BEIRUT -- Francois Bassil, chairman of Lebanon's biggest bank,
Byblos Bank, has called on the Central Bank to sell off its gold
reserves to clear public debt in view of the falling gold prices
in the world market.
</P>

The price of gold slid to a 20-year-low of around 250
U.S. dollars an ounce after the Bank of England announced its
attention of selling 25 tons of its gold reserves a few months

As a result, the value of the Lebanese Central Bank's 9.2 tons

<HEADLINE> Mir Cosmonauts Fail to Unfold Antenna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space
station failed Friday to complete a unique experiment of unfolding
a reflector antenna in open space, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Flight commander Vladimir Solovyov has ordered Viktor Afanasyev
and Sergei Avdeyev to cancel the operation.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was designed to check the reliability of a
complex unfolding mechanism in conditions of raw space -- zero
gravity and sharp temperature changes.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the failure to the condensate accumulated in
the mechanism under the hotsunlight, which later turned into ice
when the station was in the shadows, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts also dismantled scientific equipment mounted
during the previous space walk for a French-Russian project.
</P>
<P>
Solovyov said the operations that were not carried out Friday
have been put off until the next space walk scheduled for next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts were forced to return to Mir urgently because
the ventilator temperature in the life-support system of
Afanasyev's space suit rose abruptly.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyev and Avdeyev spent a little over four hours in open
space before returning to the station ahead of the scheduled time
of 16:54 GMT, Interfax said.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Kennedy family and friends
paid their last respects Friday to John F. Kennedy Jr, son of the
former U.S. president, his wife and her sister in a private
memorial service in a New York church.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 people attended the memorial service including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton and
daughter Chelsea.
</P>

The service was held well out of the gaze of the public, which
has followed every detail since Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette were killed in a plane
crash a week ago.

<HEADLINE> Signing of E. African Community Treaty Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the commission who met in the city to review the
program for the completion of the treaty-making process decided
that they will meet on September 30 to make further preparations
for the signing of the treaty by state leaders of the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
The East African Community is to be formed on the basis of the
current EAC, which was set up by the three countries in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The community aims to create a common market among the three
countries, to be followed by monetary union and ultimately a
political federation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Uganda have expressed concern that the quick
reduction of a zero internal tariff and a common market tariff
would lead to a flood of products into their markets from Kenya,
which dominates trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
The same issue led to the acrimonious collapse of the first
East African Community in 1977, with Tanzania and Uganda
complaining that wealthier Kenya got disproportionate benefit
from the bloc.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the highest decision making body of the EAC,
also decided that studies related to the treaty should be
completed and discussed before the end of September this year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, it reaffirmed
the determination to expedite the completion of the treaty-making
process.

UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
said Friday that the 15-nation body would "vote shortly" on a
draft resolution on the deployment of some 90 military observers
in Congo (K) and its neighboring countries, who are expected to
serve as liaison officers among signatories to a peace accord on
the Congo (K) conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Hasmy Agam of Malaysia, said, "Members of the
Security Council have finalized their consultation on the draft
resolution that authorizes the deployment of up to 90 military
liaison personnel to the sub-region" in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
These military liaison personnel will begin to play the U.N.
role in implementing the peace accord, signed by six African
countries involved in the Congo (K) conflict on July 10 in Lusaka,
capital of Zambia, once rebels sign the ceasefire agreement once
the accord is "signed by all parties."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expect the vote on the draft resolution
shortly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of Congo (K), due to disagreement on the peace accord
within their ranks, refused to sign the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hasmy said the Security Council "once again strongly
urged the Congolese rebel movement to take the first step in the
process of peace and national reconciliation by signing the
agreement without further delay."

KAMPALA, July23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday advised the country's rural people to learn and use the new
technology to get more profit in agricultural production,
according to a release from the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
When touring western Uganda, Museveni said research
institutions in the country have put up improved, disease
resistant, high yielding seeds but the population is ignorant
about their existence.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all local leaders to make known to the people in
the rural areas the existence of a variety of improved seeds and
breeding livestock.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government has deliberately posted, at
every sub- county level, university degree holders in agriculture
and fisheries, forestry and environment sectors so that these
people disseminate this knowledge to the people.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local leaders to assist these technocrats so that
development concerns affecting the people are addressed.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also called for a total change in the rural economy so
that people use their scarce land resources could get good profits
and eradicate poverty.

<HEADLINE> King Hassan II of Morocco Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- King Hassan II died of a serious
pneumonia disease Friday, Agence France-Presse quoted a source of
the Moroccan Royal Palace as saying Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The king died in the Avicenne Civil Hospital in Rabat where he
was put under supervision for heart and breathing conditions.
</P>
<P>
The official Moroccan television channels of RTM and 2M began
broadcasting the verses from the Islamic holy book Koran in the
afternoon, after the king was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan throne is expected to be inherited by his eldest
son Sidi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Hassan King Hassan has been suffering from a chronicle
pulmonary disease and has breathing problems for a long time.
</P>
<P>
With the departure of King Hassan II, Africa has waved good-bye
to a whole generation of leaders who came to power after the black
continent gained independence.
</P>
<P>
Born on July 9, 1929, in Rabat, Hassan II was the son of King
Mohamed V of the Moroccan protectorate under French rule.
</P>
<P>
He finished his education in France in 1951 with a degree of
law from the University of Bordeaux and accompanied his father in
exile in Corsica, France, and then in Madagascar from 1953 till
1956, the year when Morocco gained independence from France.
</P>
<P>
He came to the throne in 1961 after the death of his father and
his rule has been marked by two attempts of coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
The first coup d'etat took place on July 10, 1971, at a royal
palace outside Rabat, when he was attacked by mutinous soldiers.
He survived miraculously while 100 others were killed in the
attack and the fight that followed.
</P>
<P>
The second coup d'etat took place on August 6, 1972, when the
king's Boeing plane was attacked by a military aircraft of the
Moroccan army when he returned from a visit to France. He again
escaped death in the attack.
</P>
<P>
He annexed the Western Saharan region after Spain withdrew from
there in 1975 by organizing the "Green March" on November 6, 1975.
He has since then engaged in a fight with the Polisario Sahraoui
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The king tried to arrange a political opening of Morocco in
March 1998, when he invited opposition leader, Socialist
Abderrahmane Youssoufi, to become the country's prime minister
with "an alternative government."
</P>
<P>
But such a "government of alternative" has not been established
because of various internal problems.
</P>
<P>
The king was among the first Arab leaders to recognize Israel
and has been pushing for a resumption of the Israeli-Arab peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He paid his last state visit to France from July 12 to 14, and
reviewed the military parade on the Bastille Day on Champs-Elysee
with French President Jacques Chirac.

LUSAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Food Reserve Agency (FRA)
is expected to start granting loans of the 1999/2000 agricultural
season for farmers who have repaid the loans for the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by FRA here Friday said the farmers who have
not yet paid back the loans for the 1998/1999 season will only

on the first-come-first-save basis.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, FRA warned all the fertilizer beneficiaries
who have failed to pay back the loans that legal action will be
taken against them.
</P>
<P>
It also warned maize dealers, transporters, milling companies
and the public that those who will be found selling empty grain
bags bearing the labels of FRA will be prosecuted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Appeals for Forest Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has called
on its people to stop forest destruction following massive
destruction of forests in the country.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a three-day workshop on the protection of
forests in the country which was held in the southwestern Cyangugu
Prefecture, the Rwanda News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Over 1,500 hectares of both artificial and natural forests
have been completely destroyed, while 3,500 hectares have been
affected by the destruction,'' said Thaddee Habiyambere, the
Minister of State for Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Habiyambere who is in charge of the Forestry Department, said
the causes of forest depletion in Rwanda are encroachment for
farming, settlements, fuel, construction and mining activities.
</P>
<P>
"Natural forests like Nyungwe in southwestern Rwanda have been
 destroyed due to gold-mining in the area,'' Habyarimana told the
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Gishwati forests in northwest Rwanda which had 28,000 hectares
of natural forests in 1960 shrank to 3,800 hectares in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However Umutara Prefecture in the east of Rwanda of which
vegetation is predominantly savannah is hit by severe and
prolonged drought that has drastically affected the water-table.
</P>
<P>
It is said that there are many pests mainly termites prone to
the forests in the region. Over-grazing due to overstocking is
also a major factor in the destruction of forests in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government plans to plant 30,000 trees in every
commune of the country, with a special program for Umutara
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
A long-term afforestation program will be established and
prefectural forest commission shall be set up to ensure that all
the resolutions are implemented.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the existing laws governing forestry in the country
shall be modernized and massive sensitization program launched on
the importance of forests protection.
</P>
<P>
"All mining activities in the areas covered by forests shall be
 suspended until proper procedures are put in place to avoid the
destruction of forests," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan Africa Owes $200 Billion to Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa owes the
international financial institutions and donor community a
staggering 200 billion U.S. dollars, which has become an
unsustainable drain on its fragile economies.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 United Nations International Children's
Fund (UNICEF) report on the progress of the nations available here
Friday, Africa has repaid its initial debt many times over in cash
terms.
</P>
<P>
The report further noted that between a quarter and third of
national budgets in sub-Saharan countries have gone to debt
service.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique pays wealthy creditors more than it spends on basic
education and health combined, noted the report.
</P>
<P>
This massive resource shift cost children dearly as in Zambia
which currently owes 7.2 billion dollars in debt, which is five to
six times its export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Of the bilateral aid reaching poor countries, about one quarter
 boomerangs back to donors as debt repayments. In Tanzania, one
in every three aid dollars goes to debt service whereas in Zambia
one in every two is spent in this pointless way.
</P>
<P>
The money would have been better spent on relieving poverty or
laying the foundations for the future growth than going back to
donors, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Debt increases dependence on aid, slows down growth which
inhibits foreign investment. It also creates instability and
soaks up money that could be spent on health, education and other
vital services, the report concluded.

</P>
<P>
In a ministry statement released Friday, Deputy Environmental

<P>
She explained that the government's overriding interest was to
minimize risk to human health, marine life and the environment by
ensuring the safe passage of the ships to Japan.
</P>
<P>
She had been given assurances at the briefing that the ships,
the Pacific Teal and the Pacific Pintail, would not dock at any
South African harbor, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
South African law requires that ships carrying nuclear material
in its waters had to have a license to do so, but no application
had been received by the regulatory authority, the Council for
Nuclear Safety.
</P>
<P>
"Further assurances were received that the radiological
protection and safety arrangements meet international standards,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Mabudafhasi said the diplomats had been requested to
communicate any new developments to a special committee in her
department.
</P>
<P>
The briefing, at the government's request, followed Moosa's
statement earlier this week that he was concerned over the
shipment.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that everybody... must realize that the
transport of nuclear waste should not be taken lightly and that it
is a practice of which the South African population is very
concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ships have left France, after being delayed in a
confrontation with protesters in Britain, and are expected in
Japan in late September.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace plans to track the shipment with its flagship
Rainbow Warrior.
</P>
<P>
British Nuclear Fuels, parent company of the firm that owns the
ships, maintains that the safeguards it implements in transporting
nuclear material would ensure that the environmental effects of an
accident would be negligible.

<HEADLINE> Syria Asks Barak to Turn Intentions into Deeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Mohammed
Zuhair Masharaqa asked the Israeli government led by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to turn the intentions of resuming the peace
talks into tangible deeds.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made here on Friday in a public rally on the
occasion of the 35th anniversary of the foundation of the Arab
Communist Union Party which is a partner in the Syrian National
Progressive Committee.
</P>
<P>
All talks about a breakthrough in the peace process will remain
useless unless intentions are turned into tangible deeds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria will forge ahead in the peace process in accordance with
the extent of Israel's progress in this direction, Masharaqa added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Syria firmly sticks to the national principles
and policies of not allowing any compromise on its occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Masharaqa welcomed step towards the resumption of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks from the point they had achieved prior
to the election of Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Positive messages were exchanged between Syria and Israel after
Barak, a moderate, took office on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus radio said in a political comment on Wednesday
that "There are many indications on the resumption of the talks
with Israel within a few weeks."
</P>
<P>
"It will not be impossible to reach agreement if Israel is
convinced that peace is the only way to ensure security for all
parties," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
"No one expects the talks to be easy. Rather it will be
difficult to reach an agreement," it added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening Israel expressed readiness to restart the
peace talks with Syria from the point they had arrived at. "We are
not against the Syrian demand to resume the talks from the point
they arrived at," Barak's security adviser Dany Batom said.
</P>
<P>
"But this point needs clarification," he added.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between Barak and visiting Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar on Thursday, Batom said Israel did not
accept any preconditions to resume the talks.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt. Trains People for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
training people who intend to apply for land under its
resettlement scheme, Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai
Kangai said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Zimbabweans applying for land under
the program could only maximize production if they received
adequate training on modern methods of farming.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Kangai as saying that the
National Training Farmers Board established early this year is
training the prospective plot-holders.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 559 families were resettled on 3.4 million hectares,
bringing to 72,175 families who have been resettled since the
country won independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
National Chairman of the Land Reform and Resettlement Committee
Joseph Msika said recently that resettlement would take place on
23 farms comprising 54,000 hectares acquired by the government
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government intends to acquire five million
hectares of land for resettlement over the next five years under
its land reform program.

<HEADLINE> S. African Public Servants Demand Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of public servants
marched through central Durban, about 800 kilometers southeast of
Johannesburg Friday to highlight their demands for a 10-percent
wage increase.
</P>
<P>
The march was part of the national action to protest against
the government's offer of a six-percent across-the-board increase
and a 6.5- percent hike for teachers, South African Press
Association SAPA reported.
</P>
<P>
The chanting marchers represented the National Education,
Health and Allied Workers' Union, the South African Democratic
Teachers' Union, the South African Communist Party and the Police
and Prisons Civil Rights Union.
</P>
<P>
Some of the demonstrators wielding placards called for the
removal of National Police Commissioner George Fivaz and the
restructuring of the South African Police Service.
</P>
<P>
The unions warned that if their demands were not met, they
would embark on rolling mass action on July 29 which could result
in a nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
They said the government's wage offer did not take into
account inflation and showed the government's disregard for the
workload of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Despite warnings of rolling mass action, the unions said they
remained committed to a resolution of their wage dispute with the
government.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the implementation of a new wage policy for the
public sector and that the government should refrain from making
announcements on salaries in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The unions also accused the government of lacking transparency
in the budgeting process.
</P>
<P>
Lunchtime traffic was slightly disrupted during the march to
the Durban city hall with a strong police contingent monitoring
the proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Continue Anti-Israeli Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Friday stressed that his country will continue its
anti-occupation resistance movement until its territories are
liberated from Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon will adhere to its brave resistance (against Israeli
forces) until its territories are liberated and fair and
comprehensive peace is achieved in the region in conformity
with relevant principles," Lahoud said when meeting with local
politicians.
</P>
<P>
He said those principles can not be subject to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The president was referring to the land-for-peace formula
which was formed in the 1991 Madrid peace conference to guide
overall Arab-Israeli peace talks and related United Nations
resolutions, including Resolution 425, which calls for a
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied part of Lebanon since 1978 and set up a
self-declared security zone in the south in 1985 with the claimed
aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The country's Muslim military group Hezbollah, or Party of God,
has been spearheading a guerrilla war with the Iranian financial
backing in a bid to oust Israeli forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said Israel first time offered to withdraw from south
Lebanon thanks to the country's resistance and solidarity, adding
this is Lebanese people's right, which no one can pressure them to
give up.
</P>
<P>
On the day, Lahoud received a letter from his United States
counterpart Bill Clinton through U.S. Ambassador in Beirut David
Satterfield.
</P>
<P>
Satterfield told reporters that Clinton briefed Lahoud over his
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak last week.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Clinton expressed hopes and optimism that
negotiations on all tracks will be resumed as soon as possible,
the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. believes in a serious manner that there
are new opportunities for a fair and full peace in the region and
Clinton is committed to personally make every efforts to advance
the peace talks in cooperation with concerned parties.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Surprised at Tanzania's Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) secretariat in Lusaka has expressed
surprise at the intention of Tanzania to quit the regional
organization.
</P>
<P>
A senior official working in COMESA center here told Xinhua by
telephone that Assistant Secretary General Sindiso N Ngwenya will
go to Tanzania Saturday to find out the reason for that intention.
</P>
<P>
He said the news of Tanzania considering withdrawing from
COMESA has surprised the organization as it did not send fillers
about its intention.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania has been very active in the organization in
the past and was one of the dependable member.
</P>
<P>
It would be a surprise if the country pulled out of the
grouping as it has been very active in the meetings especially at
the last summit meeting held in Nairobi, Kenya, in March at which
President Benjamin Mkapa attended, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report Tanzania has announced that it
plans to pull out of the 21-member organization.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's newspaper, The Guardian, quoted Thursday Iddi Simba,
Minister of Industries and Commerce, as saying:"we have done some
research and found out that it is best for us to quit COMESA."
</P>
<P>
Before the government's decision to withdraw from COMESA,
Tanzania reduced by 80 percent the tariffs through an act in 1998,
he said.

<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian foreign
ministers had a "frank and useful" discussion Friday on the future
of ASEAN and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the process of
ASEAN's dialogue with its partners, Singapore Foreign Minister
Shunmugam Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
After the opening session of the 32nd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
here, the ministers had an informal retreat at a scenic resort
spot to exchange views among themselves.
</P>
<P>
On the future of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), said Jayakumar, there was a very frank and honest
reappraisal of ASEAN, especially its problems and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that they should manage their disputes in
a way that does not impede ASEAN's operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to do that, it was felt that we must keep the unity
and solidarity of ASEAN," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the future of the ASEAN Regional Forum, the only regional
security forum in the Asia-Pacific, Jayakumar said the ministers
talked about how ASEAN can play a leading role in the ARF and at
the same time let non-ASEAN countries have a sense of
participation and ownership.
</P>
<P>
ARF serves as a multi-lateral consultative forum aimed at
promoting confidence-building, developing preventive diplomacy and
working out approaches to conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
ARF have 22 members, including ASEAN countries, ASEAN's 10
dialogue partners, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also felt the need to review the style of
the dialogue process in the Post Ministerial Meeting (PMC), said
Jayakumar, adding that Thailand, the next rotating chairman of
ASEAN after Singapore, will form a working group to look into the
full process of the PMC with dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
Involved in the PMC are 10 ASEAN members and the regional
grouping's 10 dialogue partners which include China, Japan,
Russia, the European Union and the United States, among others.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Prime Minister to Visit India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai said here Friday that he will visit India this
year at the invitation of the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with journalists in his official residence, Bhattarai
said he has decided to accept the Indian government's invitation,
but he did not disclose the exact date of his visit.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that in his discussions with the Indian
government, he will put forward a lot of proposals on such issues
as the repatriation of Bhutanese refugees and the Kalapani
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
He said Nepal needs India's help in solving the issue of
Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are now staying in eastern
Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and early 1990s.
Seven rounds of talks have so far ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
India, which handles Bhutan's defense and foreign affairs, has
taken a non-involvement policy on this issue, insisting that it is
a bilateral issue between Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
As to the Kalapani dispute, Bhattarai said he is confident that
the long-standing issue will be solved, as Nepal has good
relations with India.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Nepal lay claim to the Kalapani area in
far-western Nepal which is now occupied by Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said that he will also raise the question of the
control of flow of people to and from both countries and the
coordination of attacks against cross-border crimes. Nepal and
India share a 1,750-kilometer-long open border.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he will propose a revision of the
India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed in 1950,
Bhattarai said, "Yes, of course." Nepal has raised the question
time and again in the past years.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Health Sector in Fund Shortage: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare has almost exhausted 200-million-Zimbabwean
dollars (5.2 million U. S. dollars) additional funding it received
from Treasury a week ago, secretary of the ministry Paulinus
Sikhosana said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sector received the fund to supplement its operations which
were facing a serious shortage of resources, said the secretary
here.
</P>
<P>
Sikhosana said the ministry had exhausted its 1999 budget of
3.53 billion Zimbabwean dollars (92.8 million U.S. dollars)
halfway through the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said the devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar and high
inflation rate compelled the ministry to request an additional 1.3
billion Zimbabwean dollars (34.2 million U.S. dollars) from
Treasury to normalize its operations.
</P>
<P>
"We looked at how the prices have gone up and made a projection
of how much we needed to run the ministry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Health and Child Welfare Timothy Stamps
has already indicated that his ministry would continue to demand
cash for sustenance.

<HEADLINE> EU to Launch Reconstruction Program for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
said here Friday that the regional organization will be providing
some 150 million euro (some 156 million U.S. dollars) this year to
launch the post-war reconstruction program in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction program, an EU news release said, will
receive some 500 million euro (some 520 million U.S. dollars),
which will be implemented by the European Agency for
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
An European Commission delegation visited Pristina, provincial
capital of Kosovo, this week. The delegation was headed by Deputy
Director-General Francois Lamoureux and Marc Franco, head of a
task force set up on July 5 to pave the way for the Reconstruction
Agency, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the delegation unveiled the main priorities
of the first 45 million euro (some 46.8 million U.S. dollars)
phase of the 1999 program, which were discussed with Bernard
Kouchner, who is currently Kosovo's civilian administrator and the
United Nations special representative, said the news release.
</P>
<P>
These priorities include the supply of material to enable local
residents to repair their home properly, the rehabilitation of
basic infrastructure, such as the power grid and water supplies
and the wages of operating staff, and the establishment of a
coordination center for mine clearance to speed up efforts to
tackle this problem.
</P>
<P>
Under the relevant U.N. resolution, EU is in charge of the
post-war reconstruction in Kosovo after the 79-day air strikes,
staged by the U.S.-led NATO, has destroyed large part of
infrastructure in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> W. Cape, Gauteng Have Highest Crime Rates in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Western Cape
and Gauteng provinces are jostling for position for the dubious
honor of having the highest crime rate in the country, the monthly
crime bulletin issued by the Ministry of Safety and Security's
shows.
</P>
<P>
The statistics covering January to May shows that the Western
Cape has the highest level of reported crimes in seven crime
categories which include murder, attempted murder, house breaking
and theft from vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng, on the other hand, leads the way in reported cases of
robbery and aggravated robbery and continues to show high levels
of violent property crime.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Cape shows high levels of inter-personal violent
crime with the highest levels of rape, common assault and serious
assault.
</P>
<P>
Provincial comparisons are based on a measure of specific crime
types per 100,000 people in each province.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Province has the lowest crime levels in almost all
 categories.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said murder, attempted murder, rape, house
breaking at business premises and theft of motor vehicles remained
stable but aggravated robbery which includes hijacking, serious
assault, residential housebreaking and theft were on the increase.
</P>
<P>
Only drug-related crime showed a decline due to successful
police action at roadblocks or police acting on information.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Peace Talks Ends with Little Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of Sudan peace
talks concluded here Friday without substantive progress on major
controversial issues despite a consensus on procedures for further
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and rebels remained deeply divided on
issues like self-determination for southern Sudan, boundaries
between the black and Christian south and the Islamic north,
comprehensive ceasefire and religion.
</P>
<P>
But both sides agreed to set up a permanent secretariat in
Kenya's capital Nairobi to facilitate peace negotiations and
accept a special envoy to conduct shuttle diplomacy between
rounds of peace talks, according to a communique released Friday
by the Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD), the
sponsor of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Bonaya Godana, Kenyan foreign minister and chairman of the
talks,  revealed that the special envoy to be appointed is Daniel
Mboya, a senior Kenyan diplomat with much experience in handling
Sudan issues.
</P>
<P>
The other member states of the IGAD, namely Uganda, Eritrea and
Ethiopia, will each appoint an envoy to the peace process on a
full time basis, said Godana.
</P>
<P>
The five-day talks were attended by delegations led by Sudan's
Foreign Minister Osman Ismail and deputy chairman of the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army, Slava Kiir.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has ravaged the southern part of Africa's
largest country. More than 1.5 million people have died during
war and famine since 1983 when the fighting restarted.
</P>
<P>
Historical, religious and cultural tensions between northern
Sudan and the south are root causes for the continuing conflict in
southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's New Vehicle Sale Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,834 new vehicles were
sold in the first half of this year in Kenya, representing a drop
of 2.7 percent compared with the same period of last year,
industrial sources here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kenya Motor Industry Association, the new
sales this year include 2,089 locally-assembled vehicles and the
rest of imported cars.
</P>
<P>
The association, the country's formal motor sector including
assemblers,

dealers, distributors and component makers, said it sold more than
4,502 vehicles in the first six month of 1999 as against 4,627
units in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
As the country's economic growth is still slow, local analysts
said the the motor sales in the remaining months of this year
might see further decline.
</P>
<P>
The drop in car sales are also attributed to the dumping of
used vehicles and currency fluctuation, they added.
</P>
<P>
Since the liberalization of the motor sector in 1993, Kenya
saw more imported used cars into local market. The Kenya Auto
Bazaar Association said that it imported used cars around 1,200
units each month last year while the figure dropped by half in the
first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy in Trouble: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said here Friday that the country's economy was in trouble and
called for a concerted effort to rescue it.
</P>
<P>
"Natural calamities and human error have placed us in an
economic morass out of which we shall have to pull ourselves," Moi
said at a workshop of business executives.
</P>
<P>
"We must admit that key sectors of our economy have in the last
few years performed below expectations due to factors, some of
which were beyond our control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moi cited high population growth rates, unfavorable weather,
shrinking markets and high crude oil prices as some of the factors
that had damaged Kenya's economy.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers argue that part of Kenya's plight are
blamed on the suspension of a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan in July
1997 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to protest
corruption and poor governance in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear so far whether and when the formal negotiations
on the stalled loan will be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's gross domestic product is predicted to grow at 1.6
percent this year, down from 1.8 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent
in 1997, 4.6 percent in 1996 and 4.8 percent in 1995.

LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets ended
markedly lower Friday as investors digested Federal Reserve
Chairman Greenspan's more hawkish than expected comments the day
before.
</P>
<P>
The leading UK index, the FTSE 100 closed over 1.4 percent
lower at 6,207.4, a fall of 90 points, despite some traders
claiming the Greenspan bias already had been largely factored into
the market.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit in the session was Asian heavyweight HSBC, which
fell over 5 percent. Barclays wasn't far behind as it slumped
almost 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Engine maker Rolls-Royce plunged more than 5.3 percent on a
downgrade by Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
Germany's blue-chip Dax index finished weaker Friday after
failing to break the trading range set earlier as Wall Street
started flat and struggled to hold modest gains ahead of the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Dax closed 0.57 percent lower at 5,310.63 points. Amid a
dearth of other economic impulses, the index received slight
support from some German state inflation numbers which came in
slightly higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 fared slightly better, but the index still
lost over 1 percent, or 49 points, to end at 4,440.45. French blue
chips have seen 4.6 percent wiped off their value over the last
week.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration is
to issue rules for relaxation of sales of food and medicine to
Iran, Sudan and Libya, a U.S. official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The regulations would not require congressional approval and
would take effect immediately unless otherwise stipulated, the
official said, speaking on condition of being unidentified.
</P>
<P>
The official said the regulations are now going through an
interagency clearance process involving the Treasury, State,
Commerce and Agriculture departments.
</P>
<P>
On April 28, the Clinton administration announced a change in
U.S. policy to exempt food, medicine and medical equipment sales
from economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the policy change also would mean
approval for a pending Iranian request to buy more than 500
million dollars worth of American grain and sugar.
</P>
<P>
Some government experts have predicted that the policy change
could increase wheat and corn exports by 1 million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN member countries have
agreed to speed up regional integration by advancing the
implementation of the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA) adopted at the
6th regional summit last December.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to hasten the implementation of the set of specific
directives in the HPA to guide ASEAN activities over the next six
years," said a joint communique issued here Saturday at the end of
the 32nd ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
Ministerial Meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This would speed up regional integration, mitigate the social
impact of the global financial turmoil, deal with environmental
issues and other transnational problems, and intensify
international awareness of ASEAN," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It also said the progress would be reviewed at the 7th ASEAN
Summit in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The HPA is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out
to realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for
the region approved by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It has a six-year timeframe covering the period from 1999 to
2004. The progress of its implementation is reviewed every three
years at the ASEAN summit meetings.
</P>
<P>
The communique also reiterated the regional grouping's resolve
to accelerate the process of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and
ASEAN Investment Area.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the significance of regularizing the ASEAN + 3
(China, Japan and South Korea) summits, saying it underscores
ASEAN's confidence in itself as a dynamic and resilient
organization.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has decided to advance the completion of AFTA in the six
original signatories -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- by one year from the year
2003 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
The newer members will maximize the number of their tariff
lines subject to tariffs of 0-5 percent, by 2003 for Vietnam and
2005 for Laos and Myanmar.

On other world issues, the ASEAN ministers reaffirmed their
support for the goals and principles of the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM). The NAM is "a unifying forum not only for discussions but
also for cooperation among developing countries, so that they may
exert a more active influence on the direction and management of
world affairs," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
"We recognized the NAM's strength as a significant leverage in
negotiations vis-a-vis the developed countries on crucial
political and economic issues," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the need to continue to promote agreed
positions of the NAM members in the United Nations and in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the U.N. Security Council, the communique said
any reform must take into account the principle of sovereign
equality of states and equitable geographical distribution. It
said the reform and expansion of the council should be considered
as a package.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the international community to focus its
attention on transnational crime and called on the United Nations
to play the leading role in coordinating the efforts of member
states to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We supported the ongoing negotiations to draft an
international convention against organized transnational crime, as
well as its supplementary protocols on addressing trafficking in
women and children, and illegal trafficking in firearms," it said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Saturday
ordered a "comprehensive review" of the events that led to what it
called "the Pakistani intrusion in Kargil."
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a specially convened meeting of the
cabinet, which gave a four-member non-statutory committee three
months to submit its report.
</P>
<P>
The committee is headed by defense analyst K. Subrahmanyam.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have been demanding a thorough inquiry into
"the Pakistani intrusion," alleging that there had been
intelligence failure.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decision was made after Defense Minister George
Fernandes disclosed that the army has ordered an internal inquiry
into what went "wrong" leading to the incursions which would be
independent of any government probe.

<HEADLINE> People From All Walks of Life Condemn Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), government officials and people throughout China have
all expressed their support for the Central Government's decision
to wipe out Falun Gong, and condemned it as an organization which
spreads malicious fallacies which are harmful to people's minds
and bodies.
</P>
<P>
They said this is a serious ideological and political struggle
which has a bearing on the fundamental beliefs of Party members,
on the basic ideological foundation for the Chinese people's cause
and unity, and on the future of the Party and State.
</P>
<P>
They strongly condemned Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong,
for concocting Falun Gong in order to destroy people's minds, and
disturb public order and social stability.
</P>
<P>
National People's Congress Standing Committee members in
Beijing said that stability is the paramount interests of the
State and the people, and nothing can be done successfully without
it. So an early resolution of the Falun Gong issue will help
safeguard stability and unity in China and allow the Chinese
people to concentrate their efforts on pushing ahead reforms, the
opening-up and the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Party members, educators, workers and government officials from
the provinces of Hebei, Zhejiang, Liaoning and Heilongjiang as
well as many other regions stated that Falun Gong constitutes a
serious hindrance to the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the overall situation of reform, development
and stability. Therefore, it must not be allowed to continue to
exist and further develop.
</P>
<P>
They said that under the pretext of 'promoting health', the
Falun Gong organizations have conducted many illegal activities
which have seriously disturbed the normal order of society,
confused the people's moral and ethical concepts, deceived many
innocent people and inflicted enormous damage on their physical
and mental health.

<HEADLINE> India to Expand Trade with ASEAN by Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- India has targeted 15 billion
U.S. dollars in trade with ASEAN countries by the year 2000,
according to a document released Saturday by the Ministry of
External Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Due to the financial crisis faced by some ASEAN countries in
the past two years, India's overall trade with ASEAN registered a
marginal decline of about 0.2 percent during 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the country's exports to the region dropped
by 17 percent while imports from the region grew by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Potential sectors for imports from ASEAN countries include date
processing machines, natural rubber, transport equipment, organic
chemicals and textile yarn.
</P>
<P>
Scope for future exports to ASEAN countries lies in sectors
including pharmaceuticals, computer software, textile machinery
components, rubber manufacture and alcohol distilleries.
</P>
<P>
India's total trade with ASEAN countries stood at 6 billion
dollars in 1997-1998.

<HEADLINE> Medical Scientists Refute Falun Gong's Fallacies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Some renowned Chinese medical
scientists today disclosed the fact that some people's health has
been damaged due to refusal of treatment as a result of blind
faith in Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that knowledge of medical science should be
further spread among ordinary people to help them spurn fatuity
and superstitious thinking, as well as escape tragedies caused by
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media has recently reported an array of cases, in
which Falun Gong practitioners refused to seek treatment from
doctors, in accordance with the dictates of the sect. Many became
more seriously ill or even died. Some committed suicide after
suffering from mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
"I myself have witnessed a rocketing rate of mental illnesses
among Falun Gong practitioners since 1996," Dr. Zhang Tongling, a
psychiatrist at the No. 6 Hospital Attached to the Beijing Medical
University, told a forum here today.
</P>
<P>
She quoted statistics from the psychiatric departments of two
Beijing hospitals as showing that mentally-diseased Falun Gong
followers now accounted for 42 percent of all mental patients,
compared with only 10.1 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It is an indisputable fact that practicing Falun Gong can lead
to many kinds of mental disorders, which however has never been
admitted by Falun Gong advocators," said Cai Zhuoji, also a
psychiatrist at the Beijing Anding Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Cardiologist Jiang Baoqi said that a high blood pressure
patient, who turned to Falun Gong for treatment, refused to take
drugs and finally died of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
"China has over 100 million sufferers from hypertension. How
can they be cured if they rely on such fabrications? I am really
worried about this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The experts shared the view that medical professionals should
devote themselves not only to saving patients' lives through
scientific means, but also to massive campaigns to spread
scientific knowledge among ordinary people.

traffickers in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Coach Gets Two-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- An unlikely run to the NBA
Finals apparently has pushed Jeff Van Gundy from the unemployment
line back into the good graces of the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's New York Daily News is reporting that Van Gundy has
agreed to a two-year extension worth between eight and 10 million
U.S. dollars. The deal would keep him with the Knicks through the
2002-2003 season.
</P>
<P>
A team spokesman said no announcement was planned for today.
</P>
<P>
The much-maligned Van Gundy was the subject of constant rumors
throughout the season. The media had Van Gundy fired numerous
times during the lockout-shortened campaign, but he remained on
and barely guided the Knicks into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the regular season on April 20, general manager
Ernie Grunfeld was reassigned, taking the fall for the subpar play
of the talented and retooled roster, but Van Gundy remained on.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks beat the Miami Heat in the decisive fifth game of
their first round series in the Eastern Conference as Allan
Houston's last-season shot bounced in off the rim. Had that shot
been off the mark, Van Gundy likely would be coaching a different
team next season.
</P>
<P>
New York then swept the Atlanta Hawks in the conference
semifinals, making the Knicks the first eighth-seeded team to win
two playoff series. Then New York took out the favored Indiana
Pacers in six games to advance to the NBA Finals, which they lost
in five games to the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Gundy took over the team on March 8, 1996,
relieving Don Nelson. He went 13-10 over the rest of the season
and the Knicks lost to the Chicago Bulls in five games in the
Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
He guided the team to a 57-25 record in his first full season
and was 43-39 in his second as the Knicks lost the Pacers in East
semis.
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy had served as an assistant coach for the Knicks for
6 1/2 seasons, serving under Stu Jackson, John MacLeod, Pat Riley
and Nelson.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Conclude China Tour With Victory in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) - England's treble champions
Manchester United concluded their Australia and China tour after
chalking up an easy 2-0 win over Hong Kong's South China side here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, without almost their entire mid-field --
David Beckham, Roy Keane and Paul Scholes -- fielded their star
striker Dwight Yorke to pair with another mid-fielder Jesper
Blomqvist to feed Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole, who scored one
goal each within four minutes in the first half.
</P>
<P>
United's Assistant Manager Steve Mclaren said the team got
exhausted in the heat but the quality of the team did not allow
many opportunities for their opponents.
</P>
<P>
He said the tour had made life easier for the team and the pre-
season preparations "ran smoothly."
</P>
<P>
A sold-out crowd of 40,000 packed the Hong Kong Stadium despite
the missing of their long-awaited stars and high temperature and
humidity to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
United were also without their super substitute Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer and winger Ryan Giggs, who left for England Thursday to
treat injuries. Nicky Butt also withdrew due to injury.
</P>
<P>
South China entered the game aggressively and produced a corner
kick after only four minutes. But a breakthrough by Cole along the
right wing created the first real chance for United in the 21st
minute and Sheringham sent the ball into the upper corner of the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Jordi Cruyff launched a counterattack only four minutes later
and passed the ball to Sheringham at the left edge of the box. The
34-year-old Sheringham, who scored the equalizer in the European
Champions League final, quickly fed the ball to unmarked Cole who
redirected the ball into the lower corner of the net with the side
of his left foot.
</P>
<P>
United's new goalkeeper Mark Bosnich stood outside his own box
for the most time of the first half but needed to dash out to
block South China's loaned forward Alex Agbo's two solo runs in
the 46th and 75th minutes.
</P>
<P>
An excited Yorke, who seemed not to bother too much about the
tropical heat and humidity, played actively in the second half and
shot just wide in the 64th minute. Cruyff also missed a sure goal
in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
United made four substitutions in the second half and simply
kept the score at 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The win was United's fourth of their four-match tour. They
defeated Australia twice before beating Chinese league-leaders
Shanghai Shenhua 2-0 three days ago.
</P>
<P>
United have created a sensation in the city where the Red's
jerseys bearing the names of Beckham and Giggs can be seen
everywhere in the street.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Pledges Shaping Itself to Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) pledged Saturday to continue shaping itself
in order to deal with future challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to continually shaping an ASEAN that is
attuned to the challenges of the times," said ASEAN foreign
ministers in a joint communique issued at the end of the 32nd
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) here.
</P>
<P>
The ministers held a retreat Friday to discuss only among
themselves issues related to the future of the regional grouping,
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and ASEAN's dialogue relationships,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The retreat, the first such arrangement incorporated in the
ministerial meeting, is "part of a continuous process of serious
re-examination of the longer-term issues facing ASEAN," said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent signs of economic recovery, the communique
said, uncertainties still remain and the ministers agreed to
undertake more restructuring measures to sustain the recovery
process.
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement at the AMM, Singapore Foreign Minister
Shunmugam Jayakumar said the challenges include how to integrate
old and new members at different levels of economic development
and political systems; how to enhance regional cohesiveness
without losing national distinctiveness; and how to adapt to the
trend of globalization and maximize its opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He described the issues that surfaced at the retreat as
"complex," saying there may not be immediate answers to all of
them.
</P>
<P>
But to successfully adapt, ASEAN must embrace change as an
integral part of the organization, said Jayakumar, chairman of the
AMM.
</P>
<P>
To face up to the challenges which could undermine ASEAN, said
the communique, the ministers reaffirmed the fundamental
principles of ASEAN and the importance of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to further develop the relationships between
ASEAN and its dialogue partners including China, Japan, the United
States, Russia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
It is important to "move the ARF process forward at a pace
comfortable to all participants and on the basis of consensus,"
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to strengthening ASEAN's role as the primary
driving force of the ARF process," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jayakumar said ASEAN felt the need to review the style
of the dialogue process in the Post-Ministerial Conference (PMC).
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand, the next rotating chairman of ASEAN after
Singapore, will form a working group to look into the process.

NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Ministry of Trade and
Industry said Friday night that with effect on August 1, the
importation of poultry and meat as well as their derivatives
produced from poultry and animals fed on feeds with animal fat or
substances will be banned.
</P>
<P>
"Only poultry and meat of animals fed on vegetable feeds or
substances will be permitted to be imported into the country," it
said in a statement signed by Mrs Elizabeth Obeng, Public
Relations Officer of the ministry, the Ghana News Agency (GNA)
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said with effect from the same date, all such
products imported into Ghana will have to be accompanied with
certificates issued by an authorized veterinary officer in the
exporting country, certifying that the products are not produced
from feeds compounded with animal fat or substances.
</P>
<P>
"Since dioxin is traced to animal fat, it has become necessary
to take this precautionary measure of banning the said products
entirely."
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already banned the import of poultry and its
derivatives from Belgium over a dioxin scare. The chemical is
known to cause cancer.

<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's second largest opposition
party New Komeito formally decided Saturday to join the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Liberal Party (LP) in
forming a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in an extraordinary convention of the
party in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
New Komeito leader Takenori Kanzaki told a news conference
after the convention that he promoted the plan to join the
coalition because he felt New Komeito should do more than just "
support or oppose bills that are submitted to the Diet (parliament)
."
</P>
<P>
Kanzaki said his party should join the ruling bloc "in drawing
up policies and compiling the budget...to deal with mounting
problems" faced by Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said the planned alliance would be a good chance for his
party to realize its policies.
</P>
<P>
Kanzaki is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Monday to accept the premier's proposal to form the new
coalition and join his cabinet. Tripartite policy discussions are
expected to begin after the Obuchi-Kanzaki meeting.
</P>
<P>
The New Komeito made the decision in response to a request by
Obuchi for it to join the coalition to help the LDP expand its
support base in the Diet, where even with the LP backing, the LDP
has no majority in the 252-member House of Councilors (upper house)
. The ruling bloc enjoys a majority in the House of
Representatives (lower house).
</P>
<P>
The party's participation in the coalition would secure the
ruling bloc a majority in the upper house, giving it more than 140
seats.
</P>
<P>
New Komeito was established under its earlier name, Komeito, in
1964 with the support of Soka Gakkai, Japan's largest lay Buddist
group. It renamed itself the New Komeito last November after the
merger of the New Peace Party and the Komei party.
</P>
<P>
The New Komeito's decision was welcomed by the LDP, but rebuked
by other opposition groups including the largest opposition
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the Japanese Communist Party (JCP)
and the Social Democratic Party (SDP).
</P>
<P>
DPJ leader Naoto Kan criticized New Komeito, saying the party "
has argued it would make case-by-case policy decisions, but is
prioritizing an alliance with the LDP and the LP, though its
policies are inconsistent with the two other parties."
</P>
<P>
SDP head Takako Doi called for a cabinet resignation en masse
or a dissolution of the lower house, citing an expected change of
cabinet members due to the launch of the tripartite coalition.
</P>
<P>
By launching an expanded coalition, the three parties will "
bulldoze everything," Doi said.

<HEADLINE> French Aerospace Group Denies Merger Plan With German Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The French aeronautics and airspace
group Aerospatiale-Matra denied on Saturday a report by the German
weekly Der Spiegel that it will merge with the German aerospace
group DASA.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Pierre Bayle, a spokesman of
Aerospatiale-Matra, as describing the report as "totally
groundless."
</P>
<P>
Der Spiegel said in its latest edition that Aerospatiale-Matra
and DASA, which is affiliated to Daimler-Chrysler, plan to merge
in order to become the world's number two in the field of
aeronautics after the U.S. Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Both Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA own 37.9 percent of the stocks
of the European aeronautics group Airbus Industrie. A merged
group from them would hold 75.8 percent of the stocks of Airbus,
while the British Aerospace holds 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The merger plan was personally negotiated between Juergen
Schrempp, president of the board of directors of Benz-Chrysler,
and Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of the supervision council of
Aerospatiale-Matra, said the German weekly.
</P>
<P>
The French government still holds about half of the stocks in
Aerospatiale, so the final decision on a merger with DASA will
have to be approved by President Jacques Chirac, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Celebrate New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Amid increasing insecurity,
hundreds of Somalis in white traditional uniforms, spears and
shields have moved toward the annual celebrations of the year.
The festival marking the end of the traditional year and the
beginning of the new Somali year took place this week in various
towns and villages in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the tradition, each year takes its name after the
day it begins. Therefore, this new year is "Friday" since it began
on Friday and the years follow the patterns of the week's rhythm,
so next year will be Saturday. In celebration of the New Year,
people of all ages especially those who could have set out for
the traditional sites early in the week attended these colorful
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Among the most popular and fascinating traditional performances
are Istunka, Shirta Daynilleh and Bad-Galka, all of them held
around capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, not all of the New Year's celebrations were bloodless.
 Five people including two women have died and more than 18 others
wounded in a tragic accident when two vehicles running at high
speed collided near the industrial road of south Mogadishu Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two vehicles, a mini-bus transporting 18 people to the
traditional Shirta Daynilleh and a milk-transporting lorry,
collided when the lorry tried to overrun the mini-bus. After the
collision, only four people could stand on their feet. All of the
wounded were rushed to a treatment center in south Mogadishu,
while the dead were buried Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The most moving traditional occurrence is the Istunka where two
 contesting sides compete by beating each other with sticks.
Afgoie town, 30 kms south of the capital, is the site for the
Istunka where thousands of people gather to witness the event
every year.
</P>
<P>
The Sultan of Afgoie town, Sultan Ahmed, also attended the
performance as the most prestigious traditional leader of the
town. Sultan Ahmed praised the people and hoped the New Year
would be more prosperous and more peaceful. Bonfire was lit at
the front doors of almost all houses in Somalia to mark the New
Year. Boys and girls jumped over the fire in happiness.
</P>
<P>
Despite the celebrations, there had been bloody confrontations
elsewhere in Somalia. According to reports reaching Mogadishu
here, a serious armed confrontation took place Friday between the
forces of General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan and those of the
Jubba Valley Alliance in and around Badhadheh district, about 120
kms south of Kismayu in southern Somalia. Badhadheh town has been
the stronghold of General Morgan after he was chased out of the
port town of Kismayu last month.
</P>
<P>
According to Ibrahim Jama Howleh, spokesman of the Somali
National Front (SNF) which leads the Jubba Valley Alliance, the
town of Badhadheh has now fallen into the hands of his forces
after some fighting. Howleh said his forces have surrounded the
town and the area where Morgan stayed. However, he said Morgan
has escaped with a few militiamen on foot after all his battle
wagons were seized by the allied forces.
</P>
<P>
There's no word as yet from the other side over the fighting.

tickets.
</P>
<P>
This was learned from the National Welfare Lottery Conference,

From November last year to this June, the country issued 11
billion yuan worth of lottery tickets, pooling a total fund of 3.3

billion yuan worth of lottery tickets will be sold by offering "
big prizes". In addition, the proportion of cash prizes will be
further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The sale of computer lottery tickets will be expanded to 10
provinces and autonomous regions this year, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the issuing of TV lottery tickets will be done in
Shanghai, Sichuan and other areas.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Support Falun Gong Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the country's highest advisory body, today
expressed their support for China's policy decision to ban Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
At a forum called by the CPPCC National Committee, members of
the CPPCC National Committee and of its standing committee held
that the decision made by the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party conformed the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
The decision is of far-reaching significance for maintaining
social and political stability and ensuring the healthy
development of the reform and opening-up, and socialist
modernization drive, they said.
</P>
<P>
He Zuoxiu, a scientist who consistently opposes pseudoscience,
said that the Falun Dafa Research Society is an illegal
organization, not only because of its failure to register in
accordance with the law, but also for its illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, is not only
a scientific illiterate, but also a person with wicked ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Li fabricated wild tales about his Falun Gong to cheat people
by calling it superior to Buddhism and the highest standard of
science, he said.
</P>
<P>
By exploiting people's desire to keep fit, he attempted to
realize his political objective, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the members noted that the activities of Falun Gong
organizations have disturbed social stability and impaired the
people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chunlong said that Falun Gong disturbed social security,
swindled money and resulted in many deaths among its practitioners,
noting what Falun Gong has had an unfavorable impact on society
and should be banned.
</P>
<P>
The attendees at the forum stressed that the CPPCC at all
levels should enhance their ties with the people and publicize
Party and State policies, so as to help the people know the
harmfulness of Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Appreciates Support From Dialogue Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Saturday expressed
their appreciation for the support given by the grouping's
dialogue partners to its activities.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of their annual meeting
in Singapore, the foreign ministers expressed the hope for
international cooperation in carrying out the measures in the
Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA) of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciated the continuing support extended by the
international community, particularly ASEAN's dialogue partners,
to ASEAN's activities," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped that our dialogue partners, the international
financial institutions, United Nations agencies, foundations and
non-governmental organizations would collaborate with ASEAN in
carrying out the cooperative measures in the HPA," it said.
</P>
<P>
The HPA is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out
to realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for
the region approved by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The communique also reaffirmed ASEAN's principle of
non-discrimination in developing relations and cooperation with
the grouping's dialogue partners, as well as other countries and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 dialogue partners include China, Russia, Japan, the
European Union and the United States. ASEAN foreign ministers will
hold discussions with their counterparts from the dialogue
partners on July 26-28 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said ASEAN has agreed to consider its new
dialogue relationships only after the ASEAN foreign ministers'
meeting in Bangkok in July 2000, "to ensure that ASEAN
consolidates its relationships with the current dialogue
partners."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also called for rationalization of
ASEAN's secretariat's organizational structure to make it "more
effective and more responsive" in meeting the new challenges
facing the grouping and helping it prepare for the future. A
working group is reviewing the role and functions of the
secretariat.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After years of tight budgets and a Congress focused on
cutting the deficit, business this week cashed in on the new
economic climate to win billions of dollars in breaks tucked into
the tax bill that passed the House and another working its way
through the Senate.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> WB Chief Economist Praises China's Macroeconomic Policies (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success of China in transition over the past decade makes a
sharp contrast with the failure that prevailed elsewhere, and out
of this emerged several aspects of China's strategy that seem to
be missing elsewhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China pursued a strategy of gradual reform, which
is a pragmatic strategy. At each stage the strategy exploits the
current strength and sets foundations for the next stage of reform.
</P>
<P>
China's reform strategy stresses job and enterprise creation,
with competition from various localities, spurring learning from
each other's successes and failures. At the same time, make
efforts to establish effective corporate governance based on
localities.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he said, in too many countries, privatization
without appropriate corporate governance led to asset stripping
rather than wealth creation; this is why these countries are
poorer than they were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is consulting Chinese economists and government
officials such issues as what accounts for China's enormous
success over the past two decades, what lessons are there for
other countries, especially countries trying to make the
transition to a market economy; what are the outstanding issues in
China's present reform, how can further progress be made and what
are the critical issues that need to be faced in China's reforms
at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"There are many challenges ahead, but I'm confident that China
will address these challenges with the same thoughtfulness and
forcefulness as in the past," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China has weathered the global
economic storms and its success in maintaining economic growth
serves as a model of macroeconomic policy for the rest of the
world, said Senior Vice President of the World Bank (WB) Joseph
Stiglitz.
</P>
<P>
Also serving as chief economist of the WB, Stiglitz told a
press conference here today that the kind of measures the Chinese
government undertook to stimulate the economy last year were
precisely correct.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a global economic slowdown, and the appropriate
response is fiscal expansion, which is also standard economics,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the positive aspects of China's strategy
was addressing the short-run macro concerns by directing
investment to infrastructure construction, which area can create
huge demand.
</P>
<P>
China's ongoing efforts in housing system reform, urban
infrastructure construction and the establishment of a social
insurance system can both stimulate the current demand and provide
a solid foundation for future development, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Completes Huge Oil Projects for Sudan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A huge oilfield, a long oil
pipeline and a large oil refinery China built in Sudan have gone
into operation, marking a major breakthrough in China's expansion
of its overseas oil markets.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) beat out other
international bidders for the project, which was built by its
subsidiary the China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corp. (
CPECC).
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of work, China finished the Muglad
oilfield project, with an annual production capacity of from 7.5
million tons to 10 million tons. The project also involved
building a 1,506-km pipeline from Heglid in southern Sudan to the
Port of Sudan, and an oil refinery that processes at least 2.5
million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The huge oilfield lies in the Muglad Basin in midsouth Sudan,
covering an area of 49,000 sq km with cumulative verified oil
reserves topping 424 million cu m.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield, the first in Sudan, has a daily output of 150,000
bbl, or an annual output of 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China has made a series of technological breakthroughs in
undertaking the huge oil project, including in the sectors of oil
engineering technology, geological prospecting and oil drilling,
said a company official, adding that crude oil is expected to be
sent to the Port of Sudan by the end of this month for export.  (

<HEADLINE> WB Releases Latest Report on China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has released
the Chinese edition of its latest report on China's economy,
titled "China: Weathering the Storm and Learning the Lessons,"
according to the WB's Resident Mission in China.
</P>
<P>
The report analyzes how China has responded to the domestic and
global challenges of the last two years, the effectiveness of the
macroeconomic policy stance, the continuation of reforms in the
financial and enterprise sectors, and the expanded measures to
address the social agenda of employment and poverty reduction in
the face of macroeconomic shocks.
</P>
<P>
The report argues that the major policy issue facing China is
how to respond to the near-term growth pressures in ways that
reinforce structural reform and economic development.
</P>
<P>
As implementation of reform proceeds and new storm clouds
emerge, policy-makers will have to focus on pro-growth reforms
that support the development of the labor-absorbing service sector,
it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, restructuring of enterprises and
strengthening of corporate governance must remain high priorities,
in order to both tackle the corporate debt problem and release
assets for productive activities.
</P>
<P>
The report stresses that China's strategy needs to support
structural measures that increase household demand by raising
rural incomes and providing adequate fiscal support for safety-net

<TEXT>
<P>
This was China's largest overseas oil project ever that meets
international standards, according to CPECC's president Qin Anmin.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China is actively exploring
international oil markets, while developing its own oil and gas
resources with foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
China plans to develop 50 million tons of oil and 50 billion cu
m of natural gas from abroad by 2010 by giving priority to
developing oil markets in the Middle East, Africa, Russia, South
America and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
China is moving ahead in oil exploration and development
overseas. CNPC and its subsidiary CPECC have so far completed a
number of oil projects in Peru, Canada, Thailand, Kuwait,
Kazakstan and Sudan, and have produced a certain amount of crude
oil overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to Qin, CPECC has signed overseas oil construction
contracts worth more than one billion U.S. dollars. It has also
been listed among the world's top 225 oil industry contractors for

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Administration of Dyke Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is seeking to
develop a new administration system governing construction of
dykes and embankments along the country's major rivers, according
to Deputy Minister of Water Resources Zhang Jiyao here today.
</P>
<P>
The official added that at present the State Development
Planning Commission, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry
of Construction and the Ministry of Finance are jointly working on
the new system.
</P>
<P>
He said that poor construction quality in some sections of the
main embankments of the Yangtze River caused a lot of breaches
during the catastrophic floods last year, particularly in the
section near the city of Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
In the process of renovating the main embankments along the
Yangtze last winter and this spring, some contractors illegally
transferred contracts to other construction units and embezzled
part of the construction funds, which resulted in hidden perils
regarding construction quality, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The reshaping of the administration system is aimed at ensuring
the construction quality of dyke and embankment projects in line
with the market economic system, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The main contents of the new system include re-appraising the
qualifications of the design units, setting up a responsibility
system for embankment building, establishing quality monitoring
bodies for dyke projects and improving the allocation of funds for
dyke construction.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Y2K Campaign Moves into 2nd Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has moved into the
second phase of tackling the computer Y2K problem, the Central
Coordination Office has announced.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of national Y2K campaign initiated by the
government ends this month with "immense success," the office said
in its latest monthly report on tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
The office, which comprises administrators, technical experts,
economists, secretariat and logistical support staff, said the
second phase of the campaign will take place from July to
December.
</P>
<P>
The target of the first phase was the assessment and monitoring
of the Y2K program, while the second phase will be on assisting in
the development of contingency plans, legal assessment and advice
as well as public relations.
</P>
<P>
Other areas will be provision of information, training,
selling Tanzania as a safe heaven, funding program liaisons,
meetings and office administration. This will also involve the
execution of mock drills and audit of all equipment.
</P>
<P>
The statement identified government administration, commerce,
transport, agriculture, food and energy as critical sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem means that computer systems may fail, with
potentially disastrous results, if internal clocks that record
only the last two digits of each year are unable to cope with the
change from 99 to 00.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's campaign against the Y2K, commonly known as the
millenium bug, has won technical and financial support from the
World Bank, Britain and other agencies or countries.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Closes Dioxin-Contaminated Pig Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 233 pig farms were
closed down by the Belgian government in an attempt to stamp out
the dioxin contamination, the local press reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian health authorities announced the close-down late
Friday after a checkup found that the 233 pig farms under close
survaillance between July 13 and 16 showed a dioxin contamination
20 to 50 times higher than the acceptable dioxin level.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after government officials studied
the result of the checkup for seven hours on Friday. The products
from the 233 pig farms were already blocked from entering the food
market, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt was quoted by the local
press as admitting that he had never thought of the scale of the
dioxin contamination that triggered a powerful jolt against the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that it was still difficult to estimate
the loss caused by the close-down. But the loss has to be big in
that there are still hundreds of thousands of tons of pork meat
deeply frozen in the stock house of the farms in question and in
the slaughter houses.
</P>
<P>
Some estimated that between 60,000 and 80,000 tons of
contaminated pork meat were blocked from reaching the food market.
</P>
<P>
The cost for closing down the pig farms and treating the
contaminated pork meat must be around billions of Belgian francs,
others suggested. One report said that the cost would be around 6
billion francs (156 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
CAIRO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Saturday expressed deep sorrow for the death of Moroccan King
Hassan II, calling the death a great loss for the Moroccan people.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in a statement that he "felt great sorrow and
grief" for "the loss of a brother, dear friend and companion in
the struggle for Arab and Islamic causes."
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan king "had made significant contributions to" the
efforts aimed at forging peace in the Middle East and "played a
leading role in" promoting Arab unity, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The late Moroccan king helped Egypt and Israel reach peace
agreements in late 1970s, the first between an Arab country and
the Jewish state. He also mediated in the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israel since the 1991 Madrid Mideast peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he received the news of Hassan's death with sorrow
and grief, describing the event as a grave loss for both the
kingdom and its people.
</P>
<P>
King Hassan II died Friday night of heart attack at 70 after
ruling the North African country for 38 years.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian people will always remember King Hassan II as one
of the leading statesmen who had great interest in extending the
bridges of cooperation and solidarity with Egypt," Mubarak said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"He has turned the special and warm relationship between the
two nations into a live model for cooperation among brothers
united by one destiny and goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt announced on Saturday three days of mourning for the
death of Hassan, during which the Egyptian national flags will be
lowered to half mast across the country and on the buildings of
its diplomatic missions abroad.

<HEADLINE> PLA, Armed Police Support Government Ban on Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Following the imposition by the
Chinese authorities of a ban Thursday on Falun Gong, officers and
men of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the armed police
forces have hailed the ban as "a wise and resolute decision" and
promised to give all-out support.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few days, all officers and men of the PLA and the
armed police forces have earnestly studied a series of important
speeches by President Jiang Zemin and materials exposing the true
face of Falun Gong, so as to further unify their thinking and
improve their understanding," said a senior officer with the PLA
General Political Department.
</P>
<P>
The PLA and armed police officers and men all believe that the
central authorities' decision to ban Falun Gong has an extremely
important realistic significance for safeguarding social and
political stability, ensuring the smooth development of China's
reform, opening-up and modernization drive, and paving the way for
the country's long-term prosperity and stability, noted the
officer.
</P>
<P>
"As revolutionary soldiers, we must maintain sober political
minds, constantly improve our Party spirit, enhance our political
sensitivities and judgment, and foster a firm belief in Communism,
" said a PLA soldier, who is also a member of the Communist Party
of China.
</P>
<P>
According to PLA sources, many soldiers have vowed to take
concrete action to safeguard the hard-won social stability and the
achievements of reform and opening-up, and to serve as "loyal
guards" of the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Military units across the country have held forums, seminars
and lectures to educate the soldiers in Marxist materialism and
atheism, and expose the deceptive, hypocritical and reactionary
nature of Falun Gong, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
In the Guangzhou Military Area Command, in south China, more
than 30 revolutionary veterans who joined the army in the 1930s
and 1940s gathered to voice their indignation at Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"We, who experienced the revolutionary wars, see this more
clearly than anyone else: Only Marxism can save China and only the
Chinese Communist Party can lead us to accomplish the great cause
of reinvigorating the Chinese nation," they were quoted as saying.

<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of well-known Chinese
athletes, coaches and workers engaged in physical education and
physical science research gathered Friday in Beijing to expose the
theism and pseudo-science of Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, with the
theory and practice of physical science.
</P>
<P>
At a forum convened by the State General Administration of
Sport and All-China Sports Federation, the participants voiced
their support for the decision made by the Chinese Civil Affairs
Ministry on outlawing the Research Society of Falun Dafa and
firmly supported the circular issued by the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) prohibiting Party members from
practicing the outlawed Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tian Maijiu, deputy president of the Beijing Physical
Science University, noted that Li Hongzhi, founder of the outlawed
Falun Gong, claims to be able to forecast the future and to have
supernatural power, which is totally in violation of science,
especially physical science.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important task for the community of physical
education and physical science research to promote science and use
scientific truth to educate the Chinese people, especially the
youth," said Tian, who is also a member of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He called on relevant
departments to work out regulations on the management of Qigong as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shan, a former Olympic shooting champion, said Falun Gong
has caused serious damage to China's social stability, and the
fallacies concocted by Li Hongzhi do not hold water.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Changjiu, deputy head of the Institute of Sporting
Medicine and also a research fellow on the testing of stimulants,
said Li Hongzhi uses pseudo-science to deceive the Chinese people
and to achieve his purpose of destroying China's stability and his
personal ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Calling Li Hongzhi's malicious fallacies discouraging people
with ailments from taking medicines or consulting doctors
violations of medical science, Zhang said that it is the
responsibility of physical science workers to step up publicity
concerning scientific knowledge, and use the theory and practice
of physical science to educate the Chinese people and let them
understand better the true nature of Li Hongzhi's malicious
fallacies.

President Hosni Mubarak Sunday as planned. No new dates have been
set for the meetings, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But a statement issued by Arafat's office said the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders would meet Tuesday instead. Israel Radio
reported that Barak has rescheduled his meeting with Mubarak for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians said they "were feeling loss and
pain" over the death of the Moroccan king, a highly respected
advocate of Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has announced three days of mourning in the West Bank
and Gaza beginning on Saturday in memory of the king, who died of
a heart attack Friday. Palestinian officials said that Arafat
would attend the funeral, due on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Foreign Minister David Levy
will also travel to Rabat for the funeral, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Barak and Arafat would be their second
summit since Barak took office on July 6. They are expected to
hold substantial talks on the way of restarting the peace
process, largely frozen by Israel's former hard-line prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who ousted Netanyahu in the May election with a pledge
to revive the peace talks with the Palestinians and Syria, is
seeking Palestinian agreement to combine the implementation of
the interim Wye accord signed last year with the final-status
talks, which have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu suspended the deal after carrying out the first of
its three phases late last year in a failed attempt to woo back
rebellious far-rightists in his coalition who, anger at his
signing of the agreement, joined forces with the opposition bloc
led by Barak to bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to hand over additional 11 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians in the last two phases of the agreement. The
deal also calls for the release of Palestinian prisoners, the
building of two safe passages between West Bank and Gaza, and the
opening of a Palestinian seaport.
</P>
<P>
Barak wants to put the implementation of the agreement into
the whole framework of the final-status talks, which is expected
to result in a permanent peace treaty defining the status of the
Palestinian entity, the fate of Jerusalem and the final borders
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Washington opposed the idea when it was first floated soon
after Barak's election victory, but softened its attitude after
Barak last week paid a six-day visit designed to coordinate his
peace policies with the closest ally of the Jewish
state. President Bill Clinton said everything agreed upon would be
good for both sides.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA has rejected Barak's proposal on repeated
occasions, urging him to carry out the remaining phases of the
agreement immediately.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said that if Arafat insist on the implementation of
the interim agreement before the final-status get started, he
would have no problem in doing so.

<HEADLINE> Major Mass Organizations Support Falun Gong Ban (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's three major mass
organizations said here today that they and their members across
the nation strongly support the government ban on Falun Gong, an
illegal organization spreading superstition and heresies and
disrupting social stability in the guise of physical fitness
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations are the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACFTU), the All-China Women's Federation and the Chinese
Communist Youth League, which represent the country's workers,
women and younger generation, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The working class represents the most advanced productive
forces and relations of production of society, and we firmly
oppose the feudal superstition and fallacies preached by the Falun
Gong organizations," said an ACFTU spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the ACFTU and trade union
organizations across the country in recent days have held a number
of forums to study and discuss the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee's decision to resolve the Falun Gong issue.
</P>
<P>
Many model workers and workers' representatives attending these
forums vowed that they would fight against the Falun Gong
organizations resolutely and help the Party and government to win
the struggle, he added.
</P>
<P>
"What we need most at present is a political situation of
stability and unity. Li Hongzhi and his clique have attempted to
sabotage the current hard-won fine situation, and the working
class will by no means allow this to happen," Zhang Wei, a
national model worker from central China's Henan Province, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a forum held by the Chinese Communist Youth League Central
Committee Friday in Beijing, participants agreed that the CPC
Central Committee's decision to resolve the Falun Gong issue
according to law reflected the common aspiration of the
overwhelming majority of Party members and the common people. (

"Members of the Communist Youth League across the country must
take a clear-cut and firm stand to support the Party Central
Committee and play an active role in this struggle," they urged.
</P>
<P>
A Youth League official from the Ministry of Railways said he
was amazed that with pure fabrications and lies and his idealistic
and theistic fallacies, Li Hongzhi (founder of the Falun Gong)
could deceive so many people and lead them into disaster so easily.
</P>
<P>
"This reminds us of the importance and urgency of strengthening
our political and ideological work among the younger generation,
educating them with Marxist materialism and atheism, and making
greater efforts to popularize scientific knowledge," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
According to Gu Xiulian, vice-chairwoman of the All-China Women
's Federation, one major task for women's federation organizations
across the country at present is to further strengthen ideological
and political education among Chinese women and call on them to "
advocate science and abandon superstition".
</P>
<P>
"We must arm our sisters with scientific knowledge and help
improve their capability to recognize and resist feudal
superstition," said Gu at a forum in Beijing today attended by
women representatives from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation has also issued a circular to
women organizations nationwide, urging them to make active efforts
to help all Chinese women and their families to adopt a civilized,
healthy and scientific way of life, and keep away from all
benighted and superstitious activities, added Gu.

<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- He Zuoxiu, a 72-year-old
theoretical physicist was gratified at the central government's
ban on Falun Gong. He was among the first few people to write a
criticism of the Falun Gong before it was finally labeled
superstitious and a fount of malicious fallacies by the Ministry
of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Feudal superstition is becoming rampant in China these days,
which poses a threat to social stability," said He, a research
professor at the Institute of Theoretical Physics under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The prohibition will be beneficial to social stability and
unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, Prof. He published an article in the Youth
Scientific and Technological Review, a publication of Tianjin
Normal University, which cited the case of a postgraduate student
in his institute who developed a mental disorder through
practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
His article caused a great disturbance among Falun Gong
followers. More than 3,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered at
the campus of Tianjin Normal University in the next few days. On
April 25, more than 10,000 Falun Gong followers gathered outside
Zhongnanhai, the compound housing the headquarters of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee in downtown Beijing,
seriously disrupting social order and affecting people's daily
lives in this area.
</P>
<P>
"Li Hongzhi, the head of the illegal organization, has held up
the banner of 'Truthfulness, Benevolence and Tolerance'. But he
himself lied about the date of his birthday, and got his followers
to create disturbances whenever Falun Gong was criticized," said
He.
</P>
<P>
"Large groups of Falun Gong followers came to my house to argue
with me after I raised questions about the fallacies of Falun Gong,
and some followers were even encouraged to attack press
organizations which publicized my criticism of Falun Gong. This
can not be regarded as 'tolerance'," Prof. He said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of well-known Chinese
scientists have urged the elimination of Falun Gong and other
kinds of pseudoscientific phenomena and activities in China.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong has deceived many people by taking advantage of
senior citizens' hope of improving their health and undereducated
people's ignorance, said Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
If the absurd ideas fabricated by Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun
Gong, are accepted, scientists need not develop medical science.
And if the pseudoscientific ideas such as that water can be turned
into petroleum, which emerged in China several years ago, are
accepted, we need not to exploit oilfields, Lu said in contempt.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that scientific knowledge should be popularized in
China, and that the scientific spirit be better advocated.
</P>
<P>
"China will witness more rapid development if a large number of
the country's 1.2 billion population adopts the scientific spirit
and attitudes," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that chicanery and activities violating
scientific ethics should be banned in the academic field in China.
</P>
<P>
He Zuoxiu, an academician of CAS, who published an article
criticizing Falun Gong in a magazine sponsored Tianjin Normal
University in April, said Falun Gong, with the aim of making money
by cheating, has developed a large organization in China, and has
been pursuing political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
"Falun Gong and other kinds of pseudosciences should be rooted
out from China," said the 72-year-old physicist.

The 72-year-old physicist helped to compile the book "Exposing
Pseudoscience" three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1994, I have taken part in many fights against
psuedoscience and fake Qigong, and have written articles
criticizing pseudoscientific activities," said He.
</P>
<P>
"Many relatives of the victims of Falun Gong have called me,
telling me tragic stories concerning Falun Gong practitioners," He
said.
</P>
<P>
"But they were reluctant to stand up to expose the true face of
Falun Gong in public, fearing retaliation from other Falun Gong
followers," said He.
</P>
<P>
He said that the newly emerged superstition, under the disguise
of science and Qigong, advocates and disseminates fallacies. For
instance, Falun Gong, on the one hand, assaults modern science,
and on the other, spreads information via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Our fight against superstition has been feeble in recent years.
Personnel in scientific and press circles should think this over
and look for the real cause behind the Falun Gong phenomenon," He
added.

Zou Chenglu, an academician of the Institute of Biophysics
under CAS, attributed the Falun Gong phenomenon to the lack of
education in science.
</P>
<P>
"If scientific knowledge is not widely spread among ordinary
citizens, and if the scientific spirit can not take root in the
people's hearts, pseudoscientific activities will continue to
deceive people, even after the banning of Falun Gong," Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiansheng, an astronomer from CAS's Beijing Observatory,
said superstition has all along taken shelter from the universe.
Falun Gong preached many things about the universe that can not be
known. Li Hongzhi alleged that he knows when the world will blow
up or even can postpone the explosion by 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"It showed that Li is an ignorant cheater," Chen said, adding
that the explosions of supernovas have been observed by scientists
many times.
</P>
<P>
"But an explosion of earth is sheer nonsense, for the earth has
no nuclear burning process," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He added that science, with the major task of exploring the
future, progresses constantly. People should not deny science only
because it can not answer all the problems we are facing now.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, minister of science and technology, said in a
statement on behalf of Chinese scientific circles Friday that
scientists should shoulder the responsibility of promoting
socialist modernization construction, and criticize Falun Gong and
its leader Li Hongzhi's ridiculous ideas with large numbers of
facts and scientific truths.
</P>
<P>
The ulterior motives of making money and disturbing social
stability of Falun Gong should be further exposed, said Zhu in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are urged to explain the special phenomena of the
universe and the human body to the general public and refute
pseudosciences.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Ready to Hold Talks With Iran, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia have
expressed readiness to hold talks with Iran and the United States
to improve relations with the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We want to enter into meaningful talks with Iran and the
United States and to strengthen relations with them," the News
Network International (NNI) quoted head of the Taliban Interim
Council Mulla Mohammad Rabbani as telling the visiting U.N.
special envoy on Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, in Kabul Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. envoy proposed to Mulla Rabbani holding talks with
Tehran and Washington and the Taliban leader accepted the
proposal," Taliban official for information Ameer Khan Mutaqqi
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Rabbani and Brahimi held constructive talks and
discussed a host of issues concerning the long-running Afghan
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's relations with Iran and the United States have
been strained on a number of issues. Ties between the Taliban and
Iran soured after the militia killed 10 Iranian diplomats and a
journalist in the northern Afghan town of Mazar-e-Sharif last
year.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan
is believed to be the main reason for the strained relations
between the Taliban and the United States. The Taliban have
rejected the U.S. demand for the extradition of Osama who is
alleged to be running terrorist bases in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. envoy insisted on holding talks with the opposition
(Northern Alliance). Our side made it clear to Brahimi that the
Taliban are not against dialogue but the rivals have never been
sincere in talks," Rabbani was quoted as telling Brahimi.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived in Kabul Thursday after attending two days of
U.N.-sponsored talks in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan. The
Taliban and the Northern Alliance sat with representatives of "Six
plus Two" countries and discussed ways for the peaceful settlement
of the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The "Six plus Two" groups Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors
and Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Mutaqqi, the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance
launched an offensive in Aalingar district in Laghman province and
Darre Suf in Samangan province soon after the Tashkent talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Brahimi admitted that there are internal differences
inside the anti-Taliban alliance and that is why the dialogue
process remained inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
Mutaqqi quoted Rabbani as saying the opposition is responsible
for the failure of the Tashkent talks and all other peace talks in
the past.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Health Ministry said
there is a 50 percent decline in AIDS cases in the country,
especially in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry disclosed this in its 1999 AIDS surveillance
report available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decline in AIDS cases to awareness
programs and improved health care facilities including hospitals,
the AIDS support organization and other counseling centers.
</P>
<P>
The report said Rakai district in the west part of the country
recorded only 5 clinical AIDS cases in 1998, compared with the
1182 patients in 1996, adding the decline is due to the high level
of communication and awareness there.
</P>
<P>
Despite a remarkable decrease in the HIV/AIDS caused deaths
since 1996, about 54,712 Ugandans are still suffering from the
disease, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to another report launched on July 22 by UNICEF, 1.8
million Ugandans have died since the first patients of AIDS were
reported in 1982.

</P>
<P>
-- King Hassan II of Morocco died on Friday of a heart crisis
at the age of 71. Ruling Morocco with an iron hand since 1961, he
ended his rule with a political opening in 1998. As Hassan II's
rule was rooted in the rural and traditional areas, his son, Sidi
Mohamed, is faced with the task of reconciliating the kingdom with
the more modern urban population.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac, who visited Togo this week,
failed to arrange a direct meeting between the Togolese President
Gnasingbe Eyadema and the Togolese opposition party the UFC to
attain national reconciliation in Togo, which has been mediated by
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- King Hassan II of Morocco died in Rabat on Friday after
suffering from a heart crisis. In his latest years, the king had
tried to engage his country on the road of liberalization. He had
played an important role in the Arab world, initiating in 1982 an
Arab peace plan proposing recognition of Israel in exchange for
the return of Arab lands seized by Israel.
</P>
<P>
-- Upon arriving in Nigeria on Friday on the first state visit
by a French head of state to the African giant, Jacques Chirac
appealed to the leaders of Nigeria to build a relationship of ``
confidence and friendship'' with France.

<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Police had confirmed three

rescue groups said at least 10 were feared dead in the accident, a
Nigerian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading newspaper, reported that soldiers have
been drafted from their barracks to join policemen in containing
the rage which on Thursday turned the ancient city of Kano into a
tribal flash point.
</P>
<P>
Kano State Police Commissioner Alhaji Abubakar Mairamri also
said 47 suspects had been arrested over the riot that already
rendered more than 10, 000 non-indigenes in Kano refugees in
military and police barracks.
</P>
<P>
As tension lingered Friday afternoon, Kano State Governor Rabiu
 Kwankwaso reassured residents particularly the non-indigenes
taking refuse in barracks, that efforts had been redoubled to
guarantee security. Also, Emir of Kano Alhaji Ado Bayero and
Police Commissioner Mairamri, called for immediate cessation of
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Maramri blamed the driver who, according to him, dropped the
Sagamu riot victims at the Kano Central Mosque.
</P>
<P>
He assured city residents of security of life and property,
urging refugees in the barracks to go back to their respective
quarters.
</P>
<P>
A similar appeal was made Friday by the state governor while
addressing refugees at the military and police barracks. He
assured them that the government has intensified measures to stop
the riot and ensure the security.
</P>
<P>
"To see and to show solidarity, we assure you that we are
working round the clock to see that the skirmishes that started
yesterday is over," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the refugees replied that they would not leave the barracks
until their safety is certain.
</P>
<P>
The rioters who are mainly youths started the crisis on
Thursday afternoon at Kofar Wambai quarters. Security agents
however intervened after about three hours.
</P>
<P>
But some groups of youths regrouped in the night and continued
the riot at some other quarters.
</P>
<P>
The youths attacked non-indigenes, looted their properties and
burnt buildings especially at Kurna-Agabe and Bacharawa in Kano
city.
</P>
<P>
Many people were said to have sustained injuries while about 10
were feared dead.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Mourn Death of Moroccan King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians
said they "were feeling loss and pain" over the death of Moroccan
King Hassan II, a highly respected advocate of Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Saturday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak would issue official condolences on the death of the king
after the end of the Jewish Sabbath Saturday evening. The Jews
keep themselves away from public activities on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman has decided to attend the
funeral of King Hassan II, due on Sunday, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister and now Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres, who had close ties with the king, said he
was "really shocked" and felt "a deep loss" upon hearing the news
of the king's death.
</P>
<P>
"He was a real friend of the Jewish people. He hoped for peace,
he dreamed of peace and he fought for peace," Peres told the radio
late Friday night, soon after Rabat announced that Hassan died of
a heart attack after being hospitalized for a lung ailment.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan king worked secretly for peace between Arab
countries and Israel as early as in the 1970s. He helped Israel
and Egypt sign a peace accord in 1978, the first between an Arab
country and Israel, and played an instrumental role in the
convening of the 1991 Madrid peace conference and Israel's
peacemaking with Jordan and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Following the 1993 signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Oslo
accords, Morocco and Israel set up low-level diplomatic relations
in 1995. But the relations soured after the former hardline
Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has
announced three days of mourning in the West Bank and Gaza
beginning on Saturday in memory of the king.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian leadership felt great pain upon hearing the
news of the death of his majesty, King Hassan II," the PNA issued
a statement after a cabinet meeting late Friday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 24 (Xinhua) -- At least two civilians have been
killed and several others injured by fierce artillery fire near
the Afghan capital of Kabul between two warring factions.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Saturday from Kabul said the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance hit villages about 25 kilometers
north of Kabul in overnight shelling.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Taliban Commander Mullah Tavil Dar as saying
that at least two farmers were killed and several others wounded
by the shelling which started Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban retaliated by targeting the enemy bunkers, Dar
said, adding that the Taliban suffered no casualties.
</P>
<P>
No comment was immediately available from the Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The two Afghan warring factions attended the two-day peace
talks held earlier this week in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.
However, they failed to achieve any result because of sharp
differences on issues of cease-fire and establishment of a
broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
This was the second face-to-face meeting between the Taliban
and the opposition Northern Alliance since they met in Ashkhabad,
capital of Turkmenistan, in March this year.

human aspirations, ambitions, excitement, competition and

Nepal remains far behind in the treatment of mental disease.
While conditions of physical treatment here are far from

<HEADLINE> World Maritime Group to Assist Philippines' Seamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that International Maritime Organization (IMO) will help
sea-based Filipino workers comply with strict maritime-training
rules.
</P>
<P>
The move will help the government prop up the country's status
as the world's top supplier of seafarers, the presidential office
said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
The office said the IMO has promised to provide technical
assistance to ensure that the Philippines complies with rules set
under the International Convention on Standards of Training,
Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW).
</P>
<P>
Compliance with the STCW is crucial, it said, because it is a
prerequisite for the Philippines' inclusion in the "white list,"
which is the list of countries accredited as suppliers of highly
skilled seafarers.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 20 percent of the 1.23 million seafarers
worldwide are Filipinos, making the Philippines "the manning
capital of the world."
</P>
<P>
The presidential office said the IMO agreed to provide the
Philippines all the necessary technical assistance programs,
citing "the vital role of the Philippines in the international
ship-manning industry."
</P>
<P>
The number of Filipino seafarers rose steadily from 50,604 in
1984 to 193,300 last year. They are employed in ocean-going
tankers, passenger and reefer vessels as well as bulk and chemical
carriers worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Politician Arrested for Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan opposition politician Paul
Muite has been charged in a court with the theft of 31.1 million
Kenyan shillings (about 430 thousand U.S. dollars) from two firms
in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Muite, a lawyer and critic of the government, Friday pleaded
not guilty to the charges and was freed on bail of 4 million
shillings (about 55 thousand dollars), the East African Standard
daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Muite, as chairman of his private Arthi Holding, stole 24.1
million shillings (334 thousand dollars) from Naivasha Farmers
Cooperation and a man called Mwana Rironi between 1992 and 1993,
according to a state prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
He also stole seven million shillings (97 thousand dollars)
from the Murunguetha Farmers Company, the prosecutor alleged.
</P>
<P>
Muite responded to the charges by accusing the government of
fabricating and linking the court case to his recent disclosures
on the Goldenberg scandal.
</P>
<P>
"The charges are aimed at weakening me financially in the hope
I will be lured into (President Arap Moi's) diabolic regime,"
Muite argued.
</P>
<P>
The Goldenberg scandal directly led to the suspension of a 205
million dollars loan by the International Monetary Fund. The halt
of the loan has undermined Kenya's economy greatly.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent
a message of condolences on Saturday to the new Moroccan king Sidi
Mohammed VI over the death Friday of King Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the Chinese president praised the late Moroccan
king as a great pioneer in the cause of the north African country'
s national independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the king had devoted his entire life to his
country's independence, liberation and development and made
important contributions to the promotion of peace and development
in Maghrib, the Middle East, Africa and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He said that King Hassan was a leader loved by the Moroccan
people and having important influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, Jiang said, the late king paid great
attention to developing friendly relations and cooperation with
China and maintained deep friendship with Chinese leaders of
several generations. The king's death was a great loss to the
Moroccan people and also deprived the Chinese people of a
respected friend, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hoped that the new king would carry on with King Hassan's
unfulfilled wish and bring a developing and progressive Morocco
into the new century and that the Sino-Moroccan friendship would
continue to develop.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Live in Debt: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Most Lebanese are reported to be
living in debt, spending annually 28 percent more than per capita
income, the Daily Star quoted a report as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report on family income and expenditure in 1997 was
released by the country's state-run Department of Central
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
It was based on interviews with 15,206 individuals from
3,471 families, randomly selected from Beirut and its environs.
</P>
<P>
The report said that individual annual expenditure in 1997
amounted to about 4,500 U.S. dollars, nearly 28 percent more than
the per capita income of 3,200 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The average annual family expenditure in 1997 stood at about
20,000 dollars. This was 27 percent more than the 15,300 dollars a
family earned the same year.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the overspending to the lifestyle the
Lebanese are fond of keeping, along with their reluctance to
declare their real income.
</P>
<P>
The survey also noted that nearly a quarter of a family's
expenditure goes into basic food necessities.
</P>
<P>
Housing expenses come second, taking up nearly 22 percent of
the annual family budget, followed by telecommunications and
transport at 14.4 percent and education at 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Families in 1997 spent 7 percent of their budget on medical
expenses and 6.2 percent on clothing, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Undertake Population Census in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will undertake a
national population and housing census on May 1, 2000, and
preparations for the census are already under way, according to an
official report.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Saturday, the Philippine Information
Agency said volunteer coordinators and enumerators will start the
census at 00::01 that day.
</P>
<P>
Such a census is taken every 10 years beginning in 1980 and the
last national census of population and housing was conducted in
1990, it said.
</P>
<P>
The last census put the country's population at 64 million. But
at the present rate of growth, the country's population may reach
75 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The agency said teachers will be employed for the enumeration
work with field personnel of the National Statistics Office
supervising the census operations.
</P>
<P>
All housing units, whether occupied or vacant at the time of
the census, will be enumerated, it said.
</P>
<P>
The census will gather population data through house-to-house
visits and interviews, but special areas like exclusive
sub-divisions and condominiums will be covered using a
self-administered questionnaire to be filled up by the respondent.
</P>
<P>
The official results of the census will be released before
December 31, 2000, it said.

<HEADLINE> Third Yangtze Flood Crest Passes Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 24 (Xinhua)-- The third flood crest of the Yangtze
River passed this central China city of Wuhan in the middle
reaches of the Yangtze Friday night.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, at 08:00 today, the water level
monitored at the Wuhanguan Hydrology Station near Hankou, a
business district of Wuhan, receded to 28.85 meters and is
expected to drop to 28.50 meters on July 28.
</P>
<P>
But the water level monitored at the same station at 18:00
yesterday was 28.89 meters, the third highest in history, and the
flow was monitored at 69,000 cu m per second.
</P>
<P>
The flood peak is the largest so far this year on the Yangtze.
The water level monitored at Yichang upstream at 08:00 yesterday
dropped to 51.1 meters, and the flow was recorded at over 40,000
cu m per second.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze divides Wuhan City into three parts of Wuchang,
Hankou and Hanyang. Its major tributary, Hanjiang River, joins the
main stream of Yangtze at between Hanyang and Hankou, making Wuhan
the most important point for flood control on the main stream of
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, also the provincial capital of Hubei, has organized
plenty of manpower to carry out carpet-styled patrol on 465-km-
long embankments built along the river banks in the city in order
to discover and repair in time cave-ins in the flood-control
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In another development, navigation in the waters of the Yangtze
River near the construction site of the Three Gorges Project,
which was suspended for the third time in this flood season in the
morning of July 18, was resumed late July 22, as the runoff of
floodwaters in the area dropped to safe levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has dramatically appointed a conservationist to head the
country's civil service in a move termed as the reversing of the
corruption and inefficiency culture.

<P>
Richard Leakey, a white Kenyan, who was formerly chief of Kenya

<P>
The surprise appointment of Leaky, a former political adversary
of Moi, was a highest profile one in the major reshuffle of the
civil service, with several top jobs going to private sector
experts.
</P>
<P>
"Dr Leakey is recognized, both at home and internationally, as
a man of determination and integrity," Moi said in a statement
Friday. "He will have my complete and undivided support."

<P>
ABUJA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday jetted in Nigeria's capital Abuja from Togo, kicking off
the first visit of a western head of state to this country since
its resuming of civilian rule this May.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, on his third leg of a four-nation West African tour, is
expected to meet his Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo on
boosting bilateral ties and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first visit by a French president to the
English- speaking regional power. Analysts say that the visit
demonstrates a significant adjustment of French diplomacy, showing
France is to pay more attention to English-speaking Africa,
especially such regional power as Nigeria, which has ended its
military rule and been quickening its steps to reform its economy.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is paying the visit considerable importance. France is
already Nigeria's fourth largest trading partner, behind only the
United States, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is also eyeing on calling for France into its aid in
relieving its estimated 30 billion U.S. dollars debt.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian presidency statement released earlier said that "the
visit is important to Nigeria because it is part of the efforts to
attract foreign investment, open new areas of cooperation, while
strengthening existing economic, cultural and social relations."
</P>
<P>
Recent years Nigeria-France trade activities are on the rise,
with French businesses, particularly in the oil and construction
sectors having gained an increasingly larger share in the oil-rich
west African country.
</P>
<P>
Chirac began his West Africa tour on Wednesday in Guinea, and
he arrived in Nigeria from Togo.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export of Raw Jute Declines 26 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export of raw jute
declined by 26 percent in the just-concluded 1998-99 fiscal year
as compared with that in the previous year, The Financial Express
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 3.24 billion taka (2.02 million U.S.
dollars) by exporting 1.76 million bales (one bale equivalent to
180 kilograms) in the last fiscal year, against 4.3 billion taka
(86.9 million dollars) from the export of 2.4 million bales of raw
jute in the previous fiscal year, the report said, quoting sources
of the Bangladesh Jute Association.
</P>
<P>
India topped the list of last fiscal year's imports with
900,000 bales of jute from Bangladesh, followed by Pakistan which
purchased 450,000 bales against 325,000 bales of jute from the
country.
</P>
<P>
Jute traders attributed reasons for such a shortfall mainly to
a major decline in the export of jute to China due to huge
carry-overs from previous year's purchase since China topped the
list of major jute imports from Bangladesh in the 1997-98 period
by importing 700,000 bales.
</P>
<P>
Scarcity of seeds and shrinkage of acreage accompanied by
draught are likely to cast an adverse impact on the coming jute
crops in the country in the current fiscal year, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The raw jute export is a major foreign exchange earner of this
South Asian country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Expands Rural Road Network to Boost Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government plans to
construct an additional 2,000 kilometers of rural roads, upgrade
16,500 kilometers of existing rural roads and build 5,500 new
bridges to help boost rural development, Vietnam's English daily
Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Communications and Transport will
mobilize 3,000 billion Vietnamese dong (215 million U.S. dollars)
to undertake this work.
</P>
<P>
This will help local people in rural and remote areas have
access to economic, trade and investment activities.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 169,000 kilometers of rural roads, of which
only 53 kilometers are asphalted.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1998, Vietnam invested over 10,200 billion
Vietnamese dong (730 million dollars) in developing the rural road
network. More than 66,000 kilometers of rural roads were built and
tens of thousands of kilometers of existing rural roads were
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
However, 606 communes throughout the country lack any roads
suitable for use by automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is planning to complete building and upgrading the
entire system of rural roads in all communes throughout the
country by the year 2010. The new road network will link district
centers with commune centers, and link inter-commune routes.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Communications and Transport is also
calling on all nations, international financial organizations and
non-governmental organizations to support the program by providing
loans.

DHAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A third wave of earthquake, which
killed five children and injured more than 100 people Thursday,
hit southeast Bangladesh's Maheshkali island in the Bay of Bengal,
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"People were gripped by panic as the quake rocked this island
for the third time" early Friday morning, former chairman of
Shaplapur Union (township) Siddiqui Ahmed was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Terrified men, women and children were seen scrambling out of
their dwellings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of the tremor hit the offshore island, 25
kilometers from the southeastern sea resort of Cox's Bazar, at
4:45 P.M. Thursday and lasted for about 16 seconds damaging more
than 200 houses and government office buildings, and the second
wave shook the island at midnight.
</P>
<P>
People heard four bangs immediately after the quake, community
leader Abdul Khaleq said. An abandoned mine of a gas exploration
company might have exploded at that time creating a big hole in a
nearby hill, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates said that the quake damaged at least 500
houses, including educational institutions and mosques, while
25,000 houses were partially damaged. Some 250,000 people live on
the fishing Maheshkali island.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Coffee Production to Drop Sharply in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee production from
July of 1999 to June 2000 is estimated to be 24.8 million bags (60
kilograms per bag), a 26.9 percent drop compared to the 33.95
million bags last year.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Coffee Industry Association President Jose Carlos da
Silva Jr. said that 15 million bags of the total coffee output in
the 1999-2000 period will be exported.
</P>
<P>
This means a 29 percent reduction in the country's coffee
exports in the 1999-2000 period, compared to the 21.2 million bags
during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The output drop is mainly attributed to the "La Nina"
phenomenon, which has also affected coffee production in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a possibility that Brazil's coffee output in
2000-2001 could reach a record of 40 million bags.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.

<P>
Britain's Princess Anne attended the opening of the 17-day
games, which is described as the biggest Pan-Ams ever staged.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the games are more than 5,000 athletes from 42
countries, in addition to 2,000 coaches, trainers and mission
staff and 2,500 technical officials.
</P>
<P>
Canada, as host country, is sending 618 athletes who were led
by a 29-year-old track cyclist into the opening ceremony at
Winnipeg Stadium.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,400 performers joined in Winnipeg's celebration
culminating in cultural dances -- Chinese, African-Caribbean,
Polish, Guyanese, Hispanic, Hungarian, Indian, Scottish and

<HEADLINE> Thai-Kuwaiti Ties Not to Be Affected After Abuse Allegation: Chuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Thailand and
Kuwait are unlikely to be affected after a Thai maid alleged that
the Kuwaiti ambassador to Thailand sexually abused her, Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai was quoted Saturday morning by Channel 9,
the state television station, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has assigned the Foreign Ministry to
investigate the incident and find a solution to it, Channel 9
reported.
</P>
<P>
A Thai maid working at the ambassador's residence lodged a
complaint Thursday to the Foreign Ministry that the ambassador
sexually molested her on July 14.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement from the Kuwaiti embassy said her
allegations are "untrue and false", adding that publication of the
allegations would affect the "excellent relationship between the
two countries".
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra
chaired a meeting in the ministry Friday to discuss the matter.
Later a statement was issued, saying the ministry "lends
importance to maintaining the dignity of Thai women and to
protecting Thai people's rights and welfare".
</P>
<P>
If there is ground to the allegations, action could be taken
against the ambassador, 51-year-old Hamood Y. Al-Roudhan, in line
with the 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The convention allows for an investigation but not criminal or
civil action. Governments have been known to waive diplomatic
immunity to facilitate court proceedings in a host country, but
usually when a serious crime is involved.
</P>
<P>
At most, the Thai government might ask Kuwait to recall the
ambassador, officials at the Foreign Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> 223 Pig Farms Closed in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government Friday
decided to close 223 pig farms suspected of dioxin contamination,
whose products will be banned from sale unless scientific tests
prove them to be dioxin-free.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt told Xinhua after Friday
's cabinet meeting that it's not a new crisis of dioxin
contamination, and the government just made the decision to
prevent the dioxin pollution from extending further.
</P>
<P>
According to a source in the Health Ministry, the measure was
announced after media reports that investigators have found dioxin
levels more than 50 times the permitted level at the above-
mentioned 223 pig farms.
</P>
<P>
Verhofstadt confirmed the most serious problems are now in the
pig sector with 800 farms blocked, including 160 with confirmed
cases of dioxin contamination. He promised that his government
will approve a series of new measures in three days to deal with
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The food crisis started in late May when high level cancer-
causing dioxin was found in home-grown eggs, meat and dairy
produce, which were banned from sales both at home and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Five Sri Lankan survivors of the
ship that sank off Australia's Christmas Island coast are to be
grilled by the Australian federal police, Foreign Ministry sources
here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The five Tamils were on board together with 14 others who are
reported missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
At a predetermined point, the crew on the boat carrying the Sri
Lankans had changed over to the accompanying boat and returned to
Indonesia leaving the Sri Lankans in mid sea.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling route is a new one from Colombo to Singapore and
then to Indonesia from which point those being smuggled take a sea
route which has become increasingly popular despite the risks
involved, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Last December there had been a similar drowning. This year, an
estimated 900 people have arrived in Australia illegally by boat.
</P>
<P>
Last November 60 Sri Lankans attempting to sail to Australia
were rescued from a sinking trawler and in January 1998 over 80
Sri Lankans were drowned when a vessel carrying 300 illegal
immigrants sank, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> More Anti-Govt Armed Group Members Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 113 more members of the
Kayinni National Development Party (KNDP), an anti-government
ethnic armed group operating in Myanmar's southeastern Kayah
state, surrendered to the government forces Friday after
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The 113 KNDP members, who "exchanged arms for peace", were led
by the party's Hoya region commander U Goeri, official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony marking the move took place in Loikaw, capital of
the Kayah state, Friday, attended by Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Khin Nyunt urged the remaining armed group
members in the state to follow suit, it added.
</P>
<P>
In March 1995, the KNDP with 7,790 members led by its
Vice-Chairman U Khudhe Buphe, returned to the legal fold after
negotiation in response to the government's peace offer in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 525 members from
various anti-government armed groups "exchanged arms for peace"
with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as
the Mong Tai Army led by former drug warlord Khun Sa, have made
peace with the government since late 1988 when the military
government took over.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The 18th edition of the Indonesian
Badminton Open is set to stage in Tembau, Bali, from September 1
to 5, The Indonesian Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bali tournament, in which a total of 150,000 U.S. dollars
in prizes is up for grabs, is expected to lure more participants
than the last campaign.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is likely joined by top players from all over
the world in pursuit of as many as points as possible. Points they
are going to need if they want to be eligible for the
qualification round of the Sydney Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
"The country's badminton association (PBSI) has to thank all
related parties involved, so that one of the world's most
prestigious annual badminton events will be able to be kicked off,
" PBSI secretary-general Leo Wiranata said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the prolonged crisis that has rocked the
country over the past two years, causing financial problems for
many sports organizers intending to hold international level
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"This year, however, will be the moment to step up the pace in
giving the best efforts to the country. The upcoming showcase in
Bali should be marked by outstanding performances. But of course,
it will not do anybody any good if our athletes fail to take
advantage of the opportunity and perform their utmost," Leo said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is expected to face an uphill task given the likes of
big names participating in the event including China, Denmark,
Malaysia and others.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Indonesia took four out of the five events contested
with Mia Audina winning the women's singles, Ricky Subagja/Rexy
Mainaky (men's doubles), Eliza/Deyana Lomban (women's doubles) and
Trikus/Minarti (mixed doubles).
</P>
<P>
Trikus/Minarti have been the dominant figures in the tournament
over the years, snapping the mixed doubles crown four times in a
row. They are vying for their fifth consecutive title.

BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- New blueprints are expected to be
discussed by foreign ministers from China, the United States,
Russia, Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and the European Union (EU) to seek peace and development in
Asia and the world as a whole when they gather in Singapore next

</P>
<P>
As a representative of an ASEAN dialogue partner, Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan left here this morning for Singapore
to attend three ASEAN conferences, namely, the sixth ASEAN
Regional Forum, the 32nd Post Ministerial Conference and the ASEAN-
China Dialogue (10+1).
</P>
<P>
During the ASEAN Regional Forum, Tang is scheduled to emphasize
the new security concept featuring equality, mutual respect,
dialog, cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts
between nations, and to put forth proposals for the orientation of
the forum, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
At the 32nd Post Ministerial Conference, Tang will join hands
with other participants in discussions on the ways to establish a
just and reasonable political and economic order at the global
level.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese foreign minister will, in the ASEAN-China
Dialogue, explore new avenues to promote Sino-ASEAN good-
neighborly partnership of mutual trust with his ASEAN counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Tang's meetings with foreign ministers from more than ten
countries, including Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Thailand,
the Philippines, the United States, Russia and Finland, will also
be on the agenda of the visit.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Regional Forum, set up by ASEAN in 1993, is aimed at
safeguarding regional peace and establishing relationships of

Local observers said that the number of destabilizing factors
in the international situation have increased in recent months,
noting that in such circumstances, the forthcoming meetings will
underline the importance of maintaining regional security and
promoting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, these bilateral and multilateral meetings
will provide new opportunities for the participating countries to
engage in full exchanges of views, and promote trust and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of Asian affairs from the Chinese foreign
ministry told Xinhua that China holds that the forum will proceed
with an emphasis on establishing trust, and on the principles of
participating on an equal footing, and reaching agreement through
consultations, mutually beneficial cooperation and in a step-by-
step manner.
</P>
<P>
Yan Xuetong, a research fellow at the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations, said that China and ASEAN,
which is now seeing gradual regional economic recovery, share an
interest in maintaining regional stability and pursuing economic
and trade collaboration, thus laying a basis for bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the financial crisis in Southeast Asia serves as a
touchstone, because China's sincerity in ensuring regional
security and stability and its important role in the region have
been fully reflected in the country's positive action to keep its
currency stable as well as the granting of financial aid worth
nearly five billion U.S. dollars.

Indeed, China's actions have promoted its political trust

Trust promotes stability, and stability brings about growth.
Clearly, any attempts to form military alliances in the

<HEADLINE> More Anti-Govt Armed Group Members Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 113 more members of the
Kayinni National Development Party (KNDP), an anti-government
ethnic armed group operating in Myanmar's southeastern Kayah
state, surrendered to the government forces Friday after
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The 113 KNDP members, who "exchanged arms for peace", were led
by the party's Hoya region commander U Goeri, official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony marking the move took place in Loikaw, capital of
the Kayah state, Friday, attended by Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Khin Nyunt urged the remaining armed group
members in the state to follow suit, it added.
</P>
<P>
In March 1995, the KNDP with 7,790 members led by its
Vice-Chairman U Khudhe Buphe, returned to the legal fold after
negotiation in response to the government's peace offer in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 525 members from
various anti-government armed groups "exchanged arms for peace"
with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as
the Mong Tai Army led by former drug warlord Khun Sa, have made
peace with the government since late 1988 when the military
government took over.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Rejects U.S. Charge of Subsidy in its Steel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazil on Friday rejected the
accusation of U.S. steel companies that Brazilian steel producers
have benefited from government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"We emphatically reject this accusation (of the U.S. steel
producers)," Jose Alfredo Graza Lima, vice minister in charge of
integration affairs of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry told the
press.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced recently that it will investigate
whether Brazil steel producers have benefited from subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Lima described the U.S. threat to probe the Brazilian steel
industry as a trade barrier.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's cold rolled steel exports to the United States
amounted to 75 million U.S. dollars last year, equivalent to 10
percent of the U.S. imports of such products.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian authorities said U.S. steel producers want to see
less import of Brazilian cold rolled steel products so they can
hike the prices.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Invest 10 Million U.S. Dollars to Boost Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador will invest 10 million U.S.
dollars this year to help its export sector tide over the current
slump, Foreign Trade Minister Jose Luis Icaza said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Ecuador Before the Year 2000" held
here, the minister said the money will be injected into the
private export sector in the form of interest-free credits.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian exports are going through a slump and the whole
export sector is "on the brink of collapse," said Luis Maldonado,
president of the Exporters Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian Central Bank said that exports for the January-
April period amounted to 1.3 billion dollars, compared to 1.5
billion dollars for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said exports of cocoa, lumber and fish
increased during the period, but prices and quantities of other
products, such as coffee, were seriously reduced, going from 20.2
million dollars to 7.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Banana exports dropped from 430.8 million dollars to 374.8
million dollars, and crude oil fell from 298.7 million dollars to
246.4 million dollars, said the Central Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Baoshan Iron
and Steel Group, one of China's top-ten iron and steel producers,
is reported to have gained nearly 11.59 billion yuan in sales and
456 million yuan in profits during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
This sweet result is mainly due to the introduction of a policy
urging 27 of the nation's large- and medium-sized iron and steel
companies to expand their shares of the domestic market by
upgrading product quality.
</P>
<P>
This policy aims to reduce the nation's imports of high value-
added rolled steel by convincing consumers to use domestically
produced rolled steel turned out by these 27 companies.
</P>
<P>
To help China-made rolled steel increase its share of the
domestic market, the country issued favorable policies to reduce
taxes levied on the home-made products, which are used
domestically to produce export-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
Baoshan exported 814,700 tons of rolled steel during the first
half of the year, more than twice the figure of the corresponding
1998 period, bringing in 195 million US dollars in foreign
exchange, a 45 percent rise over the same period last year.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Soccer
Federation (FIFA) disregarded the results of anti-doping tests of
two Mexican national team players and supported the South American
Soccer Confederation which suspended them for six months.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Joseph S. Blatter said on Friday the association
rejected the test results because they were not done in a
laboratory approved by FIFA and the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The two players Raul Rodrigo Lara and Pablo Cesar Chavez, who
played for the Mexican National team in the America Cup in
Paraguay, were both found positive in the doping tests.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said that the two could play in the Confederations Cup
that starts here Saturday if they are needed by the Mexican team.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said the South American Soccer Confederation (Conmebol)
knew that only officially approved laboratories could conduct the
tests, and that it would be sanctioned.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economic Growth Forecast Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to increase the country's
economic growth forecast for 1999/2000 to 1.5-2.5 percent from 0-2
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Growth prospects are benefiting from improving market
sentiment, higher agricultural incomes and recovering consumer
demand," the government said in its latest letter of intent (LoI)
with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The LoI was issued by the office of the coordinating minister
for economy, finance and industry here Friday. Signed by the
government and the IMF following a routine review of Indonesia's
economic reform progress, the LoI paves the way for the
disbursement of the IMF's 43-billion-U.S. dollar rescue package to
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Market sentiment has improved markedly since the last review,
helped by the peaceful completion of the June 7 parliamentary
election," the LoI was quoted by The Indonesian Observer Saturday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The LoI also revised the annual inflation rate to 4-5 percent
and the gross foreign exchange reserves to 27.5-28.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the LoI, economic analyst Umar Juoro said the
target of the gross foreign exchange reserves is difficult to
reach because of political and economic factors.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming presidential election will have an impact on the
Indonesian economy, he was quoted by the Antara News Agency
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank Indonesia, the country's gross international
reserves, which are net foreign exchange reserves plus outstanding
foreign exchange contracts, dropped by 295.8 million dollars to
26.6 billion dollars on July 15 compared with the previous week's
level.
</P>
<P>
Umar said the 4-5 percent inflation rate could still be
achieved, as prices had been declining.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's inflation in March, April, May and June
respectively was 0.18 percent, 0.68 percent, 0.28 percent and 0.34
percent, bringing the cumulative inflation in the first semester
of this year to 2.73 percent compared with 46.55 percent in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The declining inflation rate, Umar said, was associated with
the drop in the inflation of foodstuffs which has a strong effect
on the overall inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said that agricultural production has improved, although it
has been raining during the current dry season, but harvests are
good.
</P>
<P>
Food sufficiency may lower prices, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
continued to fall Friday amid a threat of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks closed down 58.26 at 10,910.96, adding to
33-point drop Thursday. Among the Dow components hit hardest were
J.P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the House Banking
Committee Thursday that while 1999 has been an exceptional year
for the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve would "act promptly and
forcefully" to raise interest rates at the first hint of inflation
pressure. The remarks drove the market lower on that day and made
an impact on the most leading indexes Friday.
</P>
<P>
The high rate threat also dragged the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index lower. The stocks fell 4.03 at 1,356.94.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq index was pushed higher by
strong earning reports released by Sun Microsystems and Gateway.
The index rose 7.96 at 2,692.42.
</P>
<P>
Other stock indicators were also lower. The NYSE composite
index fell 2.91 at 638.87 and the American Stock Exchange
composite index fell 3.52 at 796.29.

<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.11 at

<HEADLINE> Russia Squad Takes Position in Italian Sector in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An entire squad of Russian
paratroopers Friday moved into the city of Kijevo, central Kosovo,
in a sector that is formally under Italian command.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency Ansa reported that the squad, made up
of some thirty military personnel, three armored vehicles and a
transmitter station, took up position inside a former farm
cooperative next to the Mother Teresa humanitarian center and less
than 100 meters from an Italian army base set up recently inside a
school.
</P>
<P>
Since the arrival of their forces in Kosovo, Russian generals
have asked the KFOR command in Pristina to be allowed to occupy a
corridor in the Italian sector that was 10 km long and three km
wide, with Kijevo at its center.
</P>
<P>
Italian military sources in the area said Friday that the
Russians were on a reconnaissance mission that had been regularly
authorized. No mention was made of the fact, however, that the
soldiers had raised the Russian flag and their paratrooper
regiment colors and set up a communications center.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Russian squad said that they were
operating in cooperation with the Italians but an official meeting
between the two sides would not take place until Saturday, in Pec.
</P>
<P>
A roadblock set by the Italian San Marco Brigade was moved back
several hundred meters and this allowed the Russians to enter
Kijevo without passing through the check-point.
</P>
<P>
It was at this same roadblock that Italian troops recently
stopped Russian military vehicles from entering the city without
authorization from the KFOR.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Four tombs dating back to the ninth
century BC have been discovered in the Roman Forum, Rome's famous
historic monument, archaeologists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The finding is of particular importance because it is the first
evidence of human settlement in the forum area at such an early
date, they said.
</P>
<P>
One of the tombs was of a child and one had already been robbed
at the time of the Caesars, they said.
</P>
<P>
Inside the tombs were earthenware jars and other objects
typical of the Latium civilization of the time.
</P>
<P>
Also unearthed during the ongoing digging of the forum was a
6th century BC well containing ceramic objects.
</P>
<P>
"No one could have thought that under our feet there was a
settlement that preceded the historic founding of the city," Rome
Mayor Francesco Rutelli told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the diggings had enabled them to redraw the map of
the forum in the time of the Caesars. One said a significant link
between the forum of Julius Caesar and that of the later emperor
Nerva had been established.
</P>
<P>
The imperial forums will re-open fully to the public in
December.

<HEADLINE> Venice's Population Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The population in Venice fell to
67,483 at the end of 1998, compared to 100,000 20 years ago and
over 200,000 during its imperial and merchant heyday in the 1400s,
figures released in the Italian water city Friday showed.
</P>
<P>
"People are not getting out of Venice, but the population is
aging," said Deputy Mayor Michele Vianello in presenting the
city's statistical year-book for last year, which showed that
deaths were about double births in 1998 (1,028 to 505).
</P>
<P>
The city's progressive de-population as traditional trades
cease to be viable is seen by some to be as big a threat to its
survival as the rising level of the lagoon and greater frequency
of flooding by high tides.
</P>
<P>
According to the city hall, de-population is affecting the
city's mainland neighborhoods as well as its historic center built
on islands in the middle of the lagoon.
</P>
