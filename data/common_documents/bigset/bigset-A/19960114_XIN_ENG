<HEADLINE> Guinea Worm Attack Reduced Greatly In Northeastern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Guinea worm cases in the Nigeria
Guinea Worm Eradication Program Zone tumbled from 33,544 in 1988
to 2,165 last year, representing a more than 90 percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
The zone in northeastern Nigeria covers one third of Nigeria's
landmass and comprises eight states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno,
Jigawa, Kano, Plateau, Yobe and Taraba.
</P>
<P>
Ben Nwobi, the zonal facilitator of "Global 2000", an
international agency working for the eradication of the disease,
was quoted today by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying that
only six percent of the Guinea worm cases remaied to be
eliminated in the zone.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the reduction to prompt distribution of
chemicals and filters for water treatment, provision of potable
water in some endemic villages, timely report and management of
cases and the efforts of village-based health workers.
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts, he noted, had resulted in the revival of
agricultural activities which suffered neglect owing to the
debilitating nature of the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria and neighbouring Cameroon had stepped up
efforts to check borer transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The zone would also step up its enlightenment campaign through
jingles on the radio, distribution of cassettes on Guinea worm
control, drama by schools and house-to-house visits, he added.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today voiced
the hope in Riyadh that the Middle East peace process would be
crowned with setting up an independent palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency quoted Palestinian Ambassador in Saudi
Arabia Mustafa Hashem Sheikh Deeb as saying that the two officials
expressed the hope during their meeting earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Deeb said their talks dealt with Arab and Islamic affairs and
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Crown Prince and Arafat affirmed that Moslems would not
concede their Islamic and historical rights in Jerusalem, and
reiterated their rejection of Israel's attempts to Judaize the
Holy City, Deeb said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked the Saudi Government for pledging, during a
Paris donor countries meeting last week, 100 million U.S. dollars
in aid to the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He put the total amount of Saudi Arabia's financial aid to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) at 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said Arafat, who arrived this morning on a
two-day visit, would proceed to Bahrain for talks with Emir Sheikh
Isa Bin Salman al-Khalifa.

In a statement issued upon his arrival, Arafat praised Riyadh's
"important and brotherly role toward the Palestinian Authority
and people."
</P>

The PNA leader said he would visit King Fahd, who is resting
after his health was deteriorated as a result of exhaustion last
month.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Welfare Party Ready to Return Mandate if Failing in Coalition Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Islamist Welfare
Party said today it would return the mandate for forming a new
government if other parties refuse its coalition offer.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Suleyman Demirel asked Necmettin
Erbakan, leader of the Welfare Party, which came first at the
December 24 general elections, to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Gul, deputy chairman of the Welfare Party, told
reporters that his party was making every effort to form a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "We are not giving concessions in order to
form a government (as the press claimed). All we do is to act
without any prejudice."
</P>
<P>
He accused some circles of preventing the establishment of "an
honest government" led by the Welfare Party. "These people are
taking advantage of the current economic system. They are the
self-interested people."
</P>
<P>
Gul added that any solution excluding the Welfare Party would
be artificial.
</P>
<P>
So far both the True Path Party of caretaker Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller and the Motherland Party have cold-shouldered
Erbakan, who has been seeking a partner for a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The local leading newspapers have called for a center-right
coalition without the Islamist Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
If Erbakan fails persuading other parties to take part in a
Welfare Party-led coalition government, he would have to return
the mandate to President Demirel, who will assign other party
leaders to try again.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Pledges Security For Returning Shobashobane Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 14 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki today led a government delegation to
welcome returning refugees back to their Shobashobane homes in
Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to 42 families who have returned to the African
National Congress (ANC)-controlled area, Mbeki pledged government
assistance "in whatever way is required" to restore order in
Shobashobane.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki assured returning refugees the government would provide
tight security to prevent them from further attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should be a refugee in this country. As government we
are determined to deal with the problem of violence in this
province," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the Shobashobane killers was of paramount
importance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people fled Shobashobane following the Christmas
Day massacre, carried out by a horde of about 600 people. During
the massacre, 19 people were murdered.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, who accompanied
Mbeki to Shobashobane today, said police and army personnel would
maintain a 24-hour presence in the area.
</P>
<P>
The government would also provide personnel and logistical
assistance to the police at the nearby port of Shepstone to
assist in this task, Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ANC Kwazulu/Natal Provincial Secretary Senzo Mchunu
said the return of the refugees marked a victory against the
violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
"If government folded its arms, it would be a victory for the
evil forces and they can carry on with violence in other areas,"
Mchunu said.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the returning refugees were concerned the
security forces would pull out of the area, leaving returning
residents at the mercy of hostile neighbors in the surrounding
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
"We need permanent security in this place," said one returning
refugee.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the political violence in Kwazulu/Natal
between the supporters of the ANC and the IFP had claimed lives
of more than 14,000 people in the past few years. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Sharif
Zeid Ben Shaker held talks here today with his Dutch
counterpart Wim Kok who arrived earlier today for a two-day
official visit to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers signed a joint declaration on land
transportation and a letter of intent for agreement on
protecting investments in the two countries after their talks in
the Prime Ministry Office.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two premiers discussed bilateral
relations and the prospects for cooperation between the two
countries in various fields, according to the Jordan News Agency,
Petra.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch prime minister, who is on the second-leg of his
Middle East tour which has already taken him to Syria and will
also cover Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, will open
a Dutch embassy in the Kingdom Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that economic cooperation and exploring
investment opportunities are high on the list of Kok's talks
with Jordanian senior officials.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the Netherlands is eager to win the bids
of some major projects in the Kingdom, including the extension
of a gas pipeline from Egypt to Israel via Aqaba, the
construction of a railway from Amman to Aqaba and the expansion
of Amman international airport.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is among the first Western countries who
opened joint ventures in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In 1955, Jordan breweries, which produces Dutch beer Amstel,
was the first commercial venture between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, KLM, the royal Dutch airline, was the first
international European airline to have direct flights to Amman.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 14 (xinhua) -- Doctors have warned Canadians
that they will be hit by influenza which has been traveling from
west to east across Canada in this winter.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of all laboratory confirmations of influenza
viruses in Canada by December 30 had occurred in the western
provinces and now influenza is moving into eastern Canada, the
Montreal daily Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
As the two strains circulating this winter -- A/Johannesburg
and A/Texas -- pass through the eastern Canada this month, a
quarter of the general population will have been infected,
including half of children aged 15 and under, according to the
federal Laboratory Centre for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
Doctors advised Canadians to receive flu vaccinations at the
beginning of the winter. Flu vaccines do not guarantee immunity,
but studies suggest they confer protection in 70 to 90 percent of
cases.

HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) - Yeh Chang-ting from Chinese
Taipei scored a final round 67 to take the 500,000 US dollars
Omega PGA Championship here today.
</P>
<P>
He won over Welshman Mark Mouland by five strokes.
</P>
<P>
Yeh, the tournament leader since the first day, had five
birdies and two bogeys at the Clearwater Bay Golf &AMP; Country Club
here in his fourth consecutive sub-70 score, finishing with a
nine-under-par total of 271.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Yeh made up for his failure two months ago at
Hong Kong Open, where he also led from the start only to be
overtaken in the closing stages by American Gary Webb and Mexico's
Rafael Alacorn.
</P>
<P>
Yeh collected 80,750 US dollars, the biggest cheque of his
career.
</P>
<P>
Mouland, who fired a closing 68 and made sure of second place
with an eight-foot birdie putt at the last, felt he lost all
chance of catching Yeh when he dropped two shots on the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Mouland's last victory was in the 1988 KLM Dutch Open.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Richard Kaplan, who equaled the best score of
the week with a final round 65, finished third on three under par,
and America's Mike Cunning fourth a further stroke behind.
</P>
<P>
Despite only finishing 30th, Lin Keng-chi also from Chinese
Taipei wrote his name into the history books by becoming the
first-ever Asian Order of Merit winner with 177,856 US dollars in
prize money.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Boonchu Ruangkit was second with 173,177 US dollars,

Japanese spacecraft, said U.S. space agency officials in Cape
Canaveral, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata set loose the Office of
Aeronautics and Space Technology satellite at 11:32 GMT as
Endeavor soared nearly 200 miles above the Atlantic Ocean off the
coast of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is to remain in orbit for about 48 hours; the
crew then will pick it up for the ride home.
</P>
<P>
It contains four technology demonstration experiments,
including a Global Positioning System receiver to test its ability
to navigate satellites, amateur radio gear, new laser-based
ordnance equipment and projects to measure the levels of
contamination in low-Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
Endeavor is now in its fourth day of an ambitious nine-day
mission.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wakata, the crew consists of its commander Brian
Duffy, pilot Brent Jett and mission specialists Leroy Chiao,
Winston Scott and Daniel Barry.
</P>
<P>
Leroy Chiao and Daniel Barry are scheduled to conduct the first
spacewalk Monday to test tools and techniques for building an
international space station.

<HEADLINE> Israel Promises not to Interfere in Palestinian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not interfere in
the process of the Palestinian elections scheduled on January 20,
but will take security steps on its part on the day.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by Oren Shahaul, Israeli coordinator for
activities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, today at a press
conference in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Shahaul said that "till now, (there are) no major problems or
obstacles in the (elections) process." he said. "According to our
opinion, the Palestinians did their best in the preparations in
the right direction."
</P>
<P>
According to Shahaul, there are a total of 955,000
Palestinian eligible voters registered for the Palestinian Council
elections.
</P>
<P>
There are 672 candidates, 28 of them women, for 88 seats of the
council. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and West Bank resident Samila
Khalil, who opposes the peace process, are running for the post of
Palestinian Authority chairman.
</P>
<P>
Shahaul said there are 1,696 voting stations, including 1,198
in the West Bank and 498 in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the five post offices in east Jerusalem
where balloting will also take place are not voting stations,
but "places with special arrangements." The post offices will
remain open for business as well.
</P>
<P>
Rightwing Israelis have already complained that voting in east
Jerusalem will affect Israel's "sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Concerning Hebron, where the Israeli military redeployment
will be concluded only in late March, Shahaul said that the
voting will take place in specific places where Jewish settlers
will be barred from entering.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the Palestinian elections will be democratic and
free, more than 600 international observers, including former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and some 2,000 local observers will
be monitoring the voting.

<HEADLINE> Russia Extends Hostage Deadline for Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia extended the deadline
today for Chechen rebels to release some 70 hostages from 10
a.m. (700 GMT) to 1 p.m. (1000 GMT) to avoid a bloodshed to end
the five-day crisis in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
The new deadline was set at "the request of Daghestan's
leadership" and in an effort to "keep possible casualties to a
minimum when the hostages are freed," the operational headquarters
was quoted by Itar-Tass agency as saying, after the gunmen failed
to free their captives by the old deadline.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Mikhail Barsukov, head of the
Federal Security Services, arrived this morning in Pervomaiskoye,
Daghestan, where the rebels held hostages they captured in the
city of Kizlyar early Tuesday, to seek resolution to the second
hostage crisis generated by Chechens outside their homeland in
seven months.
</P>
<P>
His on-the-spot supervision is expected to bring new life
into the deadlocked negotiations between Moscow and the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Barsukov on Saturday threatened to take swift action if a
single hostage is killed and promised the rebels safe passage back
to their mountainous north Caucasus homeland, which is fighting
for independence from Russia, only after they released the victims
and surrendered their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were blocked on Wednesday in Pervomaiskoye, just
short of the Chechnya-Daghestan border, when they tried to flee
back to Chechnya after storming Kizlyar and captured over 3,000
hostages Tuesday. Most of the hostages have been freed so far.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, led by Salman Raduyev, have vowed to "fight to the
last bullet" and asked leading Moscow politicians, foreign
journalists and aid workers to accompany them to Chechnya as a
safety guarantee.

<HEADLINE> Snow Storms Hit Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A snow storm, which has not
visited the northwest extreme of China for five years, has plunged
the region into an icy world.
</P>
<P>
Strong cold air currents coming south from Mt Ural started
influencing Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on the ninth of this
month, having brought down the temperatures by ten to 20 degrees
celsius. The temperature in northern Xinjiang has dropped to 40
degrees below zero. In Urumqi, the regional capital, the snowfall
reached 40 cm thick.
</P>
<P>
The snow storms have claimed no casualties, according to the
regional government. The improvement of grasslands and hay supply
and animal shelters over the past few years has also remarkably
decreased the death of cattle.
</P>
<P>
However, the snow storms had caused a 24-hour blockade on the
railway between Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, and
Urumqi. The Alataw Pass Railway Station on the Sino-Kazakhstan
border had been shut down for 16 hours by gales and snowfalls,
stranding 30 Chinese and foreign passenger and cargo trains. The
railway administration of Urumqi had more than 1,600 workers clear
the snow day and night.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou-Urumqi railway line has resumed operation. No
passenger was frost bitten.
</P>
<P>
The road department in Xinjiang has had more than 1,000
workers clearing the snow day and night, ensuring the smooth
operation of the traffic trunks. The civil aviation department has
taken prompt measures to ensure normal international and domestic
flights.
</P>
<P>
In Urumqi more than 700 traffic police are keeping order around
the clock. No major traffic accidents have occured. But the number
of patients wounded from falling off is apparently growing in
major hospitals. 500,000 local residents went on the street to
clear the snow. And more than 70,000 vehicles were used to
transport 210,000 tons of snow and ice on over 80 main streets out
of the downtown districts.
</P>
<P>
"The invasion of the strong cold air and the snowfall across
Xinjiang have somewhat affected the lives of urban residents and
transportation," Sui Yuxin, a senior engineer and director of the
Xinjiang Meteorological Center, said. "But it is very beneficial
for winter wheat to live through the winter, for the alleviation
of droughts since last winter and the agricultural production and
animal husbandry this year."

<HEADLINE> Iran Concerns Security in Central Asia, Caucasus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security could be
affected by the wars raging in Central Asia and the Caucasus, said
Iranian foreign minister here today.
</P>
<P>
Ali Akbar Velayati said Iran was involved in mediation between
the warring factions in Tajikistan, between Azerbaijan and
Armenia, because "the security of the Islamic Republic of Iran is
guaranteed through establishment of peace and security in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international seminar on Security and Foreign
Policy in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Velayati said that his
country was extremely active in bringing peace to Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can witness the efforts of the Islamic Republic for
resolving the Tajikistan crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the influence of the Islamic Republic of Iran
over the warring factions has led to the reduction of tension in
Tajikistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati added that Iran was also involved in mediation
efforts for bringing peace to the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous
Region (NKAR), a part of Republic of Azerbaijan populated by
mostly ethnic Armenians.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that, in Iran's view, "the Karabakh crisis can
only be resolved through negotiation, and based on mutual respect
and lack of interference in the internal affairs of both
countries."
</P>
<P>
However, he made no mention of Iran's role in Chechnya, a
region which is now at the center of world attention because of
the latest hostage-taking by Chechen separatists in Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that there is a tacit agreement between
Iran and Russia that Tehran would stay quiet on the Chechnya
crisis in return for strategic relations which include the
transfer of nuclear technology by Moscow to Iran.

<HEADLINE> New Employment Mechanism Taking Shape in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A new form of labor market
system featuring two-way selection between employers and employees
has taken shape in Dalian, a coastal city in northeastern Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Taking the city occupational recommendation center as the
leading organization for employment or reemployment matters, the
system consists of 12 service centers at the district or county
levels, eight specialized job-seeking agencies and 204 grassroots
commissions.
</P>
<P>
By means of competitive employment, businesses hire the qualified
personnel they need, and the other way round, and individuals look for
work places where they want to go.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, a labor market mansion was completed in
the city for rendering routine services for job-seekers and
employers. Service personnel working in the mansion are
responsible for arranging talks and providing consultations and
training services.
</P>
<P>
In the past, labor departments of the city government would
just organize job-seeking gatherings several times a year.
</P>
<P>
With assistance of these job-recommending organizations,
550,000 individuals and 22,800 work units have been listed in the
labor market over the past two years, and 32,000 urban unemployed
found jobs and over 60,000 redundant workers were hired again.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Solve Problem of Water Shortage in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government today
reaffirmed its determination to solve the problem of water supply
shortage in Kathmandu through a major water project.
</P>
<P>
There is no alternative to the Melamchi water project for the
solution of the drinking water problem in the capital city,
Minister for Physical Planning Balaram Gharti Magar said today at
a seminar on the 185 million-US dollar project.
</P>
<P>
He said the government planned to implement the project with
the cooperation of donor agencies and involvement of the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The government last month announced the Melamchi project which
is scheduled to bring water from a river nearly 30 kilometers away
to Kathmandu by constructing dams and tunnels.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to supply 170 million liters of water
every day for Kathmandu after the completion of its first phase by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Daily water demand in Kathmandu is around 130 million liters at
 present, but only 110 million and 60 million of that is supplied
in rainy and dry season respectively.
</P>
<P>
Criticism had arisen here saying that the large-scale water
diverting project would cause substantial damage on local
environment.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factional Leader Criticizes Osman Atto For Siding With Aidid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 14 (Xinhua) --The norminal Chairman of the
Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM), Aden Abdullahi Nur Gabyow, today
ciritcized osman Atto's militiamen in Lower Jubba for siding
militarily with General Mohamed Farah Aidid's self styled
national army.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in North Mogadishu, Gabyow
said: "The political alliance of Osman Atto with the Somali
Salvation Alliance (SSA) was a tricky one for sabotaging the
unified efforts of factions supporting Ali Mahdi."
</P>
<P>
The criticism followed a fighting which erupted between the
militiamen loyal to General Mohamed Siad Hirsi Morgan and those
of General Aidid in Gobwein and Yontoy earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Gabyow strongly condemned osman Atto's initiatives in the over
all peace efforts in Somalia. He said: "Osman Atto's faction is
now clearly representing the interests of Aidid's unilateral
government."
</P>
<P>
"Osman Atto is a traitor and will not be accepted by our
Somali Salvation Alliance as a political leader," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gabyow said that non-painted technicals belonging to Osman
Atto were supporting General Aidid's massacre and capture of
Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
According to Gabyow, SSA had a closed-door meeting yesterday
aimed at a isolating osman Atto and his faction from what he
called the peace loving efforts of SSA.
</P>
<P>
Gabyow also announced that Mohamed Haji Aden, the
Vice-President of Aidid's government had defected from the South
Mogadishu government and now joined the elders of Kismayo
supporting SPM.
</P>
<P>
Osman Atto, the former financier of General Aidid had defected
from his boss in mid-June last year when United Somali
Congress/Somali National Alliance had elected him chairman for
the faction after sacking General Aidid.

WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers here today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton visited U.S. troops in Bosnia and talked
about the importance he places on peacekeeping "where our values
and interests are at stake."
</P>
<P>
-- The hostage situation in a southern Russian region near
Chechnya is pointing up the continuing and long-standing tension
with Russia and among groups in the region about sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
-- Republican rivals for the U.S. Presidential nomination
sharpened their attacks on the front-runner, Senator Bob Dole,
saying he lacked the vision and leadership to defeat President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> mee011409hke-- Iran Spends 1.6 Percent of GNP on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today called for reduction of arms race in the Gulf
region, saying his country spends only 1.6 percent of its gross
national product (GNP) for defense purposes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing international experts at the Seminar on Security and
Foreign Policy in Central Asia and the Caucasus held here,
Velayati said his country was focusing on reconstruction rather
than arms race.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation of all the Persian Gulf littoral states will
reduce the arms race, ensure the free flow of oil, and cause
economic boom in this sensitive and strategic region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also criticized Iran's neighbors
in the Gulf region for continuing to spend huge sums of money on
armaments.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Defense Minister Mohammad Forouzande said earlier that
the total budget expected to be devoted to defense in 1996 will be
5,800 billion rials. In term of U.S. dollars (one dollar for 3,000
rials in market price), that will be equivalent to less than 2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This figure shows a 30.7 percent increase compared to the
current Iranian calendar year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran increases the military spending
in order to enhance military capabilities, especially the Navy
force, because it claims that the U.S. military presence in the
Gulf constitutes a major threat to the security of the Islamic
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Navy Deputy Commander Admiral Abbas Mohtaj said earlier that
Iran will have the third Russian-made submarine at the Persian
Gulf in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a total armed forces of 528,000 and reserves of
350,000. There is also some 170,000 for the Revolutionary Guard
Corps.

<HEADLINE> Returned Students Contributing to Developing Hainan's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A number of students who have
returned from overseas are playing an important role in the
economic development of south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
More and more students studying overseas came back to the
motherland after completing their studies. According to statistics
available in Hainan, some of them have become leading officials in
the departments or companies where they work, while others become
professors or associate professors in universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Chen Feng, who returned in 1982 after completing advanced study
in Germany for more than one year, set up the Hainan Provincial
Airline Company, the first stock-sharing firm of its kind in
China. After introducing six large- and medium-sized luxury
passenger planes and opening 17 national routes, it has now become
a star-rated enterprise in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from New Zealand, Wang Sheng, who is working in
the provincial foreign affairs bureau, compiled an English-Chinese
Dictionary of Real Estate Property with his partners to help
spread the relevant expertise, which has filled a gap in this
field for China.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- UN special envoy to
Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri said here today that his previous
proposal of setting up a 28-member interim council in Kabul is
still alive.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri said, "I have not abandoned the 28-man council plan and
it too will be subject of discussion with the Afghan groups."
</P>
<P>
Mestiri announced the namelist of the 28-member council last
November, which would take power from Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
However, Taliban and the Afghan opposition alliance rejected
the scheme for its "pro-Rabbani tilt."
</P>
<P>
Mestiri said that the proposed council needed some changes and
he prepared two separate lists this time, which would come up for
discussion with Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not disclose the two namelists so far.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri arrived here Friday to launch his new peace efforts to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had had preliminary talks with the
representatives of some Afghan opposition groups in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri had to put off his planned trip to Kabul today in the
wake of heavy snowfall in the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would fly to Kabul to meet Rabbani and then
visit Kandahar to meet Taliban leadership as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Arrives in Germany for "Historical Visit" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
arrived here this morning for a 4-day state visit to Germany,
widely seen as "a historical event in the development of the
relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
President Weizman was greeted by German President Roman Herzog
at the Berlin Airport, where a German president held a welcome
ceremony to greet a foreign head of state for the first time.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Herzog, the Israeli president will head for
Bonn tomorrow for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel and President of the Federal Assembly Rita
Suessmuth.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's visit, reciprocating Herzog's trip to Israel in late
1994, will be highlighted by his speech on January 16 at the
German parliament, where only three foreign heads of state, namely
former U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and former
French President Francois Mitterrand had the honor to make
speeches.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president will also visit the Sachsenhansen Camp,
where the Nazi troops imprisoned and killed Jews, and the site of
the Wannsee Conference, which witnessed how Nazi made the decision
to start a genocide of European Jews in January, 1942.
</P>
<P>
Weizman is the second Israeli president to visit Germany. His
predecessor Chaim Herzog visited Federal Germany in 1987. The two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1965, years after
World War Two, in which German fascists massacred millions of
Jews.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Dong Jiong of China and Susi
Susanti of Indonesia won the men's and women's singles titles with
respective final victories at the Chinese Taipei Open badminton
tournament in Taipei today.
</P>
<P>
The tournament was the sport's first grand prix event of 1996,
a year which features the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Dong, who beat hot-favored top seed, Allan Budikusuma of
Indonesia, in the semi-finals Saturday, won over Malaysia's famed
Rasid Sidek, winner of the men's doubles at the 1991 Open event,
15-11, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
A much anticipated showdown in the women's singles final did
not turn out as a less fit world number one Ye Zhaoying of China
lost in a lopsided match.
</P>
<P>
Ye's opponent, world champion Susi Susanti of Indonesia, looked
somewhat surprised to win in straight games 11-5, 11-2 in one hour
and 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, 24, lost the title to Sweden's Lim Xiao Qing at last
year's event. Lim was eliminated in earlier rounds at this year's
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Ye defeated the Indonesian three times last year, but all her
victories came out of a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
With the first game of the men's singles final going Chinese
way, Sidek, winner of the men's doubles in the 1991 Open event,
was too eager to take the second. His moves were slower than that
in the opening game and he seemed helpless in face of Dong's sharp
shots and tricky drops.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Denmark's Rickee Olsen and Michael Sogaard
outplayed Chinese pair of Liu Jianjun and Gu Jun 15-3, 7-15,
15-13, for the mixed doubles title.
</P>
<P>
And Chinese Ge Fei and Gu Jun downed South Koreans S.Y. Kim and
M.H. Kim 15-8, 15-13 to take the women's doubles event.
</P>
<P>
And Indonesia's defending champions for the men's doubles, A.B.
Irianto and D. Kantono won over Sweden's P-G Jonsson and P.
Axelsson 15-6, 15-7.

<HEADLINE> One Third HK Women Suffer Urinary Incontinence: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Almost one out of three Hong
Kong women tends to suffer from incontinence of urine at an early
age, as shown in a new medical survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Hong Kong Chinese University at a
selected district in the region called Sha Tin, revealed that 32
percent of 409 women polled had "urinary incontinence". And half
caught the disease in their mid 30s and early 40s, according to
Hong Kong Standard, a local English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Incontinence is defined as leakage of urine during physical
exertion, ranging from sneezing to coughing, laughing, running,
jumping or even climbing stairs.
</P>
<P>
Married women who have given birth and obese women are prone to
the condition, according to a leading urologist in Hong Kong, who
urged women to overcome embarrassment in seeking help for the
symptom.
</P>
<P>
The Sha Tin population -- a mix of social strata, is considered
to offer a reliable reflection of the overall female population of
Hong Kong, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Township Mines Contribute More to China's Coal Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's township coal mines
last year produced 590 million tons of coal, or 46 percent of the
country's total coal output, playing an increasingly important
role in coal production.
</P>
<P>
Most of the coal they produced in 1995 was shipped to other
parts of the country, pushing forward the development of national
and regional economy, said officials from the Ministry of Coal
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Rules on the management of local coal mining industry,
published in the past five years, have putting an end to chaotic
situation of coal mining when township mines mushroomed, according
to a national working conference on township coal mines held today.
</P>
<P>
A group of new coal production bases have been formed on the
base of township mines.
</P>
<P>
The number of major coal pits with an annual output of more
than 30,000 tons has increased to more than 3,200, with a total
output of 177 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Land Leasing Markets Showing Better Performance in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Land leasing markets in this,
China's biggest metropolis, have tended to be more standardized
and orderly, because they are operating strictly in accordance
with what guides the market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a municipal source, three major changes have taken
place in the land leasing markets of the municipality, namely, the
focus of land leasing having been shifted from luxury hotels,
villas and office buildings to moderately-priced housings.
</P>
<P>
More and more land leasing has been granted to construction of
industrial projects instead of real estate projects. And the
outskirtan areas, rather than the urban districts, are now drawing
an increasing number of land developers, leasing 75 percent of the
city's total land area.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in the first three quarters of last
year, land areas that were leased for industrial projects
accounted for 70 percent of the total amount, a rise of some 40
percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 63 percent of the foreign investment went to
city's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that overseas investors had shifted the focus of
their investment from real estate to industrial projects, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials also noted that in light of the city's overall
planning, a total of 319 industrial enterprises and 455 factories
or workshops haved moved from the downtown districts to outskirtan
areas in an effort to help ease the shortage of infrastructural
facilities in the city area.
</P>
<P>
However, the reconstructing of the old city proper remains an
arduous job, and foreign investors have become well aware of the
situation, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in first nine months of last year, the
foreign investment thrown in the reconstruction projects recorded
a 6.6-fold increase over the same period of last year.

JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's former Navy
Commander Ami Ayalon was formally appointed as director of the
General Security Service (GSS) at today's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon will replace Carmi Gillon, who announced his resignation
last week. He is to officially take up the position on March 1 and
is expected to begin working soon with Gillon on the transition.
</P>
<P>
Gillon resigned last week due to the failure to protect late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who was assassinated at a pro-peace
rally in Tel Aviv on November 4, last year.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon held his first working meeting with Prime Minister
Shimon Peres Friday. He also met with Gillon on the same day to
begin coordinating the transition.
</P>
<P>
Peres today announced the appointment of Ayalon. He also
indicated that he does not believe it is possible to prevent the
publication of name of photograph of the GSS chief.
</P>
<P>
His remarks would make the local press to heave a sigh of
relief. Following Washington Post, Israeli newspapers also
published the name of Ayalon's predecessor, which is against
Israel's law. The newspapers might be punished for the
act.

<HEADLINE> Hunan to Spread Cultivation of Two-Line Hybrid Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan
Province, a major grain producer in the country, plans to spread
cultivation of two-line hybrid rice to 1.3 million ha by the end
of this century, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
The move will help increase rice output by more than 1.5
billion kg, said Pang Daomu, vice-governor of the province, after
talking with Yuan Longping, China's "Father of Hybrid Rice".
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the two-line hybrid rice strain, compared
with the three-line one, can have a higher yield and can make use
of manpower and material resources more efficient.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, local farmers planted 20,000 ha of two-line late
hybrid rice in 55 counties on a trial base. Per ha output reached
8,250 kg, 1,125 kg more than that of the three-line one.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has taken the lead in the country in rice production for
several years. Annual rice output in the province is some 26
billion kg and expected to reach 30 billion kg by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Pang noted that the spread of two-line hybrid rice strains will
play a positive role in the fulfillment of the target.

<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- August First or Chinese Army,

Chinese Army. "Liaoning put up a fairly good defensive game and
they did well in the counter-attacks."

"We are not at the same par with August First," said Liaoning
head coach Li Ge. "We did not play as well as expected, otherwise
we might have reduced the gap."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Non-State-Run Science Ventures See Strong Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- With years of brisk operation,
the non-state-run science ventures in this industrial center in
east China have reached a new stage of development, local
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the number of non-state-run science ventures
registered with the municipal committee of science and technology
was 7,684 -- 119 more than that of previous year, which have
reported 14.19 billion yuan of total income.
</P>
<P>
At present, a number of non-state-run science ventures are
adopting the shareholding system for assets expansion, forming
group companies, and applying international practices for business
management.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the per capita output value and profit
for the non-state-run enterprises have all surpassed the city's
average level.
</P>
<P>
It has become an important part of the work of local
authorities to support non-state-run enterprises. Hongkou District
has decided to increase the total income of non-state-run science
ventures to two billion yuan in 2000; Yangpu District three
billion yuan; and Changning District six billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of investment funds is another measure local
government has taken to support non-state-run science
ventures. Some districts have already set up investment
foundations or risk foundations for the ventures.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- As China's political and
cultural center, Beijing should take a correct approach and
further improve its service work, said Wei Jianxing, secretary of
the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
Wei, also member of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee,
made the remarks last Friday at a conference to sum up and report
on the work of its municipal government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Beijing must give full scope to its functions of being the
national political and cultural center, render still better
service to the Party, government and military headquarters, the
growing exchanges with other countries, the development of the
national education, science and technology, and cultural
undertakings as well as the residents' work and livelihood, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, he noted, increasing sense of service
has something to do with one's world outlook, outlook on life and
concept of value.
</P>
<P>
Wei also urged leading officials to set a good example in
improving their awareness of service work, and called on the
municipal government to actively and more frequently report their
work to the relevant central government departments and confer
with other provinces and municipalities and draw on their
experience and support.

International Judo Federation so that its Jodokas can take part in
the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Kum Yong Jin, the deputy head of the DPR

DPR Korea became the last of the 197 national Olympic
committees to accept the IOC's invitation to take part in the 1996
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But they have been excluded from most of the events including
judo as they didn't send athletes to any of the qualifying
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korean Amateur Athletic Federation had appealed that
the IOC and the relevant international sports organisations permit
the country's athletes to enter events without having come out
through the qualifying tournaments.

<HEADLINE> Educational Help Offered to Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- More and more economically
developed coastal provinces and cities are giving hands to less
developed areas in the country to support their educational
development.
</P>
<P>
The province-to-province aid alone resulted in 20 million yuan
(about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) of funds and equipment. About 85
percent of the funds and instruments have reached the aided areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the educational "aid-the-poor" program initiated by the
State Education Commission (SEC) and the State Nationalities
Affairs Commission, economically developed provinces and cities
help the poverty-stricken areas improve school conditions by
offering funds and equipment for teaching, and help these areas
train management personnel and teachers.
</P>
<P>
The program also trains specialists who are badly needed by
these poor areas and helps dropouts financially so that they can
go back to school.
</P>
<P>
Among the 311 poor counties listed by the State Council, 143
are inhabited by ethnic minorities. The SEC asked provinces and
cities in the country to give special support to the 143 counties.
</P>
<P>
Schools jointly built by coastal provinces or cities and these
poor counties have helped more children of ethnic minorities go to
school.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen of south China's Guangdong Province has built a
computer room for a middle school and a language lab for a primary
school respectively in Kashi of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Normal University and Zhangzhou Teachers' College in
east China's Fujian Province have trained 18 teachers of computer
science, mathematics, physics and Chinese language for schools in
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
With profits from the agricultural bases and factories which
were established with the help of Pinggu County of Beijing, school
conditions in Ehketuo Front Banner (an administrative division
equivalent to a county) in north Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
have been improved much.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A new study on Hong Kong's
air quality warns local residents that dense cancer-causing
particles could threaten their health in every breath taken in.
</P>
<P>
The first chemical analysis of air around the territory shows
that the level of fatal particles that can cause cancer,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), are six times higher than
in Los Angeles, a city suffering from severe air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Standard, a local English newspaper reported it took
researchers of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
three years to complete the study collecting air samples on
quartz-fiber filters from six locations in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Diesel exhaust is the main source of PAHs, and traffic emission
adds the largest amount of man-made pollutants to aerosols in the
six selected spots, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
Half a million cars dump 6,000 tons of aerosols into the
atmosphere each year, according to the figures released by the
Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that the situation is not going to change until
these emissions are reduced.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Anti-US Budget Serves Defensive Purposes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said here today that it is only of defensive
purpose for Iran to earmark 25 billion rials (about 14.28 million
U.S. dollars) as a tit-for-tat measure to fight back the
U.S. covert-action against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The budget endorsed by the Iranian Parliament is to thwart the
plots and conspiracies by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) and other organization which are related to the U.S.,
Velayati said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite a defensive measure which has been taken by the
Parliament. It is quite defensive, not offensive," the Iranian
foreign minister told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati declined to say when Iran will lodge a
lawsuit against the United States in the International Court of
Justice in Hague.
</P>
<P>
Iran has claimed that it will lodge a protest with the United
Nations and the International Court of Justice if Washington does
not rescind the U.S. congressional act against the Islamic
republic.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri announced
last week that a special budget of 25 billion rials has been
allocated for the next fiscal year (starting on March 21) as a
counter measure against the recent U.S. decision to sanction 20
million dollars for sabotage against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran will spend part of the 25 billion rials
special budget for the lawsuit against Washington in the
international court.
</P>
<P>
The special fund will be distributed to the Foreign Ministry,
Information Ministry and propagation organizations such as the
Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Tehran would still consider normalizing relations with
Washington, Velayati said Iran will consider it a sign of
goodwill on the part of the United States if Iran's frozen assets
abroad are returned.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iran's position that the affairs of the countries
in the region have to be settled by the regional nations
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The security is not something that can be exported. The
Americans, who are in another part of the world, cannot bring
security to the people in the region," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Eating Less Could Extend Life, British Scientists Find </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Eating less could extend human
life by as much as 50 percent to 140 years or more, according to
British scientists.
</P>
<P>
An international trial is to be launched later this year, the
Sunday Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Biologists found that when the weight of mice is cut, they live
longer and their health improves.
</P>
<P>
Brian Merry of the Institute of Human Aging at the University
of Liverpool, who is conducting research with scientists at the
University of Sheffield in Britain, said he had extended lives of
mice in laboratory by as much as 42 percent through restricting
their feeding.
</P>
<P>
Mice in the experiments have been deprived of as much as 70
percent of their normal calorie intake. But what they do eat is
highly nutritious and they do not suffer from starvation.
</P>
<P>
The mice are more energetic and more youthful, show better
mental capacity and are less prone to cancer and other diseases
than others allowed to eat freely.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope to discover drugs that would allow people to
enjoy the benefits of caloric restriction without cutting food
intake.

<HEADLINE> Iran Makes First Official Criticism of Afghan Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- In a rare public criticism of
Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
today lashed out at the Afghan group for trying to force themselves
upon the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
Velayati told a press conference that as a neighboring country,
Iran could not accept the current situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Taliban used to say that they were looking for peaceful
solutions to the Afghan problem, but they started engaging
(itself) in military action and fratricide," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian press has consistently attacked Taliban as a Pakistani-
and Saudi-backed force trying to topple the Kabul government.
</P>
<P>
But this was the first time a high-ranking Iranian official
openly criticized the Afghan militia group.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the latest talks between the
Tehran and Islamabad have helped ease the tension between Iran
and Pakistan over Pakistan's alleged support for Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The tensions prompted a trip by Pakistani Premier Benazir
Bhutto to Tehran in November, when she held talks behind closed
doors with Iran's President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report, at least 15 civilians were
injured in a shelling of the Afghan capital by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Kabul's Security Committee reported Saturday night that the
Taliban fired 15 long-range missiles in 24 hours, destroying two
houses and wounding 15 civilians, mostly women and children.
</P>
<P>
Kabul has been the target of the Taliban's long-range
artillery since October last year.

<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted by
the Ministry of Machinery Industry shows that essential conditions
are now available for farmers in some affluent rural areas to
purchase motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the annual per-capita net income for China's one

provinces, the figure was as high as 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of well-to-do rural families aspire to buy motor

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Tightens Price Monitoring (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the
implementation of the expanded value-added tax (EVAT), the
Philippine government has tightened price monitoring, especially
in markets, retail outlets, restaurants and hotels.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos today ordered a nationwide clampdown on
market vendors, retailers, restaurants and hotel unduly jacking up
the prices of goods and services under the guise of the EVAT.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the people to report immediately to concerned
agencies those committing price violations and imposing additional
taxes through the EVAT.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos warned business establishments against imposing
additional charges and fees on the pretext of implementing the new
tax law and directed various governments agencies to take
necessary actions to put an end to such practices.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Metro Manila Development Authority, the
Department of Finance and the Department of Trade and Industry
forged an agreement to monitor the prices of basic goods in the
aftermath of violations of price laws.
</P>
<P>
The price act imposes severe penalties on violators. For
illegal acts on price manipulation, the penalty is imprisonment of
five to 15 years and fine of 5,000 pesos (200 US dollars) to two
million pesos (80,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
For violation of the price ceiling, the penalty is imprisonment
of one to 10 years or fine of 5,000 pesos (200 dollars) to one
million pesos (40,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, administrative cases against price law violators may
lead to a fine of 1,000 pesos (40 dollars) to one million pesos
(40,000 dollars) and the imposing sanctions such as temporary
closure, reprimand, censure and suspension, revocation or
cancellation of permit or license.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien flew into Islamabad from India today with a 170-member
large delegation of officials and business representatives of big
companies to explore market in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by about 150 business representatives of 141
companies, seven provincial premiers, two central ministers and
several senior officials, Chretien's visit to his four-nation trip
including Indonesia and Malaysia reflects Canada's new aggressive
policy to get its share in the South and South-East Asian
countries in terms of trade and investment, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
As the first Canadian Prime Minister to visit Pakistan since
1971, Chretien will hold talks with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
and call on President Farooq Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Several agreements on cooperation in energy, transport and
communications sectors are expected to be signed between the two
countries during Chretien's two-day official visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian delegation will attend an exhibition of Pakistani
products specially organized by the Export Promotion Bureau of
Pakistan for the visit.
</P>
<P>
A one-day Pak-Canada investment conference, to be attended by
Pakistan Commerce Minister Ahmed Mukhtar and his Canadian
counterpart Roy MacLaren, will be held here Monday to explore the
possibilities of Canadian investment in education, environment,
agriculture, finance, energy, and telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's mission, named "Canada Team," is the largest foreign
business delegation visiting Pakistan in recent years.
</P>
<P>
His visit would be multi-faceted one aiming at strengthening
bilateral economic and commercial relations, Canadian High
Commissioner Marie-Andree said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will look into establishing linkages of all
kinds, Marie-Andree added.
</P>
<P>
The volume of bilateral trade between Pakistan and Canada
reached 260 million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, Canadian companies have concluded sales
worth more than 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canada's investment in Pakistan increased from virtually zero
in 1993 to an estimated 10 million dollars now.
</P>
<P>
Major Canadian exports to Pakistan include coal, wheat, peas,
pulp and paper, power and energy equipment, railway spare parts
and plastics.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Pakistan include cotton, textiles and leather
goods.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which joined the Aid-to-Pakistan Consortium in 1959,
has provided economic assistance to Pakistan worth 1.27 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli-Syrian Talks Slowly Move Forward (by Xie Dongfeng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The peace process between
Israel and Syria seems to be slowly moving forward following
another successful shuttle mission by U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who started his mission in Israel last Wednesday,
announced here last night that "very good progress" has been
achieved during his meetings with Israeli and Syrian leaders over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference along with Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres, Christopher said that the next round of the
Israel-Syria peace talks will be held on January 24 in Wye
Plantation in Maryland, the United States, and Syria has agreed to
broaden the scope of talks by adding a senior military officer.
</P>
<P>
He added that Syria has also agreed to discuss economic issues
with Israel in the upcoming negotiations although it would not
send economic experts to the talks as Israel had expected.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, head of the Planning Branch of the
Israeli army, Uzi Dayan, would join the Israeli negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
The top U.S. diplomat said that the challenges cannot be
minimized, but said he was more convinced than before that Peres
and Syrian resident Hafez Al-Assad are determined to do the hard
work necessary to achieve a comprehensive peace before the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic and hopeful," Christopher said, noting that
Israel and Syria have reached "a more meaningful dialogue."
Meanwhile, he promised that the U.S. "would be there at key
points ... to help."
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Israeli leaders have begun to describe
Syria as a peace partner, although they are still uncertain
whether it will be a substantial partner.
</P>
<P>
"The visit (of Christopher) moved things ahead and things are
moving. It's very important progress," Peres said last night.
</P>
<P>
"We have a partner for peace talks," he said, "But there is a
long list of weighty issues" still to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Peres also said that for the first time, there is a chance to
discuss normalization with the Syrians and to raise the
possibility of a comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "there is a change for the better"
although he stressed that not all the outstanding issues have
been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Following a half-year suspension, Israeli and Syrian negotiators
resumed their discussion in Maryland on December 27 and reconvened
on January 3. No major breakthrough were made during the talks,
but both sides said a "very positive" atmosphere prevailed.
</P>
<P>
The tone in Syria in recent months has changed. Syria still
demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, but for
the first time it has praised Peres for his willingness to make
peace. Earlier this month, Syrian press also said that 1996 should
be "the year of peace with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, words do not represent deeds. both sides have
not yet started discussions on vital issues such as the border,
security arrangements, water sources and a timetable for peace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said last Thursday after
meeting with Christopher that "it is too early to know whether we
have a substantial partner with the Syrians."
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait and see what will happen at the next round of
talks at Wye Plantation and when Christopher perhaps returns here
after that," said Barak. Christopher said last night that he will
be back to the region on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said last week that
it is doubtful that an agreement can be reached with Syria before
the Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections, scheduled for
October 29, because of the large number of unresolved complicated
issues.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent gesture to urge the Syrians to speed up the
talks, Israeli Labor Party Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli said
that early elections would be inevitable if there was no tangible
progress in the talks with Syria very soon.
</P>
<P>
"If we see that the negotiations with the Syrians do not soon
lead us anywhere, then early elections are a must," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January (Xinhua) -- Juan Martin Coggi of Argentina
took away the World Boxing Association (WBA) junior welterweight
title from American Frankie Randall Saturday in spite of his
failure to continue after the accidental head butt.
</P>
<P>
Coggi, floored at 1:15 of the fifth round, was on the canvas
for nearly five minutes before being carried out of the Miami
Jai-Alai Fronton to a nearby hospital for tests, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
Both knocked heads each other in the middle of the ring, the
Argentine staggered back to his corner, then sank to his knees.
</P>
<P>
From his knees, Coggi fell on his back and was attended by
ringisde doctors before being lifted out by a stretcher.

In other fights, Carlos Murillo of Panama outpointed Hi-Yong
Choi of South Korea in a bruising 12-round bout to take the WBA
junior flyweight championship.
</P>

HEFEI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of Hong Kong civil

in east China's Anhui province, as a gift of Hong Kong's return to
the motherland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This is the first primary school funded by HK civil servants in
the hinterland, which will have a floor space of 800 square meters.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australia Outlines Trade Outlook To 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Government
released a trade statement today, painting a rosy picture for its
trade outlook to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released by Trade Minister Bob McMullan,
stresses not only the importance of positive trade prospects to
Australia's sustained economic growth, but also the significance
to Australia of the East Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Describing the trade outlook for Australia as "very promising,"
McMullan said that "Australia has stepped onto a new and higher
growth path for exports" since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The export growth rate, as a share of GDP (gross domestic
product), has been approximately double that achieved in the 1970s
and 1980s," he said.
</P>
<P>
McMullan forecast that Australia's exports, as a share of GDP,
would be 23 percent in the year 2000-01 as compared with some 19
percent in the 1994-95 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Australia would also witness substantial increases in exports
of elaborately transformed manufactures (ETMs) and services by the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2000-01, these categories are projected to total
around half of total export income compared with 41 percent in
1994-95," McMullan said.
</P>
<P>
He expected that higher exports growth would offer strong
prospects for a sustained trade surplus by 1997-98 even if imports
continued to grow at a pace of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
McMullan believed that the improvement in the trade balance
outlook would contribute to reducing the red in the current
account balance sheet over the medium term and increasing the
speed limit for sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the improved exports performance over the
past decade represented "a fundamental contribution towards
achieving the Government's goal of reducing unemployment to five
percent of the labor force by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Australia emphasized again the East Asian
region as a vital market for its exports, which account for 55
percent of its total exports of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
McMullan pointed out that with the sustained economic growth in
Asia, "robust growth in Australia's exports of ETMs and services
to the region is likely to continue well into the next decade."
</P>
<P>
He projected that Australia's services and ETMs exports to Asia
would be worth around 33 billion Australian dollars (24.42 billion
U.S. dollars) by the end of the century, or almost half of
Australia's total exports to Asia.
</P>
<P>
At present, Australia earns 15 billion Australian dollars (11.1
billion U.S. dollars) from its exports of services and ETMs to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of East Asia to Australia's trade cannot be
overstated and is set to strengthen further with the long term
commitment to further intra-regional cooperation in the context of
APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation)," McMullan stressed.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Fishing Nets Impounded In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 14 (Xinhua)-- The Uganda Anti Smuggling Unit
(ASU) has impounded 180 fishing nets belonging to five Kenyans on
Sanga Islands on Lake Victoria, according to an official
announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
The nets were impounded because netting of immature fish has
been banned by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal
industry and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that another half tonne of immature Nile
Perch were also seized during an operation carried out on Sanga,
Bugiri and Nsanzi of Lake Victoria on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said the catching of immature fish denies the nation of its
revenue and impairs its economic growth. The ASU is taking
efforts to prevent the devastation of the fish stoks.
</P>
<P>
There are about 600 illegal nets In Uganda's Lake Victoria
waters, about 300 on Lake Albert and about 2,000 on Lake
Wyoga,it said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one beach siene net causes a loss of
30,000 U.S. Dollars and 30 percent of Uganda's population who eat
fish are deprived of it since most of the fish caught is exported
mainly to Zaire and Kenya.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Stringent Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China will continue with its
relatively stringent monetary policy as the government takes
inflation control as a primary task in this year's macro financial
control.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC),
told a national finance conference today that the government will
improve the means of financial control and strengthen supervision
of the financial sectors to minimize financial risks.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank will reform its interest
adminstration system, which will be oriented to the market. The
reform of credit cooperatives in the rural areas and the
state-owned commercial banks will also top the agenda in 1996, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government will support the reform and development of
state-owned enterprises, the central bank governor noted. Dai
also stressed the importance of the banks' internal management
with a view to improving capital flow, enhancing safety rate and
ensuring more profits.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he said, China has achieved fruitful results in
carring out the stringent monetary policy as capital circulation
saw marked decrease and increase rate for capital supply witnessed
steady fall. Also, the retail sales prices for social commodities
grew by only 14.8 percent, within the goal set in the beginning of
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, China's total bank savings grew by
32 percent last year and the total loans by the state-owned banks
increased by 638.7 billion yuan over that of the previous year. A
total of 37.1 billion yuan were added in loans to agriculture and
township enterprises by the Agriculture Bank of China as well as
credit cooperatives last year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Restrict Firecrackers During Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolis, will strictly control the selling or setting off of
firecrackers and fireworks during the Spring Festival season
(February 19--24).
</P>
<P>
Chinese traditionally set off firecrackers to celebrate the
festival, which usually pollutes the urban environment and
frequently lead to fires and human injuries.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has been trying to limit firecrackers
in recent years, and more effective measures will be taken this
year.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of firecrackers and fireworks purchased this
year will be less than that of last year and the ratio of
fireworks to firecrackers will be adjusted to two to one.
</P>
<P>
A total of less than 1,000 shops will be allowed to sell such
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The time span when firecrackers and fireworks are permitted to
be set off is shortened to between 7.00 PM and 1.00 AM each day of
February 18-24. At the same time, no-setting off areas, marked
with clear signs, are enlarged in downtown.

<HEADLINE> More Terra-cotta Warriors Unearthed in Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 more terra-cotta
warriors and traces of construction of the pit for the terra-cotta
figures and human activities in later dynasties have been found in
the world-renowned Museum of Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses.
</P>
<P>
The museum, located at the foot of the Lishan Mountain some 37
km from this capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, was
built over three pits of the terra-cotta warriors and horses
serving as guards in the nether world for the first emperor of the
Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC).
</P>
<P>
The No.1 and No.3 pits had been excavated and opened in 1979
and 1989, separately.
</P>
<P>
The No.2 pit, with complete arms of services and thought to be
the best of the three, however, had not been dug until 1994 and
has been shown to the public while being dug.
</P>
<P>
So far the Chinese archaeologists have opened shed beams over
the pit, which occupied an area of some 6,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zhongyi, leader of the archaeological team in charge of
the excavation, said that the structure of the pit, including shed
beams, pillars, passages and door way, has been preserved intact
for it suffered little damage in the fire set by peasant armies in
the late Qin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Today, even rut, foot prints of the Qin laborers, and traces of
digging with iron tools and ditch made by rain falls can be found
in the pit.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 terra-cotta warriors and horses have been
unearthed from the northern and southern parts of the pit. Some
are warriors on horseback and shooting warriors rarely seen in the
other two pits.
</P>
<P>
More eye-catching is a carriage with four warriors, the first
of its kind found in the museum, which was broken into pieces by
shed beams collapsed in the late Qin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
It is really fortunate that the carriage has been kept till
today for archaeologists found an 80-cm round hole considered to
be dug during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), which led to the
underhidden carriage.
</P>
<P>
The experts infer that the digger, most probably tomb robbers,
was only interested in gold and silver, not terra-cotta figures.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists also found a Eastern Han tomb above a group
of terra-cotta warriors and horses and a 11-m-deep well dating
from the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), which contains pottery
fragments piling up for several metres.
</P>
<P>
Although people had come across soul guards of the first
emperor of Qin, the terra-cotta figures had never attracted the
world's attention until 1974, when a local farmer dug a well and
found fragments of terra-cotta warriors.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Lorin Maazel, one of the
world's top ten conductors, left here today after sending his new
year greetings to music lovers of this largest metropolis of China.
</P>
<P>
Maazel opened the concert yesterday evening, the last on his
China tour, with a prelude by a modern Chinese composer, which was
followed by pieces of Richard Strauss and John Strauss and
Symphony No.7 of Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
As with his two concerts in the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing, Maazel won thunderous applauses from an highly
enthusiastic and responsive audience.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the press, the maestro voiced satisfaction
over the success of the previous two concerts, saying it was
unexpected to have the chance to perform at the Great Hall of the
People for two evenings in a run.
</P>
<P>
However, he found it a pity that after his three-day China
visit, he could still speak no more than the three Chinese words
Xin Nian Hao (Happy New Year), the new year greeting he uttered at
the Vienna New Year Concert.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps U.S. Over Military Activities With South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), in a press communique published here
today, has condemned a series of U.S. military activities jointly
conducted with South Korea over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine in Jinhae,
South Korea on January 10 and the subsequent anti-submarine joint
exercises involving South Korean troops constituted open military
provocations directed against the DPRK, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier, some Americans had spread the allegation of 'North
Korea Threat' and urged Japan to get involved in an
anti-DPRK 'cooperation system,'" said the communique, which was
issued by the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful
Reunification of the Fatherland on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. decided
to send a brigade of reinforcements to the South and trained South
Korean soldiers on the U.S. soil, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite its professed commitment to "improving U.S.-DPRK ties"
and "easing tensions" on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. is hostile
to Pyongyang at heart and attempts to carry out its military
strategy in East Asia at the cost of the DPRK, said the
communique.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Rule of Law for Religious Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China will beef up its rule of
law in handling religious affairs, a senior government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Rule of law over all social affairs is one of the major
characteristics for a modern society, and religious affairs are no
exception," said Ismail Amat, state councillor, who is in charge
of religious and nationalities affairs.
</P>
<P>
The state councillor was addressing a national conference on
religious work today.
</P>
<P>
he went on to explain that rule of law over religious affairs
means that the legitimate rights of religious groups, religious
sites and the religious people are protected.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, those disregarding religious rituals and harming
the feeling of religious people should be punished according to
law.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, those who make use of religion to
interfere with administrative, judicial, martial, educational and
other social affairs, especially those who take advantage of
religious reasons to split the country, must be severely cracked
down upon according to law.
</P>
<P>
He said the country will build up a relatively complete set of
legal framework and supervision mechanism over religious work in
the next five to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
China has two provisions issued by the State Council in 1994 on
the management over sites for religious activities and on foreign
nationals' religious activities in China.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat listed the registration of religious sites, as
stipulated in the first provision, as on top of the three major
tasks for religious work this year.
</P>
<P>
The other two tasks are of efforts to deal with difficult
religious problems of public concern and to cultivate contingents
of young patriotic religious preachers.
</P>
<P>
He described the general religious situation as stable in
China, despite some new problems emerging against the backdrop of
reform and opening-up which he said should be dealt with through
careful studies.
</P>
<P>
He said that religious work should be oriented to serve the
country's economic and social development goals set for the next
five and 15 years. Towards that, he called on the localities to
list religious work in their economic and social development plans.
</P>
<P>
In handling religious affairs, the government should also seek
help from the religious masses and rely on the patriotic religious
personages, the official stressed.

<HEADLINE> New Find Near Niya Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Red pottery, comb-like stone
knife, bronze knife and stone mill have been found between 15 and
43 kilometers to the north of the Niya Ruins in the world's second
largest moving sand waste.
</P>
<P>
The Niya Ruins, a city-state in the Western Regions which
flourished during the 1st-4th centuries, was buried in Taklimakan
Desert in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region some
1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It attracted limelight in the early 1900s when a British
explorer found it and took from it a great number of wooden slips
bearing Kharoshthi writings and wooden sculptures in Greek style.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, archaeological research had never
outstepped the British explorer's footprints -- some 25 km in the
north-south direction and five km in the west-east direction, with
a Buddhist pagoda as the center.
</P>
<P>
The latest find, however, was for the first time made at the
end of the Niya River bed or outside the Niya site.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the newly found relics, dating
much earlier than the Niya Ruins, are unique and different from
those excavated in the Niya Ruins.
</P>
<P>
They say that the find will contribute to the study of the
history of the Niya River Valley and the development of ancient
Niya.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
will launch a major offensive against the rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the east within the next three
weeks, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
The military this week started moving troops in the Eastern
Province for the impending offensive as the LTTE stepped up its
recruitment drive in the province.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, in a bid to stall the government's military
offensive, is continuing its attacks in the province, disrupting
power supplies, blasting transformers and causing damage to public
installations. As a result, a large number of villages in the
province are now without power supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LTTE's "Pistol Gang" has been active in the
province. According to reports, a dozen of local Tamil politicians
who were supporting the government's peace efforts were gunned
down by the Gang.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told
parliament last week that the government was determined to clear
the Eastern Province of the LTTE troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's main forces have moved into the Northcentral
Province and the Eastern Province after the fall of Jaffna City on
December 5.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerns Over ASEAN Nuclear-Free Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has expressed
concerns that the Southeast Asian nuclear-free zone might affect
the freedom of navigation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific
Affairs Winston Lord said the principal concern is the application
of the nuclear weapon-free zone to the continental shelf and the
exclusive economic zones, which is linked with assuring the
freedom of navigation.
</P>
<P>
These issues need to be addressed before the U.S. can sign the
treaty, Lord, who is on a two-week Asia-Pacific tour, told
reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asia nuclear weapon-free zone was launched at the
fifth ASEAN summit held in Bangkok last month and signed by 10
Southeast Asian countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries hope nuclear powers would accede to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Kasem Kasemsri told reporters after
meeting with Lord Saturday that his country would press the
U.S. to agree to the treaty's protocol, saying, "There is
definitely a way for the U.S. and us to work it out."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Sets Investment Target for Next Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is seeking 42 billion
U.S. dollars of investment in the next five years to maintain a
yearly growth rate of between 9 and 10 percent, according to the
Ministry of Planning and Investment.
</P>
<P>
But the latest issue of "the Vietnam Investment Review" said
how to raise such a massive amount of money is still a question.
</P>
<P>
The English language weekly newspaper said that about 21.5
billion U.S. dollars can be raised at home, with the rest coming
from foreign direct investment and official development assistance
(oda).
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign paid-up capital in
Vietnam in the last five years amounted to about 6 billion
U.S. dollars, about one-third of the total registered capital.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, more than 2.4 billion dollars were actually
invested, an increase of about 70 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, oda funds have totaled 6 billion
dollars. The Vietnamese government believed that it is realistic
for the country to absorb 7.5 billion dollars oda funds over the
next five years.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Newspaper Hails Than Shwe's China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Leader Senior Gen. Than
Shwe's week-long official friendly visit to china has served more
than just a strengthening of relations between the two countries,
the official newspaper New Light of Myanmar said in an editorial
today.
</P>
<P>
The editorial described the Myanmar leader's visit as a highly
successful one right at the beginning of 1996 auguring well for
further development of bilateral relations and for peace,
stability and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it is significant that the Myanmar leader
exchanged views with President Jiang zemin and other Chinese
leaders on matters of mutual concern, including regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar leader returned home yesterday after concluding his
visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that during Senior Gen. Than Shwe's visit,
the Myanmar side reiterated once again that Myanmar would firmly
follow the "one China" policy which regards Taiwan as an
inalienable part of China. The Myanmar side also reiterated that
it would not establish official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also applauded the signing of agreements on
technical and cultural cooperation, as well as a framework
agreement on interest-subsidized credit.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 has brought Myanmar and China to the threshold of
a new era of cooperation, and the Myanmar leader's visit signified
more than strengthened relations, the editorial added.

MEXICO CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Julio Cesar Chavez of
Mexico will probably not defend his World Boxing Council super
lightweight crown in the bout against American Scott Walker early
next month because of his failure to make weight.
</P>
<P>
According to the fighter's promoter Top Rank Boxing, Chavez was
not in good enough shape to make the 63.5-kg (140-pound) weight
limit to defend his title on February 9, said WBC on Saturday in a
statement from its Mexico City headquaters.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, the fight will probably not be a title
fight," the WBC added.
</P>
<P>
The poor outings in his last few fights and domestic troubles
have cast a shadow over Chavez's boxing career as a holder of four
world boxing titles, the Mexican press reported.

<HEADLINE> German Ice hockey Clubs Not to Limit EU Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign players in
German ice hockey clubs will not be limited to three, German
Ice hockey League (DEL) officials said in Berlin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This meant clubs could virtually field as many players from
European Community (EU) members as they like.
</P>
<P>
The league officials voted 14 against 3 for the lifting of the
limits, but all clubs would have a deadline of January 31 to
recruit EU players to boost their squads.
</P>
<P>
An European Court of Justice ruling last year decided that it
is against the EU law to restrict the number of EU players,
prompting strong reaction from European sports, especially soccer.
</P>
<P>
German soccer clubs agreed last week to retain the three
foreigners limitation until the end of the season, but meanwhile
maintained that those who failed to abide would not be punished.

<HEADLINE> Investment Inflow Still Looks Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Capital inflow remained strong
last year with foreign money invested throughout the year topping
an estimated 40 billion US dollars, today's "Business Weekly"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics from the State Planning Commission, an
official with the commission's Macro-Economic Research Academy,
said that committed foreign investment in the first half of last
year alone reached 110 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
But funding from abroad was more tempered than in 1994 and was
estimated at little more than 50 billion US dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
A relatively stable renminbi, China's currency, largely
contributed to slow investment of a speculative nature, while a
ballooning foreign reserve enabled China to seek less overseas
borrowing, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, an exodus of domestic funding had
remained in place since 1994. He estimated that the outflow of
domestic funds could top 35 billion US dollars in 1995, more than
double the year's net inflow of foreign money under the capital
account, which was down by 50 percent from the previous year to
stand at around 150 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the non-trade part of China's international balance was
projected at 12.5 billion US dollars and almost all economic
forecasters believed there would be a cumulative foreign exchange
reserve of no less than 75 billion US dollars by the end of last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
An audacious policy overhaul in late 1995 could dampen China's
foreign funding growth this year, but the impact would be small,
he projected.
</P>
<P>
Among other incentives being phased out, foreign investors will
soon lose tariff-exempt treatment for their imports of capital
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing strategic plans by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation, he said China would like to use 20 billion
US dollars in foreign funding each year from 1996-2000.

the required credentials can not hold the positions, or should be
replaced by the qualified people.
</P>
<P>
Also, the system of receiving vocational training and
credential will be practiced in other key positions of the
publishing trade in five years or more.

<HEADLINE> Single-armed Shop Owner Helps Handicapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A disabled person finally got
his daily necessities -- five stick rubber caps -- from a small
shop in Suzhou city, a small industrial city in east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere else could I find those things," he said after a
three-hour journey by train to the city, where the handicapped
makes up five percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
He uttered words of appreciation to the shop owner Jin
Yongxing, a handicapped himself, who is an enthusiast for social
welfare activities for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
After undergoing the much inconvenience since he lost his left
arm in an accident eight years ago, Jin decided to open a shop to
help people trapped in similar conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jin's non-profit shop, offering more than 40 kinds of goods and
special services for the handicapped, has recieved donations from
local enterprises as well as help from voluntary workers.
</P>
<P>
What encouraged Jin most was a letter written in braille by
students of a school for the blind and deaf-mute. "All of us
blind students want to voice deep gratitude for your sending us
the walking sticks and special writing materials, which are
extremely important to us," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Jin was invited to be an after-school counsellor for the
special school.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I can still lend a helping hand to the disabled," Jin
said, waving his single arm. "I shall do as much as I can."
</P>
<P>
Next, he plans to open a hot-line to deal with problems
encountered by the handicapped over telephone.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Sets Deadline for Release of Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia's security chief today
told Chechen rebels to unconditionally release about 100 hostages
they are holding before 10 a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Barsukov, head of the Federal Security Services, said
that he will take swift action if a single hostage is killed.
</P>
<P>
Barsukov, who was assigned by President Boris Yeltsin to end
the hostage crisis, hoped that the rebels led by Salman Raduyev
will "make a correct decision to guarantee the lives of peaceful
population."
</P>
<P>
He also promised the Chechen fighters safe passage back to
nearby Chechnya if they free all the hostages and give up their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen separatists raided the city of Kizlyar in the
Daghestani Republic and captured over 3,000 hostages early
Tuesday. Most of the hostages were released after the Russian
authorities agreed to give them a safe return to Chechnya
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
But the convoy carrying the terrorists and their human shields
of an estimated 100 were held up at Pervomaiskoye, a village near
the Daghestani-Chechen border, because a bridge on the road into
Chechnya was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
There has been no substantive progress at the negotiations
between Moscow and the terrorists, who wanted to change the route
back to their mountain bases in Chechnya.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 13 (xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed today that the United States arbitrate the dispute
between Muslims and Croats in Mostar, a Croatian official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in Zagreb this evening, made the proposal
during his talks with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
Croatian presidential spokeswoman Natasa Rajakovic said that
the two presidents discussed the tension between the Muslims and
Croats in Mostar, the implementation of the agreement on Eastern
Slavonia, and the U.S.-Croatian relations.
</P>
<P>
According to Rajakovic, Clinton said during the talks that the
Muslim-Croat federation is a cornerstone of the entire peace
process in Bosnia and proposed that U.S. arbitrate the dispute
between the two ethnic groups in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman was said to have accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also gave full support to Croatia's demand for a speedy
implementation of the agreement on Eastern Slavonia, which Tudjman
described as the most important issue for his country at the
moment, according to the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the preparations for a treaty on
avoiding double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who visited U.S. troops in Bosnia earlier today, flew

<HEADLINE> World Bank Official on China's Remarkable Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior World Bank official
said that China achieved "remarkable" economic success in 1995
with reasonable growth rate, according to today's "Business
Weekly".
</P>
<P>
World Bank's China mission chief Pieter Bottelier told Business
Weekly last week that the main objectives of the macro-control
programme launched in mid-1993 were realized in 1995. Economic
growth has cooled down without generating new problems.
</P>
<P>
Financial discipline has improved while inflation has stepped
down from 21.7 per cent in 1994 to last year's 14.8 per cent, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Bottelier as saying that if no tremendous
changes happen in government policy, the inflation for 1996 may
stay at 10 per cent.
</P>
<P>
However, he listed maintaining macro-economic stability as a
top challenge for the Chinese government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bottelier said it is important for China to maintain monetary
discipline, adding that increased inter-company debts are not a
result of monetary policy but the result of a financial system
which is too relaxed to recall loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tight monetary policy will put more pressure on
enterprises to reform and improve their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the importance of accelerating enterprise reform
in 1996, saying "the deficit enterprises should be closed, sold or
auctioned to avoid further losses."

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The village and township
enterprises in East China's Jiangsu Province made a total revenue
of 500 billion yuan last year, 30 percent up over 1994, thus
taking up two-third of the provincial industrial output.
</P>
<P>
The province's 12 million industrial enterprises in the rural
areas saw their total industrial output value and pre-tax profit
increase both by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rural industry's export and utilization of foreign capital
accounted for more than three-fifths of the province's total
respectively while the taxes it turned in accounted for half of
the province's budget income last year.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that foreign trade and utilization
of foreign capital have greatly boosted the province's rural
industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the rural sector's income from export took up 28
percent of their revenues, three percentage points higher than
1994.
</P>
<P>
Also, the rural sector set up 1,100 joint enterprises with
foreign investors, using 1.63 billion US dollars of contracted
investment, last year.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that foreign investment accounted for
one-fourth of such enterprises' investment in 1995.

<HEADLINE> London's Postal Workers on Industrial Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Postal workers across London
have walked out as three-day unofficial dispute spread throughout
the capital of the UK.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Morning Star newpaper today, four
out of five sorting offices in London are closed with a total of
8,000 staff involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Postal workers have been on strike over the general post
office, the Royal Mail's use of casual staff for clearing
backlogs.
</P>
<P>
The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents postal
workers, had agreed with the Royal Mail to use only five casual
workers in a post office in north London. Now the striking workers
accused the Royal Mail of "flooding the post office with 35
temporary staff".
</P>
<P>
A Royal Mail spokeswoman said that it was a management issue
that how many casual workers were used, and such a matter was not
up for debate.
</P>
<P>
And workers had been hoping to benefit from their unofficial
strike by earning overtime pay while clearing their own backlogs,
and this was not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
But postal workers accused the Royal Mail of engineering
unneccessary disputes and maintained that they Royal Mail was
trying to push the CWU into a difficult position and then try and
break it financially using anti-union laws.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Mail has advised companies with large postal
contracts to mail their post from outside London.
</P>
<P>
While the CWU said it was pursuing an acceptable solution while
staying inside the law by advising workers to return to their
jobs.

<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Arthur Scargill, President of
Britain's National Union of Mineworkers on Saturday announced his
breakaway from the Opposition Labor and set up a new Socialist
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The miners' leader said that the Socialist Labor Party would be
inaugurated on May 1, the international labor day.
</P>
<P>
Scargill accused Labor leader Tony Blair of betraying socialism
and pledged that his Socialist Labor Party would stand for "a
return to socialism abandoned by the Labor Party".
</P>
<P>
He said that his party would stand for free health care,
education without private schools and a society where unemployment
is banished and homelessness ended.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to challenge Labor candidates at the next general
election due to be held on May 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A Labor spokesman said Arthur Scargill clearly didn't feel at
home in the modern Labor Party and was perfectly entitled to do
what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
Labor has changed dramatically, while Scargill was locked in
the politics of many years ago, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Over 3 Million Foreign Tourists Visit Egypt in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3.13 million foreign
tourists visited Egypt in 1995, recording an increase of 21.4
percent over that of the previous year, Egyptian Tourism Minister
Mamdouh el-Beltagui said today.
</P>
<P>
He added that each tourist stayed in the north African country
for more days on the average last year than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's tourism industry, the largest earner of foreign
exchange, picked up greatly in the second half of 1995 following a
slump since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The big number of tourists last year has been attributed to the
improved security situation in the country and the ambitious
tourism promotion campaign launched by the Ministry of Tourism in
international tourism markets.
</P>
<P>
Beltagui added today that Egypt will set up about 300 tourism
projects worth 13 billion Egyptian pounds (some 3.8 billion
U.S. dollars) to attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is especially famous for its monuments left over from the
Pharaonic era in southern Egypt, mild weather in winter, and
unpolluted sand beaches along the Red Sea coast.
