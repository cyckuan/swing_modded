<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Darkness gathers on a winter evening as the choir
of Westminster Abbey files in for the daily service of Evensong.
</P>
<P>
   The service has changed little since Thomas Cranmer's first Book
of Common Prayer was published 451 years ago. The anthem, Thomas
Tallis' ''Videte miraculum,'' is another luminous survivor of that
age, its cadences burnished by the echo from the Gothic vaults high
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Church of England at its most sublime -- and, one
might argue, at its most irrelevant to the daily lives of ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
   Church attendance is low and declining rapidly. And now the
church's fading influence is about to get another confirmation: a
reduction in its seats in the House of Lords. The government has
not set a date for proposing legislation, but has already endorsed
the general idea of opening up the Lords to representatives of
other denominations and faiths.
</P>
<P>
   To sit in Westminster Abbey for Evensong is to be at the
symbolic heart of the British state -- a few steps from the spot
where monarchs are crowned by the archbishops of Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Church and state are intertwined from the top of British society
-- the monarch is the supreme governor of the church -- down to 5,000
primary schools operated by the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops have sat in the House of Lords from its inception, and
have kept their places as the exclusive representatives of religion
within the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is now the only democracy that preserves this role for
the church (but then Britain is a country that decided only last
year that the Lord Chancellor didn't have to walk backward while
preceding Queen Elizabeth II to the state opening of Parliament).
</P>
<P>
   ''The retention of the Lords Spiritual in Britain is a
reflection of the measured pace of social change on this island
allowing structures to be hollowed out or left standing while the
realities of power migrate elsewhere,'' David Martin, a University
of Exeter professor, wrote in a background paper prepared for a
royal commission considering the restructuring of the House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of England now places 26 bishops in the Lords, but
the commission recently recommended that the church be reduced to
16 seats -- not all of them bishops. Ten other seats would be
allocated to other Christian denominations, and five places would
be created for representatives of non-Christian faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church of England should continue to be explicitly
represented in the second chamber, but the concept of religious
representation should be broadened to embrace other Christian
denominations, in all parts of the United Kingdom, and other faith
communities,'' said the commission, headed by Lord Wakeham, a
prominent Conservative Party politician.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Britain has become a society of multiple
beliefs, or none, was neatly expressed by Prince Charles in 1994
when he said he aspired to be a ''defender of faith'' instead of
the monarch's historic title of ''defender of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles, who is next in line to succeed his mother as monarch --
and therefore as supreme governor of the Church of England -- said
he wanted to be ''defender of the divine in existence, the pattern
of the divine which is, I think, in all of us but which, because we
are human beings, can be expressed in so many different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   England -- and Britain as a whole -- remains overwhelmingly if
unenthusiastically Christian. Half the 49 million people of England
were baptized in the Church of England (though by 1995 the rate had
slipped to only a fourth of the babies born that year).
Non-Christian faiths account for just 5 percent of Britons,
including 1.2 million Muslims, 400,000 Sikhs, 360,000 Hindus,
285,000 Jews and 25,000 Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, has spoken of
European Christian churches as ''bleeding to death.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't specifically mention the Church of England, but it has
been steadily losing popular support, with Sunday attendance
falling from 1.67 million in 1979 to 1.27 million in 1989 to
980,000 in 1998. Attendance dropped by more than 20 percent in the
1990s, which Carey had proclaimed as the ''decade of evangelism.''
</P>
<P>
   Church officials say the decline partly reflects changing
patterns of churchgoing -- more people attending once or twice a
month instead of every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And the Church of England's plight is matched by that of other
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday attendance by Roman Catholics in England fell from 2
million in 1979 to 1.2 million in 1998, while Sunday attendance at
Methodist churches fell from 621,000 to 380,000 in the same period,
according to figures published by Christian Research.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no serious discussion of ending the Church of
England's status as the officially established church.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Canon Edward Norman, chancellor of York Minster,
argues that the bishops have accepted a view of England as a
plural, multicultural society, and that ''plainly raises major
problems for the concept of establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a plural society undermines the idea of a true
faith, he said, while the Church of England has a diminishing claim
to be the faith of the majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a church ''by law established'' got a ringing
endorsement from Britain's chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, in his
testimony to the royal commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Establishment secures a central place for spirituality in the
public square. This benefits all faiths, not just Christianity. It
invests national occasions with an aura of sanctity, which is to
say, a sense of the presence and sovereignty of God,'' Sacks said.

<HEADLINE> Four Buffalo police detectives face multiple corruption chargesBy JOHN WAWROW Associated Press Writer </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- As four of his decorated narcotics
detectives were arraigned in federal court, a saddened but
emboldened Buffalo Police Commissioner Rocco Diina said there was
no place for corruption in his department.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a happy day for the Buffalo Police Department, but I
think that we have to stand strong and remind the public of the
vast, vast majority of our fine officers,'' said Diina Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the vast, vast majority of the women and men of
the Buffalo Police Department are honest, and I think anyone that
breaches the integrity of the public trust in law enforcement
unfairly throws everyone in a bad light.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's credibility was shaken when the FBI, following
an extensive eight-month investigation, announced four Buffalo
police officers were arrested and face multiple federal charges,
including conspiracy, drug trafficking and civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Darnyl Parker, John Ferby, David Rodriguez and Robert Hill -- who
all have 12 or more years of service with the police force -- are
accused of shaking down drug dealers, taking money, jewelry and
drugs for their own profit and letting the dealers go free.
</P>
<P>
   Ferby was working as a member of the Drug Enforcement
Administration at the time of his arrest, while Parker had
previously been assigned to the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   William Parker, Darnyl Parker's son, and Reno Sayles, believed
to be Darnyl Parker's cousin, also face charges following the
investigation, which was conducted by the FBI, the DEA and the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Each face sentences of up to 20 years in prison and as much as
$1 million in an array of fines.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard A. Tolbert, the FBI special-agent-in-charge of the
investigation, stressed that the charges against the officers is
not indicative of large-scale corruption within the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important for the public to understand that this
investigation is not an indictment of the Buffalo Police
Department, nor is it indicative of systemic corruption in the
department,'' Tolbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began when a confidential source, described as
a drug dealer, tipped off the FBI about Parker's alleged illegal
activities, Tolbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The source, whose gender was not identified, ''had a
relationship'' with Parker for 20 years, Tolbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert said the FBI have audio and video surveillance evidence
to back up their charges, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Videotape of the four detectives allegedly breaking into what
they believed to be a Jamaican drug dealer's apartment, which was
actually set up by the FBI. While allegedly stealing a gold watch
and a 14-karat gold diamond ring, the four failed to locate a stash
of $12,000 which the FBI hid in a plastic bag under a mattress.
</P>
<P>
   -- On a separate occasion, the four detectives allegedly took a
bag containing more than $36,000 after searching the car of an FBI
undercover agent, whom they believed to be a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Denise O'Donnell, who will oversee the prosecution
of the case, said law officials have a sworn obligation to uphold
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot ignore it, disregard it or put ourselves above it,''
O'Donnell said. ''When these abuses occur, we have a serious
obligation to investigate and prosecute those who have failed to
live up to their sworn duties as law enforcement officers.''

<HEADLINE> Judge says it is time to let treatment end for dying woman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) --Sheila Pouliot lays moaning in her hospital
bed. Her withering body is bloated from malnutrition. Her muscles
are rotting. A doctor says she is being forced to ''die by
millimeters.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time to let the 42-year-old Pouliot die without further
efforts to prolong her life, a judge has decided. But state
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer says the state considers the ruling
a sanctioning of assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Swayed by testimony and a visit to Pouliot's hospital bed,
Onondaga County Judge James Tormey on Wednesday ordered an end to
Pouliot's hydration, as recommended by the doctors treating her at
University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Tormey made a direct plea to state lawyers not to appeal his
decision and continue the two-month-old legal battle over Pouliot's
fate. Tormey even challenged Spitzer to come visit Pouliot himself
before the state proceeded with an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the judge's comments about traveling to Syracuse
were ''injudicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While we obviously feel tremendous compassion for this patient
... what the judge seeks to do is unlawful,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pouliot has been profoundly mentally and physically disabled
since she was 9 months old. Her family cared for her at home until
she was 20. She was then placed in a developmental home. Shortly
before Christmas, she was admitted to the hospital with
gastrointestinal bleeding and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Her family went to court to block University Hospital -- a state
health care institution -- from providing nutrition or any
lifesaving medical procedures to Pouliot so she could die with
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Tormey had signed an order in early January barring the hospital
from initiating lifesaving treatment, based on doctors' opinions
that death was imminent and any such intervention would serve only
to prolong Pouliot's pain.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute resulted in a compromise with the hospital being
allowed to provide hydration and nutrition through an existing
intravenous feeding line into Pouliot's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathy Faber-Langendoen testified Wednesday that the
compromise did not last long because Pouliot was unable to tolerate
the sugar nutrition mixed in with the water.
</P>
<P>
   Without any other viable way to provide her with nutrition,
Pouliot's condition has deteriorated, Faber-Langendoen said.
</P>
<P>
   Without nutrition to provide protein to make cells, Pouliot's
body began consuming the protein in her body, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her body is basically starting to devour itself,'' she said.
''This is not a normal treatment plan. This is causing great
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been using skin patches to administer pain
medication, but Pouliot's skin is deteriorating and that is
becoming difficult, Faber-Langendoen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is to me like a breathing corpse,'' Alice Blouin,
Pouliot's sister, told the court. ''She feels like one. She looks
like one. She is very difficult to watch in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This poor girl needs to finish her journey in peace,'' family
lawyer Martha Mulroy said.

<HEADLINE> Adult Charged in Mich. School Death  </HEADLINE>
By RANDI GOLDBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Prosecutors Thursday brought
an involuntary manslaughter charge against a man they believe
possessed the stolen gun allegedly used by a 6-year-old boy to kill
a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not looking for scapegoats in this case; we're looking
for justice for Kayla,'' said Genesee County Prosecutor Arthur
Busch.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said investigators believe the .32-caliber semiautomatic
gun used Tuesday to shoot 6-year-old Kayla Rolland had been left,
apparently loaded, under Jamelle James' blankets in a bedroom at
the house where the boy stayed. Investigators also found a stolen
12-gauge shotgun and drugs at the house, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   James, 19, was arraigned Thursday on the manslaughter charge,
which carries a possible 15-year prison sentence. He simply replied
''yes'' when the judge asked whether he understood the charge and
possible sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard L. Hughes set James' bond at $100,000. James made
an obscene gesture toward news photographers as he was led out of
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Jeffrey Skinner, said after the arraignment he
thought the bond ''is a little high,'' but he had no other comment.
Skinner did not return a telephone message left later at his
office.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint read in court, prosecutors alleged that James
kept the pistol loaded, had twirled it in front of the boy, failed
to keep the gun secure, and created ''an atmosphere of reckless
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge requires prosecutors to show gross negligence that
gave the boy access to the gun, Busch said. He said prosecutors
also would allege that James contributed to the delinquency of a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this prosecution can send a message to America that
those guns that you think can make you safer can make our community
more dangerous,'' Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said he doesn't have grounds to charge the boy's
uncle, Sir Marcus B. Winfrey, with involuntary manslaughter. Police
arrested Winfrey, 21, late Tuesday on unrelated charges of
receiving stolen property. James also was taken into custody on
unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   The boy himself is too young to understand what he was doing and
probably won't be charged, Busch said. Police have said the boy
told them the shooting was an accident, that he meant only to scare
the girl.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Saul Green told The Detroit News for a story in
its Friday editions that his office is looking into the possibility
of filing federal firearms charges against the boy. But he said no
decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not sure you can prove intent on the part of a
6-year-old,'' he said. Messages left at Green's office Thursday
night were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said Thursday that Green never indicated to him that he
would pursue federal charges against the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Mr. Green would discuss that sort of thing with me,''
he said. ''I don't see this as something they would pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch said the house where the boy and his 8-year-old brother
were staying with Winfrey was frequented by strangers. And the
boy's father, Dedric Owens, who is in jail, said people at the
house traded crack for guns.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his two siblings have been placed in a maternal
aunt's custody, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who is jailed on a parole violation related to 1995 drug
and burglary charges, apologized for the shooting but said neither
he nor the boy should be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I feel responsible for is not being there in
his life like I'm supposed to be like a father, every day,'' said
Owens said in an interview broadcast Thursday on ABC's ''Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers related to the custody issue, the
state's Family Independence Agency said two of the boys' classmates
told police they'd seen guns in the house where the boy had been
staying. The welfare agency also said the boy's mother, Tamarla
Owens, 29, knew marijuana was smoked daily at the house, the
documents said.
</P>
<P>
   Buell Elementary School will remain closed Friday for a third
day, Superintendent Ira Rutherford said. He did not know when
classes would resume.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Simons, whose son is in the second grade at Buell, has
gathered more than 300 signatures from parents and grandparents
seeking metal detectors and security cameras at Buell, and hopes to
get as many as 1,000. She and another parent gave the petitions to
school board members Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For now, metal detectors in elementary schools are rare. Less
than five in every 1,000 elementary schools had them in 1996-97,
the most recent year for which the National Center for Education
Statistics has figures. Only 1 percent nationally conducted random
metal detector checks, and only one in 10 had police or law
enforcement officials at school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it never would happen. But this is the year 2000,
and if the violence is there, (we must) try to prevent it,'' Simons
said. ''They need to do something about it before another child
dies.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people attended a vigil Thursday evening outside Buell,
where a makeshift memorial for Kayla had grown to include more than
100 stuffed animals. A cardboard sign was covered with messages:
''She is smiling from heaven,'' says one.

<HEADLINE> Bradley visits Boys &AMP; Girls Club in Bridgeport  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- When Bill Bradley was with the New York
Knicks his team pulled out their share of victories in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut Thursday, Bradley promissed an NBA-style rally in
his attempt to win the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like the fourth quarter. You know, we haven't even put
on a full court press yet. It starts today,'' Bradley, told a crowd
of about 170 people at the Bridgeport Boys &AMP; Girls Club.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bradley trailing Vice President Al Gore in
Connecticut and 14 other states holding Democratic primaries on
''Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   During his brief stop at the club for inner-city children,
Bradley touched on issues familiar to the poor and working-class
families of this north-end neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He said if elected he would work toward making health care
available to all families, passing ''common sense'' gun-control
laws, making a major new investment in public schools, and reducing
the number of children living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that at this time of unprecedented prosperity, we
should be fixing our roof because the sun is shining,'' said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was joined on stage by former Boston Celtic K.C. Jones
who has endorsed his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley joked with the club's young members who jumped up and
down and raised their hands when he asked who wanted to take him on
in a game of one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of kids play basketball and are interested in a lot of
sports and that's why we look up to him,'' said Sam Cappiello, 13.
''They say in life nothing is impossible. I think its possible he
could be president when we grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley flew from New York City to Bradley International Airport
in Windsor Locks Thursday afternoon, before getting in a car and
driving over an hour south to Bridgeport, which is just 53 miles
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen supporters met him at Bradley Airport chanting
''Let's go Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday in Hartford, state Comptroller Nancy Wyman and
female labor leaders threw their support behind Bradley's rival for
the Democratic nomination -- Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Wyman said Gore will protect a woman's right to decide whether
to have an abortion, despite Bradley's claims that his rival can't
be trusted to uphold the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that as president, Al Gore will be a strong and
effective leader in the fight to protect a woman's right to
choose,'' Wyman said. ''He has fought with us on the front lines of
this issue in the past, and we know we can count on him in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori Pelletier, the secretary treasurer for Connecticut's
chapter of the AFL-CIO, said Gore will fight to increase the
federal minimum wage and work to make sure men and women receive
equal pay for doing the same job.

<HEADLINE> Closing arguments in Gritz attempted kidnapping trial  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A jury is being asked to decide if Patriot
Movement leader James ''Bo'' Gritz was planning a kidnapping to
help a woman who called his talk radio show complaining about her
custody case.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations were expected to begin in Gritz's criminal trial
today after Judge Nicola Rubinow finished instructing the jury.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Thursday, prosecutor John Malone accused
Gritz of ''taking the law into his own hands'' to kidnap a
12-year-old boy and reunite him his mother, Linda Wiegand, who had
appeared on Gritz's radio show claiming claiming her former husband
had sexually abused her children and the government had failed to
protect them. the government was keeping her from her children.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz and a co-defendant, Sheldon Robinson, are charged with
conspiracy, attempted second-degree kidnapping and attempted
custodial interference.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gritz and Robinson accused some prosecution
witnesses of lying and accused the police of conducting a shoddy
investigation. They said Gritz was just investigating Wiegand's
claims to see if he could help her.
</P>
<P>
   Malone admitted much of the evidence against Gritz and Robinson
was circumstantial and that much of the evidence by itself may not
mean much, but he asked jurors to piece the facts together.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz and his son, James Gritz, were arrested Sept. 30, 1996, in
the parking lot of the boy's school in Suffield. James Gritz is
being prosecuted separately.
</P>
<P>
   They were driving Wiegand's car and had with them a photo of the
boy, radios, tools and information about the school that Robinson
had obtained days before.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand had accused her ex-husband of sexually assaulting the
children in Vermont during the couple's divorce in 1994. Charges
were dropped for lack of evidence. An 18-month investigation in
Connecticut also found insufficient evidence to support Wiegand's
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand went on the run with the children for two years. She was
arrested in Las Vegas in 1996 but has since disappeared and is
wanted on custodial interference charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a medical device salesman with a private plane, got
the information from the school under the guise of being a
businessman who was interested in relocating his family to Suffield
from Texas, Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also rented cars and hotel rooms for Gritz, and Malone
claimed Robinson's plane was planned as a getaway plane for Wiegand
and the children.
</P>
<P>
   When a police officer questioned Gritz in the school parking
lot, Gritz claimed he was in the area looking to buy a car that was
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Gritz said he went to the school because he
wanted to be arrested so he could draw attention to Wiegand's
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he was really there to focus publicity on the situation,
that was the time to do it,'' Malone said. ''What he tried to do
was avoid being arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz also wrote in a newsletter to his supporters about the
''rescue and safekeeping'' of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But Gritz's attorney, David Kritzman, said the alleged
conspiracy plan makes no sense. They were in Wiegand's car, which
was known to police, and they drove past a marked police cruiser
under the eye of school administrators to park in the school
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the boy and his brother, who went to another
school, got rides from their father or aunt and did not take the
bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you had any intent to kidnap these children as they were
getting on the bus, it couldn't be done,'' Kritzman said.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused prosecution witnesses of lying when they placed
Gritz and Wiegand together at a survivalist expo that Gritz did not
attend. Another witness lied when he testified that Gritz asked him
to put together a list of families that could hide a child,
Kritzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's lawyer, Wendi Doolittle, noted that Robinson used his
name and credit cards to pay for the cars and hotel rooms. At the
time, he thought his business might expand into the Northeast and
might want to live in Suffield.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 3, Mighty Ducks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Felix Potvin stopped 29 shots
and Mark Messier recorded his 1,700th career point Thursday night
in the Vancouver Canucks' 3-1 victory over the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Messier made it 2-0 with 8:11 left in the second period when he
came down the right side and beat Guy Hebert between the legs with
a trademark wrist shot off his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks, 5-1-2 in their last eight games, are unbeaten in
three games (1-0-2) this season against Anaheim. Potvin, 4-1-2 in
his last seven games, has allowed one goal in six of nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin came close to a shutout for the second straight home
game, but Kip Miller scored with 8:59 left. Miller's seventh goal
came on a weak shot from behind the net that went in off Potvin's
skate.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks scored the only two goals of the second period
despite being outshot 12-5. Anaheim missed a great chance to get
back into the game after Trent Klatt was assessed a double-minor
for high sticking.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended a three-game undefeated streak for Anaheim,
playing its fifth straight without injured leading scorer Paul
Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Mogilny's 16th goal, on a 25-foot wrist shot, gave
Vancouver a 1-0 lead. It was Mogilny's first point since returning
Tuesday from a shoulder injury that kept him out for eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Brad May rounded out the scoring with his first goal in 15
games.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky extended his point streak to
four games with an assist on Miller's goal. Tverdovsky has four
goals and eight points in seven games.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Frerotte, Broncos Agree  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Quarterback Gus Frerotte has reached a $1 million,
one-year agreement with the Denver Broncos, according to reports in
Denver and Detroit Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Denver television stations KUSA and KCNC, citing unnamed
sources, said Frerotte's agreement with the Broncos came Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Other reports indicated the Broncos signed a ''new quarterback''
but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos struggled at quarterback last season on the way to a
6-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials couldn't be reached for comment, and messages
with an agent for Frerotte were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte was in Denver earlier in the week, arriving Monday and
spending much of Tuesday in town after opting out of his contract
with Detroit. The Lions wanted him back but only as a backup to
Charlie Batch.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Frerotte is seen as a possible challenger to the
inexperienced Brian Griese for the Denver starting job, or as
someone who could push Griese to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had been interested in Kent Graham, but the
Pittsburgh Steelers signed him to a three-year, $5.1 million deal
which includes a $1.1 million signing bonus and $5 million in
performance incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had also expressed interest in San Francisco's Steve
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte, 28, has been near the top of the list of free agents
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Tulsa graduate showed flashes of the form that
landed him the starting job with the Washington Redskins several
years ago, winning two games in relief of Batch and another two as
a starter.
</P>
<P>
   He completed almost 61 percent of his passes with nine
touchdowns and seven interceptions. His rating of 83.6 was nearly
10 points higher than Griese.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lions Sign QB Mike Tomczak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Lions have signed Pittsburgh
quarterback Mike Tomczak to a two-year, $2.2 million contract,
according to two broadcast reports.
</P>
<P>
   WDIV-TV in Detroit and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh reported Thursday
night that Tomczak had signed the deal. Lions officials and
Tomczak's agent could not immediately be reached for comment
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak is a 15-year NFL veteran who spent his first six seasons
with the Chicago Bears. He spent one year each with Green Bay and
Cleveland before joining the Steelers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his time in Pittsburgh was as a backup, although he did
start 15 games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak has thrown for 15,690 yards with 85 touchdowns and 102
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak would replace Gus Frerotte as the Lions' back-up
quarterback. WDIV-TV also reported Thursday night that Frerotte has
signed with the Denver Broncos.

<HEADLINE> Oregon State 70, No. 3 Arizona 69  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Deaundra Tanner sank a 3-pointer at the
overtime buzzer to give Oregon State a stunning 70-69 victory over
No. 3 Arizona on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner scored 20 points for the Beavers (13-14, 5-11 Pac-10),
who defeated Arizona for the second straight time at home following
17 consecutive losses overall to the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wright had 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Wildcats
(24-5, 13-2), who may have blown their chance at a No. 1 seed in
the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded turnovers in the final seconds before Arizona's
Jason Gardner had his shot blocked by Jason Heide with 14 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner rebounded, but on the final possession the ball came
loose. Heide wound up with it and dished off to Tanner, who stepped
behind the 3-point line and let the shot fly.
</P>
<P>
   With the roar of the crowd, the horn seemed to have sounded
before Tanner got the shot off, but replays showed there was 0.2
seconds left when the shot left his hands. After it swished
through, the fans poured onto the court. Arizona and coach Lute
Olson did not protest.
</P>
<P>
   The teams went to overtime tied at 60, and Gardner sank two
straight 3-pointers to start the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers climbed back with a layup by Clifton Jones and a
3-pointer by Josh Steinthal that cut it to 66-65 with 2:11 left.
Wright made three free throws in two trips to the line, but his
last shot missed, leaving Arizona with a 69-67 lead and setting up
the thrilling finish.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Arenas and Gardner each had 16 points for the Wildcats,
who lost here last year 60-59 when they were ranked No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   It was Oregon State's first win over a team ranked as high as
No. 3 since Dec. 2, 1989, when the Beavers defeated No. 2 Arizona
84-61. That was Oregon State's last winning season.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers took a 60-57 lead in regulation on Brian Jackson's
two free throws with 15.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner launched a 3-pointer and fell to the floor in front of
the Wildcats' bench. A foul was called on Jimmie Haywood, but there
appeared to be little contact.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner made all three free throws with seven seconds left to
tie it. The Beavers pushed the ball past halfcourt and called a
timeout with 1.5 seconds left to set up a final play, but Richard
Jefferson leapt high to intercept the inbound pass toward the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who played for the first time since breaking his
right foot in a victory at Stanford Jan. 8, played nine minutes and
was held scoreless on two field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats also were without star center Loren Woods, who
isn't expected to return until the NCAA tournament because of an
injured back.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Doesn't Want Prep Star  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Cincinnati said it wouldn't make another
scholarship offer to prep basketball star Jerome Harper even after
a judge dismissed a simple assault charge against him.
</P>
<P>
   A Columbia Municipal Court judge dismissed the charge Thursday
at the request of Harper's accuser, Saboor Rasheed. Rasheed went to
court Thursday morning to say he never meant for things to go so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to destroy his career, and everybody wants to take
back his contract and don't want him to go to college. ... That was
never my intention,'' Rasheed told the judge. ''My intention was
just to make this young man pay for what he had done to my eye.
That didn't mean to destroy his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper hit Rasheed in the eye during a Feb. 17 fight at the home
where Harper lives with his aunt. The investigating officer said
the assault was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, a 6-foot-5 guard considered one of the best high school
basketball players in the country, spent Monday night in jail after
being arrested. He had signed a letter of intent to play next year
for Cincinnati, but the university withdrew its scholarship offer
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan McCann, assistant sports information director at
Cincinnati, told Columbia's WIS-TV Thursday that the school would
not offer Harper another scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not changed our minds,'' McCann said. ''We wish Jerome
Harper well and are moving on.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Fewer Hospital Infections  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Fewer hospitalized people appear to be
contracting bloodstream infections as efforts to prevent common
infections start yielding results, according to a government
report.
</P>
<P>
   According to data on hospital-acquired infections over the last
decade, there was a drop of more than 30 percent, with the biggest
reduction -- a 44 percent decline -- occurring in bloodstream
infections in nonsurgical intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
   Coronary ICUs had a 43 percent decline, pediatric ICUs had a 32
percent decrease and surgical ICUs had a 31 percent decrease, the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Similar reductions were found for urinary tract and ventilator
associated pneumonia infections, the CDC said. Each year, about 2
million Americans contract infections while in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The results far surpassed the CDC's goal of reducing such
infections by 10 percent during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''These decreases really are dramatic,'' said Dr. Julie
Gerberding, head of the CDC's Hospital Infections Program.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the decline to hospitals better identifying
problem areas, then evaluating the infections closely to figure out
how to prevent them. The process undergoes constant review and
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a classic quality-improvement model that works in
industry and other settings, and now we're seeing it in the
health-care setting,'' Gerberding said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on data obtained between 1990-1999 from 300
hospitals in 42 states, the CDC said. Similar results were observed
in urinary tract infections associated with catheters and pneumonia
contracted after being on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   Most hospital-acquired infections develop in surgical incisions,
the urinary tract and the bloodstream. They are more common among
the elderly, malnourished and severely weak patients. Burn victims,
premature infants and smokers also are at high risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   The infections typically are caused by catheters, intravenous
lines and breathing tubes common to most hospital stays. Such
devices allow bacteria easy entry into the body.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rekha Murthy, an epidemiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles, said the decreases show that health workers
are being more vigilant observing the basic precepts of preventing
hospital-acquired infections: using catheters only when necessary,
making workers wash their hands more, changing IV tubing more
frequently, prescribing fewer antibiotics and wearing gowns and
masks more often.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of participating hospitals was small, the
CDC said evidence suggests that such infections are dropping
nationwide because many medical centers use the same monitoring
system but do not report their findings.

<HEADLINE> Study: Marijuana Raises Heart Risks  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Boomers pushing into their 50s probably should
add another item to their list of things to worry about: The effect
of marijuana on their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Thursday documents for the first time that
smoking pot increases the risk of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of keeling over from a single joint is tiny, just as
no one dies from one cigarette. But the cumulative effect on large
numbers of 1960s children taking their pot habit into middle age
could be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ''With baby boomers aging, more people in (their) 40s and 50s
are smoking marijuana than in prior generations,'' said Dr. Murray
Mittleman of the Harvard School of Public Health and Boston's Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ''The risk of coronary artery
disease increases with age. Whether this will emerge as a public
health problem remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mittleman presented the data at a conference in San Diego of the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the risk of a heart attack is five times
higher than usual in the hour after smoking a joint.
</P>
<P>
   To put this into perspective, many things can trigger a heart
attack, including just climbing out of bed in the morning. The
researchers said that for someone in good shape, marijuana is about
twice as risky as exercising or having sex.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers questioned 3,882 heart attack victims -- men and
women -- at 62 locations across the country about their habits and
found that 124 were marijuana users. While pot was uncommon among
the elderly heart patients, 13 percent of those under age 50 said
they smoke it.
</P>
<P>
   Among those questioned, 37 had their heart attacks within a day
of using marijuana, including nine within an hour afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers calculated that someone's risk of a heart attack
is five times higher during the hour after using marijuana. After
an hour, the risk falls to twice normal. It soon returns to the
usual level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a fivefold increase is a worry depends on whether
someone has other risk factors, such as high blood pressure or
diabetes. The increased risk is probably insignificant for a
20-year-old, whose chance of a heart attack is vanishingly small
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''With baby boomers aging, more people in 40s and 50s are
smoking marijuana than in prior generations,'' Mittleman said.
''The risk of coronary artery disease increases with age. Whether
this will emerge as a public health problem remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the risk of a heart attack from any single session
of marijuana smoking is likely to be low. Mittleman said that for
an otherwise healthy 50-year-old man, it is about 10 in 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana typically makes the heart speed up by about 40 beats a
minute. Whether this is how it contributes to heart attacks is
unclear. Mittleman noted that while marijuana doesn't contain
nicotine, the smoke is otherwise similar to cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the marijuana smokers in the study were more likely
than other heart attack victims to be overweight and sedentary, but
they were less apt to have diabetes, high blood pressure or badly
clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ''My advice on marijuana is, 'Don't,''' said Dr. Lynn Smaha of
Sayre, Pa., president of the heart association. ''If they have
heart disease, I'd tell patients they are playing a dangerous game
if they smoke marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   Mittleman said the possibility of triggering a heart attack
should be considered when deciding whether to smoke marijuana for
medicinal purposes, such as to relieve the nausea of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Thomas of the Washington-based Medical Marijuana Policy
Group, which advocates legalizing pot for medical treatment, noted
that many prescription drugs can also have dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone has such a bad heart that they can't run upstairs,
they probably should not smoke marijuana, either,'' he said. ''But
that decision should be left up to a doctor and not the criminal
justice system.''

<HEADLINE> Vitamin C Pills, Artery Clogs Linked  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Vitamin C pills may speed up hardening of the
arteries, researchers suggest in a new study they called a
disturbing surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers cautioned that more experiments are needed to
know for sure whether megadoses of the vitamin actually are
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they said the finding supports the recommendations of
health organizations, which generally urge people to avoid high
doses of supplements and to get their nutrients from food instead.
</P>
<P>
   Many people load up on vitamin C and other nutrients on the
assumption that these supplements are good for their health, even
though there is little scientific evidence this is true. In theory,
vitamin C and some other nutrients might protect the circulatory
system and other organs by suppressing the damaging effects of
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you extract one component of food and give it at very
high levels, you just don't know what you are doing to the system,
and it may be adverse,'' said Dr. James Dwyer, an epidemiologist
who directed the study. He presented the findings Thursday at a
meeting in San Diego of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Clogged arteries -- what doctors call atherosclerosis -- are the
major underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, doctors looked for early signs of this
process by twice performing ultrasound scans on volunteers' carotid
arteries, once at the study's start and again 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer and colleagues from the University of Southern California
studied 573 outwardly healthy middle-aged men and women who work
for an electric utility in Los Angeles. About 30 percent of them
regularly took various vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   The study found no clear-cut sign that getting lots of vitamin C
from food or a daily multivitamin does any harm. But those taking
vitamin C pills had accelerated thickening of the walls of the big
arteries in their necks. In fact, the more they took, the faster
the buildup.
</P>
<P>
   People taking 500 milligrams of vitamin C daily for at least a
year had a 2{ times greater rate of thickening than did those who
avoided supplements. Among smokers, the rate was five times
greater.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a person's physician has prescribed vitamin C, it is
appropriate to be taking it,'' Dwyer said. ''But if you are a
healthy person and taking them in hopes of preventing
cardiovascular disease, the heart association does not recommend
it. This study would suggest that recommendation is prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shiriki Kumanyika of the University of Pennsylvania said the
research shows the uncertainties of picking out a single vitamin
among the plethora of nutrients in a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a challenge to sort out what it is in what people eat
that makes them live longer,'' she said. ''We have to be careful
about recommending foods or nutrients, because if we are wrong, we
can do harm.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, experts recommend that people get their vitamins and
other nutrients from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani defends officer, says unarmed suspect was career criminal  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unlike Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man
fatally shot by police in the same Bronx neighborhood was a heroin
dealer and career criminal who endangered the lives of officers,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a neighborhood that is one of the most dangerous in
the city,'' Giuliani said Thursday of the Soundview section.
''Police officers were there to protect that neighborhood. If
police officers act in the line of duty to protect a community from
violent criminals and drug dealers then that community should stand
up and support them when police officers' lives are in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the predominantly poor, minority neighborhood in
the South Bronx had already protested the shooting Wednesday of
Malcolm Ferguson, 23, at the hands of a plainclothes officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferguson shooting, which brought about 100 angry protesters
to the neighborhood Wednesday night, came at a particularly tense
time in police-community relations in the city: Last week an Albany
jury acquitted four white undercover officers on trial for
murdering Diallo, a black man from Guinea, firing at him 41 times
in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. In Brooklyn, a
jury is considering the fate of three white officers charged with
concealing the police torture of Abner Louima, a black Haitian
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Diallo's parents met with
Justice Department officials in Washington to ask the federal
government to pursue charges against the four officers who gunned
down their unarmed son. During the meeting, protesters marched
outside demanding federal action.
</P>
<P>
   And a nationwide Harris Poll released Thursday found that 76
percent of blacks and 45 percent of whites believe police brutality
against minorities is relatively common.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Soundview residents' fear and loathing of police
officers was ripe.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got away with Diallo,'' said neighbor Yolanda Jones, 34.
''Now, all of a sudden, they think they just have the right to pull
out and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials however, took pains to draw distinctions between
the February 1999 police killing of Diallo and the shooting of
Ferguson, who was described Thursday as a career criminal with
arrests for robbery, burglary, heroin trafficking, possession of a
handgun and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death he was on parole for a heroin selling
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd been arrested several times while on parole but somehow
was never put back in prison which is where people who violate
parole should go,'' said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   City officials described the shooting this way: At about 6:30
p.m. Wednesday, a six member team from the department's housing
bureau anti-drug squad saw Ferguson, William Cadiz, 28, and Julio
Reyes, 24, engaged in ''suspicious activity'' outside an apartment
house at 1045 Boynton Ave.
</P>
<P>
   All three had previous arrests for drug dealing or drug
possession and the four story apartment building has been the scene
of 86 drug arrests since 1997. Reyes, who lives in the Boynton
Avenue building, had been arrested Feb. 7 when police found 90
glassine envelopes in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The building itself is considered a prime drug location,''
said Giuliani. ''The area is an area in which significant numbers
of shootings and homicides have taken place,'' he added. ''It is
one of the top 10, 12 precincts for crime in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   When the officers identified themselves, the three men ducked
inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have statements from the other two individuals that they
knew they were police officers, that they had their shields out and
they in fact said, 'Police officers, don't move,''' said Howard
Safir.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson ran inside and Officer Louis Rivera, a four-year
veteran, gave chase toward the back of the building and up a flight
of stairs to the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police officer Rivera chased him and it appears that at some
point a struggle took place and the police officer's gun went
off,'' said Giuliani. ''We don't know if it was accidental or
intentional, intentional meaning as part of the struggle in
protecting his life. But one bullet entered Mr. Ferguson, the side
of his head, and killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said a witness saw Rivera and Ferguson struggling, but did
not see the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found blood on Rivera's gun and $360 in small
bills and glassine envelopes containing heroin on Ferguson's body.
Ferguson was also wearing two sets of clothing -- which may have
been an effort to avoid arrest, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx District Attorney's office is investigating the
shooting and the case is likely to be presented to a grand jury.
Rivera has refused a request to be interviewed by investigators,
said Steven Reed, spokesman for the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Rivera has 126 arrests and four medals and ''is
considered to be an exceptionally skilled police officer.'' Rivera
also has two civilian complaints against him, both found to be
unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   He has been placed on modified duty pending the outcome of the
investigation, which is standard police procedure.

<HEADLINE> Diallo's Bronx neighborhood mourns another fatal police shooting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Days after four police officers were acquitted
in the killing of Amadou Diallo, his old neighborhood is mourning
for another unarmed man killed by police.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers and candles sat Thursday outside the building where
Malcolm Ferguson, 23, was shot in the head, a few blocks from the
apartment building vestibule where Diallo was shot by police last
year. Several of Ferguson's friends cried and hugged on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ferguson, a parolee, was carrying heroin and fleeing
police when he was killed during a struggle with an officer of the
Street Narcotics Unit Wednesday night. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
called Ferguson ''a serious criminal'' and police said he was a
convicted drug dealer with nine prior arrests.
</P>
<P>
   But those who knew Ferguson described him as friendly and
easygoing, and placed blame for his death on police, who they said
were routinely rude to neighborhood residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts,'' said Yolanda Jones, 34, who lives a block away
from 1045 Boynton Ave., where Ferguson was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got away with Diallo,'' she said. ''Now, all of a sudden,
they think they just have the right to pull out and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers were angered by the acquittal last week of the
four officers who fired at Diallo 41 times, and Ferguson was
detained Friday for resisting arrest at a protest of the verdict,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The Soundview section, where both killings happened, was quiet
Thursday, but residents said Ferguson's death was more evidence
that police were too violent, particularly with black and Hispanic
people. Diallo and Ferguson were both black.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real bad,'' said Anthony Carty, 43, who lives next door
to the Ferguson shooting scene. ''It's not right at all. Something
has got to give, because they're going to continue doing it again
and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir took pains to
distinguish the Ferguson shooting from Diallo's death, although
both men were unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police have to arrest drug dealers,'' the mayor said. ''If
police officers act in the line of duty to protect a community from
violent criminals and drug dealers, then that community should
stand up and support them when police officers' lives are in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But friends of Ferguson -- who did not live in Soundview, but
often visited friends there -- were baffled by his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the teenagers know each other here, all the fellows,''
said Juan Valdez, 19, who was lighting candles at a makeshift
shrine. ''Not everybody's a suspect. This is a rough
neighborhood,'' he said. ''But not everybody deserves to die. He
died for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Renaldo Landers, 49, who works in a nursing home and lives in
the neighborhood, worried that Ferguson's past would be used to
justify his killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not no gangster or nothing,'' Landers said. ''He just has
a little drug problem. He's not an armed robber or a serial
killer.''

<HEADLINE> Spurge-Eating Sheep Could Be Answer  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- A jointly owned herd of weed-eating sheep
could be the best way to control leafy spurge, a new study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a sheep cooperative devoted to purging spurge could
also put money in the pockets of the cattle ranchers, researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one big thing this sheep co-op would offer is the chance
to turn this problem into something that could generate income. And
that would really address two problems, when you think about it,''
said Dan Nudell, a research scientist with the Agricultural
Experiment Station in Hettinger.
</P>
<P>
   Nudell is one of about a half dozen researchers who recently
completed a study of such a co-op.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the idea is just that. No ranchers have stepped
forward to make the proposal a reality, Nudell said.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing sheep on rangeland infested with leafy spurge has been
recognized for years as a way of controlling the spread of the
weed, which can take over pastures and fields. But it also has been
impractical for many cattle ranchers because it means adding their
own sheep herds.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of producers have just not been interested in doing
that. It hasn't made any sense for them,'' said Randy Sell, a
research scientist with the North Dakota State University
Agriculture Economics Department. ''They just don't have the time
or resources to add an entirely new component to their
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers use herbicides to control leafy spurge, but the
chemicals are expensive and impractical when infestations are
greater than a few acres. Another recent option has been the use of
flea beetles, which also feed on the spurge.
</P>
<P>
   Sell, along with Nudell and other researchers, studied the idea
of the rancher-owned sheep cooperative at the request of Team Leafy
Spurge, an organization of scientists, agriculture officials and
ranchers looking at different control methods.
</P>
<P>
   Sell said the idea is to use animals purchased with member
investments to control leafy spurge on members' pastures. Unlike
cattle, sheep will eat leafy spurge, which tends to crowd out other
grasses. A number of studies have found that sheep even develop a
preference for the weed.
</P>
<P>
   The added benefit of the co-op, Nudell and Sell say, is that
ranchers would divide the profits when the sheep are eventually
sold for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   While a number of proposals were examined, the study concluded
that a 5,000-animal cooperative was the most affordable option,
with each rancher buying a minimum of 50 animals to be a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the co-op only breaks even and no dividend is returned
to members from the slaughter, the ranchers still have gained
because they're not paying for any other leafy spurge control,''
Nudell said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers would have to build a facility for spring lambing and
a place to house the sheep when they are not grazing on spurge.
Nudell said the study estimated it would cost just over $1 million
to get the facility built and operational.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Nudell said, is finding ranchers who are
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've presented the idea a couple times,'' he said. ''But as
with any co-op, there has to be a champion to lead the charge. That
person hasn't come forward yet.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Worker Stock Options  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is recommending a
change in the nation's labor laws to encourage companies to offer
stock options to all workers -- not just executives.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options ''allow workers to obtain a stake in their
employer's growth, prosperity and profits,'' said Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Education and Workforce Committee have
agreed that a clarification of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act
would be helpful in spreading stock-option benefits to more
workers, and say they hope to speed it through Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there were such a thing as a no-brainer, this would be
it,'' said Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options give employees a chance to buy stock in the
company they work for at a preset price during a limited time
period. If the stock then rises beyond that price, the employee
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, they have been offered to high-level executives as a
personal incentive to make a company profitable. But a growing
number of companies have begun offering stock options to
lower-level workers as well, among them Xerox, Starbucks, Microsoft
and Proctor &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers receiving stock options has grown from an
estimated 1 million to between 7 million and 10 million since the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The 1938 labor law includes provisions meant to prevent
employers from scheming to keep overtime pay rates low by devising
creative ways to compensate workers outside of their regular wages.
</P>
<P>
   The law exempts some employee benefits such as health insurance,
retirement plans and some profit-sharing from overtime pay
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   But stock options do not fall neatly into one of those existing
categories, according to Labor Department Wage and Hour
Administrator T. Michael Kerr who testified at a House Education
and Workforce subcommittee hearing on Thursday. Therefore, the
administration is recommending that Congress create a separate
exemption for stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Without the change, Kerr said, the design of some stock-option
plans could mean companies would have to pay higher overtime rates
to hourly wage workers -- who, unlike salaried professionals, are
entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work more than a 40-hour
week.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate executives were surprised last year by an
informal Labor Department advisory letter indicating that one
company's proposed stock-option plan would have to be treated as
part of hourly workers' normal compensation. That would boost the
worker's base pay rate, and therefore would require the company to
pay a higher overtime rate, said the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Companies say that would be costly and administratively
burdensome, discouraging the spread of stock options to
lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that we will discontinue it'' if it means
paying higher overtime, said J. Randall MacDonald, vice president
for human resources at GTE Corp., which has offered stock options
to 53,000 hourly workers.

<HEADLINE> Census Problem: Returning Forms  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first big run of census forms landing
on doorsteps across America today, Census Bureau director Kenneth
Prewitt is more worried about how he'll get those forms back.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Prewitt says the
bureau has tried nearly everything to get people to fulfill their
''civic duty'' and return filled-out forms. That includes
participating in a Mass for the census beamed to 8 million
Catholics nationwide, speaking to undocumented workers in Texas to
ensure their information would not be turned over to authorities,
and even inserting ''fill-out-your-form'' messages inside fortune
cookies in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The more forms turned in, the more accurate the results are, and
the results will show that the American population is on its way to
becoming a ''microcosm of the entire world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It drives big money, power, reapportionment, redistricting,
and private investment. It has consequences,'' Prewitt said. ''You
have to make a proactive statement that you care enough about your
country, yourself and your community to fill out the form and send
it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he concedes, is to overcome the public's
increased apathy and concerns over confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Mail response rates declined from 78 percent of households in
1970 to 70 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990. Census officials
estimate it will dip to 61 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first forms were being hand-delivered to rural households.
The bureau is trying a number of new things this year, including a
$167 million advertising campaign, to get more of those forms back.
</P>
<P>
   Other census novelties in 2000 include allowing people to answer
surveys over the Internet, and getting 90,000 ''community
partners'' like pastors, schoolteachers and community activists to
help spread the message.
</P>
<P>
   Even mayors like Dennis Archer in Detroit, Richard Riordan in
Los Angeles and Rudolph Giuliani in New York are taking lead roles
to attach a familiar, assuring face to relay the message, Prewitt
notes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more people on the move, more people in irregular
housing, a higher percentage of foreign born and more disinterest,
more cynicism, more disengagement,'' Prewitt said. ''So if we can
actually turn it around, I think it will be a serious and big
story.''
</P>
<P>
   He is so confident, in fact, that he wagered a pessimistic
friend $25 that the response rate will go up. ''And the check goes
to a charity,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau already has forecast that the number of
foreign-born will more than double between now and 2050, from 26
million to 53.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   To account for the diversity, this year's census allows people
to indicate if they are of more than one race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents charge that may water down the power of minority
groups because those who consider themselves multiracial will not
be statistically counted as, for instance black and white, but be
placed in a separate multiracial category.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is turning a corner in terms of how it's going to
deal with itself along racial categories, and the Census Bureau is
simply a reflection of that,'' Prewitt said. ''The people who have
that as their experience don't want to be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said this year's census has become the most scrutinized
and politicized ever. Census data is used for redrawing political
boundaries as well as redistributing billions of dollars in federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau must compile two sets of data -- one from raw
numbers, a second that is statistically sampled -- for release to
the states.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Supreme Count decision mandated that the federal
government use non-sampled data for the purposes of redistributing
aid. States will determine which set of numbers to use for drawing
new political lines.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials estimate 1.6 percent of the population, mostly
minorities and inner-city residents who tend to vote Democratic
were undercounted in 1990, and Prewitt said sampling methods
provide more accuracy. Republicans fearing unfavorable redrawings
of district lines oppose sampling.
</P>
<P>
   But Prewitt said the political battle will matter little if
people do not do their ''civic responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Agency To Report on Nazi Art  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal agency is planning to report by the
end of the year on how many of the 600,000 art works estimated to
have been looted by the Nazis may be in federal museums or other
U.S. government sites.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Smithsonian Institution, only eight of the 750
art museums in the country are under federal control, led by the
National Gallery of Art. On Wednesday the gallery reported that
among its 3,000 paintings is a still life by Dutch artist Frans
Snyders from the 1600s that had once been in the hands of a Nazi
art dealer. Gallery officials did not know how he got it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Britain's National Museum Directors'
Conference listed more than 300 works in their institutions that
the Nazis might have taken, but American museums do not report to a
central body.
</P>
<P>
   Looting art is an old wartime tradition in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Germans have a lot of information about what the Russians
took from them and the Russians know a lot about what the Germans
took,'' said J. Carter Brown, chairman of the federal Commission of
Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing Nazi-tainted art is hard, said Stuart Loeser, spokesman
for the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the
United States, whose agency will make the year-end report to
President Clinton. The estimate of 600,000 stolen works worldwide
came from Jonathan Petropoulos, the commission's top expert on
plundered art.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chairman Edgar M. Bronfman told The Art Newspaper,
published in Britain last month, that the report will deal with
wartime American policies on art, allegations of mishandling by
U.S. armed forces and the ''Hungarian gold train,'' which was
loaded with art work and gold from Nazi stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Gaudieri, executive director of the Association of Art
Museum Directors, said that doing the research in American museums
is a bigger job than in Britain. American museums get their
collections from private donors and dealers, she noted. In Britain
many works in museums come from collections made by royal and noble
patrons hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Museums would not report to us,'' said Edward H. Able, Jr.,
president of the American Association of Museums. ''They'd tell the
Art Loss Register or CAR (Commission of Art Recovery). We support
both of them. We're not a policing body. The museums are
self-policing.''
</P>
<P>
   The register is a private business, and CAR is part of the
American Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing last month before the House Banking Committee it
was noted that the North Carolina Museum of Art had just agreed to
return a 500-year-old painting by Lucas Cranach to a pair of aging
sisters in Vienna. It had been stolen from their granduncle 60
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CAR Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, a former U.S. ambassador to
Austria, told the committee that the German government has agreed
to take an active role with his commission in trying to return
stolen art.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 4, Predators 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Marco Sturm's short-handed score
completed San Jose's three-goal rally as the Sharks beat the
Nashville Predators 4-3 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators scored three times in only 3:09 of the second to
take a 3-1 lead, but goals by Brad Stuart and Jeff Friesen tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Sturm drove from the blue line and had his shot from the right
circle stopped. He got to the rebound and scored from point-blank
range.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Sharks' first in 23 games (1-20-2) when
trailing after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose rookie goalie Evgeni Nabokov earned his first NHL
victory. He replaced injured starter Steve Shields early in the
second period and faced only four shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks opened the scoring at 15:44 of the first period when
Stephane Matteau scored on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second, Shields was hit on the right side of his
head by a flying puck, and the game was stopped briefly. Shields
stayed on and Nashville tied it at 1:28 when Sebastien Bordeleau
scored on a 10-footer off a pass from Scott Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four seconds later, Greg Berehowsky gave the Predators a
2-1 lead on an 18-foot shot from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's Bob Boughner got only his second goal, scoring on a
short shot at 4:47 after a pass from Cliff Ronning.
</P>
<P>
   Shields was then replaced by Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose cut it to 3-2 when Stuart scored at 13:07 on a
20-footer. The Sharks then tied it on a power play with 46 seconds
gone in the final period when Friesen scored his 22nd goal on a
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Sharks tied with Colorado for the last
Western Conference playoff spot, three points ahead of Calgary and
four ahead of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The game was interrupted three times when sections of the
protective glass around the ice were shattered.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 5, Kings 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gary Roberts broke open a tie game with two
goals and Sami Kapanen had a goal and two assists as the Carolina
Hurricanes beat the Los Angeles Kings 5-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also assisted on Rod Brind'Amour's empty-net goal in the
final minute. Martin Gelinas scored on a power play and Arturs Irbe
made 30 saves, helping the Hurricanes win for the fifth time in
seven road games.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille of the Kings extended the NHL's longest
point-scoring streak of the season to 15 games with his 33rd goal --
and 34th in 36 career games against the Carolina-Hartford
franchise. Glen Murray added a power play goal with 1:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Just seconds after referee Kerry Fraser failed to call a penalty
against Carolina's Jeff O'Neill for whacking Murray in the back
with his stick, Kings defenseman Garry Galley was called for
holding. The penalty gave the Hurricanes a two-man advantage which
they converted, after just six seconds, to take a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts scored on a rebound from the edge of the crease at 14:19
of the second period after Stephane Fiset stopped Sean Hill's slap
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, playing his second game after missing the previous
seven because of a groin strain, scored his 14th goal just 25
seconds into the third period to match his total of last season and
increase the lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gelinas made it 4-1 with his 13th goal, scoring off Ron Francis'
centering pass with 12:51 to play and 44 seconds left in a
four-minute high-sticking penalty to Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina managed only two shots during the game's first 7:32,
but the second was a 25-foot wrist shot from the slot by Kapanen
that gave the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead. Brind'Amour's pass from the
left corner set up Kapanen's team-leading 21st goal, which ended a
nine-game goal drought.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings scored the tying goal just three seconds after O'Neill
left the penalty box when Robitaille one-timed a cross-ice pass
from Jozef Stumpel for his 550th career goal.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's career-best point-scoring streak is one game longer
than that of Calgary's Jarome Iginla -- whose stretch is also
current.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only meeting this season between the clubs.

<HEADLINE> A Scramble for Next America's Cup  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The hangovers from one of
Auckland's biggest parties ever had barely gone away when it was
already time to start focusing on the next America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's top sailors think they can hang onto the oldest
trophy in sports for 25 years. That's a modest goal compared to the
132-year winning streak that the New York Yacht Club once had, but
still a formidable challenge for those who spend close to $60
million trying to grab the coveted trophy.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand already has held the cup for five years, and it got
a great jump on the quarter-century mark with a 5-0 sweep of
Italy's Luna Rossa, becoming the first country other than the
United States to successfully defend the cup.
</P>
<P>
   The next America's Cup regatta is scheduled for 2002-03, so
syndicates are already going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing to do for next time is we all have to start
immediately,'' said America True CEO and sailor Dawn Riley, the
first woman to head an America's Cup syndicate. ''I'm going back to
the States next week to start on the sponsorship trail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians spent the most money this time, an estimated $55
million that came from the chic Prada design house. That didn't
even get them a single victory against the Kiwis.
</P>
<P>
   Even though New Zealand recorded its second straight finals
sweep, the challengers have gotten closer in boat speed. What
really hurt the Italians were tactical mistakes either in the
prestart maneuvers or early in the races that turned close contests
into runaways for the black boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the gap closed a little,'' winning skipper Russell
Coutts said Friday, looking weary after a night of celebrating.
''There's probably still a little more than what I thought it
probably would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactician Brad Butterworth agreed that the boat speed was closer
than in 1995, when the Kiwis were so far ahead of the design curve
that the closest race in their sweep of Dennis Conner off San Diego
was 1 minute, 51 seconds. This time, the closest the Italians got
was 48 seconds, in the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to be a lot better next time if we hope to
win,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be changes within Team New Zealand, but it'll
probably be just as formidable. The CEO, Sir Peter Blake, is
leaving to run the Cousteau Society. Coutts, Butterworth and Tom
Schnackenberg, a key member of the sailing and design units, will
run the team.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also still have a hand in sailing, although Coutts
showed just how strong Team New Zealand is when he took himself off
the boat hours before Race 5 and introduced his protege,
26-year-old Dean Barker, to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Barker didn't buckle under the pressure of protecting a 4-0
lead, sailing Black Magic as flawlessly and with the same
unflappable demeanor as Coutts, setting off a wild waterfront
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   While New Zealand made history, so did the Americans. For the
first time ever, they didn't make it to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think not having an American in the America's Cup was not
good, but I don't see it as America giving up,'' Riley said. ''I
see us fighting even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   But they've also got to fight among themselves for sponsorship
money. Paul Cayard, whose AmericaOne was eliminated by Luna Rossa
in the challenger finals, thought the American effort was diluted
with five syndicates here.
</P>
<P>
   Conner understands such reasoning, but doesn't think it will
work. After all, the America's Cup is pretty cut-throat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Could you imagine the New York Yacht Club raising $47 million
and giving that to St. Francis so they could win the Cup and bring
it to San Francisco? No,'' said Conner, who's won the America's Cup
four times and lost it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Conner, Cayard and Riley are off on the next money chase.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yacht Club George M. Isdale Jr. doesn't know yet
whether the New York Yacht Club will back another challenge. It
supported Young America, which saw the older of its two boats crack
in two and nearly sink in an early round. Young America didn't even
make it to the challenger semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Punta Ala Yacht Club, which backed Luna Rossa, issued a
challenge minutes after Black Magic's clincher and will be
Challenger of Record, coordinating the interests of all the foreign
syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   In one change already announced for 2002-03, there will be just
two round-robins for the challengers instead of three, with yachts
seeded into the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Four Way Tie for Lead in Doral Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The stillness of the morning was broken by gunfire,
drawing puzzled looks from a few people in the gallery. The sound
brought back fond memories for Harrison Frazar.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the rat-a-tat sound Thursday was coming from an FBI
shooting range adjacent to Doral because his grandfather, who died
last week after a lengthy illness, was an FBI agent for some 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought a lot about him today because I heard the FBI over
there having target practice,'' Frazar said after his 7-under 65
put him in a four-way tie for the lead after the first round of the
Doral-Ryder Open. ''Pretty cool, kind of an eerie little deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazar fired off a volley of his own.
</P>
<P>
   With a near flawless round of golf, in which he hit every
fairway, missed only three greens and required only 26 putts,
Frazar became one of several players to take advantage of the kind
and gentle course called the Blue Monster.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh had a dandy of a round with a new putter called
''Dandy,'' holing a couple of lengthy putts in his round of 65. Jim
Furyk fired off four straight birdies to join the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The other player with a 65 was Bruce Lietzke, who plays about as
much as he practice -- very little -- and will be playing for the
last time until the Houston Open in late April.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my third tournament in a row,'' Lietzke said. ''I'm
about to pass out from exhaustion. I won't be able to recover until
I get these seven weeks of vacation out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Right behind the leaders is a large cast of challengers that
includes just about everyone in the field but John Daly, who had a
triple bogey on his way to a 79.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, Bernhard Langer and Nick Price were in a group
of six players at 66, Ernie Els was among nine players at 67 and
even three-time champion Greg Norman showed signs of life with a
4-under 68.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 75 players managed to break par.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the low scoring on a surprisingly calm day in south
Florida, and a restoration that turned the Blue Monster back to
what it once was -- vulnerable when conditions are prime, playable
when the wind starts to howl.
</P>
<P>
   ''A real friendly day in Miami,'' Lietzke said. ''I'm very happy
the wind didn't pick up. It gave us a chance. Putting is easier
when the wind doesn't blow. Everything becomes easier. On a day
like this, we're always going to shoot low rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it was calm in the first round a year ago and only
23 players managed to break 70. The number of rounds in the 60s was
nearly double Thursday, mostly because Doral has refilled or
reshaped 70 of the cavernous bunkers put in by Raymond Floyd in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, who decided to play Doral because he felt his game
rounding into form, didn't give himself many makeable birdies and
walked off with a 71, tied with defending champion Steve Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Compton, the first heart-transplant recipient to play the
PGA Tour, had a 72.
</P>
<P>
   ''The golf course doesn't look quite as intimidating anymore,''
Frazar said. ''You can actually see some land where you are trying
to hit it. In the past couple of years, all you saw was the wall of
a bunker, or you tried to hit it over one trap and leave it short
of the others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little more reassuring when you can see some grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazar, whose life has taken several turns over the past couple
months, fired off a few volleys of his own. He had seven birdies in
a near flawless round, in which he hit every fairway, missed only
three greens and never came seriously close to a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Frazar's first child was born Dec. 2, and he has tried to take
young Harrison on the road -- at the expense of a good night's
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can handle it for a day or two, but as it continues on for
two, three weeks, it just gets harder and harder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He got a sinus infection going from the desert sun of Phoenix to
chilly Pebble Beach, changed equipment before Los Angeles and then
had to pull out of the Tucson Open when his grandfather died.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a rough start of the year for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a nice start at Doral, the $3 million
tournament that could turn into a birdiefest if the wind doesn't
blow. The last time four players shared the first-round lead was
the Hartford Open seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a lot of fun,'' Lietzke said. ''But I'm not the
only one thinking that way.''

<HEADLINE> Dragila Going for World Record  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Of all the athletes eligible for a $50,000 bonus
for breaking a world record at the USA Indoor Track and Field
Championships at the Georgia Dome, women's pole vaulter Stacy
Dragila was considered the most likely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the 112-year history of the meet, which
started today, the bonuses were being offered in the men's and
women's 60 meters, mile and pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   Among those events, the consistently improving Dragila was the
only American to set a world record this year -- and she did it
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila began the season by smashing the U.S. record, soaring 14
feet, 9{ inches at Pocatello, Idaho, on Jan. 28. Then, she became
the first women's vaulter to reach 15 feet indoors, clearing that
height three weeks later at Pocatello. After climbing 15-0, she had
the bar raised to 15-1{, and cleared again.
</P>
<P>
   That height also surpassed the world outdoor record of 15-1,
which Dragila shares with Emma George of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila didn't stop there. She asked for the bar to be placed at
a staggering 16-0, a height that triggered e-mail queries of why
was she being so unrealistic. Dragila missed three times at 16-0,
including one solid attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not there now,'' Dragila said Thursday. ''Hopefully, it
will be there in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt OK on the second attempt, but just to go upside down
and follow through at that height ... that was something. I
remember when I was at 14 feet and tried 15. That felt high at the
time. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Half the battle is confidence, believing that you can do it. I
want to be ready for 16 feet going into the Olympics. Not to have
those aspirations is not in your favor. You want to shoot high.
Another foot would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago -- 1994 to be exact -- that Dragila set the
American record of 10-0, a laughable figure now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any one of us ever dreamed that the women's pole
vault record would soar so high,'' Patricia Rico, president of USA
Track &AMP; Field, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shattering the world record at the championships will not be
easy because of the large field of 26 vaulters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a challenge,'' Dragila said. ''Because of the large
field, I will have to be patient. I will have to focus and
visualize great jumps. It's unfortunate you have to come to a big
meet like this and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Stubbs, Dragila's agent, thinks she can play the waiting
game, but wishes the field were smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stacy's a great performer,'' he said. ''She has the focus. She
sees the big picture. She can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want world records, but they haven't structured it to
give her the best opportunity. She won't watch the others competing
early at the lower heights. She'll just step aside and chill out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs said 15-6 is a realistic height for Dragila. He was irked
at those who criticized her for attempting 16-0 at Pocatello.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why not try it?'' he said. ''By the time of the Olympics, if
Stacy has jumped at 16 feet, she'll feel very comfortable at 15-6.
Others might not have that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pocatello, Dragila used a heavier and longer pole for her
final attempt. That's what she thinks she'll need to clear 16-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixteen feet wasn't as scary as I thought it would be,'' she
said. ''It didn't feel that weird.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a feeling that probably only Dragila knows among women
vaulters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pole vault, finals were scheduled today in
the women's long jump and men's triple jump. Also on the program
were prelims in the men's and women's 200, 400 and 800, and the
first four events of the men's heptathlon. The remaining 28 finals
will be held Saturday.

<HEADLINE> A humbled Rocker Rejoins Braves  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- For more than two months, the Atlanta
Braves looked forward to this moment. John Rocker was standing
before his teammates and coaches. The clubhouse door was locked.
There was no escape from the tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted him to offend so many people? How did he truly
feel about his Latin teammates? Was he willing to be accountable
for his disparaging comments?
</P>
<P>
   ''He was kind of shaking, nervous,'' Braves catcher Javy Lopez
said. ''But he passed the tough part. He had to apologize and he
did that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rocker donned a Braves uniform for the first time
since the World Series after an independent arbitrator cut his
suspension in half, reduced his fine and allowed him to report to
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the man who had 38 saves a year ago faces his toughest save
of all.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to be heckled by 55,000 fans in New York, it's
quite another to face the harsh scrutiny of your own team.
Especially when you've described a teammate as a ''fat monkey'' in
a magazine interview, and disparaged gays, foreigners and
minorities, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted him to own up to what he said,'' outfielder Reggie
Sanders said. ''You could tell he felt very regretful. I think he's
learned something from the whole ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig originally suspended Rocker for all of
spring training and the first 28 days of the regular season, fined
him $20,000 and ordered him to get sensitivity training after the
divisive comments appeared in Sports Illustrated in December. The
fine was cut to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving at the ballpark, Rocker addressed manager
Bobby Cox, the coaching staff and his teammates in a private
meeting. According to some players, Rocker started speaking in
front of his locker, but slowly moved toward the middle of the
room.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke for about 10 minutes, expressing regret for his
comments and trying to explain his motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he took questions from those in the room. Cox spoke first.
Pitchers Terry Mulholland, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz all took
turns, along with third-base coach Ned Yost, first baseman Randall
Simon, outfielder Brian Jordan and Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody was tense,'' catcher Eddie Perez said. ''There were
no jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was grilled especially hard by Yost, who grew noticeably
angry as he recalled the lurid details of the magazine article,
even bringing up the part about Rocker spitting at a toll booth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ned asked him how it felt to say all that stuff,'' Perez said.
''Rocker said, 'Please guys, let me play. I want to play for the
Braves.' I think he wanted to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker met privately with Simon, whom Rocker referred to as a
''fat monkey'' in the story. He asked for forgiveness and invited
Simon and his wife to dinner this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked at him in the face and he showed me he really regrets
what he said,'' Simon said. ''I saw in his eyes that he was kind of
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Rocker hardly seemed like a changed man outside the
clubhouse. He was in no mood to explain in any depth his
disparaging comments.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference prior to the Braves first exhibition game,
Rocker read from a handwritten, two-page statement that mirrored
virtually word-for-word an apologetic editorial he wrote for The
Atlanta Constitution. He took no questions, walking away from more
than 100 reporters and leaving general manager John Schuerholz to
face the mob.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Rocker consented to an interview with
Atlanta-area reporters, only to keep them waiting in a hall outside
the clubhouse for 90 minutes. He talked for only five minutes after
warning the media, ''If there are too many ridiculous questions
being asked, I'll end it right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker blamed his problems on immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just turned 25 a couple of months ago, so I guess people are
expecting me to be mature way beyond my years just because of the
position I'm in,'' he said. ''I just think a little bit of growing
up will have to be done, and I don't think that will be a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker threw in the outfield with fellow reliever Rudy Seanez
and also had a short stint pitching off the mound in the bullpen.
Cox said he expects the reliever will be ready for a spring game in
8-10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a little frustrating the first couple of days I wasn't
down here,'' Rocker said. ''I just tried not to watch TV and
coverage from spring training because that really would have made
it tough and got my nerves itching.''
</P>
<P>
   If his reception by the fans of central Florida was any
indication, Rocker has plenty of support amid the criticism. He was
cheered after his workout and stopped to sign autographs for about
10 minutes along the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still love you, John!'' a woman yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leave him alone!'' another fan screamed. ''He's taking care of
his fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker will wind up missing the first 13 days of spring training
and the first 12 games of the regular season. Atlanta's first game
after the suspension is against Philadelphia at Turner Field on
April 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he puts that uniform on, I want him to be the meanest guy
around,'' reserve shortstop Ozzie Guillen said. ''I want him to
save 50 games, win me a ring and make me more money.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not my buddy. He's my teammate.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Money-Laundering Powers Sought  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking to stem
the flow of billions of illegally obtained dollars through U.S.
banks, wants broad new powers from Congress to fight money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   A new legislative proposal, outlined Thursday by Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, would give the government the authority
to ban financial transactions between offshore financial havens and
U.S. banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the House Banking Committee liked the
administration's proposal so much they said they would co-sponsor
it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering came under the public spotlight last summer,
when federal authorities said the Bank of New York, one of the
country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for about $7
billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Summers identified Russia, Colombia and Nigeria as
among the biggest sources of illicit money, and the Caribbean
islands of Dominica and Antigua, Nauru in the South Pacific and
Liechtenstein in Europe as some of the leading money-laundering
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When dirty money finds its way into American banks, the
reputations of all involved suffer,'' Summers told an audience of
bankers and securities industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is estimated to absorb nearly $600 billion
annually, or up to 5 percent of the world's gross domestic product.
Profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and other criminal
activities are moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts
to make them appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, the Treasury Department is seeking the power to
ask U.S. financial institutions to collect data on all kinds of
transactions with an offshore bank or financial company. In cases
where foreign governments shield banks from investigation, Treasury
wants the authority to cut them off from the U.S. financial system
without seeking congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and the
panel's senior Democrat, Rep. John LaFalce of New York, proposed a
stricter measure that would have required U.S. banks to collect
detailed information on their customers from countries considered
to be money-laundering havens. The administration's proposal would
leave it up to Treasury to decide whether to impose data-collecting
requirements on banks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' proposal had been opposed by the banking
industry. Groups representing the banking and securities industries
applauded the administration's plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Clinton proposal
''doesn't go far enough'' because it gives Treasury discretion to
decide whether to take action, rather than requiring it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diplomacy usually prevails over the domestic need to curb
money laundering,'' Schumer said in a telephone interview. He and
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed their own legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Summers noted in his speech that Treasury officials already have
begun informing U.S. banks about foreign banks or nations that
repeatedly refuse to abide by generally accepted standards to
protect against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Treasury unveiled its first national
money-laundering strategy, a package of proposed new laws and rules
that include requirements that storefront check cashers, brokerage
firms and casinos notify authorities of suspicious activities the
way banks are required to do.
</P>
<P>
   That package, and the new proposals outlined by Summers, will be
submitted to Congress in the coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Mob Said To Infiltrate Wall Street  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Acting more like a business seeking a consultant
with international experience than an organized crime family,
Italian mobsters sought help from their Russian counterparts to
take on Wall Street in a lucrative stock scheme, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch in Brooklyn said the case that
resulted in an indictment charging 19 people, including six alleged
mobsters or associates of crime families, ''illustrates the
continuing relationship of organized crime in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The mob, she said as the indictment was disclosed publicly
Thursday, ''sought to extend its reach into the lives of ordinary
citizens'' as Russian mobsters teamed up with four Italian
organized crime families in New York between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual combination of forces funneled millions of dollars
in illicit proceeds from stock sales through offshore banks before
the FBI stumbled upon documents in a storage locker that revealed
the large-scale stock fraud and money laundering plot,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those charged had been captured earlier in a similar
prosecution in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. That case involved
stock manipulation by small brokerage houses protected by the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch estimated the mobsters reaped at least $40 million in
illegal profits, while Lewis Schiliro, the FBI's assistant director
in charge of the New York office, said profits could easily exceed
$60 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said the case proved once again that organized crime
families, closed off from traditional avenues of income through
aggressive prosecutions, sought new opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''A recurrent theme in our investigations has been that the mob
goes where the money is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those indicted in the case were a captain in the Bonanno
crime family, a soldier in the Genovese family, an associate in the
Colombo family and an associate and a soldier in the Gambino
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian gangsters used their expertise in money laundering
and offshore bank accounts while the New York mob families lent
their skills at muscling their way to money through threats and
intimidation, Schiliro said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities refused to divulge exactly how the organized crime
families protected the scheme or if anyone was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said help from the mob was welcomed by two now-defunct
brokerage firms in downtown Manhattan -- White Rock Partners &AMP; Co.
and State Street Capital Markets Corp.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, top executives at the two companies
joined other brokerage firms and brokers to create fraudulent
securities schemes and then launder tens of millions of dollars of
illicit profits.
</P>
<P>
   The firms allegedly acquired control of tiny companies by
quietly buying enough stock in them, then artificially boosted
their value by paying unscrupulous brokers to persuade unwitting
investors to buy stock in the same companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the stock value rose six or seven points, the firms cashed
in by selling their secretly held shares, causing the value of the
stocks to plummet, the indictment alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The profits were laundered by transferring money several times
through offshore bank accounts until it had the appearance of
having been legitimately earned.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said one company whose securities were manipulated by the
mob was essentially dormant until it became part of the scheme.
Three companies, she said, were listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said the companies who solicited help from the mob
learned over time that organized crime had become part of their
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they're in, they're in for good,'' Schiliro said.

<HEADLINE> Engineers, Boeing To Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ROXANA HEGEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The Boeing Co. will resume negotiations
with the union representing engineers at its Wichita facility after
declaring talks at an impasse in Seattle, union officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They appeared to be too busy before with Seattle, and now that
they have declared an impasse it sounded like they might have time
for us,'' said Jim Singletary, contract administrator for the
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace in
Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a shot in the dark, is what it really is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Dick Ziegler said the company got a letter
Monday from the Wichita union inviting the company to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent back a response that we would be more than happy to do
that,'' Ziegler said.
</P>
<P>
   No date has yet been set for negotiations, but contract talks
will probably resume in about a week, Singletary said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at Boeing's Seattle and Wichita facilities -- both
represented by SPEEA -- have separate contracts and negotiate them
separately. Engineers at the Wichita plant did not strike when
their colleagues in Seattle went out on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union representing striking engineers and technical
employees at Boeing's Seattle facility said it had filed an unfair
labor practice complaint against the company late Thursday,
claiming it prematurely declared negotiations at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Bill Dugovich said the complaint faxed to the
National Labor Relations Board alleged Boeing had ''failed to
bargain in good faith by declaring an impasse without meeting face
to face with the union and without exhausting all prospects for
reaching an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing notified SPEEA on Wednesday that it considers labor talks
in Seattle at an impasse after Boeing's latest offer was rejected.
That means that the company could attempt to impose an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   SPEEA workers in Seattle walked out Feb. 9. About 17,000 workers
remain on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union had sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses
similar to those received by the larger Machinists union, which
represents Boeing production workers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has insisted on mostly selective pay increases,
reductions in life insurance benefits and some changes in health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In Wichita, Boeing has been abiding by the terms of the old
contract, which expired in early January, and had agreed earlier to
resume negotiations with the Wichita SPEEA unit after the Seattle
contract was settled. About 1,200 engineers work at the Wichita
plant.

<HEADLINE> GM Recalls Electric Vehicles  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A potential fire hazard has forced General Motors
Corp. to take back about half of all the high-tech EV1 electric
cars it has leased since 1996, and all of its battery-powered
Chevrolet S-10 pickups.
</P>
<P>
   GM said Thursday it hags told owners of about 450 1997 EV1
coupes and about 450 '97-'98 Chevrolet S-10 pickups, to stop
driving the vehicles immediately. The '97 EV1 was leased between
December 1996 and August 1999 to customers primarily in California
and Arizona; the S-10 was sold to business fleets from May 1997 to
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While the S-10s can be fixed, GM has not figured out a repair
for the EV1, a sleek coupe built in a high-profile attempt to prove
GM's technical prowess. But GM officials said they would continue
to lease and service 1999 EV1s, which are not affected by the
recall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EV1 remains a tremendous learning exercise for us,'' said
Bob Purcell, GM's executive director of advanced technology
vehicles. ''While it may be small in number, it is very large in
enthusiasm, in terms of the customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   The EV1 and S-10s run off battery packs which have to be charged
with a special system provided by GM; a full charge can take
several hours. The company said a part in the vehicles' charging
ports can overheat or possibly catch fire during charging. GM asked
owners to stop driving so they would not have to charge the
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   GM has had 16 EV1s brought in for service with heat damage to
the port over the past few months. GM said no injuries or property
damage has been linked to the vehicles, and that the recall was
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   While GM says the S-10s can be repaired, the EV1's problem is
more complicated. The defective part is a 10-pound piece that would
have to be redesigned.
</P>
<P>
   ''To find a space to package a fix into is very difficult,''
said John Hepke, director of propulsion engineering for GM's
advanced technology vehicles. ''Every inch is taken up in the
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   GM announced it was building the EV1 in 1996, and hoped to
eventually sell thousands of battery-powered vehicles as
pollution-free alternative transportation -- especially in
warm-climate cities beset by smog.
</P>
<P>
   It spent $350 million to develop the EV1, and promoted it
heavily. But after an initial flurry of interest, few buyers came
forward, and the EV1's limitations became clear. EV1 leases cost
between $400 and $600 a month, and for their money, owners got a
car with a range of 80 miles that needed several hours to recharge.
The '99 EV1s have about a 100-mile range.
</P>
<P>
   GM has built two 500-vehicle batches of EV1s since 1996, but has
no plans to restart production; the factory where the EV1s were
made has been converted to build Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   GM said it would pick up the affected vehicles; EV1 owners who
are losing their cars will be provided with rental cars and free
gasoline for a short period of time. GM said it would settle leases
with EV1 owners, but provided no details.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Friday amid
renewed concern over possible intervention by Japanese finance
authorities. Japanese stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.56 yen, up 0.21 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo but lower than its late New York level of 107.83 yen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 137.57 points
points, or 0.7 percent, to finish the day at 19,927.54. On
Thursday, the average closed down 16.56 points, or 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher on worries about a
possible yen-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan to stop the
the Japanese currency's advance.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Japan's government has expressed concern about
the yen's gains, which make the country's exports less
cost-competitive abroad and decreases the value of repatriated
overseas earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.96 yen, down
from 104.97 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices closed lower as many players sold
export-related shares because of the stronger yen.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said another negative factor may have been the upcoming
release of U.S. jobless figures in Washington later Friday. The
data is regarded as an important indicator for the outlook for U.S.
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.99 points
to 10,164.92 points at Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 31.99 points, or 1.86 percent, to 1,686.49.
The TOPIX had closed down 6.76 points, or 0.39 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 717.35 million shares, down from 801.70 million
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Decliners beat advancers 726 to 541, while 129 closed unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7850 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7800 percent. Its
price fell 0.04 point to 100.12.

<HEADLINE> More Women Contract Disease  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Autoimmune diseases caused when the body
starts attacking itself overwhelmingly strike women -- and are often
misdiagnosed, medical experts told a U.N. panel.
</P>
<P>
   Between 75 percent and 90 percent of those suffering from
diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus
are women, said Dr. Denise Faustman, an associate professor at
Harvard Medical School and director of the Immunobiology Laboratory
at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And autoimmune disease is now the third major category of
illness in the United States and many industrialized countries,
behind heart disease and cancer, said Dr. Noel Rose, a pioneer in
autoimmune research at Johns Hopkins University School of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the more than 80 serious chronic illnesses caused when the
body's immune system attacks its tissues are not as well-known and
publicized as heart disease, cancer and infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said Thursday that the reason was autoimmunity as a cause
of disease is a relatively new concept -- only about 40 years old --
and autoimmune diseases can affect any part of the body so symptoms
vary enormously, making diagnosis difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But Faustman believes there is another reason these diseases are
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''Middle-aged women are not fashionable'' -- and they are the
main victims, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fashionable to talk about young people dying, children
dying. But it's not fashionable to talk about some woman who can't
walk down the hallway'' or loses her job because of arthritis,
Faustman said. ''It's slow and chronic and you don't die and get
the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the major goals of the panel, held in conjunction with a
meeting of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, was to
deliver a message to the international community that autoimmune
disease is a major women's health issue.
</P>
<P>
   Autoimmune diseases ''affect hundreds of thousands, maybe
millions of women in developing and developed countries alike,''
said Dr. Nafsiah Mboi, director of the Department of Women's Health
at the World Health Organization in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, which causes
painful joints; lupus, which can affect any part of the body and is
sometime fatal; Graves' disease, which affects the eyes and results
from an overactive thyroid; and Crohn's disease, an inflammatory
bowel disorder. All are due to misguided T-cells in white blood
cells, which direct the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Kellie Martin, a spokeswoman for the American Autoimmune
Related Diseases Association, described how her 19-year-old sister
died of lupus, which was repeatedly misdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary how much we don't know,'' she said. ''I hope today
marks another step to end a lot of needless pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health has made autoimmune disorders
a priority for research, said Dr. Vivian Pinn, the institutes'
associate director for research on women's health. Topics for
research include the role of genetics, environmental influences,
age, pregnancy, hormones and other biological influences, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Jean-Francois Bach, head of the immunology research
laboratories at Necker Hospital in Paris, said autoimmune diseases
are more common in northern, colder countries -- and appear to be
related to a higher standard of living and perhaps also
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Bach said research has shown that female hormones, especially
estrogen, boost immune -- and autoimmune -- responses.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Ladd, president of the American Autoimmune Related
Diseases Association and a longtime lupus sufferer, said now that
scientists have discovered the underlying cause of autoimmune
diseases is the same, these chronic illnesses should be considered
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to look at them as a group -- and that is where we
think we will begin to find a cure,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Diallo protesters target Justice Department; Deputy AG promisesinvestigation  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The No. 2 official at the Justice Department
told Amadou Diallo's parents that the agency is investigating the
trial of four white police officers acquitted in their son's
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder made no guarantee that
civil rights charges would be filed against Sean Carroll, Edward
McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   After the private meeting Thursday, nearly 2,000 demonstrators
marched repeatedly around the Justice Department building chanting
''no justice, no peace, no racist police.'' The protest was the
largest in recent memory outside the federal building, which takes
up an entire city block in Washington. Many of the demonstrators
were bused in from New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here because I have a son, I have friends with sons and I
have grandsons,'' said Rena Glasco, of Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, former New York City Mayor David Dinkins,
NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume and Diallo's parents expressed optimism
after the two-hour meeting with Holder.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting was very great and fruitful and we have very high
hopes,'' said Saikou Diallo, Amadou's father.
</P>
<P>
   But while Holder said the Diallo case was a priority, he made no
guarantee that the Justice Department would pursue federal civil
rights charges against the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are difficult cases to prosecute. The standard that we
have to meet on the federal side is a high one, but we will look at
the case,'' Holder told reporters in a news conference before the
meeting. Holder said the Justice Department only gets involved in
matters like the Diallo case once or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   To pursue federal charges, authorities must show the officers
intended to deny Diallo his civil rights. The Diallo case has been
compared to the Rodney King beating trial in Los Angeles where
federal charges were pursued after police officers were acquitted.
But legal experts say there are crucial differences, such as the
videotape in the King beating.
</P>
<P>
   Officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the early hours of Feb. 4,
1999, in the narrow vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   A state appellate court moved the trial out of the Bronx to
Albany, in upstate New York, because of pretrial publicity the case
received in New York City. The four officers testified they fired
at Diallo when he reached for what they thought was a gun. It
turned out to be his wallet. The officers were acquitted last week
by a racially mixed jury of charges ranging from second-degree
murder to reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors that can be considered in reviewing the trial
are incompetence, corruption, intimidation or undue influence,
according to Justice Department guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-Harlem, said Diallo supporters had raised
questions with Holder over whether the case was vigorously
prosecuted and whether the judge was unduly supportive of the
defendants. After the verdict, some jurors laid blame for the
acquittals on a lackluster prosecution by Bronx District Attorney
Robert Johnson's office. One juror said she was surprised when
prosecutor Eric Warner declined to cross examine the final witness,
an expert on police practices. Some activists have called for
Johnson to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Holder, who is black, told the Diallo supporters that he grew up
in Harlem and has himself been subject to police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is already conducting an ongoing
investigation into the patterns and practices of the New York
Police Department. That probe was expanded to include the Street
Crime Unit after Diallo's shooting. All four cops in that case were
assigned to Street Crimes, a roving group of plainclothes officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must do all we can to stop these mad dog cops,'' said
former Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, one of those protesting
at the Justice Department on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Herbal Research Needed  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Physicians need more training in herbal
medicine, and more research into the remedies themselves is needed,
speakers at an international conference said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in some European countries are trained in herbal
remedies, while such training is rare in the United States,
scientists said Thursday at the conference on safety and
effectiveness of herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''People seek a cure for something we haven't been able to
provide ... so they take the action by themselves,'' said Dr. Felix
Stickel of the University of Erlangen and Salen Medical Center in
Heidelberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''The physicians have to become aware of the needs as well as
the scientific background of these herbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbal medicines are a $4 billion-a-year industry in the United
States, where an estimated one-third of the adult population uses
them. The remedies are sold as food rather than regulated as drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Although herbal remedies generally are safe -- one, however, can
cause severe liver damage -- more basic research is needed,
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it a waste of money? Is it dangerous? We don't have enough
data to know,'' said Lenore Arab, professor of epidemiology and
nutrition at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, which
sponsored the conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the herbs discussed at the meeting was comfrey, a
root-derived remedy that is widely available in the United States
and is taken for its purported anti-inflammatory and antibacterial
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Stickel said the herb should be restricted as it is in Germany
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the effects of comfrey unproven in limited clinical
studies, it appears to destroy small veins in the liver and can
result in abdominal pain, liver enlargement and liver failure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the conference said many other herbal remedies
appear no more dangerous than aspirin, but far less understood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to convince the producers to put some money into
research on these products,'' said Varro Tyler, an herbal medicine
expert at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers covered the most popular remedies: St. John's wort for
depression, garlic for cholesterol and anticancer uses, gingko
biloba for treating dementia, ginseng as a tonic, saw palmetto for
urological problems, echinacea for colds and to enhance the immune
system and feverfew to treat migraine headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said a system should be developed to regulate herbal
remedies without the stringent requirements for synthetic drugs
enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA issued new rules in January to liberalize the claims
that can be made about the herbal remedies, but the conference
participants said what herb users need is more information.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no way that consumers can be assured that
what is on the label is actually in the package, other than the
reputation of the producer,'' Tyler said.

<HEADLINE> Russian mob allegedly joined Italian crime families in stock scam  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Acting more like a business seeking a consultant
with international experience than an organized crime family,
Italian mobsters sought help from their Russian counterparts to
take on Wall Street in a lucrative stock scheme, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch said the case resulted in an
indictment charging 19 people, including six alleged mobsters or
associates of crime families, and ''illustrates the continuing
relationship of organized crime in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   As the indictment was disclosed Thursday in Brooklyn, Lynch said
the mob ''sought to extend its reach into the lives of ordinary
citizens'' as Russian mobsters teamed up with four Italian
organized crime families in New York between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual combination of forces funneled millions of dollars
in illicit proceeds from stock sales through offshore banks before
the FBI stumbled upon documents in a storage locker that revealed
the large-scale stock fraud and money laundering plot,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those charged had been captured earlier in a similar
prosecution in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. That case involved
stock manipulation by small brokerage houses protected by the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch estimated the mobsters reaped at least $40 million in
illegal profits, while Lewis Schiliro, the FBI's assistant director
in charge of the New York office, said profits could easily exceed
$60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said the case proved once again that organized crime
families, closed off from traditional avenues of income through
aggressive prosecutions, had sought new opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''A recurrent theme in our investigations has been that the mob
goes where the money is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those indicted in the case were a captain in the Bonanno
crime family, a soldier in the Genovese family, an associate in the
Colombo family and an associate and a soldier in the Gambino
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian gangsters used their expertise in money laundering
and offshore bank accounts while the New York mob families lent
their skills at muscling their way to money through threats and
intimidation, Schiliro said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities refused to divulge exactly how the organized crime
families protected the scheme or if anyone was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said help from the mob was welcomed by two now-defunct
brokerage firms in downtown Manhattan -- White Rock Partners &AMP; Co.
and State Street Capital Markets Corp.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, top executives at the two companies
joined other brokerage firms and brokers to create fraudulent
securities schemes and then launder tens of millions of dollars in
illicit profits.
</P>
<P>
   The firms allegedly acquired control of tiny companies by
quietly buying enough stock in them, then artificially boosted
their value by paying unscrupulous brokers to persuade unwitting
investors that they should buy stock in the same companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the stock value rose six or seven points, the firms cashed
in by selling their secretly held shares, causing the value of the
stocks to plummet, the indictment alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The profits were laundered by transferring money several times
through offshore bank accounts until it had the appearance of
having been legitimately earned.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said one company whose securities were manipulated by the
mob was essentially dormant until it became part of the scheme.
Three companies, she said, were listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said the companies who solicited help from the mob
learned over time that organized crime had become part of their
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they're in, they're in for good,'' Schiliro said.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Education IRAs  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate-passed bill that would let parents
create tax-free savings accounts for education expenses including
private school tuition is sparking anew a battle over whether the
government should help taxpayers fund non-public education.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed the Senate 61-37 Thursday, would
expand the current $500-a-year savings account program for college
education, allowing inclusion of elementary and secondary schools
and allowing parents for the first time to use the money for
private or parochial school tuition from kindergarten through 12th
grade.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has yet to come up in the House, where its prospects
are uncertain. Clinton administration officials have said they
would recommend the president veto the legislation, as he has twice
in the past. The Senate was six votes shy of what would be needed
to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Clear battle lines were drawn during Senate debate, with
Democrats calling the measure an assault on the nation's public
schools akin to previously defeated proposals to give government
vouchers to parents to use to send their kids to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The House last year rejected a voucher plan that could have
given families of poor children $3,500 each to attend private
schools if their public schools were failing academically or deemed
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly what this bill is, is a shined up version of vouchers
that is going to steal money from public tax dollars to go to
private schools,'' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said of the new
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would increase the contribution level from the
current $500 to $2,000 and allow the tax-free earnings to be used
for expenses, including transportation and tutors, associated with
any K-12 school -- public, private or parochial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fifty percent of the benefits of this bill go to private
schools,'' said Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn. ''This bill does nothing
about class size, nothing about the quality of teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hailed the measure as the first step in giving the
nation's education system a much-needed boost. A few Democratic
supporters contended the measure was worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   ''No senator can come to this floor with any proposal solving
every problem,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, the
Democratic co-author of the bill. The education savings accounts
are ''the opening shot in a revolution in American education.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a sponsor of the measure with
Torricelli, said the bill was ''historic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents new ideas in education reform for the new
millennium,'' Coverdell said. ''I only hope that President Clinton
will join the Senate in its rejection of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to attach several amendments,
including ones dealing with teacher quality and school
construction. One that did pass, 91-7, by Sen. Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., establishes a $7 million grant program to educate students
and parents about the dangers of gun violence, including safe gun
storage. The measure was prompted by this week's shooting of a
6-year-old girl at a Michigan school.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which also would make savings in prepaid tuition plans
tax free and expand tax breaks for employer-provided educational
assistance, is a mainstay of the Republican agenda for improving
K-12 education.
</P>
<P>
   Education savings accounts already exist to help families save
for college, but Republicans want parents to have the option of
using the funds to pay for secondary and elementary education too.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is opposed by teachers' unions, and Clinton vetoed a
similar bill in 1998. He said the benefits mainly go to richer
families and that the plan would drain money away from the public
school system. Last year, education savings accounts were part of
the Republican's $792 billion tax cut plan that the president
vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans added provisions to raise the income levels a
married couple could earn and still participate in the program from
a $160,000 maximum to $220,000. Lawmakers also passed a proposal by
Delaware Sen. William Roth, the Finance Committee chairman, to
allow the budget surplus to pay for the proposal, estimated to cost
about $10 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's amendment also makes the program permanent; it was
originally scheduled to last until 2003.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Voters Focus on Issues  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL CHAVEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEBELLO, Calif. (AP) -- Two things never seem to change at the
Krazy Kone silkscreening store on Whittier Boulevard. The store
keeps a faded ice cream cone sign on the roof, though it stopped
selling scoops years ago, and its Hispanic proprietor, Lydia Leon,
will never vote for anyone but Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, however, has a different take.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always vote,'' said Ray Leon, 36. ''But as far as a party, I
don't even remember how I'm registered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leon family, which caters to the youth sports market in this
primarily Hispanic, middle-class city known as the ''Beverly Hills
of East L.A.,'' is symbolic of the increasingly complex Hispanic
electorate. Unlike a generation ago, they are more likely to put
issues over party, potentially reshaping California's fluid
politics.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Hispanic voters will loom large Tuesday in
California's presidential primaries, when 162 Republican delegates
and 367 Democratic delegates will be awarded in the country's most
important contest.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics made up 11.6 percent of the state's electorate in the
1996 presidential election, which is expected to increase to 13.4
percent this year, according to the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, they accounted for 4.7 percent of voters in 1996,
projected to increase to 5.4 percent this year, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interesting thing about the Latino electorate is it can't
be pigeonholed into one party or another,'' said Harry Pachon,
president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a nonprofit
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters, analysts say, became aware of their clout in
the last decade in response to ballot measures endorsed by former
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. Most notable among them was
Proposition 187, which sought to end government benefits for
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   They showed their strength in November 1998 when a record 54
percent turned out to help elect Democrats, including Gov. Gray
Davis. Cruz Bustamante also was elected lieutenant governor,
becoming the first Hispanic elected to statewide office in more
than 120 years.
</P>
<P>
   Though a recent report by Pachon's group showed that 66 percent
of Hispanics in 1998 registered as Democrats, it would be a mistake
to believe they will always vote along party lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not talking fourth- or fifth-generation Democrats,''
Pachon said. ''We're talking first- or second-generation, where
there's a potential for crossover voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics tend to support Democratic themes such as universal
health care and gun control. But in largely Catholic cities like
Montebello, they also favor anti-abortion laws and school vouchers,
traditional Republican party planks, Pachon said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that both parties are courting Hispanic voters --
from candidate visits to predominantly Hispanic cities, appearances
on Spanish-language Univision and an increase in Spanish-language
advertising, said Luis Arteaga, associate director of the San
Francisco-based Latino Issues Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''All indications are that they (the candidates) will continue
to be engaged throughout the summer,'' Arteaga said.
</P>
<P>
   One target may be Montebello, a city of 60,000 about 10 miles
east of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Once a city of immigrants, it is wealthier now and more
conservative with its bevy of Hispanic-run law offices, medical
centers and restaurants. East Los Angeles, itself, is the
traditional heart of Hispanic L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Barreto, a 38-year-old professional who works in the
area, represents a combination that is becoming less rare: Hispanic
and Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The securities broker-dealer noted that Hispanics helped elect
Republican Richard Riordan twice as mayor of Los Angeles, have
endorsed Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in New York and
re-elected Bush to the governor's office twice in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the Latino voter, it depends on who is running and what
the issue is,'' said Barreto, a co-chairman of Bush's California
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Army, Marine Cooks Go To Battle  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEE, Va. (AP) -- Ready, aim, flambe.
</P>
<P>
   A few good men are wielding kitchen utensils instead of weapons
at Fort Lee this week in a kind of culinary war game.
</P>
<P>
   From pork schnitzel and minestrone to jalapeno cornbread and
upside-down pineapple cake, the Army's best cooks -- plus one team
from the Marine Corps -- have whipped up a fine mess.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the trailers and trade camouflage fatigues for white
jackets, and you just might be able to imagine yourself in an
upscale restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of folks outside the Army still believe everything they
read in the Beetle Bailey comic strip,'' said Lt. Col. Tim
Fitzgerald, head of the Army's food program, as he inspected teams
busily preparing meals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look around and you don't see Cookie out here, (an) old
guy in a T-shirt and a belly hanging over. ... The Army cook and
the Army food will surprise most people.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition, now in its 25th year, has a category for
individual Chef of the Year, plus a contest for teams who get a
batch of mystery ingredients and four hours to prepare dinner for
50 in a mobile field kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Final results will be announced next week, when the cooks find
out whether Fort Stewart, Ga., has successfully defended its title.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the irony of a military cookoff is thicker than the
gravy. With 1.4 million active duty mouths to feed, it's no
surprise that the service is known more for quantity than for
quality when it comes to food preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But, Army officials said, concern about soldiers' quality of
life -- an issue that has come up in the presidential campaign -- has
led them to borrow techniques from the industry to improve the
food.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, military meals are tastier, more varied and more
''nutritionally advantageous'' than ever, said Fitzgerald, who
directs the Army division that trains about 5,200 Army and Marine
cooks a year at Fort Lee.
</P>
<P>
   During the field competition, all contestants had the same
ingredients and were assigned the same menu, so cooks had to find a
way to make their meals stand out. The results were judged on
criteria like presentation, serving temperature, flavor, texture,
and doneness.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far in the whole competition they've been throwing me curve
balls,'' said Lance Cpl. Jabari Catledge, a Marine stationed at
Cherry Point, N.C. The Chicago native was one of five Marines
representing the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said the competition is just another way to get cooks
-- the Army doesn't confer the title ''chef'' -- to care about their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's two things you don't mess with -- you don't mess with a
soldier's mail, and you don't mess with his chow,'' he said. ''We
call it a combat multiplier. You take a troop ... and the
difference between feeding him cold slop and something he
recognizes and wants, that's a motivational thing. It makes a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the first ones that these guys see once they get up in
the morning,'' said Army Staff Sgt. Alton Greene, a 15-year veteran
from Detroit who was on the winning team last year and traveled
from South Korea for this year's competition. ''If it's not right
... you can just mess up your whole day.''

<HEADLINE> Inspection schedules at nuclear plants may be revised  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- If corrosion by water turns out to be the
definitive cause of last month's accident at the Indian Point 2
nuclear power plant, the industry's inspection patterns may be up
for review.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Thursday that the brief
release of radioactive steam was probably caused by superheated,
highly pressurized water corroding a nickel-alloy tube from the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said that based on a videotape from a
remote-controlled camera sent into the tube, ''it's probable that
this was stress corrosion cracking,'' although a final conclusion
is still weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, radioactive water heated in the reactor leaked from
one of the generator's 32,000 tubes into the clean water that
surrounds them. As a result, there was a small discharge of
radioactive steam into the atmosphere. There were no injuries and
the increase in radioactivity was too small to be measured,
officials said. Still, it prompted the first alert in the plant's
26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison, which operates the plant 35 miles north of Times
Square, said its last inspection in 1997 showed no suggestion of a
crack in the tube that leaked. The plant has had less than two
years of operating time since then, and the NRC granted Con Ed's
request for a year's postponement of an inspection scheduled for
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with Con Ed on Wednesday, NRC investigators
suggested that if the crack could appear, deepen and break open
between inspections, the inspection schedule might have to be
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   ''If necessary, we will re-evaluate our own standards,'' said
Brian Sheron, the NRC's associate director for project licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed Vice President Stephen Quinn said a decision on more
frequent inspections should be made ''on sound, technical
knowledge'' and should await the completion of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the water in the tube starts out in a highly purified
state and is much less corrosive than ordinary tap water. But
because it is heated to 500 degrees and pressurized to 2,200 pounds
per square inch, it can stress the tube that carries it.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan also noted that the leak occurred in a U-shaped portion
of the tube, which imparts additional stress, and that water flows
through it at rates up to 70,000 gallons per minute. The tube's
inside diameter is seven-eighths of an inch and the thickness of
its walls is one-twentieth of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The belief was that this material would hold up very well over
time to those sort of pressures and temperatures, but they have
been more susceptible to corrosion than initially was believed,''
Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   James Riccio, senior analyst at Public Citizen in Washington,
said the alloy in the tubes, called inconel 600, has been shown to
be subject to stress problems even when exposed to pure water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem isn't the water,'' he said. ''The problem is Con
Ed has water-soluble steam generator pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the utility should be forced to install replacement
generators they have owned since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   David Lochbaum, nuclear safety engineer for the Union of
Concerned Scientists in Washington, said that if the current
inspection finds other tubes in the generators have been corroded
and stressed, there could be another tube rupture if they're not
replaced.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Was Unpredictable Senator  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pork was flying as must-pass legislation
barreled through Congress in the waning days of 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., added $2 million for a lighthouse
at Nantucket. Rep. Clarence D. Long, D-Md., secured $1 million for
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., got money, too -- $400,000 for a
commission to study the famine of 1932-33 in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   His sometimes quirky taste in favored causes made Bradley an
unpredictable lawmaker during his 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He clung tenaciously to some major issues, like tax reform, but
stood at a distance from others, such as the 1994 debate over
universal health care. Though often loyal to his party, Bradley
split from Democratic leaders in key votes on military aid to
Nicaragua and school choice.
</P>
<P>
   And though he was often a fighter for his state, he sometimes
seemed most engaged when involved with causes either global or
historic -- or in the case of the Ukraine famine, both.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley waged a lengthy but futile effort to get the federal
government to return 1.3 million acres in South Dakota to the Sioux
Indians. He helped win debt relief for struggling Third World
nations.
</P>
<P>
   On an issue that got a lot more attention, a Republican
colleague called him the ''godfather'' of the 1986 tax overhaul
that lowered rates and eliminated some tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters complimented his focus on ''big reform.'' But
detractors said he was often missing when horses were traded and
legislative deals struck.
</P>
<P>
   ''No pun intended, but he kind of stood above the crowd in many
ways,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg, Bradley's fellow New Jersey
Democrat, once said of his 6-foot-5 colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself once wrote, ''A small amendment on a crime bill
serves a senator's campaign more than it serves the
criminal-justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley joined the Senate in 1978, he became a student of
its parliamentarian, Floyd Riddick, who had written the book --
literally -- on the chamber's rules and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to be a workhorse, not a showhorse,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, former Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said Bradley
sometimes would call for votes on pet issues even when he knew he
would lose badly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd walk out and do something that at least half of us
thought ought to get done, but it wasn't the right time or place to
do it,'' Durenberger said. ''We'd sit there and say, 'Oh my god,
why does he have to do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Stamos, Bradley's chief of staff from 1991 to 1993, said
Bradley ''was not known as someone who makes compromises on
principles or plays political games. That isolated him from some of
the Senate club. But that's part of what made him great.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey voters sent Bradley to the Senate a year after he
completed a 10-year basketball career with the New York Knicks. And
he quickly latched on to some home-state causes such as beach
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's opponent for the
Democratic presidential nomination, has described him as a defender
of New Jersey's pharmaceuticals industry against efforts to reduce
drug prices. But Bradley's record was more nuanced. On some
occasions he backed efforts to produce cheaper generic versions of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of another major state industry, Bradley argued
successfully for a law that prohibits Atlantic City casinos from
offering sports betting.
</P>
<P>
   On international issues, Bradley was an avowed free trader and
an avid student of the Soviet Union. He opposed a space-based
missile defense system and voted against the mobile MX missile and
B-2 stealth bomber. He also voted ''no'' on the 1991 resolution
authorizing military force against Iraq in the Gulf War, saying
economic sanctions should be given more time.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, Bradley supported higher taxes on
cigarettes and new hurdles for those who want to buy guns or become
gun dealers. He supported expansion of the death penalty to cover
certain drug-related crimes. He repeatedly fought against farm
subsidies, but told voters in Iowa during the presidential campaign
that he now regrets that stance.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, he was most passionate on the topic of
race. In a 1992 speech, he rapped a pencil against the lectern 56
times to dramatize the beating of black motorist Rodney King by Los
Angeles police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As much as by any legislative initiative, Bradley was defined by
a contrarian streak. He voted against most of his fellow Democrats
to support aid to the Nicaraguan Contras in 1986 and, on multiple
occasions, to approve government tax breaks or vouchers to help
families afford private or religious school.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of three senators who both supported President
Reagan's spending cuts and opposed his tax cuts of 1981 -- a
position, he later said, that ''would have entirely prevented the
debt explosion of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's Senate style made him something of a loner among
Democrats, but it also gained him friends across the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., recalls how
Bradley, still new to the Senate, reacted when Simpson introduced a
controversial bill granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''He sat down and asked me questions about the bill -- employer
sanctions, verification systems,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I finished 90 minutes later, he said, 'You've answered my
questions and I'll be supporting you fully.' I've never had another
senator do that in that way.''

<HEADLINE> Sleep Can Numb a Musher's Mind  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Mushers can't outrun their need for
sleep on the 1,150-mile Iditarod trail through Alaska's wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the record 81 teams leaving Anchorage for Nome will
be at their freshest. But eventually, doctors say, fatigue can take
over -- impairing judgment, forcing eyes shut and sometimes even
causing hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have long-distance competitive races like this,
(mushers) become very sleep-deprived,'' said Anne Morris, medical
director of the Sleep Disorder Center at Providence Alaska Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Iditarod mushers spend nine days or more on the trail to Nome,
day and night. The race goes over two Alaska mountain ranges,
crosses frozen rivers and travels miles of wind-swept Bering Sea
ice.
</P>
<P>
   While there are mandatory breaks, including a 24-hour stop, they
must feed and water their teams, change their dogs' booties and do
everything else needed to keep their sleds on the go.
</P>
<P>
   While dogs spend about equal time racing and resting, mushers'
chores eat into their breaks. Their sleeping routines also become
scrambled as they choose their rest and run periods based on
factors such as trail conditions, temperatures and their team's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe halfway through the race, the need for deep sleep will
take its toll, Morris said: ''There will be such a pressure for
dream sleep built up, you will begin to dream -- but you are
awake.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, most mushers are racing on autopilot, Morris
said. That's fine ''if you don't have a moose walk in front of your
team,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mushers should take their sleep cues from their dogs,
Morris said. The animals are excellent nappers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, veterinarians checked over the 1,650 Iditarod
dogs, examining everything from the toughness of their feet to
their levels of body fat. A typical dog loses about 10 pounds on
the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, electrocardiograms have performed on the dogs to
weed out those with heart problems. Usually one or two are weeded
out each year, said Ken Hinchcliff, an associate professor of
veterinary medicine at Ohio State University who is studying the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Sled dogs' hearts are so big that, at first glance, vets might
think the dogs suffer from heart disease, Hinchcliff said. The
organs look more like those found in rowers -- large and muscled --
rather than those of the marathoners that they are, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests have also shown that between 30 percent and 50 percent of
Iditarod dogs have heart murmurs. But the condition is considered
normal -- just ''a function of getting fit,'' Hinchcliff said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ark. Sen. Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A former state senator has pleaded
guilty to a federal charge that he masterminded a racketeering ring
that bilked state programs benefiting children and injured school
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his plea prosecutors said they would drop 128
other charges against Nick Wilson, a 29-year state senator from
Pocahontas, in northeast Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''My intention was to defraud the state of money for my
benefit,'' Wilson told U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. at
plea hearing Thursday. ''It was fraudulent and it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 57, also agreed to testify against three former Senate
colleagues. He faces up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and
also must repay between $480,000 and $1.2 million, the final amount
not yet determined.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also agreed to drop an appeal of his November conviction
in a federal tax evasion case. He was sentenced to 18 months in
that case last month but has yet to go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his cooperation, prosecutors said they would
drop the other charges and recommend that any prison term for
Wilson be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Wilson admitted defrauding the state between
1993 and 1998 by receiving kickbacks from hand-picked lawyers who
charged the state exorbitant fees for work on child-support
enforcement cases.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator said he also helped pass legislation to
provide state-paid attorneys for children in custody cases. Lawyers
gave him part of the money they received.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and nine co-defendants -- most of them past or present
legislators or state officials -- were indicted last April. Five
have them have pleaded guilty, two others had the charges dropped
in return for their cooperation, and three are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> FBI Joins Probe of Ex-CIA Director  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials are evaluating
reports from new FBI interviews about the CIA's handling of
computer security breaches by the spy agency's former director John
Deutch, law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI completed a round of interviews with two or three
figures in the Deutch affair over the past two weeks and sent
reports to the department, one law enforcement official said
Thursday, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews focused on whether top CIA officials withheld
information about Deutch from Justice rather than on Deutch's use
of unsecured computers to store and work on thousands of top secret
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials have not requested further inquiry by the FBI,
this official said. An initial review of the FBI interviews has not
revealed sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to pursue the inquiry,
according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch affair also is being investigated by Republicans in
Congress. And the renewed Justice interest in the case -- after the
department declined to bring criminal charges last spring -- played
a role in the refusal his week by former CIA general counsel
Michael J. O'Neil to testify before the Senate Intelligence
Committee unless he is given immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   With the FBI's involvement, one law enforcement official said,
the Justice Department was conducting a preliminary inquiry, which
is short of a full criminal investigation but more serious than a
simple review, which Attorney General Janet Reno announced late
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said her department was taking a fresh look at the entire
case, but law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Thursday they are particularly interested in
whether ''we missed something or whether there was something we
didn't know about in our previous investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a yearlong probe that ended last April, the department's
criminal division looked extensively into Deutch's use at home of
an unsecured computer, which occasionally was connected to the
Internet, to work on and store top secret documents.
</P>
<P>
   The division concluded Deutch's lapses were sloppy rather than
criminal. It referred the case to the CIA inspector general for
administrative discipline. Last August, the CIA stripped Deutch of
his security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after O'Neil refused to testify voluntarily, he was
subpoenaed this week to appear before the Senate Intelligence
Committee next Wednesday to explain why it took the agency so long
to act on Deutch's violation of security rules.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members want to ask O'Neil whether he withheld information
about his former boss from agency investigators and the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, who left the agency in October 1997, at first declined
to turn over computer storage cards from Deutch's computers and
delayed notifying the Justice Department of the matter, according
to an unclassified version of the CIA inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   That report said O'Neil and Nora Slatkin, the CIA's former
executive director and now an official with Citigroup, acted in a
manner that ''had the effect of delaying a prompt investigation of
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin has agreed to appear before the committee although a
time has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil's lawyer, Roger Spaeder, sent a letter to the committee
saying he had advised O'Neil that ''he should not testify at this
time'' because Reno had decided to review her earlier decision
declining prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   However, Spaeder wrote that O'Neil ''is prepared to cooperate
and testify'' if the committee were to give him immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he did not think
the panel would agree to the immunity request.
</P>
<P>
   Although Deutch's security lapse was found in December 1996 as
he was leaving the agency, the CIA did not submit a report to the
Justice Department until March 1998 and did not notify
congressional oversight panels until June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, Deutch processed
thousands of highly classified documents on unprotected home
computers that he and family members also used to connect the
Internet, making the information potentially vulnerable to hackers,
according to the CIA inspector general's report. Deutch has
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   CIA Director George Tenet has apologized for his own delay in
forwarding the information to the Justice Department and Congress,
but said the delay wasn't intentional.

<HEADLINE> Officer Wounded After Calif. Heist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- A group of pistol-waving men robbed a
bank Thursday and fought a gunbattle with police, leaving one
suspect and an officer wounded and several people holed up in
nearby buildings during a manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   Police captured three men and a woman after cordoning off an
area around a Motel 6 for nearly eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that we have all suspects in custody,'' Sgt. Ed
Bowen said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   At least one large-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a duffle
bag of cash were recovered, Bowen said. He declined to say how much
was in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Three men armed with handguns took over a Washington Mutual
Savings Bank branch shortly before 12:30 p.m., police said.
Arriving officers saw the men jump into a stolen Chevrolet and they
chased the car for several blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The men jumped out of the car in the hotel parking lot, where
one opened fire at police, Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Alexander, 34, was shot once in the torso and was listed in
critical but stable condition after surgery, Bowen said. Alexander
is on parole for bank robbery, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Rob Heiduk, a 10-year veteran, was shot in the hand
and underwent surgery Thursday night. His was listed in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
   SWAT teams went door to door at the motel. About a half-hour
after the robbery, they detained a woman in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe she was there with another vehicle that (the
robbers) were going to transfer into,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   A second man was taken into custody in a motel room about four
hours after the holdup, and a third man hiding in a nearby drainage
culvert was captured around 8 p.m., police said. Their identities
were not immediately known, Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren were kept in nearby classrooms and a restaurant
was evacuated during the search, police said.

<HEADLINE> State lawmakers want real estate agents to help spread the word  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Legislature is considering a
proposal that would require real estate agents and landlords to
tell prospective buyers and tenants how to find out if a convicted
sex offender lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ahearn, executive director of the group Parents for
Megan's Law, said Thursday that the law would help parents access
sex offender information ''and Realtors will not be held
responsible for monitoring the whereabouts of registered sex
offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the legislation is modeled after a system already in
effect in California and a number of other states.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes in response to a January ruling by State
Supreme Court Justice Bruce D. Alpert. He said that current laws do
not require real estate agents to inform prospective home buyers
about the backgrounds of their neighbors -- even if one of the
neighbors is a pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York adheres to the doctrine of caveat emptor,'' or buyer
beware, Alpert said in his Jan. 7 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Deputy Majority Leader Dean Skelos, who sponsored Megan's
Law legislation in New York, said this proposal would amend the
state's Real Property Law. ''This bill will ensure that prospective
home buyers are empowered with the tools that they need to make
responsible, informed decisions relating to their family's
safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law was named for 7-year-old Megan Kanka, who was killed
in 1994 by a sex offender living across the street. The slain New
Jersey girl's name became synonymous with nationwide efforts to
register sex offenders and provide people with a means of finding
out if such offenders are living in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presence of a sex offender in a neighborhood may be a
critical issue for parents in the selection of where to reside,''
said Assemblyman Steven Englebright.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Chirco, a spokeswoman for the Long Island Board of
Realtors, said her organization is against the proposal, and that
customers have the ability to locate information on sex offenders
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a real estate perspective, obtaining information about
registered sex offenders should fall under the same category as
obtaining information concerning publicly recorded documents with
respect to the title of the house, recorded deeds, mortgages,
judgments or other recorded liens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, people can call 1-900-288-3838 to
learn if a specific person is a convicted sex offender. To obtain
the information, a caller needs to have the person's name and
either the specific address, Social Security number, birth date or
driver's license number for the person.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Lack, another sponsor of the notification bill, said
Thursday he and Englebright are also proposing legislation that
would reduce to 50 cents the current $5 charge to call the
registry.
</P>
<P>
   The state has more than 10,000 sex offenders registered, Ahearn
said.

<HEADLINE> S.C. House Amends King Holiday  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- State House members stripped the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s name from a bill creating an official
holiday for state workers and sent the legislation back to a
committee to be reworked.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators voted to name the holiday Civil Rights Day and sent
the bill back to the House Judiciary Committee with an amendment
that included protection for Confederate monuments and a statement
that the Confederate flag is not a racist symbol.
</P>
<P>
   House members split along racial and party lines in debate
Thursday. As black Democrats left the chamber, they decried what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prevailing sentiment here was that there would be no
holiday honoring a black person in this state,'' said Rep. Joe
Neal, the House leader of the Legislative Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social
Change in Atlanta said South Carolina is the only state that does
not recognize a King holiday for all state employees. Under
existing law, state employees can choose to take the King holiday
off, or one of three Confederate-related holidays.
</P>
<P>
   To ''link the issue to the Confederate flag obviously is an
attempt at racial politics of the lowest kind and that's exactly
what happened,'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans saw Thursday's tangle differently.
</P>
<P>
   While they want to acknowledge the civil rights struggle,
''there is also a need to acknowledge that the War Between the
States is of ... significance to many South Carolinians as well,''
said Republican Rep. Al Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Neal countered that the House can't change people's minds on the
Confederate flag. South Carolina is the only state that still flies
the flag from its Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   The King holiday bill already had been approved in the Senate.
Lawmakers expect it to be changed by the Judiciary Committee yet
again and sent back to the House floor for another debate before
year's end. The House and Senate would then have to agree on a
compromise form of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, said he was disappointed because
most South Carolinians want the King holiday. ''Some on the House
floor instead choose to engage in petty bickering and inappropriate
statements,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Patients Rights Provision OK'd  </HEADLINE>
BY KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking for common ground in two competing
patients' rights bills, House and Senate negotiators agreed on a
provision that would allow pediatricians to serve as primary care
doctors for children under their parents' health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher questions, such as whom that provision would apply to
and should patients be able to sue health plans if care is denied,
have yet to be worked out as members of a congressional committee
begin forging a compromise between House- and Senate-passed bills
designed to enhance patients' rights against HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''My effort right now is to go through some of the patient
protections where we have a lot of similarities,'' said Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla., the conference committee chairman. ''Let's get
some wins; let's get some things we agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the committee's inaugural meeting Thursday, Nickles said
negotiators agreed to the pediatric care provision and were close
to adopting a compromise on provisions that would let women see
gynecologists without prior approval and allow patients to go the
nearest hospital -- even if it's not in their plan -- for emergency
room care and have it covered.
</P>
<P>
   People covered by managed care plans complain that they must get
approval from their primary care doctor to use even routine
specialists. Another concern is that in an emergency some patients
can't use the nearest hospital if it's not in their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Working out differences on the thorny issues of lawsuits and
applicability may not be as easy. The bipartisan House bill allows
patients to sue and covers 161 million Americans with private
insurance. The Senate bill, crafted by Republicans, prohibits
lawsuits and applies to 55 million people whose health plans are
exempt from state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe patients should be able to sue if health plans
deny care to cut costs and patients suffer as a result. President
Clinton, who supports the House bill, warned conferees Thursday
that he would veto the compromise bill if it prohibits lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not sign legislation ... that is a patient's bill of
rights in name only,'' Clinton said at a White House rally.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told conferees that the House
bill should be the benchmark against which to measure alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope all members can agree to accept its major provisions,''
said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say lawsuits will drive up premiums and force
employers to drop coverage. They're also against creating a federal
law that would encompass plans that are regulated by states,
arguing that state officials have a better understanding of what
protections are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said the Senate bill gives consumers a way to fight HMO
decisions. The bill lets patients appeal care decisions to an
external board and requires HMOs to provide the care if that's what
the board decides or reimburse patients if they go to another
provider for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think maybe the president and many members aren't aware of
how far we are,'' said Nickles. ''We don't have punitive damages.
Maybe that's what he wants, but I hope we don't go for that.
</P>
<P>
   Not all GOP lawmakers oppose patients' right to sue. Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., who is not on the committee but co-authored a
patients' rights bill in 1998, said Thursday that lawsuits are a
''fundamental American right when there is a dispute between the
parties and there are serious injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   And sixty-eight Republicans joined Democrats to pass the
bipartisan House bill last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is, with Americans strongly in favor
legislation establishing patients' rights, will re-election-minded
lawmakers work out their differences, craft a compromise that
Clinton won't veto and take a popular issue home to their
districts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries To Defuse IMF Spat  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fight between the United States and Europe
over who should head the International Monetary Fund does not show
any signs of abating despite some soothing words from President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The European candidate to head the 182-nation lending agency,
German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser, received the
largest share of votes cast in an informal straw ballot cast by the
IMF's 24-member executive board on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But no candidate received the necessary majority and even more
telling was the fact that countries representing 36 percent of the
IMF's voting shares abstained from the balloting, a group that
included the IMF's largest member, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF said in a brief statement that ''executive directors
will continue their consultations with each other and their
national authorities on the next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is hoping that Europe will relent and
find another European candidate to replace Koch-Weser. But it was
unclear when, or if, that would happen. Koch-Weser spent the day
before Thursday's balloting meeting with various executive board
members from developing countries trying to line up votes.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer, a naturalized American
who has been running the IMF since the departure last month of
Michel Camdessus, was second in the voting, and Eisuke Sakikibara,
a former top official of the Japanese Finance Ministry, was third,
according to the IMF statement that did not give vote totals for
the individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Before the voting, Clinton had sought to undo the damage done by
his administration on Monday when it angered the Germans by
publicly announcing the United States could not support Koch-Weser
because he lacked sufficient stature to head the agency that plays
the lead role in handling international financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am completely committed to having a European head of the
IMF. And it would suit me if the person were from Germany,''
Clinton told reporters at the White House. ''I'd like to see
Germany play a bigger role in all these international
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said the United States would not be supporting
Fischer, whom the president praised as an ''enormously able man,''
because another naturalized American citizen, James Wolfensohn,
heads the World Bank. Wolfensohn was born in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition over the past half century, an American has always
headed the World Bank and a European has headed the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's rejection of Fischer's candidacy was aimed at putting
to rest fears among Europeans that America's ultimate goal in the
IMF leadership battle is to win the post for Fischer, a close
friend and former teacher of Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's playing any games here,'' Clinton insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government has
expressed anger over how the United States has handled the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, Schroeder's national security adviser, said in
an interview published Thursday in The Washington Post, that ''the
United States now thinks it can throw its weight around as the
world's most powerful nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said the whole episode was ''a demonstration of how the
United States lacks the necessary sensitivity toward its allies,
and the response has been to unite the Europeans more than ever
against American bullying.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers on Thursday refused to directly answer questions about
published reports in Italy that he had approached Italian Treasury
Minister Giuliano Amato and asked him to serve in the IMF post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not endorsed any specific candidate. As the president
has made clear, it is our hope that a strong European candidate
with the requisite stature, expertise and ability to command global
consensus will emerge,'' Summers told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani edges ahead of Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has pulled ahead of
Hillary Rodham Clinton in their race for the U.S. Senate, according
to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute,
released Thursday, showed Giuliani favored by 48 percent of
registered voters, with Clinton backed by 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac poll released on Feb. 6, the day Clinton formally
entered the race, had Giuliani favored by 45 percent of New York
voters to 42 percent for the first lady, a statistical tie given
that poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac's polls over the past six months have shown the race
extremely close and often the gap between the two candidates has
been within the margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The latest telephone poll of 1,842 registered voters in New York
State was conducted Feb. 22-28 and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Some other polls have shown Giuliani in the lead, also with the
margin routinely in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp said the latest poll results were a reflection
of concerns many New Yorkers have about Clinton's move into New
York to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We New Yorkers can tell the difference between authenticity
and a script,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager.
He said his own candidate is ''direct, he's real, he's authentic.
He's New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked about the poll and about her own opinion of
the mayor Thursday in an interview on WCBS-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer Marcia Kramer wanted to know if Clinton had ever met
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sure have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is he a likable guy?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I don't know him that well,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   As for the poll findings -- specifically that the mayor leads
Clinton 51 percent to 37 percent among white women -- Clinton said
she has work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have an obligation to earn the vote of every New Yorker,
which I intend to do, and talk about the issues that are important
to me and to my friends and to women that I know here in New
York,'' Clinton said. ''It's a question of having people get to
know me and what I stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''I'm a very well-known, unknown person.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac institute in
Hamden, Conn., said ''white women have been a bellwether, voting
for the winner in every statewide race in New York since 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also leads Clinton 48 percent to 38 percent among
Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   The poll director noted that the mayor's favorability rating
among New York voters had reached its highest point since the
institute began charting the race in February of last year. In the
latest poll, 42 percent of voters had a favorable view of the
mayor. Thirty-four percent had a favorable view of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On other subjects Thursday, Clinton declined in the WCBS
interview to express an opinion on whether a federal monitor should
be appointed to oversee the New York Police Department in the wake
of the Amadou Diallo shooting and another fatal shooting of a black
man by a police in the Bronx on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be a decision of the Justice Department and the
U.S. attorneys,'' she said. She also offered no opinion on whether
the four white cops acquitted in connection with Diallo's death
should be allowed to resume their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are decisions that are going to have to be made by the
review process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the police need ''better training'' and that the
force should have a higher percentage of minorities to reflect the
communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady plans to offer more proposals for the NYPD in a
speech Sunday at Riverside Church, according to her spokesman,
Howard Wolfson.

<HEADLINE> CIA Official Tapped for Nuke Agency  </HEADLINE>
BY H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional critics of Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson's revamping of the government's nuclear weapons
programs, nevertheless, are welcoming his selection of the man who
will head the new weapons agency.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson on Thursday announced that a four-star general, who
currently is the No. 2 official at the Central Intelligence Agency,
will be nominated by President Clinton as administrator of the new
National Nuclear Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the new, semi-independent agency within the
Energy Department last year as part of its response to allegations
of lax security and possible Chinese theft of nuclear secrets at
weapons research labs.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force General John A. Gordon, deputy CIA director, is
expected to get easy confirmation by the Senate after which he will
take over the new agency, which officially became operational this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has a background as a physicist and once worked at
the Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico, will have to leave
the military to take the post.
</P>
<P>
   He was among four people recommended for the job by a search
committee. A widely respected member of the intelligence community,
Gordon was a member of President Bush's national security team and
has had a lengthy background in weapons development, nuclear arms
stockpile management and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ''With his extensive background and experience in national
security matters and proven leadership skills, General Gordon is
perfectly suited to serve as the first administrator,'' said
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The selection brought quick praise from some members of
Congress, including some who have been critical about the way
Richardson has implemented the law creating the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, who has accused Richardson's
skirting the law in the way he is organizing the agency, said the
selection of Gordon, nevertheless, was ''an excellent choice'' and
that his nomination was ''very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems like the kind of person that will not bow to
bureaucratic pressures,'' said Thornberry in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows the nuclear weapons program inside out,'' said Rep.
Heather Wilson, R-N.M., who worked for Gordon him when both were at
the National Security Council in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson hoped that by picking an agency chief with topflight
credentials in security and counterintelligence, he might blunt
congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year directed all Energy Department nuclear
weapons programs be consolidated under a semi-independent agency
within DOE to streamline the chain of command and strengthen
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson has complained that Congress made the agency too
independent from the rest of the Energy Department, and that it
conflicts with the department's overall counterespionage and
security activities.
</P>
<P>
   To address those concerns, Richardson has directed that a number
of key, senior DOE officials in security, counterintelligence and
environmental-health safeguards assume similar positions in the new
agency.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to circumventing the intent of Congress when it
created the new agency, some of the critics complained.
</P>
<P>
   ''It undermines the insulation that we tried to achieve with the
new agency,'' said Thornberry, who helped craft the law.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the nuclear weapons agency was the most significant
action Congress took last year in response to the uproar over
allegations that China had stolen nuclear secrets over the years at
federal nuclear weapons labs because of poor security and
inattention to potential espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy came to a head when a Los Alamos weapons lab
scientist was fired in March after a three year -- some say botched
-- investigation by the FBI and Energy Department. Although never
charged with espionage, the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was arrested in
December on charges that he mishandled and illegally copied secret
nuclear weapons codes. He remains in jail awaiting trial. He has
denied giving secrets to anyone.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Coral Reef Protection  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants at least
one-fifth of America's coral reefs set aside for protection as
''ecological reserves'' where fishing, certain boating and other
environmentally harmful activities would be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposed an ''action plan'' on Thursday to
reverse the declining trend that has already seen a tenth of
America's coral reefs disappear and another two-thirds at risk from
overfishing, pollution and commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to save the roughly 8,600 square miles of U.S.
coral reefs will involve 11 agencies, state and territorial
officials and private groups including environmentalists and
fishing interests, officials said. It will be headed by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The coral reef crisis we are facing threatens the marine
ecosystem. It is absolutely critical that we act now,'' said NOAA
Administrator James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   America's coral reefs are mainly off Florida, Hawaii, the Virgin
Island and Puerto Rico and in the Pacific trust territories.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, based on recommendations made by a special
presidentially appointed task force, calls for developing a
scientific consensus on what areas should be set aside as
ecological reserves where fishing and other disruptive activities
would be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to give at least 20 percent of U.S. coral reefs such
protection by 2010 to ensure that the reefs are replenished. The
plan also calls for increased mapping of coral reefs and additional
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing interests -- both commercial and recreational -- have been
concerned about fishing bans. Some recreational fishing interests
have suggested fish-and-release policies in the protected areas.
However, marine biologists said that would still be harmful to the
coral and the many species that are found in the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how the off-limits areas would be designated.
Officials said that was still to be worked out, but that
designations would be made jointly by federal, state and local
authorities with participation by environmentalists and commercial
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Rufe, president of the Center for Marine Conservation,
called the approach ''bold and visionary'' but said he was
concerned that it didn't address many of the pollution problems
that threaten the coral ecosystems in areas such as southern
Florida where there has been rapid growth and sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Baker acknowledged the shortcoming. ''The plan is a start,'' he
said, suggesting that the threats to coral reefs from nutrient and
chemical runoffs would have to be addressed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also questioned whether enough money would be
put into the reef protection plan, which they say will have to be
long-term over 10 or 20 years. The current budget calls for $21
million in federal spending for coral reef protection and the
administration has asked for $25 million for next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs have become a growing tourist attraction, accounting
for $2 billion to the tourist industry in Florida and Hawaii alone.
They also contribute about $200 million to the recreational and
commercial fishing industries and are primary source for new
medicines and biochemicals.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Has Worst Game of Career  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   After the worst game of his NBA career, Allen Iverson
couldn't
have been happier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iverson scored just five points on 2-for-18 shooting, ending his
64-game streak of double-figure scoring. But the Philadelphia
76ers, behind Toni Kukoc's 19 points, 11 rebounds and seven
assists, beat the Washington Wizards 87-84 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won,'' Iverson said. ''I'll go out there and play another
bad one as long as we win. I'm in a great mood. My teammates knew
that I was struggling and they stepped up big on the offense and
defense. I knew I was having a bad game once I started missing
layups. I usually don't miss layups.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson scored 35 points with a career-best 83 percent
(15-for-18) shooting from the field in Tuesday's 106-87 victory
over Dallas, a game he wasn't expected to play because of rotator
cuff injury.
</P>
<P>
   With the shoulder still taped, he missed his first six shots and
was 2-for-11 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started to kind of get mental after a while,'' said
Iverson, who shot a career-worst 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other NBA games, New York beat Milwaukee 109-94; Miami
defeated Seattle 101-83; Orlando got past Charlotte 104-96; Houston
edged Sacramento 102-99; Minnesota beat San Antonio 108-102;
Cleveland defeated Chicago 114-110 in overtime; New Jersey edged
Dallas 103-102; and Phoenix routed Indiana 118-87.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson made his presence felt on the defensive end, blocking
Chris Whitney's potential game-winning 3-point attempt with less
than five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''We held Iverson to five points,'' said Mitch Richmond, who led
Washington with 16 points. ''That's what we wanted to do, make the
other guys step up. They stepped up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Theo Ratliff had 17 points and 11 rebounds, and Aaron McKie
scored 16 as the visiting 76ers won for the fourth time in five
games. Eric Snow finished with 14 points before fouling out with
2:29 left.
</P>
<P>
   With Philadelphia trailing by one, Ratliff blocked Gerard King's
shot under the basket. Kukoc was fouled driving on Juwan Howard at
the other end and made both free throws with 30.6 seconds remaining
to put the 76ers up 85-84, their first lead since midway through
the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards had two chances to win, but Richmond's off-balance
fadeaway jumper on the baseline didn't come close. Kukoc got the
rebound and made one of two free throws with 13.5 seconds to go to
make it 86-84.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson got a piece of Whitney's long-range attempt, and Ratliff
added a free throw with 2.9 seconds left. Richmond's 3-pointer hit
the rim and bounced away as the buzzer sounded.
Knicks 109, Bucks 94:
</P>

visiting Milwaukee 36-17 to turn a six-point halftime deficit into
a 13-point lead.

Bucks, who lost for the ninth time in 11 games.

   Jamal Mashburn scored 29 points as Miami ended a six-year
drought against Seattle.

   The Heat, who played their third straight game without injured
center Alonzo Mourning, beat the SuperSonics for the first time
since Feb. 17, 1994, a span of nine games.

10th straight at home. Ruben Patterson scored 24 points and Vin
Baker 23 for Seattle.

lower abdominal strain.
Cavaliers 114, Bulls 110, OT:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rules Would Protect Wetlands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New regulations making it harder to build
roads or homes near small streams and creeks may go into effect
this year to protect thousands of acres of fragile wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The 172-page Army Corps of Engineers regulations finalized this
week would require developers and public agencies to get specific
permits for projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more,
down from the current minimum of three acres, The Washington Post
said in today's editions.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton administration does not withdraw the plan, it
will be published next week and take effect in June.
</P>
<P>
   America loses more than 100,000 acres of wetlands each year. The
regulations would cover about one-fourth of the nation's wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations,
was quoted by the Post as saying, ''These new rules should take
away the biggest weapon of mass wetlands destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction groups, developers and the National Association of
Counties say the Corps is simply trying to expand its budget by
creating new rules, which will cost them hundreds of millions of
dollars, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would create new obstacles for development
affecting wetlands in floodplains.
</P>
<P>
   While the Corps has scheduled a news conference for Monday to
discuss the regulations, the Post quoted unidentified sources as
saying the rules could be withdrawn at the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Try To Return Home  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A day after being turned
back by stone-throwing Serbs, ethnic Albanians said they would try
again today to return to their homes in the Serb-dominated sector
of this divided town.
</P>
<P>
   However, bad weather threatened those plans. NATO officials had
to close a footbridge today that was intended for ethnic Albanians
to use to return home, after heavy rains swelled the Ibar River
that divides the city into ethnic enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers offered to escort any ethnic Albanians who wanted
to go home across the main bridge. As of mid-morning, none had
accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three families had been due to return home Thursday over
the footbridge, U.N. spokeswoman Kirsten Haupt said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Bernard Kouchner, the top U.N. official in
Kosovo, Bajram Rexhepi, the leader of Kosovska Mitrovica's ethnic
Albanian community, said a new attempt to cross would be made
today.
</P>
<P>
   Serb community leader Oliver Ivanovic also met with Kouchner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is decided, and we will continue discussions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovska Mitrovica, 20 miles north of Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina, has been the scene of repeated ethnic unrest in
recent weeks, resulting in several deaths and dozens of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NATO announced it would allow up to 120 ethnic
Albanian families to return to homes they had fled on the
Serb-controlled north bank of the Ibar.
</P>
<P>
   To facilitate the return, NATO built a footbridge across the
river near three high-rise apartment houses where the ethnic
Albanians had been living.
</P>
<P>
   However, 150 Serbs, mostly women, assembled Thursday at the
northern end of the bridge despite a driving rain. When two ethnic
Albanian men tried to cross, they were sent back in a hail of
stones. French and Canadian troops rushed to the area but made no
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Later, peacekeepers strung barbed wire in front of the apartment
houses and took up guard positions around the area.
</P>
<P>
   Before his meeting with Kouchner, Ivanovic expressed regret over
Thursday's stone-throwing. But he said the Serbs did not want the
ethnic Albanians to return unless Serbs in isolated villages in the
nearby Vucitrn area were better protected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deeply regret what happened here,'' Ivanovic said. ''But
Serbs were angry because Albanians are returning to their homes
while two Serb villages in the area will soon be empty because
people have to move because of Albanian pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed violence in Kosovo has thwarted efforts by NATO and
Kosovo's U.N. administration to establish normality in the Serbian
province eight months after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced
an end to the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and the pullout of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, a top Yugoslav army general accused NATO of
attempts to destabilize Serbia by allowing ethnic Albanian
provocations in the southwestern Serbian region of Presevo and
other areas along the boundary with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic, the Yugoslav army commander in southern
Serbia, denied that the Yugoslav army was massing troops in the
region as NATO has alleged.
</P>
<P>
   And in a memorandum to the United Nations, the Yugoslav
government objected to planned March maneuvers of the NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yugoslavia has never consented to military maneuvers on its
territory ... especially by an alliance that carried out aggression
against it,'' state television quoted Miroslav Milosevic, a senior
foreign ministry official, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo formally remains a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.

<HEADLINE> Debate Tests Candidates' Positions  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While they exaggerated on taxes, overstated
election losses and left out some facts on education, the
Republican presidential candidates steered clear of any big
mistruths in their final debate before the Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's rationale on safety locks for handguns,
however, got a test.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor declared anew Thursday night that he
supported trigger locks for handguns but doesn't think laws
requiring them would be enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ''What, are you going to have trigger lock police knocking on
people's doors?'' he asked during a nationally televised debate
from delegate-rich California.
</P>
<P>
   But his questioner noted most of the proposed laws would simply
require gun manufacturers to sell the locks with the gun --
something that could be monitored and enforced easily, and doesn't
require police to go to people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's position on the locks also has evolved. In May 1999, he
said he did not favor mandatory trigger locks but supported
''voluntary safety locks on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he said he would sign such a law if Congress
passed it, but questioned whether it would be effective. On
Thursday, he simply said, ''I have no problems with trigger locks
being sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief rival, Sen. John McCain, engaged in some hyperbole
while accusing evangelical leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell
of leading the GOP down a wrong road.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator declared ''we have lost the last two
congressional elections.'' In fact, Republicans retained control of
Congress in each of the last two elections, but the size of their
majority has shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   Such exaggerations cropped up in the debate without any outright
mistruths.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the push and pull of this process, some of the natural
hyperbole is being toned down because they realize that they can be
called on it and they have been called on it,'' said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, a professor who studies political rhetoric at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Still, careful listeners could find things to balk at.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Bush suggested that taxes today ''are higher than
they've been since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   While the total tax dollars the government collects has been
rising, that's mostly attributed to the booming economy. But the
tax load being shouldered by most taxpayers has fallen as a result
of targeted tax cuts in recent years, Jamieson noted.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Congressional Budget Office reported last
summer that the effective individual income tax rate is at its
lowest point in 20 years for everyone but the richest 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Alan Keyes branded McCain ''pro-choice'' for
suggesting he would leave an abortion decision up to his daughter
if she became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Arizona senator has received a solid anti-abortion
rating for many years from the National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's commitment to opposing abortion has been challenged
recently despite that record.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, he told the San Francisco Chronicle he didn't think
the Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion should be
repealed. Under fire from conservatives, he backed off the remark.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bush criticized Title I federal school funding
because it does not include any accountability standards, such as
the standardized tests he proposes to measure student performances.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't mention is that President Clinton tried last year
to attach such standards to Title I but was blocked by members of
Bush's own party in Congress, who saw it as federal meddling in
local decision-making.

<HEADLINE> Lucas Tops Celebrity Earnings List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''The Force'' was with George Lucas, powering
the creator of the ''Star Wars'' franchise to the top of Forbes
magazine's list of celebrity money makers.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas earned $400 million in 1999 -- more than twice as much as
second place Oprah Winfrey, Forbes said Tuesday in releasing its
Celebrity 100 rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings appear in the financial magazine's March 20th
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' grossed more $430
million domestically and is the second-highest grossing movie
worldwide after ''Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's success put Lucas far ahead of Winfrey, whose talk
show and other ventures earned $150 million. Though he earned $267
million last year to top the list, Jerry Seinfeld wasn't among this
year's top 100.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing designer Giorgio Armani was ranked third with $135
million, followed by television producer David Kelley, creator of
Fox's ''Ally McBeal'' and ABC's ''The Practice,'' with $118
million. Actor Tom Hanks ranked fifth with $71.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were authors Tom Clancy ($66 million)
and Stephen King ($65 million); the band Backstreet Boys with $60
million; director/producer Steven Spielberg with $60 million; and
actor Bruce Willis with $54.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrities who made the list ran the gamut from golf pro
Tiger Woods (ranked 17th with $47 million) and race car driver Dale
Earnhardt (39th at $26.5 million) to Harry Potter author J.K.
Rowling (No. 24 with $40 million) and conservative talk show host
Rush Limbaugh (ranked 43rd with $22 million).
</P>
<P>
   Forbes created estimates based on figures compiled from
interviews with attorneys, managers, agents, executives and
entertainment insiders. It counts pretax gross income when it is
earned, not when the celebrities are paid.
</P>
<P>
   The business magazine released the list in conjunction with its
Forbes Celebrity 100 ranking, which combines income and media buzz
-- a blend of prominence on the Internet, magazine covers, TV and
radio and in newspaper clippings -- to come up with a measure of
future earning power.
</P>
<P>
   On that list, Lucas was second to actress Julia Roberts (12th on
the money list with $50 million in earnings). Winfrey was third,
followed by Hanks and former NBA superstar Michael Jordan, who was
23rd on the earnings list with $40 million.

<HEADLINE> Key Decision Looms for Balloonist  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN LIPMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Kevin Uliassi may have to cut short his attempt
to become the first solo balloonist to make it around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Because crossing the Atlantic took longer than anticipated -- he
had to change altitude several times to avoid thunderstorms --
Uliassi was to decide today if he had enough fuel and supplies to
make it across the Pacific and finish the journey, spokesman Scott
Lorenz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In any long distance balloon flight there are several points
where or a 'go' or 'no-go' decision has to be made,'' Lorenz said.
''It's water, water everywhere and it's several days without any
land in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Uliassi was due south of Mount Everest, traveling
southeast at 106 mph and an altitude of 32,300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching from a rock quarry near Rockford, Ill., on Feb.
22, he has traveled more than 12,500 miles in a zigzagging route
that has taken him almost halfway around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were looking good Thursday, Lorenz said, but any more
maneuvering might use up too much fuel and helium. Uliassi may have
to throw supplies -- even drinking water -- overboard to lighten his
load.
</P>
<P>
   Closely watching Uliassi's progress is adventurer Steve Fossett,
who holds the world solo balloon flight record -- 14,235 miles -- set
in 1998. That trip ended when a storm off the Australian coast sent
his balloon into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Uliassi's decision, he should be happy with his
attempt, Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would think in Kevin's case that he has to be very
pleased,'' Fossett said. ''He's making one of the finest balloon
flights ever, and he had not previously made a long balloon flight.
It's outstanding so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and English
balloon instructor Brian Jones became the first to circle the world
nonstop in a hot-air balloon, landing safely in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   To count as an around-the-world flight, a balloon must cross all
lines of longitude and must cover at least half the length of the
equator, according to the Federation Aeronautique Internationale,
the governing body of air sports.
</P>
<P>
   The distance around the globe at the equator is 24,902 miles.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Protest Curbs on Papers  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Hundreds of Muslim activists
rallied in northern Malaysia today, demanding the government lift
harsh restrictions on the country's most popular opposition
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by about 500 people came as more local and
international groups condemned a move by the government to curtail
the circulation of Harakah, a paper run by the fundamentalist
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, or PAS.
</P>
<P>
   The government amended Harakah's permit on Wednesday, limiting
the paper's publication to once a month instead of twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Members of PAS gathered after Friday prayers in the town of Alor
Star in the northern state of Kedah, unfurling a 180-foot-long
banner in front of a mosque, the national news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The group urged passers-by to sign the banner, which read:
''Keep Harakah at twice a week. From all the people of Kedah.''
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid had been under attack even before its permit was
altered. Its editor, Zulkifli Sulong, and its printer were charged
in January with sedition over a political article published in
1999, and the newspaper was repeatedly warned to remove its copies
from newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent attempt to squelch the newspaper has drawn protests
from opposition parties, human rights groups and volunteer agencies
within Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists today called
on Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to lift restrictions on Harakah
and repeal Malaysia's anti-press laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''The move to limit Harakah's circulation appears to be the
latest example of your administration's efforts to curb the
opposition press in Malaysia,'' CPJ said in a letter to Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, in a letter to Home
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, said ''the change looked like
censorship.'' Copies of the letters were faxed to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Malaysian rights group Aliran also accused the
government of ''abusing its authority with puerile and primitive
methods to safeguard its political interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Information Minister Khalil Yaakob said the restrictions were an
internal affair and overseas groups should not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's Home Ministry, which grants printing permits to
publications, has said Harakah violated conditions in its original
permit that prohibited sales to non-PAS members.
</P>
<P>
   PAS has not denied that non-members read the paper, but says it
has no way of limiting readership because copies can be passed from
one person to another. The organization said there was no law that
barred the party from freely displaying or advertising its paper on
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Harakah's sales skyrocketed as Mahathir's popularity plummeted
after the prime minister's firing of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, in
1998. The newspaper quickly turned into a forum for anti-government
voices as Anwar's sacking and his arrest triggered widespread
protests in the normally placid Southeast Asian nation.

<HEADLINE> Seinfeld To Buy Billy Joel Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ever wonder what you can buy with $40 million?
</P>
<P>
   Funnyman Jerry Seinfeld is buying a Long Island beach house. Of
course, this isn't just any house.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld spokeswoman Elizabeth Clarke told the Daily News that
the comedian is buying pianoman Billy Joel's East Hampton estate, a
12-acre property that includes a huge manor house, a guest house, a
pool and a barn. Other celebrities with homes in the neighborhood
are boxer Mike Tyson, financier Bruce Wasserstein, filmmaker Steven
Spielberg and ''60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld will reportedly pay between $35 million and $40 million
for the home where Joel has lived since the mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This is Seinfeld's third attempt to score a house in the
Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to but property belonging to Lee Radziwill -- the sister
of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis -- fell through and he recently was
outbid for a $16 million property by designer Helmut Lang.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on Offshore Drilling  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an
issue and asks
the presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question
and the responses:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Offshore Drilling
</P>
<P>
   Should companies that together spent over $1 billion to secure
oil leases off the California coast be allowed to drill on them or
should an existing moratorium be expanded to ban drilling in those
waters?
</P>
<P>
   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley: ''I have called for a ban on all new offshore
drilling in our most fragile coastal waters, including coastal
Florida and California waters, as I was able to ban drilling off
New Jersey's coast. Given the promise of the vice president as far
back as 1992 to ban offshore drilling, I was particularly
disappointed that Secretary Babbitt extended the 36 leases off
California's coast, to give the companies more time to argue for
their right to drill. Had the secretary done nothing, the leases
would have expired.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore: ''Protecting our precious coastal areas is critical to
maintaining a clean environment. I support the existing moratorium
on granting new leases to drill oil off the coasts of California
and Florida. As president, I will go even further to protect our
oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling, doing
everything in my power to ban new drilling off these sensitive
coasts -- even in areas already leased for drilling by previous
administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform:
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan: No response.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush: ''I support the current moratorium banning any
new leases for drilling off the coast of California. As governor of
Texas, I understand the importance of listening to state concerns.
I'll work with California state leaders and the local communities
to determine on a case-by-case basis whether or not the drilling
ought to go forward on the leases in place right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain: ''The leases for offshore oil drilling should never
have been granted without allowing Californians a legitimate voice
in the decision-making process. I believe it is up to the voters of
California to determine the fate of these leases, and as president,
I will respect the decision they make regarding the leases. The
people of California deserve to be heard, without being forced to
resort to legal action against their own government. As president,
I will see to it that the interests of the people of California
rise above the special interests of Washington, D.C.''

<HEADLINE> Blues Show Thrashers Who's Best  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best and worst the NHL has to offer faced off in Atlanta. It
wasn't hard to tell which team was which.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, which leads the league with 90 points, beat the
expansion Thrashers 5-2 Thursday night, the Blues' record-tying
10th straight road win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, to most of the guys, it kind of snuck up on us,''
goalie Jamie McLennan said after St. Louis equaled Buffalo's
1983-84 mark. ''We didn't know until people started talking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Colorado's Patrick Roy earned his 434th victory in
the Avalanche's 5-0 win over New Jersey, tying Jacques Plante for
second place on the NHL's career list. Roy needs 13 more wins to
tie Terry Sawchuk's record.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it was Montreal 5, Boston 2; Ottawa 5, the New York
Islanders 5; Vancouver 3, Anaheim 1; San Jose 4, Nashville 3; and
Carolina 5, Los Angeles 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, who own the league's best away record (22-8-2), have
outscored opponents 39-15 during the streak that started Jan. 21 at
Chicago. St. Louis, which has won 14 of 16, can break the record at
Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not going so well in the other dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Norm Maracle lost his ninth straight start for the
Thrashers, who have dropped four straight and 15 of 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got nine guys out of the lineup. We need some help,''
Atlanta coach Curt Fraser said. ''We've got to get some of these
guys that are hurt back in the lineup, and the sooner we do that
the sooner we'll get back to finding ways to win every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which only has 34 points, fell to 0-8 against Central
Division teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lubos Bartecko, a second-year right wing, scored twice and Pavol
Demitra added his 100th career goal for the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's meant a lot to me because I'm a young guy here,''
Bartecko said. ''It's my second year. We're just trying to play
every game hard. We have a great defense and great goalies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, 28-0-0 when leading after two periods, also got an
empty-net goal on Scott Pellerin's shot from near center ice.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight outing, McLennan stopped 14 Thrashers
shots as he improved to 8-3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Hnat Domenichelli and Nelson Emerson scored Atlanta's goals.
</P>
<P>
Avalanche 5, Devils 0
</P>
<P>
   Roy, in his 15th season, made 24 saves for his 48th career
shutout in Colorado's victory over New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Devils, the Eastern Conference leaders with 88
points, had not been blanked since Jan. 2, 1999 -- a span of 111
games.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic scored twice and Adam Deadmarsh, Milan Hejduk and Alex
Tanguay had goals 1:34 apart in the second period.
</P>
<P>
Canadiens 5, Bruins 2
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zholtok's tie-breaking goal in the third period snapped
Montreal's eight-game winless streak against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Shayne Corson scored twice and Benoit Brunet added a goal and an
assist for the Canadiens, who have won nine of 11. Montreal is 5-1
in its last six road games.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Samsonov gave Boston the lead and Eric Nickulas scored
his first NHL goal midway through the second period to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins only have three home victories since Nov. 18th, and
eight victories in 40 contests.
</P>
<P>
Islanders 5, Senators 5
</P>
<P>
   Wade Redden scored with 62 seconds left in regulation as Ottawa
rallied from a two-goal deficit in the third period to tie New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators allowed three short-handed goals to the Islanders,
who haven't beaten Ottawa in 17 games (12-0-5-1).
</P>
<P>
   Marian Hossa scored twice and Andreas Dackell and Colin Forbes
had the other goals for Ottawa, unbeaten in four games (3-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Dave Scatchard, Mike Watt and Olli Jokinen scored short-handed
goals for the Islanders, and Claude Lapointe had his sixth career
two-goal game.
</P>
<P>
Sharks 4, Predators 3

   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- For the second time in as many seasons,
the lowly Oregon State Beavers knocked off Arizona on their home
court.
</P>
<P>
   This loss might hurt the third-ranked Wildcats longer, however.
They could feel the pain right into the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Deaundra Tanner got off a perfect 3-pointer just before the
buzzer in overtime to stun Arizona 70-67 Thursday night, stopping
the Wildcats' seven-game winning streak and possibly costing them a
No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just kept battling, and eventually they hit the shot that
beat us,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Wildcats lessened the sting of another dismal season
for Oregon State (13-14, 5-11 Pac-10). The Beavers lost 17 straight
to Arizona until last season, when they scored the final four
points to upset the 'Cats 60-59.
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona (24-5, 13-2) loses a No. 1 seeding, it would follow
the lead of Stanford, which lost at Oregon State to end the 1998-99
regular season. The Cardinal went on to lose in the second round of
the NCAAs, but looks to be a lock for a No. 1 seeding this year.
</P>
<P>
   In other games involving ranked teams, it was No. 1 Stanford
111, Southern California 68; No. 2 Cincinnati 64, DePaul 62; and
No. 7 Michigan State 79, Minnesota 43.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State got its first win over a team ranked as high as No.
3 since Dec. 2, 1989, when the Beavers defeated No. 2 Arizona
84-61. That Oregon State team finished 22-7, the last winning
season for a program that was a national power during the 1980s,
but has fallen on hard times. Thursday's win might not even be
enough to save the job of coach Eddie Payne, who has one more year
left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner's game-winner put that issue on hold, and it came after a
frantic final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded turnovers in the final seconds before Arizona's
Jason Gardner had his shot blocked by Jason Heide with 14 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner rebounded, but the ball came loose. His team trailing
69-67, Heide wound up with it and dished off to Tanner, who stepped
behind the 3-point line and let the shot go from the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt real good, and I followed through. It was nothing but
net,'' said Tanner, who had 20 points. ''It was the biggest shot
I've ever made, easily.''
</P>
<P>
   With the roar of the crowd, the horn seemed to have sounded
before Tanner got the shot off, but replays showed there was 0.2
seconds left when the shot left his hands. After it swished
through, the fans poured onto the court. Arizona and Olson did not
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wright had 20 points and 15 rebounds, and Gardner and
Gilbert Arenas each had 16 points to lead the Wildcats, who now
must face a tough Oregon team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State and Arizona went to overtime tied at 60, and
Gardner sank two straight 3-pointers to start the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how many people were here, but I think all but
the 14 guys on our team had given up on us,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   With a sparse crowd of 5,538 cheering them on, the Beavers
climbed back with a layup by Clifton Jones and a 3-pointer by Josh
Steinthal that cut it to 66-65 with 2:11 left. Wright made three
free throws in two trips to the line, but his last shot missed,
leaving Arizona with a 69-67 lead and setting up the thrilling
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just didn't keep our composure,'' Wright said. ''We let
them crawl back in the game -- just like overtime, we were up six
and they came storming back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers almost had it won in regulation, taking a 60-57 lead
on Brian Jackson's two free throws with 15.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner tried a 3-pointer and fell to the floor in front of the
Wildcats' sideline. A foul was called on Jimmie Haywood, but there
appeared to be little contact.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner made all three free throws with seven seconds left to
tie it. The Beavers pushed the ball past halfcourt and called a
timeout with 1.5 seconds left to set up a final play, but Richard
Jefferson intercepted the inbound pass.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who played for the first time since breaking his
right foot in a victory at Stanford Jan. 8, played nine minutes and
was held scoreless on two field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   With Jefferson rusty and center Loren Woods out until the NCAA
tournament with an injured back, the Wildcats had just seven
scholarship players.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said before the place we'd miss Woods was on the defensive
end, not the offensive end,'' Olson said of his 7-foot-1 star, who
tied an NCAA record with 14 blocks against Oregon last month. ''We
got eaten alive in the second half in the post area.''
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Stanford 111, Southern California 68
</P>
<P>
   Casey Jacobsen had 23 points as Stanford (25-1, 14-1 Pac-10) won
its 13th straight game by double digits to move into first place in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad for visiting Southern California (14-13, 7-8)
late in the first half that Jarvis Turner, in street clothes,
reached out and grabbed Jacobsen's shirt as he dribbled toward the
basket and was given a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Cincinnati 64, DePaul 62
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon Martin scored 33 points and DerMarr Johnson completed a
miraculous comeback for Cincinnati with a 17-foot jumper with two
seconds left at DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats (27-2, 15-0 Conference USA) rallied from 17 points
behind in the second half, including a 10-point deficit in the
final 3:46.
</P>
<P>
   Martin took over in the final minutes, scoring eight points and
blocking a layup down the stretch to send DePaul (18-10, 8-7) to a
crushing defeat.
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Michigan State 79, Minnesota 43
</P>
<P>
   Mike Chappell scored 18 points, including a pair of 3-point
baskets to cap a 16-0 first-half run as host Michigan State beat
Minnesota (12-14, 4-11 Big Ten).
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans (22-7, 12-3) extended their school-record home
winning streak to 27 games and moved back into a tie for first
place with Ohio State with one game remaining.

<HEADLINE> White Supremacists Said Beat Man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man who refused to raise his arm in a Nazi
salute was severely beaten by six men who may be part of a white
supremacist group, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Mike Turk of the Marion County Sheriff's Department said
detectives are looking at a connection between the alleged
attackers -- who range in age from 18 to 24 -- and a white
supremacist group called the Knightstown Boys.
</P>
<P>
   David Anderson, 24, suffered a concussion, internal bleeding and
had two teeth knocked out early Sunday. He also received stitches
around his mouth, and his eyes were swollen shut for two days.
</P>
<P>
   ''They kept trying to get me to 'Heil Hitler,' but I wouldn't do
that,'' Anderson said Thursday. ''I'll never change my beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The six men face charges of attempted murder and aggravated
battery and were in custody Thursday on bonds ranging from $100,000
to $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were at a party with Anderson late Saturday
when an argument erupted because some started making derogatory
racial remarks and talking about ''white power supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said they ordered him to give the Nazi salute, and when
he didn't he was pushed out of the house and repeatedly hit and
kicked, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was getting probably two or three kicks a second,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman across the street called 911. Anderson was found a few
block away, his face swollen and bloody.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks To Retake Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- With Hong Kong and Macau back in the fold, China
sees the recovery of Taiwan as its next ''sacred mission,'' a
leader of the government's top advisory body said today.
</P>
<P>
   Ye Xuanping, speaking at the opening of the annual meeting of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said the
recovery of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997 and of Macau from
Portugal in December were ''important milestones'' in China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the work of settling the Taiwan question and achieving the
complete reunification of the motherland stands out as a sacred
mission for all Chinese people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji and other senior
communist leaders looking on, Ye voiced the advisory group's
backing for new threats China has made to intimidate candidates in
Taiwan's presidential election on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   Ye, a vice chairman of the Consultative Conference, delivered
his speech to 2,000 of the body's delegates at the Great Hall of
the People next to Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Consultative Conference is a powerless body that proposes
policy measures for government leaders to consider.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949. China considers
Taiwan a breakaway province, and Taiwan says it will unify only
when China is democratic and more economically developed.
</P>
<P>
   Ye accused Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui of pushing the
island toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that increased tensions, Beijing issued a policy paper
last month that threatened attack against Taiwan if it indefinitely
rebuffs demands for reunification talks.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was widely seen as an attempt to pressure candidates
in Taiwan's presidential election, none of whom support
reunification on China's terms.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, a poll released today indicated that most Taiwanese
would not favor reunification with China under arrangements similar
to those used with Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the state-sponsored poll showed that about 73
percent of those surveyed would not want to reunify under a ''one
country, two systems'' framework, which allows Hong Kong and Macau
a considerable amount of local autonomy for at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 35 percent of the respondents favor
keeping the status quo, with Taiwan enjoying de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 6 percent of those polled supported immediate
independence, and 19 percent favored maintaining the status quo and
reunifying at an unspecified later time. About 12 percent wanted to
preserve the status quo and seek independence later.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the Taipei-based Burke Marketing Research firm was
commissioned by the Mainland Affairs Council, which handles the
government's China policy. The poll, with a margin of error of 3
percentage points, included 1,067 respondents interviewed Feb.
23-26.

<HEADLINE> INS Pursues Rockies' Astacio Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Lawyers for Colorado Rockies pitcher Pedro Astacio
are trying to change his guilty plea on a domestic violence charge
back to innocent to keep him from being deported to the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Harvey Steinberg said Astacio was hoping to avoid a
public hearing when he pleaded guilty in January to third-degree
assault for punching his estranged pregnant wife. He originally
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockies right-hander did not know the potential
consequences of that guilty plea at the time, Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the situation has changed and we will go through the
trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on changing the plea is scheduled for next week in
Arapahoe County.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, immigrants convicted of domestic violence and
other offenses are subject to deportation. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Agency notified Astacio last week that a deportation
would be scheduled for him.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio received a deferred judgment as a result of his plea,
but the federal law considers that the same as a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I live in Colorado too, and I root for the Rockies like
everybody else. But the law is very clear on this. These actions
were brought about by the individual that we are citing here, and
we have to go forward,'' INS District Director Joe Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers try to arrange a deal to keep him in the
United States, Astacio is working out at the Rockies' training camp
in Tucson, Ariz., preparing for his opening-day assignment April 3
at Atlanta against the defending National League champion Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We support Pedro through the process. Beyond that it would be
inappropriate for us to comment,'' Rockies general manager Dan
O'Dowd said. ''The attorneys are going through all of the
particulars and I honestly don't understand all the mumbo-jumbo
that is involved with the legal process.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not worried that Astacio would not be able to
start opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this will work itself out,'' O'Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, 30, who led the Rockies in virtually every pitching
category last season, was given a two-year deferred judgment after
pleading guilty in January. He was ordered to undergo domestic
violence counseling and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio was arrested last August after being accused of punching
his estranged wife during an argument at their suburban home. The
status of that marriage was a subject of dispute in their
separation. She said it was a common-law marriage; he said it
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio turned himself in the next day, posted a $1,750 bond and
was back on the field the same night, when he pinch-hit for the
Rockies in a 14-13 loss to the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquired by Colorado in a 1997 trade with the Los Angeles
Dodgers for infielder Eric Young, and pitched the entire 1998
season in the Rockies' rotation. He made a personal-best 34 starts
and topped 200 innings for the third straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he was one of Colorado's top pitchers, going 17-11
with a 5.04 ERA. He also pitched a team-leading 232 innings and was
third in the NL with 210 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Astacio agreed to a four-year contract extension worth
about $23 million.

<HEADLINE> Kan. Teen Gunman Baffles Police  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MILBURN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIAWATHA, Kan. (AP) -- A runaway 16-year-old from Buffalo, N.Y.
shot dead by Kansas troopers after he killed a sheriff's deputy was
described as a boy who would usually ''back off'' from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But a schoolmate's description of Vincent Smith seemed only to
make the teen gunman more of an enigma. How would someone so averse
to conflict end up Wednesday so far away from home, only to kill
Deputy Todd Widman in his cruiser on a northeast Kansas highway?
</P>
<P>
   That question continued to baffle authorities, and ''both
parties who know aren't here,'' said Brown County Sheriff Lamar
Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo News reported Thursday that Smith was apparently
distraught over bad grades, which officials in Kansas and Buffalo
said they couldn't confirm.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only initial, possible link between Smith's violent
death and the boy schoolmate Ryan O'Neill described as not ''one to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a real innocent kid,'' said O'Neill, a student at
Buffalo's Bishop Timon-St. Jude High School. ''He wouldn't even
stand up for himself, you know? He'd just back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the son of a Buffalo, N.Y., police officer, ran away on
Tuesday, taking the family car and his father's gun. The car was
found abandoned along Interstate 29 in northwest Missouri on
Wednesday, just across the state line from Kansas and about 1,000
miles from Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Two motorists said they gave rides to Smith that brought him to
Hiawatha.
</P>
<P>
   Widman, 21, was shot to death after responding to a call of a
transient or runaway walking along the main highway there. The
deputy apparently questioned Smith before placing him in his patrol
car, Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   A witness said she saw Widman talking to a boy from his patrol
car as she drove past. When she came past again about 15 minutes
later, she said, the deputy's car was up against a tree with a
window shattered.
</P>
<P>
   After Widman was shot, Smith was seen near a Wal-Mart store in
Hiawatha, a town of about 3,600. Shoemaker said he began shooting
at officers there, though no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   He said officers tracked Smith into marshy woods, and when they
drew near, he ran out firing. Two troopers returned fire and killed
him, Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings and the unanswered questions look to stay in the
psyche of the small town for a while, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things like this don't happen in Hiawatha,'' said town
resident Anne Arnesen. ''When they do, you remember them for a
long, long time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEHALIS, Wash. (AP) -- A 5-year-old boy, apparently angry at
some playmates, got his mother's gun, loaded it, pointed it at the
two playmates and then fired into the ground, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in last week's incident. The boy was referred
to a counselor but no charges were filed because the gun apparently
had been stored properly -- unloaded and on a high shelf, Chehalis
Police Chief Randy Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told police he knew how to load and fire the gun from
watching television, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode happened Feb. 23 outside an apartment complex in
this town about 80 miles south-southeast of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter could have been killed,'' Tabitha Dizer told KIRO
television of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   She said the boy got upset while playing with her 8-year-old
daughter and another playmate. The boy went inside, got his
mother's unloaded .35 mm pistol off a 6-foot shelf, found an
ammunition clip, loaded it and came back outside.
</P>
<P>
   He then ''aimed it at us and shot at the ground,'' the playmate,
Brandon Howard, told KIRO on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Claims Key Pass  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The alliance fighting Afghanistan's
ruling Taliban militia said Friday it had captured a strategic
northern mountain pass during a major new offensive in the Central
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   The assault was launched in Dar-e-Suf, some 240 miles north of
the Afghan capital of Kabul, said Ustad Ata Mohammed, a spokesman
for the opposition interviewed via satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed said opposition troops captured the Safed Kotal
mountain pass which links Samangan province to northern Balkh
province, which lies within the 90 percent of Afghan territory
controlled by the Taliban. The capture of the pass could make it
easier to launch fresh attacks in Balkh.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the report or comment
from the country's Taliban rulers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous reports of stepped-up fighting in
northern Afghanistan over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban say they have severed the supply line linking
opposition leader Ahmed Shah Massood's headquarters in
Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley to the neighboring state of
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban say they control Imam Sahib and Sher Khan Bandr, two
border towns from where they say Massood receives arms, ammunition
and money from Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Tajik government has rejected Taliban claims that it assists
Afghanistan's opposition alliance, although Massood operates
helicopters between a base in Tajikistan and the Panjshir Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, led by Massood and ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, has tried to halt the Taliban's drive to consolidate power
throughout the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban espouse a harsh brand of Islam that targets women
and girls, bans most forms of light entertainment and requires men
to wear beards.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Pa. Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKINSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The black man accused of a shooting
rampage that killed three white men and left two others critically
wounded has been charged with a hate crime. He also admitted to a
history of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Taylor, 39, was charged Thursday with ethnic
intimidation, Pennsylvania's legal term for a hate crime, and court
documents said he shot the men with malicious intent ''toward white
males.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The general tenor was that he wasn't shooting anybody but
whites,'' Allegheny County homicide Lt. John Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also said ''anti-white'' writings were found in his
apartment after Wednesday's attacks. Brennan refused to release the
contents of the writings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just some of his thoughts,'' he said. ''It was
basically anti-white, anti-Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   A court affidavit said some of the writings also denigrated
Asians, police, Italians and the news media. One document was
labeled ''The Satan List'' and listed the addresses of buildings in
Wilkinsburg. Kenneth Fulton of the Allegheny County Police told the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the two fast-food restaurants in
Taylor's path were not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was initially charged with two counts of criminal
homicide, a charge covering murder and manslaughter in
Pennsylvania. Police on Thursday added five counts of aggravated
assault, a firearms charge, one count of causing a catastrophe and
an arson charge -- for allegedly setting his apartment on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The third victim, Emil Sanielevici, 20, died late Thursday, long
after the rampage ended in a standoff at an office building in
suburban Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor faced arraignment today.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's court hearing, District Justice Alberta Thompson
asked Taylor if he had any criminal record or history of drug use,
and he said no.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked if he had any history of mental illness, he said
yes. The judge did not ask him to elaborate, and mental health
records in Pennsylvania are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was released from a psychiatric unit at St. Francis
Medical Center six months ago, after spending 37 days in the
hospital, the Post-Gazette reported, citing anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI said it has initiated a civil rights investigation
into the shootings, authorities said it was still unclear whether
Taylor's only motivation was racial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we're still getting a lot of information from
witnesses about comments he made and things about shooting white
people,'' said Wilkinsburg Police Chief Gerald Brewer. ''There's a
lot of anger and hostility in this individual, so I think it's a
little premature to simply define this as a racist event.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's lawyer, James Ecker, whom Taylor's family hired, said
he has no reason to believe his client harbors any hostility toward
whites. ''I'm a white lawyer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Taylor, angry at how long it took to have a broken
door at his fifth-floor apartment fixed, set the apartment on fire
and shot and killed John Kroll, a 55-year-old maintenance worker.
He then walked to a nearby Burger King, where he fatally shot
Joseph Healy, a 71-year-old former Roman Catholic priest, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor then crossed the street to a McDonald's, where three
other people -- Richard Clinger, Sanielevici and Steven Bostard --
were shot, police said. Clinger and Bostard remained in critical
condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor surrendered to police after fleeing into an office
building, where he kept officers at bay for about two hours. Joyce
Ambrose, who was briefly held hostage, said the gunman told another
black woman, ''Not you, sister,'' as he threatened to shoot others.
</P>
<P>
   Before he ran into the building, Taylor came in through the back
door of Christine McCrae's house, she told The Associated Press on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he wouldn't be alive long, and that he would be dead
in 10 minutes. He said he wasn't going to hurt me because I was
black, and he was out to get all white people,'' McCrae said.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning hate
crimes and calling the ''a horrible, isolated incident.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Aceh Negotiated Deal  </HEADLINE>
By SLOBODAN LEKIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- While affirming Indonesia's
''territorial integrity,'' the United States today urged President
Abdurrahman Wahid not to use force in quelling a bloody separatist
rebellion in the country's north.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding a two-day visit to Jakarta, Thomas R. Pickering,
undersecretary of state for political affairs, said the United
States supports Indonesia's ''territorial integrity and is not in
favor of dividing up Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned against continuing an offensive against rebels
in the country's northern Aceh province, which has been wracked by
separatist violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe that the problem can be resolved ... by the
use of military force,'' Pickering said. ''We believe the problem
must be resolved through the process of dialogue, discussions and
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering also voiced strong support for Indonesia's political
and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had singled
out Indonesia as one of four countries making the transition to
democracy that deserved special attention and U.S. aid. The three
others are Colombia, Nigeria and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   While Pickering had praise for the Indonesia's democratic
transition, he warned that more violence was unlikely to settle the
25-year-long Aceh conflict, where police said today 13 people were
killed in the latest violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Syafei Aksal, a local police chief in Aceh, said four
decomposed bodies were found Thursday in North Aceh district. He
said all the dead bodies, one of them headless, were beyond
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,000 people have been killed in the province during
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In West Papua, Indonesia's easternmost province, police fired on
dozens of indigenous Papuans attacking a police station,
authorities said today. Two Papuans were killed in Thursday's
clash.
</P>
<P>
   After the first free elections in 44 years in Indonesia, Wahid
took office in October with the aim of reviving the country's
moribund economy and reform its corruption-ridden institutions
while dealing with multiple separatist and religious conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   He met with President Clinton in Washington in November, and a
number of high-level bilateral meetings have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Clinton administration announced that U.S. aid
to Indonesia in 2000 would increase by 66 percent, from $75 million
to $125 million.

<HEADLINE> University Takes Out Full Page Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Bob Jones University is using full-page
newspaper advertisements to answer national criticism of its
interracial dating ban and other issues that cropped up after
Republican presidential contender George W. Bush made a campaign
stop at the fundamentalist Christian school last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''Letter to the Nation,'' University President Bob Jones
III says the school in Greenville has been wrongly painted as
racist and anti-Catholic. The issue is religious freedom, Jones
wrote. The ad appears in USA Today and the three largest South
Carolina papers, in Columbia, Charleston and Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not expect everyone to agree with us or like us,'' Jones
wrote. ''The cross of Jesus Christ is a dividing line for some. We
don't quake or blush with embarrassment over the term 'religious
conservatives.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has been criticized for stopping at the school and not
taking aim at some of the school's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has an essay on the school's Web site that describes Roman
Catholicism and Mormonism ''as cults which call themselves
Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My regret is that I didn't speak out against anti-Catholic
bias when I had the opportunity to do so. I had the mike,'' Bush
said this week at a Catholic family center in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The school's ban on interracial dating has drawn the most fire --
including proposals in state legislatures and Congress to publicly
condemn the school for its policy.
</P>
<P>
   In today's ads, Jones says the school admits students of various
races and works at ''promoting racial harmony'' in the community.
</P>
<P>
   The university is not anti-Catholic, said Jones, adding that
those in the school ''love (Catholics) in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a wide gulf between Catholic and Baptist/Protestant
beliefs,'' Jones wrote. ''Nevertheless, we respect the freedom of
all Roman Catholics to have their beliefs, just as we do
individuals in other faiths.''
</P>
<P>
   The school lost its tax exemption in 1983 after a 13-year battle
with the Internal Revenue Service that cited the school's
discrimination. BJU now admits blacks but keeps the ban on
interracial dating based on a biblical interpretation that God
created people differently for a reason.

on torture charges.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Trial in Chile Difficult  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet has avoided facing
charges of human rights abuses in European courts, but many say
bringing him to trial in Chile, though difficult, would not be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights lawyers have requested that Santiago's appeals
courts lift the immunity the 84-year-old former dictator has as a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now up to the Chilean courts, not those of other
countries,'' to decide ''whether Sen. Pinochet is responsible for
the crimes he is accused of,'' President Eduardo Frei told the
nation as Pinochet was flying back from a 16-month detention in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Gutierrez, one of the lawyers who brought the appeal,
predicted the court could rule in about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, Pinochet faces 60 lawsuits accusing him of homicide
and torture in cases such as the so-called ''caravan of death'' --
the killings of 19 dissidents shortly after the 1973 coup he led
against Marxist President Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the civilian government that succeeded Pinochet
established that 3,197 people disappeared or were killed during his
1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in Britain in October 1998 on a warrant by
a Spanish judge wanting to try him for human rights abuses. He was
freed Thursday by British Home Secretary Jack Straw's ruling that
he was mentally and physically unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean government has insisted that if Pinochet is to be
tried, it should occur in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Both his supporters and foes agree that, legally, there is
nothing that prevents a trial here, not even the reasons that
gained his release in Britain. Chilean law does not exempt sick
people from trial unless their condition is certified as deep
madness or dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is handling the suits against Pinochet,
said the general will be examined by doctors, particularly on his
mental condition, before any decisions are made. Guzman said he
would work full-time on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great responsibility and I intend to assume it
properly,'' Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official in Washington said it was possible that Chile
would pursue charges against the retired general. ''We have a high
degree of confidence of the capabilities of the Chilean government
and court system to proceed ahead,'' said David Scheffer, the U.S.
ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many fear pressure from the military, still loyal to Pinochet
and indignant over his arrest in a foreign land. But while calling
the arrest a violation of Chile's sovereignty, military leaders say
they will accept a trial if a court decides on one. Even
pro-Pinochet leaders in Chile's right admit he can be tried.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a court so decides, Gen. Pinochet can be tried, the same as
any other citizen,'' said Congressman Alberto Cardemil, a deputy
minister under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those seeking a trial agree that it may happen, but
appear skeptical of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lack of political will to bring Pinochet to
justice,'' said Gutierrez. ''Politicians still are afraid of the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Camilo Escalona, a socialist leader, said ''two or three years
ago speaking of trying Pinochet would have been seen as crazy or
reckless. Not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Escalona and the government point out that Chile's courts have
changed as most of the Pinochet-appointed magistrates have retired.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 members of the military, including six generals,
have been prosecuted and jailed in recent years in human rights
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Diaz, who heads a group of relatives of victims of the
Pinochet regime, vowed to redouble pressure to force a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will now continue to fight for justice,'' she said.
''Pinochet committed crimes and he must pay for them.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korean POW Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A South Korean prisoner of war has
returned home after nearly a half century of captivity in North
Korea, Seoul's main intelligence agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Suh Byong-ryol, 70, arrived in Seoul from a third country where
he had been living in hiding since escaping North Korea in December
1998, the National Intelligence Service said. He arrived with three
North Koreans, including a 65-year-old woman and a 38-year-old
woman, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Suh was captured by Chinese troops in 1953,
shortly before the three-year Korean War ended in a truce. He had
been forced to work in coal mines and on collective farms in North
Korea, it said.
</P>
<P>
   China sent troops to help North Korea fight South Korean troops
during the war. American-led U.N. troops fought on the South's
side.
</P>
<P>
   The agency gave no further details. It usually uses the term
''third country'' to refer to China.

<HEADLINE> Albright Meets Russian Minister  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Russia today offered to open Chechnya to
the head of the Red Cross and European investigators looking for
evidence of widespread abuses of civilians in the crushing of
separatists in the restive republic.
</P>
<P>
   Denying all the while that the bloodied area had been sealed off
from outside observers and the media while Russian troops hammered
Grozny, the capital, into submissions, Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said his government was taking ''significant steps'' to
allay Western concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He accused reporters who had managed to get to Chechnya of
disseminating ''false and twisted information.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer, made a a joint session with American and European
senior officials, was received with both hope and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have taken a few small steps, but it is not enough and it
is not convincing,'' said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and other impartial observers ''need access to
detainees in camps and we need openness,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said. ''The Russians will be well-served if they
resolved the doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   And Chris Patten, a senior official of the European Union,
stressed a need for immediate delivery of food, shelter and
clothing. ''We gave Mr. Ivanov some concrete proposals. I hope he
is going to be open-minded,'' Patten said at a news conference
after the first-ever U.S.-European Union-Russian joint meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A European technical group is due to go to Chechnya on Monday.
But European officials said they still needed permission from
Russia to enter the republic as well as ''free mobility'' there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what we heard we can take to the bank,'' a senior
U.S. official told reporters afterward. ''But we heard things that
look on the surface to be responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia based its assault on the twofold argument that it had a
right to stop Chechnya from separating from Russia and that the
rebellion was fomented by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov held to this argument today, saying the fight against
separatism, extremism and nationalism ''in all forms is our common
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, Albright had breakfast with Ivanov, with
Chechnya the main item of conversation. ''We do not mince words on
this subject and our differences are deep,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those deep differences over Chechnya, the United States
and its European allies moved to strengthen ties to Russia while
hoping for an impartial inquiry into the military campaign. And
Albright and Ivanov both seemed determined not to let Chechnya
dominate U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a good opportunity to express our concerns together on
this business,'' a U.S. official told reporters on Albright's
flight here from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Albright is looking for Russia's cooperation in
difficult peacemaking in Kosovo, the Serbian province where U.S.,
European and Russian troops are trying to keep ethnic tensions from
erupting into widespread violence.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to help establish civilian institutions that
would lead Serbs and ethnic Albanians toward coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, European officials said they were prodding Ivanov to
facilitate the work of humanitarian agencies in caring for
displaced refugees. The Europeans are offering $300,000 worth of
beef and rice to them, but wants guarantees from the Russians that
distribution will go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ivanov said Russia was calling for a U.N. Security
Council meeting on Kosovo to make sure Kosovo does not become
independent from Serbia. He said that otherwise there could be a
''new tragedy'' in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, Russia would have to review its participation
in the peacekeeping operation, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day's business agenda also was the drive within the
European Union to set up a military wing that includes a rapid
reaction force of up to 60,000 troops capable of dealing with local
conflicts without having to rely on the NATO alliance and U.S.
support.

<HEADLINE> Japan Says Debt Is Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Weeks before Japan announces fiscal 1999 year-end
national debt statistics, the Finance Ministry said Friday that
maintaining a record-high amount of outstanding bonds will be
inevitable under current economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Japan had nearly $3.35 trillion in outstanding government bonds
-- more than any other nation -- as of Sept. 30, 1999, the most
recent Finance Ministry figure. New data will be released on March
24.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of heavy borrowing, Japan, the world's
second-richest country behind the United States, is also among the
world's most indebted. The ministry said its total debt forecast
for 1999 exceeds $5.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   However, it will be impossible for the government to scale back
on raising money through bonds until Japan shows stronger signs of
economic growth, a Finance Ministry official said Friday, demanding
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been struggling to emerge from its worst economic
downturn in over 50 years. The economy started growing last year,
but then shrank in July-September. Government officials say it
probably also contracted in October-December.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the gap in outstanding government bonds in Japan and
the United States has grown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Japanese government bond issuances rose 15 percent from
the year before, while those in the United States fell 3 percent
during the same period, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding U.S. government bonds totaled $3.23 trillion as of
September 1999, below the Japanese figure.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal conservatives say wasteful public works spending has
swelled Japan's ballooning public debt. Despite the criticism, the
Japanese government has steadfastly continued to issue bonds to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Asian currency crisis of 1997, Japan has borrowed
massively to pay for such projects as road and bridge construction
aimed at reviving the economy.

<HEADLINE> Carruth Has No Plans To Quit NFL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Former Carolina Panthers receiver Rae
Carruth, under suspension by the NFL as he fights a murder charge,
has no intention of quitting the league, according to court papers
filed on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth and three others are accused of murder in the shooting
death of his pregnant girlfriend this past fall. The Panthers
waived Carruth in December, and NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
suspended him indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ''As he is innocent of the charges against him, Mr. Carruth has
not filed any written request indicating his intention to
permanently sever his relationship with the NFL as a player, and
has no intention of filing any such request,'' defense attorney
David Rudolf wrote in the papers filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf was responding to a report filed late last month by a
court-appointed examiner studying Carruth's assets and liquidating
them to pay for child support.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the examiner noted that the former Panther is
entitled to $30,000 in severance pay from the NFL if he quits the
league permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Cherica Adams died about a month after the Nov. 16 shooting in
Charlotte. After the shooting, Adams gave birth to a son, who
survived. Adams' parents have filed a child-support and custody
lawsuit against Carruth.
</P>
<P>
   A judge has frozen his assets while attorneys review his
financial condition.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble Over Money  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain said today the Republican Party's
message is headed for another defeat and that's what sparked him to
challenge the party establishment's ties to some conservative
religious leaders and campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want business as usual, the Republican party has lost
the last two presidential elections, the last two congressional
elections, and we're headed down the same path,'' McCain said. ''I
had to take on the Republican establishment and status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who said he was trying to widen the party's appeal, was
interviewed on NBC's ''Today'' show from his campaign bus as it
rolled through Manhattan. He flew to New York overnight from St.
Louis, where he was linked by satellite Thursday night into a
debate with Bush and Alan Keyes that featured differences on
campaign finances and religion in politics.
</P>
<P>
   After a night back home in Austin, Texas, Gov. Bush headed for a
breast cancer research center at the State University of New York
at Stony Brook -- a stop designed to emphasize that McCain included
federal funding of certain breast cancer research on a list of
pork-barrel spending. Bush is running ads in New York featuring a
breast cancer survivor criticizing McCain and calling for ''a
candidate with a record on women's issues we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain called the ad misleading and said he has repeatedly voted
to increase spending on breast cancer research. Speaking on ''Imus
in the Morning,'' the Arizona senator said he could get his message
to voters despite such ads, but ''If they don't figure it out, we
will have run an honorable campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain competitive in New York, one of 13 states
holding Super Tuesday contests next week that could decide the GOP
presidential nomination. California and Ohio also are among the
biggest states, and a candidate winning all three of them likely
could sew up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been on the defensive much of the week after he
criticized evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as ''agents
of intolerance,'' and concedes he needs to refocus his message.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to stay on message and not be distracted by a lot of
the stuff that's going on,'' McCain said today. But he dismissed a
suggestion that his controversial speech in Virginia on the
religious right was a mistake because it hurt his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to do what you think is best for your party,''
McCain said. ''You can't gauge what you do just on your political
ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was spending today in New York, then heading for
Connecticut, with plans to spend the weekend in New England before
returning to California on Sunday. Bush went home to Austin after
last night's debate but was headed for New York today, trying to
overtake McCain's edge in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate framing this crucial campaign sprint, McCain urged
''stop the squabbling'' while Bush complained McCain uses ''the
politics of smearing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended phone calls made on his behalf blasting Bush for
visiting Bob Jones University without quickly denouncing its
anti-Catholic stance, but wanted to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am interested in the issues of the day,'' said McCain.
''Stop the squabbling, we can address the issues.'' Bush was having
none of it, lecturing McCain sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't regret going to many places,'' said Bush. ''What I
regret is the politics of smearing somebody's reputation. Catholics
all across the country are coming to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defends that criticism as factual, but Bush dismissed
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't think those phone calls labeled me an
anti-Catholic bigot, then you weren't paying attention to what your
campaign was putting out,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run an insurgent campaign, but went out of his way to
reassure Republicans of his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican Party is my home,'' said McCain. ''No matter
who our nominee is, I will support that nominee. I am a proud
conservative with a strong conservative record.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, seeking an aura of inevitability, confidently predicted he
would be that nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are looking for a fresh start after a season of
cynicism,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, sponsored by the Los Angeles Times and CNN, the
two leading rivals were joined by Keyes, who claimed he's the
victim of a ''media blackout'' keeping his message from voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''A great many of them have no idea I'm running,'' said Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointed to reports that big givers have been given
sleepovers at the Texas governor's mansion and noted that Bush
doesn't favor limits on individual contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are my friends, John, those are my relatives,'' Bush
said of the sleepovers. He derided McCain's references to breaking
an ''iron triangle'' of special interests.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Cabbies Block Roads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- About 1,000 taxi drivers blocked traffic on
highways in southwestern China for two days to protest a tax
increase, a Hong Kong-based group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The protest caused traffic jams in Dachuan, a city in Sichuan
province, for 12 hours on Wednesday and again Thursday, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were protesting a new tax of nearly $1,000 per year,
the Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
   It said about 100 police officers broke up the protest Thursday
and detained at least 10 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   City and police officials, contacted by telephone, confirmed
that crowds converged on the roads, but refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would amount to more than half of the annual income of
$1,800 per cab driver, the Information Center said. It quoted a
city taxi manager as saying the tax had been waived in the past but
was now needed for highway repairs.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Afghan Plane Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - An Afghan passenger plane hijacked to
Britain last month returned to Afghanistan on Friday with only the
crew aboard, a Taliban aviation official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 was hijacked Feb. 6 on a domestic
flight from Kabul to Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. After
hopscotching across Central Asia and Europe the aircraft landed at
Stansted Airport, north of London.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers surrendered four days later and many aboard the
hijacked aircraft asked to stay in Britain. Criminal charges are
pending against 14 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three people returned home voluntarily. So far asylum
appeals on behalf of 32 others have been rejected by the British
government. Decisions involving 37 others have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have asked Britain to return all the asylum seekers
to Afghanistan and have promised that they will be welcomed.
Taliban officials said Britain has been told that none of the
asylum seekers will be harassed or punished.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban aviation official, who asked not to be named, said
the Ariana aircraft had arrived in Mazar-e-Sharif from Britain, but
was unable to continue on to Kabul because of poor weather in the
Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to arrive in Kabul on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban need the aircraft to send Muslim pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co. Would OK Some Oversight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- An executive with the nation's
largest tobacco company said the firm will accept some federal
regulation of cigarettes but stopped short of agreeing to
regulation of nicotine as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco critics have been pushing for such regulation of
nicotine as a more effective way to curb underage smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Parrish, senior vice president Philip Morris Cos., said
Thursday during a conference on addiction that the maker of
top-selling Marlboros would accept some regulation of the
composition of cigarettes, including lowering nicotine levels.
</P>
<P>
   But he balked at requiring the amount of nicotine to drop so low
that the product would essentially be banned.
</P>
<P>
   During a panel discussion at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library, Parrish expanded on statements he made earlier this week
in which he called for ''discussion about what is the right way to
regulate tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said the announcement was prompted by the company's
desire to stop smoking among children -- even though government
regulation could raise production costs and prompt dramatic
declines in profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''(If) our adult business dries up,'' Parrish said, ''our
company is prepared to accept that ... and we will invest our
assets in other businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David A.
Kessler, also on hand for the addiction conference, called
Parrish's announcement ''historic.'' However, he expressed
skepticism that Philip Morris was truly open to the necessary
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to believe this is a serious first step, but the fact
is I have serious questions,'' Kessler said. ''Would you agree to
regulating nicotine as a drug? Will you agree to regulation of
marketing practices? Will you agree to the removal of harmful
ingredients if that is technically possible?''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish acknowledged that nicotine is a drug but stopped short
of agreeing that the FDA should regulate nicotine as a drug and
cigarettes as drug-delivery devices.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Philip Morris' concessions may be aimed
at improving the company's image among judges and juries presiding
over lawsuits filed on behalf of dead or dying smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on
whether Congress has given the FDA authority over the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris accounts for one of every two cigarettes sold in
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Abandoned Boy Parents Get Probation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A couple has agreed to one year's
probation in exchange for admitting they abandoned their disabled
10-year-old son at a Delaware hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced Thursday by the Delaware attorney general's
office, means Richard and Dawn Kelso of Exton, Pa., will avoid a
criminal trial on the misdemeanor charge of child abandonment. The
trial was to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Apostolico, deputy attorney general, said the probation deal
makes sense because the Kelsos do not have a criminal past and have
cooperated with child welfare agencies.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 26, the Kelsos dropped off their son, Steven, in his
wheelchair at the Alfred I. du Pont Hospital for Children in
Rockland, Del., with a note saying they could no longer care for
him.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with Delaware Family Court, the couple insisted
they loved their son but were exhausted from round-the-clock care
because nursing help was unavailable during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, who suffers from cerebral palsy, uses a tube to breathe
and eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Chester County Department of Children, Youth and Families
took temporary custody of the boy. He remains at the hospital,
where the Kelsos are permitted supervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   The probation agreement does not affect the custody situation.
Any change in custody conditions or visitation rights is up to the
Chester County youth department, said Todd Halliday, spokesman for
the Delaware attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Chester County youth department did not
immediately return phone calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers OK Airport Tax Boost  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airports could raise their passenger taxes by
$1.50 a person, to $4.50, under a major aviation funding bill on
which Congress is completing work. That could mean an extra $18 for
a round trip with connections.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the ''passenger facility charges'' was one of
the final issues as House and Senate negotiators tried to finish
work on a three-year, $40 billion bill to authorize spending
programs for the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The bill could go to the House and Senate floors as early as
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brenner, spokesman for the House Transportation Committee
chairman, Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said the negotiators split the
difference between the House proposal, to allow the passenger
charges to double from the current $3 a passenger to $6, and the
Senate version of the bill, which contained no increase.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said that under the agreement a passenger could be
charged no more than $18 in airport taxes for a round-trip ticket,
which would be a $4.50 tax for two airports each way.
</P>
<P>
   David Z. Plavin, president of Airports Council International,
said the $1.50 raise could mean $700 million a year for the
nation's airports, an amount he said ''is crucial in helping
airports increase competition, lower fares and provide for a safe
and efficient air transportation system.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are putting the final touches on the FAA bill, which
has been held up since last fall over a dispute between the House
and Senate over use of money from the Airport Trust Fund, which
takes in about $10 billion a year from airport user fees.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster wanted the fund separated from the general federal
budget so all of the money coming in would have to be used for
airport improvements. Senators objected to that but in a compromise
announced earlier this week agreed that money spent on airport
modernization would at least equal the amount going into the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators agreed on $12.7 billion in aviation spending in
the coming fiscal year, $2.7 billion more than this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scales Back Mozambique Troops  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has scaled back the number of
U.S. troops it intends to send to southern Africa to provide
humanitarian relief to victims of heavy flooding in Mozambique,
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Kenneth Bacon had said on Thursday that as many as 900
troops could be involved, but today officials said it would not
exceed 600.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear today where the U.S. forces would set up a
staging base in the region. Officials speaking on condition of
anonymity said the South African government was balking at granting
permission for use of its airfields, and that the Pentagon was
considering Botswana as a possible alternative.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Thursday authorized up to $37.6 million in
emergency disaster assistance for southern Africa ''for the purpose
of providing international disaster assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon planned to send three Air Force MH-53 helicopters,
loaded aboard C-17 transport planes, from Mildenhall Air Base in
England this weekend for the 20-hour flight to southern Africa. On
Thursday the Pentagon said Navy SEAL commandos would accompany the
helicopters, but today it said they would not.
</P>
<P>
   As many as six MH-53 copters may eventually be sent. The
Pentagon also is sending Air Force C-130s from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relief effort, coordinated by the U.S. European
Command, is code-named Operation Atlas Response. That is a switch
from the name the Pentagon had announced on Thursday -- Operation
Silent Promise. It will be commanded by Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph
Wherle Jr., commander of the 3rd Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Wherle planned to leave from Europe on Saturday and arrive in
southern Africa on Sunday, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that between 800,000 and 1 million
people have lost their homes in Mozambique and are in urgent need
of help following the worst floods in decades to strike the
poverty-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands are feared dead.

<HEADLINE> Louima jury enters third day of deliberations  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The jury in the trial of three officers accused
of a cover-up in the bathroom torture of Abner Louima has spent two
days reviewing testimony about who led the victim to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In notes to U.S. District Court Judge Eugene Nickerson, jurors
have asked to be read transcripts of testimony of a sergeant and a
patrolman who were in Brooklyn's 70th Precinct station when Louima
was attacked. The jury resumed deliberating today in the Brooklyn
federal court case.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, jurors re-heard the testimony of the patrolman,
Eric Turetzky, who at trial described how he helped arrest Louima
during a street disturbance in the summer of 1997; an assault
charge against Louima was subsequently dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky identified Charles Schwarz as the officer who led the
handcuffed prisoner, his pants down at his ankles, toward the 70th
Precinct bathroom. The jurors also have heard a readback of
testimony by Sgt. Michael Hargrove, who said Schwarz was ''in
control'' of Louima when the prisoner was processed at the front
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors used the same testimony last year to help convict
Schwarz, 34, of violating Louima's civil rights by leading him into
the bathroom and holding him down while another officer, Justin
Volpe, sodomized the Haitian immigrant with a broken broom handle
in a fit of rage. Schwarz faces a possible life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The government claims that while Turetzky broke a supposed
''blue wall of silence'' -- the unspoken code among officers not to
''rat'' on each other -- Schwarz and two other officers were
concocting a story to clear Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have relied on records showing Schwarz and
codefendants Thomas Bruder, 33, and Thomas Wiese, 36, made a flurry
of phone calls to each other as investigators zeroed in. The
pattern and timing of the calls proved the officers were trying to
''get their stories straight'' that Schwarz was never in the
bathroom, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving 30 years
in prison, emerged as a key defense witness. He testified that
Wiese -- not Schwarz -- was there with him, but did not participate
in the actual assault.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has tried to convince the jury the story was true --
and that there could be no cover-up if Schwarz committed no crime.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz himself testified last week that during Volpe's attack,
he was outside the building, inspecting his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants face terms of up to five years if convicted on
obstruction of justice charges.

<HEADLINE> Singapore: US Needs Coherent Policy  </HEADLINE>
By DEAN VISSER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- The United States needs to develop a more
coherent policy on Asia despite the distractions of domestic
politics, Singapore's deputy prime minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is dealing with Asia as a bundle of disparate issues
without a coherent policy framework,'' Lee Hsien Loong said in an
opening speech at the Williamsburg Conference, an international
forum on U.S.-Asia relations.
</P>
<P>
   In this U.S. presidential election year, each candidate ''feels
free to woo votes with strident statements of high principle,
unfettered by the responsibilities of office,'' he said. ''But
election year static and rhetoric must not cloud important U.S.
interests in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee cited free trade and U.S.-China relations, which he called
crucial to Asian stability, as examples.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should quickly grant China permanent Normal
Trade Relations status, he said. Such status would lower tariffs on
Chinese goods shipped to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will remove the irritant of the annual ritual of
Congressional review of China's NTR status,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee urged the United States to push steps to uphold free trade,
despite the objections of unions and other non-governmental
organizations whose protests kept November's World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle in from launching a new round of
global free-trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the WTO talks ''showed that a small but
vociferous group of NGOs could hijack the agenda, sidetrack U.S.
trade policy and scuttle a deal that could have benefited many
countries, including the U.S.,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Fall in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A sell-off of telecommunications and
high-technology stocks pushed Tokyo share prices down today. The
dollar edged up against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 137.57 points,
or 0.7 percent, to finish the day at 19,927.54. On Thursday, the
average closed down 16.56 points, or 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.66 yen, up 0.31 yen from Thursday in Tokyo
but lower than its late New York level Thursday of 107.83 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, investors took profits after recent gains
in telecoms and high-tech shares.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's hefty $12.00 fall to $287 weighed heaviest on Japan's
main stock index, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said another negative factor may have been anticipation
of the release of U.S. jobless figures in Washington. The data is
regarded as an important indicator for the outlook for U.S.
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released hours after the Japanese markets closed,
said U.S. unemployment unexpectedly ticked up to 4.1 percent in
February from a 30-year low of 4 percent the previous month. Many
analysts had expected February's unemployment rate to hold steady.
Job growth was below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.99 points
Thursday to 10,164.92, while the Nasdaq composite index fell after
setting records in each of the two previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 31.99 points today, or by 1.86 percent,
to 1,686.49. The TOPIX fell 6.76 points, or 0.39 percent, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 717.35 million shares, down from 801.70 million
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Decliners beat advancers 726 to 541, while 129 closed unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar rose on worries about a
possible yen-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan to stop the
Japanese currency's advance.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Japan's government has expressed concern about
the yen's gains, which make the country's exports more expensive
and less cost-competitive abroad and which decreases the value of
repatriated overseas earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro traded at 104.26 yen, down from
104.97 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar ranged between 107.32 yen and 108.08 yen in today's
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7900 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7800 percent. Its
price fell 0.08 point.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Vows To Stamp Out Terrorism  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- The ruling Taliban announced
establishment of a commission Friday to battle terrorism in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban-run Radio Shariat aired a statement from the Taliban
Foreign Ministry condemning terrorism and vowing to stamp it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We completely understand our international responsibility. We
support jihad, which is a holy war, but we do not support terrorism
against innocent civilians,'' the Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not mention Osama bin Laden, the suspected
terrorist reportedly living in Afghanistan under Taliban
protection. Both the United States and United Nations have asked
the Taliban to surrender bin Laden for trial on charges of
masterminding the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has denied involvement in the bombings. The Taliban,
who held an inquiry into the charges, say they have not been given
any proof of the Saudi dissident's involvement in terrorism. They
have refused to hand him over.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry statement did not elaborate on the role of
the new commission except to say it will meet with neighboring
countries to map a joint strategy to deal with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who took power from the elected
government in neighboring Pakistan last year, has announced plans
to go to Afghanistan to meet top Taliban officials. No date has
been set for the visit. Musharraf has said terrorism would top his
agenda.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 151.09  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks advanced in early trading Friday as the
government's employment showed some easing of the tight labor
market. The news calmed investors' fears that the Federal Reserve
will push interest rates sharply higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 151.09 at 10,0316.01, adding to the
302-point gain already tallied this week by the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 15.08 at 1,396.84, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 63.16 at 4,817.67.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rallied from the opening bell after the Labor Department
reported that 43,000 new jobs were created in February, well below
analysts' expectations and the weakest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment ticked up to 4.1 percent in February
from 4 percent in January, but it still remained at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing labor market has spooked Wall Street for
months, with many investors worrying about how continued growth
will affect businesses. Companies must offer competitive wages and
incentives to keep employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at
such low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big concern is that the economy was going to overheat and
employment was going to be one of the biggest problems,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''But we did not create nearly the number
of jobs that were expected and the unemployment rate went up.
That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rate four times since June in an
effort to slow the economy to a pace that will allow continued
growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that the Fed would take a more aggressive stance in
boosting rates has caused great volatility in the stock market in
recent weeks. Blue-chip stocks have been under the greatest
pressure, with the Dow falling below 10,000 for the first time
since last April.
</P>
<P>
   While most investors still believe that the Fed will likely
boost rates again soon -- maybe even at their meeting later this
month -- many now believe that the hike won't be as sharp as
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks, which are particularly sensitive to
interest rate changes, gained on the employment news. American
Express was up 2{ at 136 1/16 and Merrill Lynch was up 3[ at 107\.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 182.72 million
shares, up from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 7.62 at 591.66.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.68 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.5 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> El Duque Scratched From First Start  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez
has been scratched from his first scheduled spring start Saturday
by a mild back strain.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this was during the season, I would be very surprised that
he would miss this,'' Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said
Friday. ''Since it's early, we want to take extra precaution and
make sure he feels good when we send him out there.'
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is day to day and will require one additional bullpen
session before making a game appearance. There is no timetable for
his return.
</P>
<P>
   ''It don't think he will be out a prolonged period of time,''
Stottlemyre said. ''We had it checked and everything is fine. We're
just protecting him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had a scheduled batting practice session pushed back
one day last weekend by back stiffness. The pitcher known as ''El
Duque'' threw 78 pitches during a bullpen session Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Grace will replace Hernandez in Saturday's game against
Pittsburgh in Bradenton.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Boy Barred From Germany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- A Turkish boy expelled from Germany in
1998 after a string of offenses was denied permission Friday to
live in Germany again, despite his assurances he would behave.
</P>
<P>
   Allowed to return for three days to testify, the 15-year-old boy
told a Munich administrative court Thursday that he had reflected
on his past and would not repeat it. But the court said the
original decision not to renew his residence permit was valid and
that he should be returned to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Muhlis Ari, is accused of more than 60 offenses. He was
convicted of robbing a 19-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   Ari is the son of Turkish parents living in Munich, where he was
born and raised. His parents stayed in Germany after his expulsion.
Ari went to live with relatives in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   With his three days up, Ari was to be put on a plane for the
return trip to Turkey. His lawyer, Alexander Eberth, said he would
appeal the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial deportation followed months of debate and
legal wrangling over whether the state was right to deport a
then-14-year-old who considered himself German but was not a
citizen. Since then, the government has amended a 1913 citizenship
law to offer immediate citizenship to children born to foreigners
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 million Turks live in Germany -- many since the 1960s,
when Germany recruited them to come help rebuild in the wake of
World War II.

<HEADLINE> Census Forms Begin Arriving  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first big run of census forms landing
on doorsteps across America today, Census Bureau director Kenneth
Prewitt is more worried about how he'll get those forms back.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Prewitt says the
bureau has tried nearly everything to get people to fulfill their
''civic duty'' and return filled-out forms. That includes
participating in a Mass for the census beamed to 8 million
Catholics nationwide, speaking to undocumented workers in Texas to
ensure their information would not be turned over to authorities,
and even inserting ''fill-out-your-form'' messages inside fortune
cookies in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The more forms turned in, the more accurate the results are, and
the results will show that the American population is on its way to
becoming a ''microcosm of the entire world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It drives big money, power, reapportionment, redistricting,
and private investment. It has consequences,'' Prewitt said. ''You
have to make a proactive statement that you care enough about your
country, yourself and your community to fill out the form and send
it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he concedes, is to overcome the public's
increased apathy and concerns over confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Mail response rates declined from 78 percent of households in
1970 to 70 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990. Census officials
estimate it will dip to 61 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first forms were being hand-delivered to rural households.
The bureau is trying a number of new things this year, including a
$167 million advertising campaign, to get more of those forms back.
</P>
<P>
   Other census novelties in 2000 include allowing people to answer
surveys over the Internet, and getting 90,000 ''community
partners'' like pastors, schoolteachers and community activists to
help spread the message.
</P>
<P>
   Even mayors like Dennis Archer in Detroit, Richard Riordan in
Los Angeles and Rudolph Giuliani in New York are taking lead roles
to attach a familiar, assuring face to relay the message, Prewitt
notes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more people on the move, more people in irregular
housing, a higher percentage of foreign born and more disinterest,
more cynicism, more disengagement,'' Prewitt said. ''So if we can
actually turn it around, I think it will be a serious and big
story.''
</P>
<P>
   He is so confident, in fact, that he wagered a pessimistic
friend $25 that the response rate will go up. ''And the check goes
to a charity,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau already has forecast that the number of
foreign-born will more than double between now and 2050, from 26
million to 53.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   To account for the diversity, this year's census allows people
to indicate if they are of more than one race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents charge that may water down the power of minority
groups because those who consider themselves multiracial will not
be statistically counted as, for instance black and white, but be
placed in a separate multiracial category.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is turning a corner in terms of how it's going to
deal with itself along racial categories, and the Census Bureau is
simply a reflection of that,'' Prewitt said. ''The people who have
that as their experience don't want to be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said this year's census has become the most scrutinized
and politicized ever. Census data is used for redrawing political
boundaries as well as redistributing billions of dollars in federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau must compile two sets of data -- one from raw
numbers, a second that is statistically sampled -- for release to
the states.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Supreme Count decision mandated that the federal
government use nonsampled data for the purposes of reapportioning
Congressional seats. States will determine which set of numbers to
use for drawing new political lines.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials estimate 1.6 percent of the population, mostly
minorities and inner-city residents who tend to vote Democratic
were undercounted in 1990, and Prewitt said sampling methods
provide more accuracy. Republicans fearing unfavorable redrawings
of district lines oppose sampling.
</P>
<P>
   But Prewitt said the political battle will matter little if
people do not do their ''civic responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Hanoi Cites 1M Agent Orange Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Vietnam has an estimated 1 million victims
of Agent Orange, the toxic defoliant widely used by U.S. forces
during the Vietnam War, according to the Vietnamese vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh said the United States should
take responsibility for resolving the issue, the official
English-language Vietnam News reported Thursday. Washington and
Hanoi have been talking about an agreement to allow the two
countries to share research on effects of the defoliants.
</P>
<P>
   The victims include war veterans, their offspring and civilians
living in affected areas. Vietnam has a population of about 76
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another official said Friday that special funds set
up for victims of the Agent Orange have raised some $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   International and local organizations and individuals have
contributed $200,000 for the Central Fund for Agent Orange Victims
and $500,000 for programs in 45 provinces since their establishment
in late 1998, said Pham Thanh of the Central Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai last month signed a decision,
retroactive to Jan. 1, to provide monthly allowances to government
workers, soldiers and volunteers working or fighting in areas that
were sprayed in August 1961-April 1975 and their disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   The allowances range from $3.4 to $7 depending on the
seriousness of their illness or disability.
</P>
<P>
   A survey on victims of toxic chemicals sprayed by U.S. forces
during the war was completed last year, but the results have not
been released yet.
</P>
<P>
   Defoliants -- including Agent Orange with its highly toxic
component dioxin -- were sprayed over central and southern Vietnam
during the war to eliminate cover for the Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese army.

<HEADLINE> Rahlves Wins Downhill Skiing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KVITFJELL, Norway (AP) -- Daron Rahlves got the first victory of
his World Cup career and the first by an American man in five years
when he won the downhill today.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came on the hill where compatriot Tommy Moe won the
1994 Olympic gold medal and Kyle Rasmussen gave the United States
men their most recent victory on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Rahlves posted the fastest intermediate times down the
Olympiabakken and crossed the line in 1 minute, 28.69 seconds. He
beat Switzerland's Didier Cuche by nine-hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Rahlves' impressive win came after a steady performance in
training runs before the race. He had the fastest time Wednesday
and was fourth Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt really well in training and relaxed going into the
race,'' Rahlves said. ''This is so good! Last year was the worst in
my life when I dislocated my hip.''
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old skier from Truckee, Calif., narrowly missed the
podium here in 1995, when he placed fourth in a super-G.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow overnight delayed the start by nearly three hours,
and high winds in early afternoon forced the organizers to move the
start down a few hundred meters to the women's starting house. That
shortened the course to under 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann Maier of Austria, the top downhiller this season,
finished third in 1:28.95 on a hill he openly dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   But that finish enabled him to extend the lead in the World Cup
overall standings. Kjetil-Andre Aamodt of Norway, the only skier
with a mathematical chance to catch Maier, was a distant 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   Maier also leads the downhill standings. He has won three of
nine races this season.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Austrian team continued its domination, placing
three others in the top eight.
</P>
<P>
   Maier's teammate, Fritz Strobl, finished fourth in 1:29.08. He
was followed by Kristian Ghedina of Italy in 1:29.26, Juerg
Gruenenfelder of Switzerland in 1:29.39, Stephan Eberharter of
Austria in 1:29.43.
</P>
<P>
   Another downhill will be held Saturday with a Super-G scheduled
for Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Congo Archbishop: End Mass Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A Congo archbishop has ordered an end to a
3-week-old Sunday Mass strike which his priests were holding to
protest his forced exile, the Vatican's missionary news service
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Services will resume Sunday in the eastern Congo city of Bukavu
-- but without church bells, instruments or song until Archbishop
Emmanuel Kataliko is allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
   Bukavu priests stopped celebrating Sunday Mass after Feb. 12,
when rebel authorities blocked Kataliko's return on the grounds he
was encouraging resistance to them locally.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has urged that Kataliko, a Congolese, be
allowed back to his diocese.
</P>
<P>
   With Lent approaching, Kataliko wrote the local clerics asking
them to resume Sunday Mass ''in the simplest form, while we wait
for the situation to become normal,'' the Vatican missionary news
service Fides reported.
</P>
<P>
   His chief vicar has obliged, ordering simple services with time
for silent prayers for the archbishop's return.
</P>
<P>
   The vicar is asking couples who have already scheduled church
weddings to make them as spare as possible, without even wedding
Masses.

<HEADLINE> Gen. Pinochet Arrives in Chile  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet
returned to Chile a free man today, 16 months after he was detained
in Britain on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's plane was greeted by cheering supporters, marching
music -- and vociferous debate about his fate.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old former dictator left Britain on Thursday after
British Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled he was mentally and
physically unfit to be extradited to Spain for trial on charges of
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet emerged from the plane in a wheelchair and was lowered
to the tarmac on an improvised elevator. On the ground, the former
ruler stood up to the cheers of gathered supporters, many of whom
waved white flags.
</P>
<P>
   Using a cane at times, he walked over to the group and hugged
and kissed several of them, including army commander Gen. Ricardo
Izurieta and several of Pinochet's grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   An army band played some of Pinochet's favorite military
marches. The general lifted his arms to acknowledge the applause
and waved with his cane. He then boarded a helicopter with his wife
and children for a brief flight to a military hospital, where
family members said he was to undergo medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets outside the hospital, people chanted ''Pinochet,
Pinochet! We are with you!'' Many sang the national anthem and held
up large photographs of the general. Hospital employees helped
Pinochet down from the helicopter and into a wheelchair as army
commanders flanked him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to take him home right away, but that is for the
doctors to decide,'' said Pinochet's daughter, Lucia.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome ceremony, which included the nation's top military
brass, displeased the government. No government officials were on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears improper to organize this as if it were a party, in
spite of the circumstances under which Pinochet was allowed to
leave London,'' Interior Minister Raul Troncoso said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested under a Spanish warrant Oct. 16, 1998,
while recuperating from back surgery in a London hospital. A
Spanish judge accused him of orchestrating a systematic campaign of
torture against political opponents throughout his 17-year
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he
toppled the country's elected Marxist president in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet spent most of his detention under 24-hour guard in a
rented mansion outside London while the Spanish judge, several
European nations and human rights groups fought to have him
extradited for trial. But Straw freed Pinochet after an independent
medical examination found the former dictator's diminished mental
capacity would make it impossible for him to participate in his own
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Pinochet's return to Chile, hundreds of flags
began to appear on homes, buildings and lightposts Thursday in what
Santiago Mayor Cristian Labbe called ''a spontaneous reaction by
people who are happy with the return of the general.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm Pinochet's release generated among his supporters
stood in stark contrast to the frustration of his opponents --
especially relatives of alleged victims of Pinochet's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disappointing, but we should not be sad,'' said Viviana
Diaz, president of an organization of relatives of dissidents who
disappeared after being arrested during Pinochet's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should now continue to work for justice,'' said Diaz, whose
father is among more than 1,000 missing detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's critics worked to pave the way for a trial at home,
asking the Santiago appeals court Thursday to lift the
senator-for-life's congressional immunity so he can be prosecuted.
He is facing 60 lawsuits, mostly by relatives of victims of
repression or the political, social or labor organizations to which
they belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ''No Chilean citizen is above the law,'' President Eduardo Frei
said in a nationally broadcast address. ''The Chilean courts must
say their word now. That is what a large majority of Chileans
want.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Chile has an obligation before the world to achieve justice,''
said Sen. Sergio Bitar, a socialist.
</P>
<P>
   Demands also have mounted for Pinochet to withdraw from
political life -- a step that will be made easier later this month
by a law that would allow him, as a former president, to keep his
congressional immunity and salary and a security detail if he
resigns his senatorial post. He created that post in the 1980
constitution drafted by his regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he is so sick that he can't stand trial, he surely cannot
be a senator,'' said leftist congressman Juan Pablo Letelier.
</P>
<P>
   Even Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes, who worked for
Pinochet's release, said the former dictator should not remain
active in politics. But others insisted that is something for
Pinochet to decide.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe today, newspapers wrote that the failed attempts to
put Pinochet on trial were not a waste.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today the world is a little more just than when Pinochet was
arrested,'' leading Spanish daily El Pais said in an editorial. ''A
jurisprudence has been created that brings an end to impunity for
criminals of his ilk.''

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Discuss Military Ties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- In a step to further strengthen military ties
between Russia and China, a Chinese general discussed military
cooperation today with visiting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Zhang Wannian told Klebanov that cooperation between the
militaries has been good, and that China is confident military
relations will ''develop further in the new century,'' the Chinese
government news agency, Xinhua, reported.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow and Beijing have been improving their relations in recent
years, driven by what they see as U.S. global domination since the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   China has been an enthusiastic buyer of Russian weaponry, and
Chinese officials overseeing military purchases attended the
meeting. In addition to Zhang, a member of the party Politburo,
Xinhua said those present included Cao Gangchuan, who oversees
armaments for the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang and Klebanov discussed bilateral relations and regional
and international security issues, Xinhua reported without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov also met today with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji. Zhu called for further ''all-round
cooperation'' between China and Russia, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides also agreed Russia would supply China with nuclear
fuel for the Tianwan nuclear power plant being built jointly by
China and Russia in eastern China's Jiangsu province, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
discussed weapons deals and military cooperation during two days of
talks in Moscow, including a meeting with acting President Vladimir
Putin, said Russia's presidential chief of staff, Sergei Prikhodko,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.

<HEADLINE> H. Kong Cop Jumped McDonald's Line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- As if the fistfights, customer stampedes and
black marketing weren't enough, it has now been revealed that a
1998 McDonald's promotion led to an internal police probe of an
officer accused of jumping the line to buy a Snoopy doll.
</P>
<P>
   Customers crowding outside a McDonald's outlet to wait for a
chance to buy the toys apparently weren't amused.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities received an anonymous complaint that the senior
police constable who was controlling the crowds at the time might
have abused his power by calling the restaurant on his cellular
phone then picking up his order through a back door while ordinary
citizens outside waited hours for their turn.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who has not been publicly identified, was called in
to explain himself. He said he had ordered the food in advance -- a
service available to any customer -- and arranged to pick up his
order through a back door to avoid the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A report into the incident harshly criticized the officer's
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found no breach of police regulations, but they
said the officer violated the rules against carrying a mobile phone
on duty without authorization. It was not clear whether the officer
was punished.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald's promotion caused a huge stir in Hong Kong, with
some people physically fighting to get the dolls and others buying
and selling them at many times the original price of about 75
cents.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Seek Wetlands Protection  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New regulations that will make it harder to
build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army
Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically
sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps completed a 172-page overhaul of its wetlands
regulations this week and is ready to issue the new requirements,
according to government and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps scheduled a news conference on the regulations for
Monday. But sources familiar with the regulations, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said today final release may be delayed
because of some technical changes.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations have been in the works for more than four
years, but were given new impetus 18 months ago when President
Clinton said he wanted to tighten the requirements on developers
''to ensure that we think twice before building in our most
sensitive wetlands.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources who have seen the new regulations, the
Corps will require developers to obtain specific permits for
projects affecting at least a half-acre of wetlands, compared to
three acres under current regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction was reduced from 10 acres in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations will replace a ''nationwide permit'' system
for developers that environmentalists argue provided too many
loopholes to builders and led to widespread wetlands destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on wetlands loss vary widely. Environmentalists say
more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year,
about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national
permit system.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are disputed by the National Home Builders
Association, which argues that wetland mitigation by developers
actually restored more wetlands than were lost by construction
under the nationwide permit system.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations would cover about one-fourth of all
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations,
said the tighter standards are long overdue in strengthening
wetlands protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps first began reviewing the wetlands rules in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   'The nationwide permit has been used to destroy thousands of
acres of wetlands,'' said Rosenberg, calling it the most
significant reason for mass wetlands loss over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, homebuilders and the National Association of Counties
have accused the Corps of overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   There is ''little evidence to justify'' the abandonment of the
nationwide permit system, and the tighter half-acre restriction is
not needed, said the National Association of Home Builders.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1998 alone, Corps statistics show that under the
(nationwide) permit program landowners provided 6,304 acres in
mitigation in exchange for permission to fill or otherwise impact
2,974 acres.'' said Neil Gaffney, NAHB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps' completion of the new rules was first reported in
today's Washington Post.

Community Mourns Slain First Grader
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Mourners paid their respects today to 6-year-old
shooting victim Kayla Rolland as the girl's body lay in a white casket with gold
trim, a small doll of the television dinosaur Barney at the base. In her hands
was a small card with a poem titled ''I'm free.'' ''She was too young. She
didn't even have a chance to grow up,'' visitor Buffy Darling said. The funeral
home passed out pink ribbons to each mourner. A memorial service is planned
tonight for the girl allegedly shot to death by a first-grade classmate.

Census Forms Begin Arriving
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first big run of census forms landing on
doorsteps across America today, the Census Bureau is more worried about how
it'll get those forms back. Census director Kenneth Prewitt says the bureau has
tried nearly everything to get people to fulfill their ''civic duty'' and return
filled-out forms. The more forms turned in, the more accurate the results are,
and the results will show that the American population is on its way to becoming
a ''microcosm of the entire world,'' he said.

Pinochet's plane was greeted by Chilean flags, German march music and debate
about his fate. Pinochet left Britain a free man yesterday after British Home
Secretary Jack Straw ruled that the 84-year-old former dictator was mentally and
physically unfit to be extradited to Spain for trial on charges of human rights

running ads featuring a breast cancer survivor criticizing McCain and calling
for ''a candidate with a record on women's issues we can trust.'' McCain called
the ad misleading and said he has repeatedly voted to increase spending on
breast cancer research.

Poland Approves Pornography Ban

   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland's parliament narrowly approved a ban on all
pornography today in what would be one of Europe's toughest anti-porn laws if it
is allowed to take effect. The bill, backed by conservatives in the governing
Solidarity party and the Roman Catholic Church, would ban the import,
distribution and sale of pornography. The measure, which likely will face a
veto, would allow courts to impose fines and prison terms of up to two years on
violators.

public by December, U.S. company Digiscents Inc. said today. The company's
''iSmell'' machine will add a whole new dimension to computer games and other
electronic products, Digiscents said. The company's technology turns smells into
digital codes that can be stored on laser discs or as computer files, and can

this past fall. The Panthers waived Carruth in December, and NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue suspended him indefinitely.

   Jobless Rate Up From 30-Year Low
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate ticked up to
4.1 percent in February from a 30-year low as 43,000 workers found
jobs, the fewest in nine months. Last month's jobless rate,
reported today by the Labor Department, followed January's 4.0
percent rate, the lowest since 3.9 percent in January 1970. Many
analysts had expected February's unemployment rate to hold steady.
The 43,000 new jobs created in February marked the weakest showing
since 28,000 jobs were added in May 1999. Jobs growth was
restrained in part by sluggish growth in the service sector --
normally the engine behind job creation in the United States.

   Factory Orders Fall 1.1 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said today that orders
to U.S. factories fell by a bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in
January, the steepest drop since a 1.4 percent decline in April. In
December, orders rose 3.8 percent. January's decline was led by a
huge 12.9 percent drop in orders for electronics, the sharpest
decline since July 1997. Orders for transportation equipment fell 4
percent as decreases in orders for shipbuilding, tanks and
airplanes more than offset increases for cars and railroad
equipment. Excluding the volatile transportation category, overall
orders fell 0.6 percent, the first decline since October.

   Japan Says Debt Is Inevitable
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Weeks before Japan announces fiscal 1999 year-end
national debt statistics, the Finance Ministry said today that
maintaining a record-high amount of outstanding bonds will be
inevitable under current economic conditions. Japan had nearly
$3.35 trillion in outstanding government bonds -- more than any
other nation -- as of Sept. 30, 1999, the most recent Finance
Ministry figure. New data will be released on March 24. As a result
of heavy borrowing, Japan, the world's second-richest country
behind the United States, is also among the world's most indebted.
The ministry said its total debt forecast for 1999 exceeds $5.6
trillion.

   Analysts Mull Palm's Stunning IPO
</P>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The stock of Palm Inc. lost 12
percent of its value this morning after soaring 150 percent in a
dramatic launch yesterday as a publicly traded company. In its
first day of trading, Palm shares surged as investors rushed to
take a stake in the No. 1 handheld electronic organizer maker. In a
round of profit-taking this morning, as some analysts questioned
whether the stunning launch was overdone, Palm was down $11.43} at
$83.62{ a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Wall Street
response to initial public offerings of high-flying technology
issues had left Palm Inc. with a market value almost twice that of
its corporate parent, 3Com Corp., which still retains control of
94.8 percent of Palm's shares.

yesterday backed off plans to cross-reference its own vast records

people had thought was confidential -- with lists of millions of
names and other identifying data. While data on Web surfing are
often tracked by online marketers, the information can't easily be

   Venezuelan Oil Workers Strike
</P>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Thousands of Venezuelan oil workers
went on strike today to protest the state-run oil company's refusal
to sign a preliminary accord for a new labor contract. In an effort
to maintain the flow of petroleum from the world's third-largest
oil exporter, the company began using mid-level managers to help
run production operations. Venezuela is one of the top three
foreign suppliers of oil to the United States. Worldwide cuts in
oil production have already caused crude prices to nearly triple
since December 1998, sending heating oil prices and gasoline prices
soaring. It was unclear what effect the Venezuelan strike would
have on prices.

<HEADLINE> Russia Candidates Launch TV Ads  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH INGRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin's rivals in Russia's presidential
race launched television and radio ad campaigns today amid a report
that the acting president will not take advantage of the free
advertising offered to all candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency reported that an unidentified source in
Putin's election headquarters said Putin already had ''enough
opportunities to communicate with voters and spell out his
position.'' The source said the acting president would turn down
free radio and TV spots to ensure equal conditions for all the
candidates, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   However, Putin's campaign office would only say that the acting
president himself would have to decide whether or not to use the ad
time, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian television channels have given wide and positive
coverage to Putin, far and away the frontrunner in the March 26
vote. And Putin has been sensitive to complaints that his media
exposure and his domination of the opinion polls, which
consistently reflect support of more than 60 percent, have left
voters virtually no viable alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   His closest rival, Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, gets
about 20 percent support in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   The free advertising and a series of televised, four-way debates
beginning next week are intended to give even the most poorly
funded candidate a chance to speak directly to voters. Few have
tried to dress up their advertising. In most of the five-minute
spots that ran today, the candidates sat in nondescript offices and
recited the main elements of their platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov sat stiffly underneath a portrait of Russia's favorite
poet, Alexander Pushkin. He remembered occasionally to substitute a
smile for his customary stony expression as he courted votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The authorities are hiding the real situation,'' he warned.
''If the existing course continues, the Russian economy will crash
at the beginning of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to immediately raise salaries, lower taxes, and
guarantee cheap housing, free education and medical care. He also
repeated his call for renationalizing property that he claimed was
illegally privatized.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Titov, the reform-oriented governor of the Samara
region of central Russia, called for ''strengthening the rule of
law, not of bureaucrats.'' He alternated his litany of achievements
in Samara -- including claims that the region paid the highest
salaries and pensions in the country, and paid them on time -- with
film clips and a campaign song.
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign swing to Surgut, a major oil- and gas-producing
center in western Siberia, Putin said he would not make
''unrealistic promises.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who make unrealistic promises are deceiving themselves
and deceiving those they make the promises to,'' he said. ''We must
not just talk about creating jobs, but about creating the kind of
jobs that will allow for the efficient exploitation of resources.''

<HEADLINE> Italy Pizza Mafia Shootout Kills 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROTONE, Italy (AP) -- Three heavily armed gunmen burst into a
pizza parlor in southern Italy and opened fire, killing a suspected
Mafia figure and a volunteer worker caught in the line of fire,
police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A second bystander was hit in the leg in the attack late
Thursday in the Euro 2000 pizzeria in Isola Capo Rizzuto, a small
town in the southern region of Calabria.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, three mobsters and an elderly man caught in the
crossfire were slain in a shootout in the main street of a nearby
town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are shocked by all this violence,'' said Damiano Milone,
mayor of Isola Capo Rizzuto. ''We feel impotent in our efforts ...
against incidents that throw us back light years.''
</P>
<P>
   Milone convoked an urgent meeting of the region's security
chiefs to coordinate action against the local Mafia clans suspected
of ordering the killings, part of an escalating turf war for
control of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Calabria is home of the 'ndrangheta, an organized crime
syndicate whose activities include extortion rackets, drug and
weapons smuggling and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were investigating but noted that tracking down
Mafia gunmen was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   The three gangsters were masked and armed with rifles, machine
guns and pistols, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were identified as suspected Mafia member Francesco
Arena, 39, and Francesco Scerbo, 29, who volunteers for a group
that helps refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The injured man, who works in town hall, was in the hospital in
fair condition.

<HEADLINE> Lions, Mike Tomczak Agree to Terms  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Quarterback Mike Tomczak has agreed to a two-year
contract with the Detroit Lions as a free agent and will play
behind and mentor third-year starter Charlie Batch.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak's agent, Paul Sheehy declined to specify terms of the
contract he said the quarterback will probably sign on Saturday.
Tomczak, 37, is a 15-year NFL veteran who last season played for
the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   WDIV-TV in Detroit and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh both reported
Thursday night that Tomczak's contract was worth $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions said they had no immediate announcement about Tomczak
-- or on reports that backup quarterback Gus Frerotte had signed a
one-year, $1 million contract with the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary for Frerotte's agent, Ralph Cindrich, said this
morning that agent was awaiting confirmation of Frerotte's signing
and was not immediately reachable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy said four NFL teams -- the Lions, the Tennessee Titans and
two other clubs he declined to identify -- expressed interest in
Tomczak, who over his NFL career has thrown for 15,690 yards, with
85 touchdowns and 102 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sheehy said, Tomczak visited with Lions coach
Bobby Ross, offensive coordinator Sylvester Croom and quarterbacks
coach Jim Zorn and ''got a real good feel for the offense they're
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the agent said, Tomczak ''called me on his cell
phone to tell me how excited he was and what a great environment it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Once he left, my marching orders were to get a deal done,''
Sheehy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a very defined goal -- he's definitely the No. 2 guy,''
Sheehy said. ''He's been known as a coach on the field, and it'll
just add to the growth of Charlie Batch. It never hurts to have a
veteran there to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak started his career with the Bears, playing six seasons
in Chicago before spending one year each with Green Bay and
Cleveland. He then joining the Steelers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his time in Pittsburgh has been spent as a back-up,
although he did start 15 games in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Sports Agent Black Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Sports agent Tank Black pleaded
innocent today to charges he bilked several former NFL clients out
of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Black also lost his biggest client, NBA star Vince Carter, who
said Thursday that he was suspending his relationship with Black
pending the outcome of his criminal fraud case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Gary R. Jones granted Black a $1 million bond
Thursday, denying the prosecutors' request to keep him in jail
until the fraud trial begins. Prosecutors had argued that Black was
a flight risk, presenting evidence from a federal drug case
involving the agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll see you all when court starts,'' Black said Thursday,
smiling as he exited the courtroom after the 9{-hour detention
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Until his trial, tentatively scheduled to begin in May, he'll
spend some time trying to rebuild a once-thriving agent business
now nearly devoid of big-name clients.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support Tank and his efforts to bring these matters to an
early and successful resolution,'' Carter said. ''Tank is a good
friend and advisor and I wish him the best. However, I feel I must
take this action in the best interest of my overall career.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Sanford based his detention case
against Black around evidence gathered from an unrelated drug
investigation in the Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said Black and his associates played a key role in
helping drug traffickers launder money and escape the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''That man has been virtually a liar, cheat and thief for the
last three years,'' Sanford said. ''He has lied to clients, stolen
from players. He has no sense of integrity and no sense of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   IRS criminal investigator Kevin Boudreau testified that Black
laundered money, saying one witness heard the agent ask for a 25
percent fee to ''help you clean your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue were two overseas business trips Black took with
the reputed drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The first trip was to Rio De Janeiro in February 1998 so
purported drug dealers could search for real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The next came two months later to Jamaica with two fugitives who
filled the small jet with luggage and still haven't returned to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''How you can make a business trip with someone with all that
luggage and not have more insight into the person, I don't
understand,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Black's lawyer, Peter George, claimed his client didn't know the
travel partners were drug traffickers or fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Jones ordered Black to use his house as collateral for the bond
and put him on a 10 p.m. curfew each night. Black will be monitored
by an electronic bracelet. Jones also ordered Black's pastor in
Columbia, S.C., to oversee the bond restrictions and forced the
agent to get approval before taking any out-of-town trips.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions were set to go into effect Friday, after
Black's arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Black could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted on fraud
and money laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel civil case filed by the Securities and Exchanges
Commission continues, as well. The SEC seeks to regain much of the
money allegedly scammed from about a dozen NFL players, including
former Florida stars Ike Hilliard, Jacquez Green, Reidel Anthony
and Fred Taylor.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Packers' Financial Woes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A proposed $295 million renovation of
Lambeau Field might not keep the Green Bay Packers financially
competitive in the NFL, state auditors said today.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the Legislative Audit Bureau said the Packers
have benefited from several years of record earnings, but the team
has used much of its available money for player signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The team will have to begin selling off $3.7 million in
investments this year to pay its expenses and will probably have to
deal with the same problem in coming years, the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   However, auditors said they were not sure an extra $20 million
each year earned from the $295 million renovation would make the
team financially competitive, as the team has said it would.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot determine whether the amount of additional net
income that will be generated by the Packers' proposal --
approximately $20.2 million in (fiscal year) 2004-05 -- is more or
less than is needed to remain competitive,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers are investigating the issue because the Packers
want the Legislature to give Brown County the authority to levy a
0.5 percent sales tax to cover $160 million of the project's cost.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, reported earlier by WITI-TV in Milwaukee and the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, shows retained earnings rising from
$40.5 million in fiscal 1994-95 to an estimated $83.9 million at
the end of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   It said cash and investments used to pay salaries and other
operating costs went from $22.1 million to $37.5 million, a much
lower percentage.
</P>
<P>
   That has caused the $3.7 million deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
   WITI-TV reported Thursday night that, based on the audit, the
Packers expect to be losing almost $7 million a year in five years
without a larger revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   The audit included the Packers' audited financial statements,
information on the Lambeau renovation, the team's investment policy
and the Packers' projected income statements, balance sheets and
cash flows through March 2005. The Packers did not turn over some
accounting transactions and contracts for goods and services, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Civic officials in Green Bay said this week that selling naming
rights to Lambeau, one of the most historic stadiums in NFL
history, would be one way to reduce reliance on a sales tax to pay
for the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Packers president Bob Harlan has said he is against renaming the
stadium, citing fan opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope it never has to be used,'' he said Thursday. ''If
you're going to fight to save the stadium, then you're going to
fight to save the name.''

<HEADLINE> Turkey Frees 18 Shootout Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRABZON, Turkey (AP) -- A Turkish court on Friday convicted two
police officers of murder and acquitted 18 others charged with
opening fire on a crowd of demonstrators, killing nine.
</P>
<P>
   Adem Albayrak was convicted of killing four demonstrators and
was sentenced to 24 years in prison for each murder. Mehmet
Gundogan was convicted of killing two protesters, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge reduced their sentences to six years for Albayrak
and three years for Gundogan and then ruled that neither had to
spend time in prison since they had already served time in jail
pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame,'' shouted Binnaz Kopal, the mother of one of the
victims, in the courthouse in the Black Sea city of Trabzon.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one demonstrators were killed during four days of rioting
in March 1995, when police clashed with thousands of people
protesting a coffeehouse slaying by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes took place in the Gazi neighborhood of Istanbul,
where leftist and pro-Kurdish demonstrations are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer of the relatives of the victims said they would
appeal the verdict first to a Turkish appeals court and then to the
Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Bush backers Pataki and Giuliani battle over McCain attacks  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani today defended his
refusal to join his fellow New York supporters of George W. Bush,
including Gov. George Pataki, in attacks against John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something that maybe some people just don't
understand. I'm a friend of John McCain,'' Giuliani told Albany's
WROW-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some people, they want to demand that you get
involved in negative campaigning and they question your loyalty if
you won't do it,'' the mayor added. ''In this particular situation,
I'm extremely loyal to Governor Bush. There is no hidden agenda ...
I just happen to have a great deal of personal regard for John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments were the latest development in the sniping between
the Texas governor's two best-known supporters in New York, Pataki
and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   With next week's ''Super Tuesday'' New York primary looming, the
infighting comes at an inopportune time for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown the Arizona senator running
neck-and-neck with Bush in New York where almost every top
Republican has endorsed the Texas governor's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is running for the U.S. Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, has refused to join Pataki in criticizing McCain
and has repeatedly said nice things about the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pataki and his political allies launched an attack
against McCain, citing his Senate voting record as being ''as
anti-New York ... as anybody's in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani refused to allow his name to be used on a mailing
to New Yorkers criticizing McCain and he balked at attending a news
conference on Thursday with other mayors from across New York also
meant to attack McCain's voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's spokeswoman and one of his top political
advisers, said Thursday that she was ''dumbfounded'' by the mayor's
reticence to join in, especially given his own campaign for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to be defending the state in the Senate, you
have an obligation to point out another senator's votes against
your interests and those of the constituency you want to
represent,'' the Pataki aide said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in political circles that Giuliani's
electoral chances would be better served by having McCain at the
top of the GOP ticket in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is clearly not about what's in the best interests of
Bush,'' one influential New York Republican, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said when asked about the Pataki-Giuliani flap.
''It's clearly about what's in the best interests of Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   The contretemps was the latest evidence that chilly relations
between Pataki and Giuliani haven't warmed much. There has been bad
blood between the two ever since the mayor crossed party lines in
1994 to endorse then-Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki. Among other
things, Giuliani questioned Pataki's ethics. Pataki won the
election.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the intervention of Bush last year that led to
Pataki's backing for Giuliani's Senate campaign. At the time, Bush
was looking for a peaceful New York scene in which he could coast
to victory in any GOP primary. That notion disappeared with
McCain's resounding victory in the New Hampshire primary and rising
poll numbers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new chill, aides to Giuliani and Pataki said both
still planned to accompany Bush on a campaign trip across the state
on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio interview today, Giuliani denied any tension
between he and Pataki and blamed the problems on ''staff members.''

<HEADLINE> Ninth German Crash Victim Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- A ninth person has died from injuries
received in last month's train crash near Cologne, while the
investigation into the cause of the derailing continues,
prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Regine Appenrodt in Cologne denied a report released
Friday by the Munich-based Focus magazine, which said investigators
had determined the 28-year-old train driver bore the main
responsibility for the Feb. 6 crash. Eight people died at the scene
and 149 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   One of the injured, who had to have both legs amputated after
the crash, died at a Cologne hospital on Thursday, Appenrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   Appenrodt said prosecutors were still waiting for a report on
the accident by the federal railways monitoring office, as well as
witness accounts taken by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the train driver, who was treated at a hospital for shock,
has not yet given his version of what happened, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is something we have to assess and we can't do that
yet,'' Appenrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also need to determine if a breakdown in
instructions to the engineer provided by the railway contributed to
the crash, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said the driver sped through the Bruehl
station at 75 mph instead of the allowed 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight express train flew off the tracks, with the engine
smashing through the wall of a home near the train station. No one
in the house was injured.

<HEADLINE> Germany May Change IMF Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both the United States and Europe are
signaling that they are searching for a graceful way to resolve a
nasty dispute over who should head the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The European candidate to lead the 182-nation lending agency,
German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser, received 43 percent
of the votes cast in an informal straw ballot by the IMF's
24-member executive board on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer, a naturalized American
who has been running the IMF since the departure last month of
Michel Camdessus, was a distant second with 12 percent. Eisuke
Sakikibara, a former top official of the Japanese Finance Ministry,
was third, with 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No candidate received the necessary majority. Even more telling
was that countries representing 36 percent of the IMF's voting
shares abstained from the balloting, a group that included the
IMF's largest member, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Germany signaled for the first time today that it was ready to
start looking for another European candidate who could win U.S.
support.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said in a brief statement
that he was encouraged by ''European solidarity'' in the initial
straw ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I now assume that a common result with the U.S.A. and Japan is
achievable,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the straw vote Thursday, Clinton sought to undo the
damage done by his administration on Monday when it angered the
Germans by publicly announcing the United States could not support
Koch-Weser. Administration officials said he lacked sufficient
stature to head the agency that plays the lead role in handling
international financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am completely committed to having a European head of the
IMF. And it would suit me if the person were from Germany,''
Clinton told reporters at the White House. ''I'd like to see
Germany play a bigger role in all these international
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said the United States would not be supporting
Fischer, whom the president praised as an ''enormously able man,''
because another naturalized American citizen, James Wolfensohn,
heads the World Bank. Wolfensohn was born in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition over the past half century, an American has always
headed the World Bank and a European has headed the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's rejection of Fischer's candidacy was aimed at putting
to rest fears among Europeans that America's ultimate goal in the
IMF leadership battle is to win the post for Fischer, a close
friend and former teacher of Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's playing any games here,'' Clinton insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's vote, Schroeder's government had
expressed anger over how the United States handled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, Schroeder's national security adviser, said in
an interview published Thursday in The Washington Post, that ''the
United States now thinks it can throw its weight around as the
world's most powerful nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said the whole episode was ''a demonstration of how the
United States lacks the necessary sensitivity toward its allies,
and the response has been to unite the Europeans more than ever
against American bullying.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers on Thursday refused to directly answer questions about
published reports in Italy that he had approached Italian Treasury
Minister Giuliano Amato and asked him to serve in the IMF post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not endorsed any specific candidate. As the president
has made clear, it is our hope that a strong European candidate
with the requisite stature, expertise and ability to command global
consensus will emerge,'' Summers told reporters.

<HEADLINE> McCain Attacks Mystery TV Ads  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain said today that TV ads from a
mysterious group questioning his commitment to clean air show
what's wrong with the campaign finance system. ''Somebody's putting
in $2 million to try to hijack the campaign here in New York,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized as misleading rival George W. Bush's ads that
suggest McCain opposes federal funding for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   As both candidates honed in on the key state, an aide said
McCain's campaign was targeting Catholic Republicans in New York
with telephone messages touting his economic proposals, in lieu of
controversial calls elsewhere linking Bush to anti-Catholic
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush headed today to a breast cancer research center in New York
to emphasize his criticism of McCain for listing some breast cancer
projects as pork-barrel spending. His ads in New York feature a
breast cancer survivor calling McCain's opposition to research
funding ''shocking'' and saying America deserves ''a candidate with
a record on women's issues we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has repeatedly voted to increase spending on
breast cancer research. Speaking on ''Imus in the Morning,'' the
Arizona senator said he could get his message to voters despite
such ads, but ''If they don't figure it out, we will have run an
honorable campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on NBC's ''Today'' show, McCain suggested the ads aired
by Republicans for Clean Air were tied to Bush. That's
''symptomatic of part of their campaign,'' said McCain, who called
the ads an example of unregulated ''soft money''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what I've been fighting against,'' McCain said. ''You
see, this soft money, nobody knows where it comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans were focusing on New York today, a crucial
state in next week's Super Tuesday round of voting. Political
director John Weaver said McCain was using a phone bank to target
his economic message to Catholics, who make up 46 percent of the
state's registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain flew to New York overnight from St. Louis, where he was
linked by satellite Thursday night into a debate with Bush and Alan
Keyes that featured differences on campaign finances and religion
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   After a night back home in Austin, Texas, Gov. Bush was going to
the breast cancer research center at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain competitive in New York, one of 13 states
holding Super Tuesday contests that could decide the GOP
presidential nomination. California and Ohio also are among the
biggest states, and a candidate winning all three of them likely
could sew up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been on the defensive much of the week after he
criticized evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as ''agents
of intolerance,'' and concedes he needs to refocus his message.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to stay on message and not be distracted by a lot of
the stuff that's going on,'' McCain said on ''Today.'' But he
dismissed a suggestion that his controversial speech in Virginia on
the religious right was a mistake because it hurt his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to do what you think is best for your party,''
McCain said. ''You can't gauge what you do just on your political
ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was spending today in New York, then heading for
Connecticut, with plans to spend the weekend in New England before
returning to California on Sunday. Bush went home to Austin after
last night's debate but was headed for New York today, trying to
overtake McCain's edge in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate framing this crucial campaign sprint, McCain urged
''stop the squabbling'' while Bush complained McCain uses ''the
politics of smearing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended phone calls made on his behalf blasting Bush for
visiting Bob Jones University without quickly denouncing its
anti-Catholic stance, but wanted to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am interested in the issues of the day,'' said McCain.
''Stop the squabbling, we can address the issues.'' Bush was having
none of it, lecturing McCain sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't regret going to many places,'' said Bush. ''What I
regret is the politics of smearing somebody's reputation. Catholics
all across the country are coming to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defends that criticism as factual, but Bush dismissed
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't think those phone calls labeled me an
anti-Catholic bigot, then you weren't paying attention to what your
campaign was putting out,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run an insurgent campaign, but went out of his way to
reassure Republicans of his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican Party is my home,'' said McCain. ''No matter
who our nominee is, I will support that nominee. I am a proud
conservative with a strong conservative record.''

<HEADLINE> Mushers Face Effects of Fatigue  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Mushers can't outrun their need for
sleep on the 1,150-mile Iditarod trail through Alaska's wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the record 81 teams leaving Anchorage for Nome will
be at their freshest. But eventually, doctors say, fatigue can take
over -- impairing judgment, forcing eyes shut and sometimes even
causing hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have long-distance competitive races like this,
(mushers) become very sleep-deprived,'' said Anne Morris, medical
director of the Sleep Disorder Center at Providence Alaska Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Iditarod mushers spend nine days or more on the trail to Nome,
day and night. The race goes over two Alaska mountain ranges,
crosses frozen rivers and travels miles of wind-swept Bering Sea
ice.
</P>
<P>
   While there are mandatory breaks, including a 24-hour stop, they
must feed and water their teams, change their dogs' booties and do
everything else needed to keep their sleds on the go.
</P>
<P>
   While dogs spend about equal time racing and resting, mushers'
chores eat into their breaks. Their sleeping routines also become
scrambled as they choose their rest and run periods based on
factors such as trail conditions, temperatures and their team's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe halfway through the race, the need for deep sleep will
take its toll, Morris said: ''There will be such a pressure for
dream sleep built up, you will begin to dream -- but you are
awake.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, most mushers are racing on autopilot, Morris
said. That's fine ''if you don't have a moose walk in front of your
team,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mushers should take their sleep cues from their dogs,
Morris said. The animals are excellent nappers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, veterinarians checked over the 1,650 Iditarod
dogs, examining everything from the toughness of their feet to
their levels of body fat. A typical dog loses about 10 pounds on
the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, electrocardiograms have performed on the dogs to
weed out those with heart problems. Usually one or two are weeded
out each year, said Ken Hinchcliff, an associate professor of
veterinary medicine at Ohio State University who is studying the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Sled dogs' hearts are so big that, at first glance, vets might
think the dogs suffer from heart disease, Hinchcliff said. The
organs look more like those found in rowers -- large and muscled --
rather than those of the marathoners that they are, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests have also shown that between 30 percent and 50 percent of
Iditarod dogs have heart murmurs. But the condition is considered
normal -- just ''a function of getting fit,'' Hinchcliff said.

<HEADLINE> Appliance Co. Moulinex To Cut Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French household appliances group Moulinex SA said
Friday that it will shed 2,100 jobs, or 21 percent of its worldwide
work force, over the next several years as part of a restructuring
program.
</P>
<P>
   France will bear the brunt of the cuts, where some 1,700 cuts
are expected before the program ends in 2002 or 2003. The company
also plans job cuts in Germany and Spain. It employs 10,018 people
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   When the program is completed, the group will have 5,300
employees in Europe -- half of its 1996 European workforce, Moulinex
said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Moulinex executives announced restructuring plans,
though they did not pinpoint the number of job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The group had announced that it would close a French factory and
transfer production of certain lines to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moulinex produces the Krups brand of coffee makers as well as
its own brand, Moulinex vacuum cleaners and other small appliances.

<HEADLINE> German Conservatives Challenge Fine  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Struggling to recover from a finance scandal,
Germany's Christian Democrats will file a lawsuit next week to stop
a $21 million fine imposed on them for submitting a false financial
report to parliament, a spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats have called the fine -- the biggest ever
imposed on a party -- excessive and have argued it would unfairly
handicap the party's ability to mount future campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   A legal challenge had been drafted and was undergoing a final
check before it is brought to court, party spokesman Ralf Weidner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, levied last month, grew out of a scandal over illegal
financial practices under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl that broke
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who also served as party chairman for a quarter century,
has admitted accepting the equivalent of $1 million in undeclared
contributions. His refusal to name the donors sparked a
parliamentary probe into whether the cash influenced government
decisions -- something Kohl has repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse, who determined the
fine after an audit of the party's 1998 financial disclosure forms,
has defended the level as the amount set by law.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview to appear in the Mannheimer Morgen newspaper
Saturday, Thierse, a Social Democrat, said he was willing to
discuss a compromise over the time period in which the fine would
be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the fines could climb into the hundreds
of millions as continuing audits turn up more evidence of illegal
donations, but Thierse said the Christian Democrats did not need to
fear that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider such a level to be speculative exaggeration,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Germany Expels Four Turks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- German officials have ordered the expulsion of
four Turkish diplomats who allegedly spied on Turks living in
Germany, a magazine reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three other alleged agents already withdrawn by
Turkey were barred from re-entering Germany, the weekly Der Spiegel
said.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman refused to comment on the report, but
said Ernst Uhrlau, the government's intelligence service
coordinator, met his Turkish counterpart last weekend and settled
the spy dispute. The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said
both sides reached ''a legally acceptable solution in the case''
but agreed to keep details confidential.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the four agents were camouflaged as
diplomats working at consulates in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities suspected the four of recruiting agents among
the 2 million Turks living in Germany and intentionally feeding
German security services false information, Der Spiegel said. The
report said they were also suspected of stirring up trouble between
Turks and Kurds from Turkey, who make up about a quarter of
Germany's Turkish community.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Disperse Serbs  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French troops fired tear
gas today to disperse about 200 Serb protesters, some of whom tried
to push their way into three apartment buildings where the United
Nations hopes to return ethnic Albanians residents who had fled.
</P>
<P>
   The scuffle took place a day after stone-throwing Serbs turned
back ethnic Albanians who tried to return home to the
Serb-controlled north bank of the Ibar River as the first stage of
a U.N. and NATO plan to end the ethnic division in Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian leaders said they might try again today to
return to the north bank.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble started when the Serb demonstrators marched through the
northern section of the city to protest the resettlement plan. When
they arrived at the three high-rises, they tried to push their way
through a cordon of NATO troops and U.N. police, but were shoved
back.
</P>
<P>
   After tear gas was fired, the Serbs retreated several yards
while French reinforcements, including about 80 police, rushed to
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Three French peacekeepers were injured in the melee, said Cpt.
Frederic Beaumont, a spokesman for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred other Serbs swarmed to the area, but made no new
attempt to confront the French troops.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the French broke into the offices of local Serb leaders,
looking for three riot shields they say were taken from them during
Thursday's unrest. Although the Serbs said they were willing to
unlock the office door for the French, the troops broke it down.
</P>
<P>
   A group of angry Serbs formed around the office building,
forcing the French to withdraw. Oliver Ivanovic, a well-known Serb
leader, called the act ''a provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather also hampered the resettlement plan. NATO officials
today had to close the footbridge intended for use by ethnic
Albanians after heavy rains swelled the Ibar River, which divides
the city into rival ethnic camps.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers offered to escort any ethnic Albanians who wanted
to go home across the main bridge. As of mid-afternoon, however,
none had accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three families had been due to return home Thursday over
the footbridge, U.N. spokeswoman Kirsten Haupt said.
</P>
<P>
   However, 150 Serbs, mostly women, assembled at the northern end
of the bridge Thursday and threw stones at ethnic Albanians trying
to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovska Mitrovica, 20 miles northwest of Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina, has been the scene of repeated ethnic unrest in
recent weeks, resulting in several deaths and dozens of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed violence in Kosovo has thwarted efforts by NATO and
Kosovo's U.N. administration to establish normality in the Serbian
province eight months after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced
an end to the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and the pullout of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NATO announced it would allow up to 120 ethnic
Albanian families to return to homes they had fled on the Ibar's
north bank. To facilitate the return, NATO built a footbridge
across the Ibar near the three apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Bernard Kouchner, the top U.N. official in
Kosovo, Bajram Rexhepi, the leader of Kosovska Mitrovica's ethnic
Albanian community, said a new attempt to cross would be made
today.
</P>
<P>
   Before his own meeting with Kouchner, Ivanovic expressed regret
over Thursday's stone-throwing. But he said the Serbs did not want
the ethnic Albanians to return unless Serbs in isolated villages in
the nearby Vucitrn area were better protected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deeply regret what happened here,'' Ivanovic said. ''But
Serbs were angry because Albanians are returning to their homes
while two Serb villages in the area will soon be empty because
people have to move because of Albanian pressure.''

<HEADLINE> Officials: German TV Show Degrading  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- State officials recommended sanctions against a
private German television network Friday after declaring that its
controversial new ''Big Brother'' series -- featuring 10 people
locked in a house and videotaped nonstop -- offends human dignity.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the media authority in Hesse state, which
oversees the network producing the show, said it found RTL II's
''reality TV'' series, which began airing Wednesday, to be in
violation of media laws prohibiting programs that degrade people.
</P>
<P>
   The federal broadcasting oversight board was to consider Hesse's
finding on Monday. If a majority of the states agree, the board
could impose punishment ranging from a fine to a ban on the series.
</P>
<P>
   The show, modeled on a Dutch hit series of the same name, films
every second of 10 contestants' lives with 28 cameras, condensing
the day's events down to an hour show broadcast each night.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will periodically be able to kick contestants out of the
house in a telephone vote. The person left after 100 days wins
$125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and church leaders have blasted the show as a ''new
low'' in television and called for viewer and advertiser boycotts.
Critics have called the first two episodes boring.
</P>
<P>
   RTL II spokesman Matthias Trenkle denied that ''Big Brother''
violated human dignity or privacy rights. The network said it may
challenge any sanction in court.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rally; Dow Up 197  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied today as the government's
employment report showed some easing of the tight labor market. The
news calmed investors' fears that the Federal Reserve will push
interest rates sharply higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 197.00 at 10,0361.92, adding to the 302-point gain
already tallied this week by the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 18.34 at 1,400.10, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 99.66 at 4,854.17.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shot higher from the start today after the Labor
Department reported that 43,000 new jobs were created in February,
well below analysts' expectations and the weakest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment ticked up to 4.1 percent in February
from 4 percent in January, but it still remained at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing labor market has spooked Wall Street for
months, with many investors worrying about how continued growth
will affect businesses. Companies must offer competitive wages and
incentives to keep employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at
such low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big concern is that the economy was going to overheat and
employment was going to be one of the biggest problems,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''But we did not create nearly the number
of jobs that were expected and the unemployment rate went up.
That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rate four times since June in an
effort to slow the economy to a pace that will allow continued
growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that the Fed would take a more aggressive stance in
boosting rates has caused great volatility in the stock market in
recent weeks. Blue-chip stocks have been under the greatest
pressure, with the Dow falling below 10,000 for the first time
since last April before recovering this week.
</P>
<P>
   While most investors still believe that the Fed will likely
boost rates again soon -- maybe even at their meeting later this
month -- many now believe that the hike won't be as sharp as
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks led today's rally. DuPont rose 4~ at 51} and 3M
rose 5] to 91 7/16. Technology shares also gained. Microsoft gained
4 9/16 at 97 15/16 and Cisco Systems rose 2 5/16 at 135 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 392.22 million
shares, up from 404.59 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 10.09 at 594.13.

McCain Attacks Mystery TV Ads
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain said today that TV ads from a mysterious group
questioning his commitment to clean air show what's wrong with the campaign
finance system. ''Somebody's putting in $2 million to try to hijack the campaign
here in New York,'' McCain said. He also criticized as misleading rival George
W. Bush's ads that suggest McCain opposes federal funding for breast cancer
research. An aide said McCain's campaign was targeting Catholic Republicans in
New York with telephone messages touting his economic proposals.

   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Mourners paid their respects today to 6-year-old
shooting victim Kayla Rolland as the girl's body lay in a white casket with gold
trim, a small doll of the television dinosaur Barney at the base. In her hands
was a small card with a poem titled ''I'm free.'' ''She was too young. She
didn't even have a chance to grow up,'' visitor Buffy Darling said. The funeral
home passed out pink ribbons to each mourner. A memorial service is planned
tonight for the girl allegedly shot to death by a first-grade classmate.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUBA-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels ambushed a column of Russian troops
in the capital, Grozny, killing 37 soldiers, the military said today. The ambush
yesterday was one of the largest rebel actions in Grozny since Russian forces
claimed to have taken full control of the capital on Feb. 6 following months of
shelling and street fighting. The attack indicated that the rebels remain a
potent force, still able to stage major offensives despite Russian claims that
the insurgents are in disarray.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sixteen months after he was detained in Britain on
torture charges, former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet returned to Chile today.
Pinochet's plane was greeted by Chilean flags, German march music and debate
about his fate. Pinochet left Britain a free man yesterday after British Home
Secretary Jack Straw ruled that the 84-year-old former dictator was mentally and
physically unfit to be extradited to Spain for trial on charges of human rights
abuses.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airports could raise their passenger taxes by $1.50 a
person, to $4.50, under a major aviation funding bill on which Congress is
completing work. That could mean an extra $18 for a round trip with connections.
The increase in the ''passenger facility charges'' was one of the final issues

Census Forms Begin Arriving

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first big run of census forms landing on
doorsteps across America today, the Census Bureau is more worried about how
it'll get those forms back. Census director Kenneth Prewitt says the bureau has
tried nearly everything to get people to fulfill their ''civic duty'' and return
filled-out forms. The more forms turned in, the more accurate the results are,
and the results will show that the American population is on its way to becoming
a ''microcosm of the entire world,'' he said.

   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Sports agent Tank Black pleaded innocent today to
charges he bilked several former NFL clients out of millions of dollars. Black
also lost his biggest client, NBA star Vince Carter, who said yesterday that he
was suspending his relationship with Black pending the outcome of his criminal
fraud case. Black was granted a $1 million bond. Prosecutors had argued that
Black was a flight risk, presenting evidence from a federal drug case involving
the agent.

<HEADLINE> Preserving Sounds of Blues Greats  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALINA, Kan. (AP) -- Snow is coating the red-brick church with an
icy blanket, but inside a husky man in a black fedora is sizzling
as he leans in to the microphone:
</P>
<P>
   ''Ho-o-old on baby,'' he wails, ''don't mess around.''
</P>
<P>
   His harmonica whimpers. His voice softens.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get too hot,'' he purrs, ''I'm going to cool you down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Wild Child'' Butler is singing the blues again, the same music
that has nourished his soul since he was a dirt-poor dreamer in the
fields of Alabama 50 years ago. This night, he's in church.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't a church anymore. It's a recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   And with apologies to Oz, this isn't Kansas anymore. This still
is the land of wheat and cattle, but this little town on the
prairie also is becoming a haven for gray-haired musicians who come
here to play the blues -- and save the blues.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the idea of Chad Kassem, a 37-year-old transplanted
Cajun who arrived at a halfway house in town 16 years ago to kick
drugs and booze. He did. Then he switched addictions: He built a
music empire that includes Blue Heaven Studios, a renovated church
where he preserves the sounds -- and stories -- of a rapidly aging
generation of bluesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the most authentic, real blues guys,'' the
boyish-looking Kassem says in a Louisiana drawl that is perpetually
notched up a few decibels. ''We're really trying to concentrate on
those older ones who might not be around much longer. We like to
record people who are underappreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   So the old-timers travel by bus, by car, by plane to a town some
have never heard of, to fill the 73-year-old Gothic church with the
mournful whine and liquid twang that many brought from the
Mississippi Delta long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their faces are creased like worn leather satchels. Their
fingers are calloused from decades of plucking guitar strings.
Their eyes are weary from long years of long nights on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But their voices still burn. The times they sing about are still
hard. The lost dreams are still fresh. The women, of course, are
still fickle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blues is the facts of life about the human condition,'' Butler
says. ''Blues don't have no color. If you don't sing it, you still
have the right to feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one feels it like the folks who lived it.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Jimmy D. Lane, Blue Heaven's music director, comes
in. Kassem hired him because Lane knows the blues scene from the
inside out -- and is trusted by those who are part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Lane moved from the South Side of Chicago, where he grew up
listening to his father, Jimmy Rogers, a guitarist who teamed up
for a time with Muddy Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers died in 1997 but not before he recorded one last time,
with his son. Lane came away from the experience realizing there
was no time to lose if other bluesmen were to be captured on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the last of these guys passes away, this is the only way
we're going to have to hear the music played the way it should
be,'' the 37-year-old Lane says. ''My generation isn't going to be
able to re-create the same sound. You can play letter-perfect notes
but you don't have the same feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have the same type of life that they had,'' adds
Lane, who travels the world with his own blues band. ''I have never
picked cotton a day in my life. I never had anybody standing over
me with a whip and gun.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''Wild Child'' does remember that life.
</P>
<P>
   Born George Butler outside Montgomery, Ala., he already was
singing the blues by age 5. He learned to play the harmonica upside
down -- something he still does today.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname came from friends of his 13-year-old mother who
would visit when he was a baby, watch him slide across the floor
and grab their legs, refusing to let go. ''This boy's wild!''
they'd shriek.
</P>
<P>
   Like many blues musicians of his day, Butler hopped a train
north to the big city (Chicago, for him), escaping a life of stoop
labor: He picked corn, sunrise to sundown, $1.50 a day, in the
sweltering Alabama heat.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrates how he'd grab two rows at a time, rocking from
side to side, grasping at imaginary stalks with meaty hands,
humming a tune that made his work go faster: ''As soon I get broke
... my baby don't want me no more.''
</P>
<P>
   At 12, Butler was itching to move on. He wrote his first song
about it. Fifty-one years later, he still remembers the words.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm leaving here early in the morning,'' he sings, eyes
closed, sitting in the church basement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peoples, I'm about to go out of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to find me some companion'' -- he pauses a long
moment --
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if she's deaf, dumb, crippled and blind.''
</P>
<P>
   His moon-shaped face beams with a gold-toothed smile.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, Butler, who took a long bus ride here from his home in
Windsor, Ontario, is among the younger Blue Heaven recording
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Townsend, age 90, recorded here in 1999, leaning on his
cane to navigate the church stairs when he arrived from St. Louis.
But his voice still had the gritty magic it did when he first
recorded -- in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   David ''Honeyboy'' Edwards is 84. At Salina, he marked one more
milestone in his career. The Chicago bluesman, who has recorded on
78s, 45s, 33s and CDs, made his first DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Weepin' Willie Robinson, who is 73, first stepped before the
microphone in the late 1950s, but had never recorded on his own
until he came to Blue Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see all these people singing and they're leaving something
behind,'' Robinson says. ''I just wanted to look back and have
somebody remember my name 50 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   When his CD, ''At Last, On Time,'' arrived at his Boston home,
he was speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like a kid who ain't ever had a piece of candy in
his life and he finally got one,'' he says with a husky laugh.
''It's the greatest feeling ever -- you can't describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Blue Heaven's artists are acquaintances of Lane, who was
raised in a home where Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and other legends
were regular visitors. Over the years, Lane also has worked with
rock greats inspired by the blues -- Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger,
Keith Richards.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Rolling Stones -- who took their name from a Muddy
Waters song -- the old-timers who played in juke joints, smoky clubs
and roadhouses never made millions. Many worked as cabdrivers,
security guards or factory workers to put food on the table. Often,
they were shortchanged and, in some cases, cheated outright by
promoters or record companies.
</P>
<P>
   So it's natural some hesitate when they're asked to record
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, they're going to have reservations, they'd be fools
not to,'' Lane says. ''Hey, I was living with a man who was ripped
off as well.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's financial troubles still are fresh in his mind. ''I
remember a time,'' he says, ''when we used to go to bed hungry,
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassem works out financial arrangements before the musicians
arrive. Once they do, he caters to their every whim: Family-style
gumbo and crawfish etouffe dinners. Pingpong and pool tables.
Lounges for napping.
</P>
<P>
   Kassem's philosophy is simple: Make them happy, they'll sound
good.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been a music fan, back to his Louisiana childhood
when he started getting high at age 10. After drying out in Kansas,
he worked as a cook and turned his record-collecting hobby into a
business, buying, selling and trading hard-to-find albums.
</P>
<P>
   Acoustic Sounds is a now growing mail-order business -- with
32,000 customers worldwide -- that sells CDs and albums.
</P>
<P>
   Kassem also has his own label, Analogue Production Originals,
and has released 10 CDs on it. He has 10 more in the can. And Blue
Heaven is producing DVDs that feature recording sessions and
musicians telling their life stories.
</P>
<P>
   Every CD also is released as an LP; Kassem believes vinyl has a
more natural sound.
</P>
<P>
   Kassem's biggest obstacle is he does not have a distributor so
all recordings are released on his label, which limits his market
to mail-order and his Web site (www.acousticsounds.com). He hopes
to change that.
</P>
<P>
   But his focus remains the same: artists who travel the byways of
music where the major labels rarely go. ''A lot of the people
recording blues are doing it strictly on what they think they can
sell,'' he says. ''They're forgetting about the guys who created
this music.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassem is convinced there's an audience for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This music is classic,'' he says. ''It's just like Beethoven.
It ain't going to change. It's going to be here 50 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's determined they be recorded with the best possible
sound.
</P>
<P>
   He has poured more than $600,000 into the studio, hiring
topnotch engineers, installing vintage (1940s) microphones and
recording in analogue sound, which he prefers to the digital
format. He also added one distinctive touch -- the stained glass
window above the altar features three jamming blues musicians.
</P>
<P>
   But Kassem's biggest asset may be the building itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he called me and asked me to come out and look at this
church, I thought it was going to be a little church in the
prairie,'' says Dave Baker, a New York sound engineer who has
worked at Blue Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found 45-foot ceilings braced by walnut beams, and
rows of oak pews that seat 400 for concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology alone isn't going to do much for you,'' Baker says.
''You need space.''
</P>
<P>
   Space was the reason Kassem bought the former First Christian
Church in 1996 for $45,000. He needed storage room for his
mail-order business. But soon he realized the building had terrific
acoustics. The studio followed, though it has yet to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But if it takes a while to break even on his recordings of
senior bluesmen, that's OK with Kassem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing something for them,'' he says, ''something for
music -- and something for history.''
</P>
<P>
   The night after Butler recorded, another musician sat down in
front of the church altar.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie Lee Robinson was making his third recording for Kassem.
</P>
<P>
   The tall, pencil-thin Robinson looked more bluegrass than blues,
decked out in denim, black cowboy hat, bolo tie, turquoise and
silver-trimmed boots, spurs and a gleaming Western belt buckle the
size of a ham sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no disguising the distinctive growl of the
69-year-old singer who helped give Chicago its reputation as the
birthplace of the urban blues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lo-o-ove that woman better than I do, do, do myself,'' he
howled, his spurs ca-chinging as he tapped his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''You got something momma, make a preacher boy lay his Bi-bi-ble
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassem watched from the control room at the back of the church.
His head bounced to the beat; his legs, in sweatpants, jittered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jimmie Lee's a tough customer,'' Kassem said during one of the
many breaks in the session. ''But when he comes up, it's in the
groove.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise, and Jimmie Lee Robinson returned it when he was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to take the blues out of the grave ... to bring it
to the world and give it its true value,'' he said. ''I was born to
be in this place.''

</P>
<P>
   ''I was working in the fields, chopping and picking cotton. ...
I got me a harmonica when I was a little fella. ... It didn't cost
me but a quarter. .... I couldn't put the thing down. I would just
get in bed at night, crawl down under the blankets and couldn't
nobody hear me. I would play light and soft. ... I worked myself
right on up to the best harmonica player. They know me all over the

   ''I wanted to be a singer because they seemed to be the ones
getting all the girls. ... I talked to B.B. King and he said, ...
'Go up on the bandstand and sing.' ... I sang, 'Woke Up This
Morning.' I was lousy, to tell you the truth. I was lost. I knew
the song, but I forgot it by the time I got with up the band. ...
He had a 21-piece band. It scared me to death. ... I finally got
myself together enough to finish. ... (Afterward) He said, 'Now
see, you tried. Keep on going.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ''I started picking potatoes and tomatoes, helping my father
out. We picked all the way to a place called Cheapside, Va. My
father sent me to New Jersey. He told me he would join me in about
two weeks. That was in 1939. I haven't seen him since. I had to
grow up with the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Singing the blues is, how can I put it? It's like medicine.
There's nothing that gets you higher than the reaction of a crowd
applauding for you when you're doing something. ... As long as you
can think and talk, you can sing the blues.''

</P>
<P>
   ''I was playing on the weekends, making whiskey, having fun with
the girls ... and this man came in and said, 'My name is Alan
Lomax. I want you to do some recordings for me.' I told him where I
lived. Monday morning, he drove up in the yard. He was driving a
'42 Hudson, six-cylinder. It was the most beautiful thing I ever
saw. ... We went 14-15 miles. He drove me to Clarksdale. ... We
went to a big school out there that the government had put up. ...
He started recording me about 12:30. A big storm cut him off in the
middle of the session. ... That was 1942. He gave me $20. That was
a lot of money then.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a lot of money, I throwed away a lot of money. ... Big
cars and women ... You got to live, you know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can play country blues. I can play rock 'n' roll blues. You
got to keep up with what's going on. It's easy when you know how to
do it.''

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Stores Ending Meat Cutting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest
retailer, is closing meat-cutting operations at 180 stores in six
states, though a spokeswoman denied the move was related to a
successful union vote at a store here.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, meat workers at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in
Jacksonville voted 7-3 to join the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union. This would be the first union in Wal-Mart
operations.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, Wal-Mart told employees in Jacksonville and
its other 700-plus supercenters that the giant retailer will switch
a number of the stores to prepackaged meat.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jessica Moser said the switch to
prepackaged beef, which will eliminate the need for meat cutters,
had been planned for months and had ''absolutely nothing'' to do
with the union vote in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Meat-cutting operations will cease in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri,
Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana, Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart will continue to appeal the union vote with the
National Labor Relations Board. she added.
</P>
<P>
   Moser said Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., would find
other jobs in its stores for meat cutters once the switch to
prepackaged meat is made in June.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Dority, president of the food and commercial workers,
had called the vote in Jacksonville ''the vote heard around the
world.'' Union officials said the Feb. 15 vote followed worker
frustration from abusive treatment, low pay and lousy benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Meat cutter Maurice Miller, who challenged Wal-Mart after the
unfulfilled promise of a $2 raise, said earlier the company had
lied to him and not boosted his pay. Miller has an unlisted
telephone number and he could not be reached today by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.4 million-strong union had seen the East Texas chapter as
a crucial foothold. It believes that unionization will quickly
spread, noting moves toward a union vote in nearby Palestine and
Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart says it has an ''open door'' approach to labor
relations and that profit sharing that eliminates the need for
unions.
</P>
<P>
   As of Jan. 31, Wal-Mart operated 1,801 Wal-Mart stores, 721
Supercenters, and 463 Sam's Clubs in the United States.
Internationally, the company operated 13 units in Argentina, 14 in
Brazil, 166 in Canada, six in China, 95 in Germany, five in Korea,
462 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto Rico and 232 in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart employs more than 885,000 people in the United States
and 255,000 internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Wal-Mart were trading up $2 to $52.56\ in midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pitches Himself on TV  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- With Vice President Al Gore confidently
looking ahead to the general election, Democratic challenger Bill
Bradley today urged his supporters to vote their convictions and
described the race as a choice between ''unfulfilled promises'' and
''straight talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley generally echoed the less combative tone of the
pre-primary appeal he made to voters Thursday night in an unusual,
five-minute commercial on network television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the people of Maine aren't going to listen to the
pollsters and the pundits. They're going to vote their hearts,
their convictions,'' Bradley about 800 students and supporters in
Portland High School gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley said the race was ''a choice between the
politics of division, of exaggerated and unfulfilled promises, and
a politics based upon belief, conviction and straight talk,'' he
never mentioned Gore by name.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the softer tone recently, spokesman Eric Hauser said
Bradley was still trying to aggressively describe to voters ''how
important it is to shake these cobwebs'' of the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also planned a speech later today about America's role
in the world and the impact of technology and globalization on
foreign. Hauser said the former senator would focus on policies
toward Europe, Russia, Japan and China in the speech at Brown
University in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is one of many states holding primaries Tuesday, and
Hauser said the campaign expects to do well in local organizing
caucuses being held Sunday that show the candidates' strength
before the Maine vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew when I got into this race that it wouldn't be easy,''
Bradley said in the five-minute ad, which aired on CBS nationwide.
''Anything worth fighting for in life rarely is. But my convictions
of where we are as a country and where we can go are so deep that I
made the decision to take on the establishment and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign, with its ''think big'' approach to issues
like child poverty and universal health care, desperately needs
some breakthrough victories in the flurry of primaries being held
Tuesday in states including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already begun looking past Bradley, railing instead
against Republicans John McCain and George W. Bush. He was
traveling to Florida today to add Sen. Bob Graham to his lopsided
pile of Democratic Party endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   A small but exuberant crowd greeted Bradley Thursday night with
chants of ''No more Gore!'' at the North End Boys and Girls Club in
Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley did not mention the vice president, opting instead
to harken to his days in professional basketball on the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say, 'Well, Bradley's behind now in some places.' I say
you're never behind,'' Bradley said. ''This is like the fourth
quarter. We haven't even put on the full court press yet. It starts
today!''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign did not reveal the cost of buying five
minutes at the tail end of network prime time. Bradley addressed
the camera directly, urging political reform and a renewed
commitment by the Democratic party ''to give voice to the
voiceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has lost every nominating contest yet to Gore, is
banking on a resurgence in the Northeast, where the former New
Jersey senator and New York basketball star is better known than
anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are states I can win'' he said of New York and New
England.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule for Saturday calls for Bradley to campaign first in
New York, then in his native state, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Friday in Jacksonville, Fla., Gore planned to push his education
agenda -- universal access to preschool, teacher hiring bonuses and
merit pay raises and teaching standards -- in a forum at Raines High
School.
</P>
<P>
   He was also doing his part for the Georgia state party by
headlining a Democratic dinner in Atlanta before heading back north
for a weekend of campaigning in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New
York.

<HEADLINE> Principal Group May Sell Stock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Principal Financial Group will
consider converting to a publicly traded company from its present
form of ownership as a mutual holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Principal was reorganized in 1998 as a mutual holding company
under which its policyholders own most of the company but it can
also issue stock to outsiders. The change was designed to increase
flexibility and improve access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that plan, the company indicated it would eventually
sell stock to the public but it would keep voting control of
Principal with policyholders, even if a majority financial stake
was sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   If the company now decides to do a complete demutualization and
sell shares to the public, voting control of the company will rest
with the shareholders, not policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Chairman David Drury said Thursday the company is
studying the issue to determine the best approach for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Drury will head the study and expects it will be completed by
the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Va. Court To Rehear Nationwide Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Virginia Supreme Court on Friday agreed
to reconsider its decision to throw out a $100 million judgment
against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. in a racial discrimination
lawsuit filed by a fair-housing organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, the court ruled 4-3 that Housing Opportunities Made
Equal could not bring its lawsuit because it was not injured by
Nationwide's alleged discrimination against minorities in issuing
homeowners insurance.
</P>
<P>
   HOME petitioned for a rehearing, which the court granted in a
one-sentence order. The court did not give a reason for its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found in 1998 that Nationwide denied homeowners coverage
to black applicants while approving insurance for whites under
similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   HOME claimed during the trial that the company's marketing
efforts were targeted to ZIP codes in predominantly white areas
while black neighborhoods were excluded -- a practice known as
''redlining.''
</P>
<P>
   The fair housing group had 15 pairs of people -- one black and
one white in each case -- pose as homeowners seeking insurance from
Nationwide. In seven of the 15 cases, HOME said, the whites were
quoted a premium and the blacks were not.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rally; Dow Up 246.02  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied today as the government's
employment report showed some easing of the tight labor market. The
news calmed investors' fears that the Federal Reserve will push
interest rates sharply higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 246.02 at 10,410.94, adding to the 302-point gain
already tallied this week by the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   With today's gains, the Dow is up more than 5 percent this week.
It is the first time since mid-August that the Dow has risen five
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 24.11 at 1,405.87, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 122.93 at 4,877.44.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shot higher from the start today after the Labor
Department reported that 43,000 new jobs were created in February,
well below analysts' expectations and the weakest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment ticked up to 4.1 percent in February
from 4 percent in January, but it still remained at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing labor market has spooked Wall Street for
months, with many investors worrying about how continued growth
will affect businesses. Companies must offer competitive wages and
incentives to keep employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at
such low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big concern is that the economy was going to overheat and
employment was going to be one of the biggest problems,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''But we did not create nearly the number
of jobs that were expected and the unemployment rate went up.
That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rate four times since June in an
effort to slow the economy and control inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that the Fed would take a more aggressive stance in
boosting rates has caused great volatility in the stock market in
recent weeks. Blue-chip stocks have been under the greatest
pressure, with the Dow falling below 10,000 for the first time
since last April before recovering this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the jobs report today and data released Thursday showing
new-home sales plunged by 4.2 percent in January may be signaling
that the Fed's actions are having some effect.
</P>
<P>
   While most investors still believe that the Fed will likely
boost rates again soon -- maybe even at their meeting later this
month -- many now think that the hike won't be as sharp as
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The softer the economic numbers we see, the more lenient the
Fed will be,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Right now bad news is good news for this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Among industrial stocks in the Dow, DuPont rose 5 to 51~ and 3M
rose 7 1/16 to 93[.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares also gained. Microsoft gained 5 to 98] and
Cisco Systems rose 2 15/16 at 135 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 553.91 million
shares, up from 569.20 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 12.03 at 596.07.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Is Victim of Border Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By FREDDY CUEVAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- In a region where the term ''soccer
war'' evokes images of gunfire rather than goals, there's unusual
tension ahead of Saturday's World Cup qualifier between Honduras
and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The start of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup comes just as the
two nations are exchanging insults -- and allegedly a few bullets --
in a dispute over where to draw their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua President Arnoldo Aleman this week called the game
''dangerous'' and expressed hope that it would not lead to a repeat
of the so-called ''soccer war'' of 1969 between El Salvador and
Honduras, which followed a World Cup qualifier between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Most historians say the soccer game had nothing to do with that
border conflict, in which some 6,000 people died. But the image
took root in the public imagination, and Honduran officials say
they have increased security to prevent any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have played in Honduras on other occasions and nothing has
ever happened,'' said Julio Rocha, head of Nicaragua's soccer
federation. ''But in the current circumstances, anything could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the countries entered a crisis in November
when Honduras approved a treaty with Colombia that conflicted with
Nicaraguan claims to a large swath of the Caribbean. The two
countries have submitted their dispute to the World Court.
</P>
<P>
   But troop maneuvers -- and rumors of maneuvers -- near the borders
have kept tensions high.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nicaragua claimed that Honduran speedboats fired on
Nicaraguan naval boats in another disputed region, in the Pacific
Gulf of Fonseca.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political conflict, Honduran officials say there's
little chance the game, in the northern city of San Pedro Sula,
will get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be the most protected soccer game in the world,''
Honduran Defense Minister Edgardo Dumas said, adding that troops
will be on hand to back up more than 300 police at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For many fans, the most disagreeable event may be a ban on
alcohol sales Saturday and Sunday in San Pedro Sula. Police say
they will search spectators for guns and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself has almost been overshadowed by the politics --
and perhaps by Nicaragua's reputation as a baseball power that has
a ho-hum attitude toward soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether we win or lose, on Saturday we will embrace our
Honduran brothers,'' said Nicaragua's ambassador to Honduras, Jose
Rene Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras is favored to advance over Nicaragua and Panama in
Group A of the first round of qualifying in the North and Central
American and Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup qualifying starts earlier Saturday when the
Netherlands Antilles is at Trinidad at Tobago.

<HEADLINE> Louisville Mayor Fires Police Chief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Mayor Dave Armstrong fired the city's
police chief over an awards ceremony that included honors to two
officers for their actions the night they shot a black teen-ager to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong announced his decision Thursday night after meeting
with Chief Gene Sherrard for 2{ hours. He said Sherrard violated
his trust by approving the awards a month ago but waiting until
this week to tell the mayor about them.
</P>
<P>
   A police chief should be ''forthright when it comes to
information that it is essential to my leading this city,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers Chris Horn and Paul Kinkade, who are white, shot
18-year-old Desmond Rudolph on May 13 as he was attempting to flee
in a stolen vehicle that had become stuck in an alley. Rudolph died
four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired 22 rounds into the vehicle, saying they feared
Rudolph was going to run them down. The shooting sparked outrage in
the black community.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers were among several officers given the
Exceptional Valor Award at a ceremony Wednesday. Kim Kraeszig, a
police spokeswoman, said the two were honored not for shooting
Rudolph but for surviving a situation where there was imminent
danger.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor called the decision to honor them ''premature and
insensitive, and I cannot condone this action.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury cleared the officers of criminal wrongdoing, but a
follow-up investigation by Public Safety Director Col. Ronald A.
Ricucci outlined numerous errors by Horn, Kinkade and others.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the two officers failed to secure the
stolen vehicle before knocking on the door where Rudolph was
staying. Officers also failed to cover the back entrance, where he
made his escape that led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The firing Thursday touched off a whirlwind of anger among
police officers. They converged en masse at police headquarters to
rally around their departing chief.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Rick McCubbin, president of the Louisville Fraternal
Order of Police, said Sherrard has earned the respect and
admiration of the rank and file, and officers didn't understand
what he had done wrong.

<HEADLINE> Gore replenishes funds for fall as Bradley pitches himself on TV  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- With Vice President Al Gore confidently
road-testing a general election fight with Republicans, Democratic
challenger Bill Bradley today urged his supporters to ignore the
pollsters and vote their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called the race ''a choice between the politics of
division, of exaggerated and unfulfilled promises, and a politics
based upon belief, conviction and straight talk,'' but never
mentioned Gore by name.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he generally echoed the less combative tone of the
pre-primary appeal he made to voters Thursday night in an unusual,
five-minute commercial on network television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the people of Maine aren't going to listen to the
pollsters and the pundits. They're going to vote their hearts,
their convictions,'' Bradley told about 800 students and supporters
in the Portland High School gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley no longer seen as a serious threat, Gore campaign
manager Donna Brazile told reporters today that it is now
mathematically possible for Gore to collect the 2,169 delegates
necessary for the nomination by March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already begun looking past Bradley, railing instead
against Republicans John McCain and George W. Bush. In Florida
today, Gore added Sen. Bob Graham to his lopsided pile of
Democratic Party endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   At Raines High School in Jacksonville, Gore ripped Bush for a
gun-safety comment during Thursday night's GOP debate -- ''I have no
problems with trigger locks being sold.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Is that what passes for courage on the Republican side of this
contest?'' asked Gore, who, like Bradley, wants to make
child-safety locks mandatory on all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore offered a belated rebuttal to Bush for deriding the
vice president's school-modernization proposals as ''bricks and
mortar.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Since he doesn't have any plan to help build new schools, his
plan is smoke and mirrors,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his softer tone recently, spokesman Eric Hauser said
Bradley was still trying to aggressively describe to voters ''how
important it is to shake these cobwebs'' of the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also planned a speech later today about America's role
in the world and the impact of technology and globalization on
foreign. Hauser said the former senator would focus on policies
toward Europe, Russia, Japan and China in the speech at Brown
University in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is one of many states holding primaries Tuesday, and
Hauser said the campaign expects to do well in local organizing
caucuses being held Sunday that show the candidates' strength
before the Maine vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew when I got into this race that it wouldn't be easy,''
Bradley said in his five-minute ad, which aired on CBS nationwide.
''Anything worth fighting for in life rarely is. But my convictions
of where we are as a country and where we can go are so deep that I
made the decision to take on the establishment and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign, with its ''think big'' approach to issues
like child poverty and universal health care, desperately needs
some breakthrough victories in the flurry of primaries being held
Tuesday in states including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already begun looking past Bradley, railing instead
against Republicans John McCain and George W. Bush. He was
traveling to Florida today to add Sen. Bob Graham to his lopsided
pile of Democratic Party endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   A small but exuberant crowd greeted Bradley Thursday night with
chants of ''No more Gore!'' at the North End Boys and Girls Club in
Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley did not mention the vice president, opting instead
to harken to his days in professional basketball on the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say, 'Well, Bradley's behind now in some places.' I say
you're never behind,'' Bradley said. ''This is like the fourth
quarter. We haven't even put on the full court press yet. It starts
today!''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign did not reveal the cost of buying five
minutes at the tail end of network prime time. Bradley addressed
the camera directly, urging political reform and a renewed
commitment by the Democratic party ''to give voice to the
voiceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has lost every nominating contest yet to Gore, is
banking on a resurgence in the Northeast, where the former New
Jersey senator and New York basketball star is better known than
anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are states I can win'' he said of New York and New
England.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule for Saturday calls for Bradley to campaign first in
New York, then in his native state, Missouri.

<HEADLINE> McCain says group's ads try to 'hijack' race  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain said today that TV ads from a
mysterious group questioning his commitment to clean air show
what's wrong with the campaign finance system. ''Somebody's putting
in $2 million to try to hijack the campaign here in New York,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized as misleading rival George W. Bush's ads that
suggest McCain opposes federal funding for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   As both candidates honed in on the key state, an aide said
McCain's campaign was targeting Catholic Republicans in New York
with telephone messages touting his economic proposals, in lieu of
controversial calls elsewhere linking Bush to anti-Catholic
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush headed today to a breast cancer research center in New York
to emphasize his criticism of McCain for listing some breast cancer
projects as pork-barrel spending. His ads in New York feature a
breast cancer survivor calling McCain's opposition to research
funding ''shocking'' and saying America deserves ''a candidate with
a record on women's issues we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has repeatedly voted to increase spending on
breast cancer research. Speaking on ''Imus in the Morning,'' the
Arizona senator said he could get his message to voters despite
such ads, but ''If they don't figure it out, we will have run an
honorable campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on NBC's ''Today'' show, McCain suggested the ads aired
by Republicans for Clean Air were tied to Bush. That's
''symptomatic of part of their campaign,'' said McCain, who called
the ads an example of unregulated ''soft money''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what I've been fighting against,'' McCain said. ''You
see, this soft money, nobody knows where it comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans were focusing on New York today, a crucial
state in next week's Super Tuesday round of voting. Political
director John Weaver said McCain was using a phone bank to target
his economic message to Catholics, who make up 46 percent of the
state's registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain flew to New York overnight from St. Louis, where he was
linked by satellite Thursday night into a debate with Bush and Alan
Keyes that featured differences on campaign finances and religion
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   After a night back home in Austin, Texas, Gov. Bush was going to
the breast cancer research center at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain competitive in New York, one of 13 states
holding Super Tuesday contests that could decide the GOP
presidential nomination. California and Ohio also are among the
biggest states, and a candidate winning all three of them likely
could sew up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been on the defensive much of the week after he
criticized evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as ''agents
of intolerance,'' and concedes he needs to refocus his message.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to stay on message and not be distracted by a lot of
the stuff that's going on,'' McCain said on ''Today.'' But he
dismissed a suggestion that his controversial speech in Virginia on
the religious right was a mistake because it hurt his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to do what you think is best for your party,''
McCain said. ''You can't gauge what you do just on your political
ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was spending today in New York, then heading for
Connecticut, with plans to spend the weekend in New England before
returning to California on Sunday. Bush went home to Austin after
last night's debate but was headed for New York today, trying to
overtake McCain's edge in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate framing this crucial campaign sprint, McCain urged
''stop the squabbling'' while Bush complained McCain uses ''the
politics of smearing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended phone calls made on his behalf blasting Bush for
visiting Bob Jones University without quickly denouncing its
anti-Catholic stance, but wanted to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am interested in the issues of the day,'' said McCain.
''Stop the squabbling, we can address the issues.'' Bush was having
none of it, lecturing McCain sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't regret going to many places,'' said Bush. ''What I
regret is the politics of smearing somebody's reputation. Catholics
all across the country are coming to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defends that criticism as factual, but Bush dismissed
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't think those phone calls labeled me an
anti-Catholic bigot, then you weren't paying attention to what your
campaign was putting out,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run an insurgent campaign, but went out of his way to
reassure Republicans of his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican Party is my home,'' said McCain. ''No matter
who our nominee is, I will support that nominee. I am a proud
conservative with a strong conservative record.''

<HEADLINE> Paul Anka Does PBS Special  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If he'd been able to ''squiggle'' just a
little bit better, popular music might never have had a teen idol
known as Paul Anka.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than finding ''Paul Anka: A Body of Work'' at the local
record store today, we might be picking up the newspaper and
reading the byline, ''Paul Anka, Pop Music Critic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a knack for writing and my dad always wanted me to be a
journalist,'' Anka recalls. ''But I got kicked out of shorthand
class. ... No way did I want to do those little squiggles.''
</P>
<P>
   So he turned his attention to music. Imagine if he hadn't:
</P>
<P>
   There would be no Frank Sinatra signature song called ''My
Way.'' Anka wrote it for him. And there would have been no bouncy
introduction for the band to play when Johnny Carson stepped on
stage. Anka wrote the ''Tonight Show'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no last great song from Buddy Holly, the title of
which, ''It Doesn't Matter Any More,'' came to frame his untimely
death in a plane crash shortly after he recorded it.
</P>
<P>
   Put together a soundtrack for the last 40 years and it is hard
to do it without Paul Anka. ''You Are My Destiny,'' ''Lonely Boy,''
''Put Your Head on My Shoulder'' and many more.
</P>
<P>
   Anka sings them all in a show airing on PBS stations beginning
Monday (check local listings), coinciding with Public Television's
latest fund-raising drive.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-moving, hour-plus performance was captured last
November at the Mirage in Las Vegas, a city where Anka has long
been a fixture.
</P>
<P>
   It's titled ''Paul Anka: Night of a Lifetime,'' though it seems
fair to assume the Canadian native has had a few others in his
42-year career. And at age 58, he's looking forward to many more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen a lot of guys in different occupations that I know,
they quit because they've got all the money they figure they need.
And they get old really fast,'' he said by phone during a recent
break between tour dates. ''I could retire but I don't know what
I'd do. I'm a very young guy. I've got a lot of energy and I
wouldn't know how to direct that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Anka goes out on the road as many as 35 weeks a year, playing
Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Australia, Europe, Asia, Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Having scored at least one hit record in every decade since the
1950s, Anka has a broad fan base and is booked solid well into
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, it was harder back then because the conditions were
tougher,'' he says of his early days as a '50s teen idol. He,
Fabian, his best buddy Bobby Darin and others would pile into a bus
and ride for hours from one town to the next to put on package
shows for throngs of screaming kids.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the bus rides were bad. He fell in love with Disney
teen idol Annette Funicello on one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're locked in a bus and you're a teen-ager,'' says Anka,
laughing nervously when the subject comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really hit it off with her and we had a little romance going
there. It got pretty serious and she wanted to get married, and of
course I was too young to entertain anything like that. And Disney
was very nervous, as you can certainly imagine. ... They kept
telling her, 'Annette, don't get married. It's puppy love, it's
puppy love.'''
</P>
<P>
   So he sat down and wrote ''Puppy Love'' for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I speak to her every now and then,'' Anka says, his voice
turning somber as he mentions the multiple sclerosis that keeps her
mostly sidelined these days. ''She's not doing too well, but she's
a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Anka's been married to his wife, Anne, for 36 years and they
have five grown daughters. (It was their births that inspired his
one controversial song, ''Having My Baby,'' which made it to No. 1
in the mid-'70s despite feminist protestations.)
</P>
<P>
   The name Elvis Presley also evokes bittersweet memories for
Anka. The two struck up a friendship when they worked in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really a nice guy. He just didn't want to get old, and
he was afraid that success thing wasn't going to keep happening for
him,'' Anka says. ''I said, 'Elvis, that isn't important. You're
Elvis!'
</P>
<P>
   ''And then I saw him getting progressively worse. And it was not
a good day when he died.''
</P>
<P>
   The days are better now. Much better.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent album, 1998's ''A Body of Work,'' featured duets
with Celine Dion, Patti LaBelle and others. He still writes every
week, and plans another album.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I'm really at a place now where I've never been this
comfortable,'' Anka says. ''I've never had so much fun. It's what
you work for all your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
   '20/20': It was an unfathomable medical mistake that forever
changed the lives of two couples. Two families now wrestle with the
outcome of a laboratory mistake in a fertility clinic that resulted
in the birth of twins -- one black, one white -- to a white mother.
Barbara Walters interviews the white couple, whose decision to
return one of their children to his black genetic parents stirred
ethical controversy and increased tension between the two families.

<HEADLINE> Ted Williams Gives Tips to Dodgers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Ted Williams gave the Los Angeles
Dodgers some hitting tips Friday before their exhibition opener
against the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The 81-year-old Hall of Famer spent more than 30 minutes in the
clubhouse, speaking, answering questions and even giving
demonstrations from his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just an incredible presence to have in the same room,''
said Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green, an All-Star while playing for
the Toronto Blue Jays last season. ''You just sit and listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking to the team, Williams and Green conversed
outside the clubhouse, with Williams asking Green what size bat he
used.
</P>
<P>
   When Green told him 34 inches, 32 ounces, Williams swung the bat
and said, ''It has a feel like Tony Gwynn's bat, only a little more
top-heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   A left-handed hitter like Green and Gwynn, Williams is regarded
by many as the greatest hitter ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, yeah, without question,'' said first baseman Eric Karros,
who said he's been fortunate to have had a couple previous
opportunities to speak with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest hitter that ever lived? Without a doubt,'' said
former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda, now a senior vice president of
the team and a longtime friend of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams spent most of his career with the Red Sox, and hit .406
in 1941 -- the last hitter to top .400 over an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda and Dodgers chairman Bob Daly invited Williams to the
exhibition opener. Williams lives in Hernando, Fla., and was flown
to Dodgertown on Daly's private jet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy's been my idol,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Several players approached Williams to shake hands and pose for
pictures after he spoke for about 20 minutes on hitting and then
answered questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got 100 hitters I like,'' Williams said of the baseball
in 2000. ''I think there's a ton of talent, I've seen more talent
than I've ever seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams advised the players to always look for the fastball,
make the pitcher throw strikes, and to not try to pull the ball.

<HEADLINE> Chilly Reception for Warm Weather  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT IMRIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- A most unwelcome thaw in the nation's
northern snow belt has put the world's largest weenie roast on ice.
Snowmobiles are silent. Ski trails are slush and mud.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties of all the warm weather include North America's
largest cross-county ski race and an ice fishing derby in
International Falls, Minn., dubbed the ''Nation's Icebox'' for its
bitter winters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just depressing,'' complained Toni White as the
thermometer climbed Thursday to 45 degrees in Cable, at the
northern tip of Wisconsin. She had intended to roast hot dogs at
Saturday's fourth annual Winter Weenie Weekend, billed as the
world's largest hot dog roast.
</P>
<P>
   The event was canceled because the venue, usually frozen Lake
Namakagon, was rapidly melting.
</P>
<P>
   The region, normally in a deep freeze during this time of year,
has been downright balmy in recent days. A landscape white with
snow two weeks ago is now barren, brown ground after days of
temperatures in the 40s and 50s. There is concern that alfalfa
crops and spring flowers could bloom early and then die if severe
cold returns.
</P>
<P>
   The thaw extends as far east as Rochester, N.Y. Even after more
than 7{ feet of snow this winter, towering snowbanks that once
seemed tougher than granite have melted away. Farther south,
Madison had its highest February temperature ever recorded this
year -- 64 degrees on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Ed O'Lenic, a meteorologist with the U.S. Weather Service's
Climate Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md., said this winter
has been warmer all over the country and around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did predict a warm winter this year but what we have seen
far exceeded anybody's expectations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the average of the high and low temperatures in
Green Bay for December through February is normally around 17
degrees. This winter, the average was 4 degrees warmer.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation in North America is simple: Cold air from the
north has not dipped into the United States with its normal
frequency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There also are La Nina conditions, a phenomenon that has to do
with cooler than normal temperatures in the eastern and central
Pacific Ocean, which affects the jet stream, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has got everybody's attention, believe me,'' O'Lenic said.
''We are trying to sort out what the physical cause for this is. We
don't know yet. You certainly can't blame all of this on global
warming.''
</P>
<P>
   The warmth has certainly brought change to those used to winter.
</P>
<P>
   International Falls canceled this weekend's Rainy Lake
Sportfishing Club's ice fishing derby because ice on the lake was
unsafe. Michigan City, Ind., could lose up to $250,000 in rental
fees because some access ramps to Lake Michigan are unusable: The
shoreline has receded because of the unusually warm, dry winter.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, ''we haven't seen a snowmobile since (Feb. 21).
Only on trailers,'' said Lauri Taylor, who works at Gordy's Place
in Fife Lake, which serves up to 1,000 snowmobilers on a good
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cable typically has 2 feet of snow on the ground this time of
year, but there was almost none Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another sad winter for us,'' said Marcia Magee,
administrative assistant for the Cable Area Chamber of Commerce.
''I have had mountain bikers call and say I want to come up and
ride already. It is just strange.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Namakagon, 10 miles east of Cable and the site of the
canceled weenie roast, Lakewoods Resort manager Barbara Popelka
said so much ice has melted that the shoreline is water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are thinking golf now,'' she said, laughing.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Closes Hutu Camps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Under pressure from international
donors and aid groups, Burundian authorities have begun dismantling
six of the nearly 60 camps holding hundreds of thousands of Hutu
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 people were to return to their homes Friday from
two camps at Gatumba and Muberure, 10 miles northwest of the
capital of Bujumbura, where they had spent five months.
</P>
<P>
   The Central African nation's Tutsi-dominated army is battling
Hutu rebels, and Burundi's government maintains it put the people
in the camps for their own protection. Critics say the move was to
allow the military a free hand in pursuing Hutu rebels and to
deprive them of support from Hutu civilians in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 350,000 people have been herded into 60 camps since
September, when the rebels stepped up attacks around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups and donors have demanded that the
government close squalid camps as it entered a new round of
negotiations aimed at ending the seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200,000 people -- most of them Hutu civilians, but some
Tutsis as well -- have been killed since 1993, when Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected
president, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   The military governor of Bujumbura Rural province last week
announced the closing of 11 camps.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, more than 2,000 people from the camp at Kinonko,
25 miles south of Bujumbura, were sent home, and on Thursday the
camp at Matara with more than 5,000 people closed. Others are to
follow starting this week.
</P>
<P>
   The government has yet to agree to a cease-fire with Hutu rebel
groups that failed last week to attend peace talks in Arusha,
Tanzania, mediated by former South African President Nelson
Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Gay Marriage Ban Splits Community  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It's not uncommon for religious leaders to
take part in initiative campaigns, weighing in on social issues
such as immigration, affirmative action and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But a proposal on next Tuesday's ballot in California that would
essentially ban gay marriages has galvanized churches on both sides
of the issue, with leaders using Scripture, sermons and campaign
contributions in an attempt to influence the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Churches are also wrestling with the issue internally, with
pastors in several denominations performing same-sex weddings in
the face of disciplinary charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're early on in a struggle about the value of a homosexual
person,'' said Bishop William Swing, the leader of the Episcopal
Church in the San Francisco Bay area who opposes Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   California recognizes only marriages between a man and a woman,
but validates unions legally performed in other states. Proposition
22 would bar the state from recognizing same-sex marriages if they
are legalized in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont lawmakers are considering a bill that would grant
certain rights to gay couples, but no state has legalized
homosexual marriage. After Hawaii's Supreme Court raised the
possibility of same-sex unions in 1993, Congress and 30 states
passed pre-emptive laws similar to Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure apparently has the support of voters, who
favored it by 13 percentage points in the latest Field Poll. The
margin of error was 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the campaign in support of Proposition 22 has
raised $8 million alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church, with 8 million California members, is
the largest single donor to the Yes-on-22 campaign, giving at least
$350,000. The Mormon Church's 740,000 California members have also
been big donors, as well as the campaign's major source of
volunteers. Southern Baptists and conservative evangelical
denominations also are involved.
</P>
<P>
   The No-on-22 campaign -- which leaders say has raised about $5.5
million -- has support from major Protestant branches such as the
United Methodist, Episcopal and Presbyterian churches, liberal
denominations such as the Quakers and Unitarians, and the
gay-oriented Metropolitan Community Church.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate is the definition of marriage, and
whether religious or secular definitions should prevail. The Bible
cannot resolve the dispute, because few churches agree on the
relevant passages.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, for example, relies on Jesus' statement
about a man and his wife becoming one flesh, never to be separated,
said David Pollard, spokesman for the California Council of
Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Some evangelical denominations rely on the Old Testament story
of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, a tale that liberal
clergy say is a condemnation of arrogance, not homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive liberal denominations also cite biblical language
that says everyone is created in God's image, as well as the
command to love one's neighbor, said Rabbi Denise Eger of Kol Ami,
a temple in the reform branch of Judaism in West Hollywood, where
same-sex weddings are performed.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right provides the proposition's strongest
support, according to polls. Several hundred California pastors
from conservative denominations met in Sacramento last month at a
conference sponsored by Focus on the Family, a Colorado
Springs-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Focus founder James Dobson, who calls homosexuality a sin and
says homosexuals can be cured, has devoted two radio programs --
which reach 5 million listeners -- to Proposition 22 and mailed
brochures to 240,000 followers in California, spokesman Tom Minnery
said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-22 campaign also has formidable religious allies. But
they were slow to organize, waiting until leaders decided to
counter the impression that churches uniformly favored the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Other handicaps for opponents include a complex message -- that
gays' right to marry, though rejected by most churches, should be
preserved in secular society -- and an individualistic tradition
that impedes political organization.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-22 churches have held teach-ins, issued ''statements of
conscience'' and held a statewide ''Solidarity Sabbath.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In some respects I'm envious of what the Mormon Church is able
to do,'' said Scott Anderson, executive director of the California
Council of Churches, which represents so-called mainline Protestant
denominations. ''I may disagree with them on theological grounds
but I wish I could raise money like that.''

<HEADLINE> Warhol Soup Can at National Gallery  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Andy Warhol painted dozens of Campbell's soup
cans, but the one included in a National Gallery of Art show that
opens Sunday may be unique: A can opener sticks boldly out the top.
</P>
<P>
   It belongs to the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Barney Ebsworth. He
is a retired St. Louis businessman, who for the past 30 years has
collected American art from the early 20th century to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Weiss, the gallery's curator of modern and contemporary
art, sees the can opener as important.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the point of that is that Warhol sometimes was able to
bring a certain kind of emotional impact to these images that seem
otherwise completely neutral and deadpan and blank,'' Weiss said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got this kind of happy consumer image, but the can opener
opening it makes it feel like it's being invaded or violated in a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Warhol's soup cans are actual size: one series of 32,
Weiss said, illustrates each of the Campbell varieties -- but Warhol
had no commercial connection with Campbell's. The 32 paintings are
designed to be mounted one after another on one wall.
</P>
<P>
   Big ones like the six-foot tall painting in the Ebsworth
collection are rare. Weiss said he knows of just four or five of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ebsworth is giving the gallery two of the more than 70 works
being shown. He's keeping the Warhol, which has been exhibited in
Britain, France, Italy, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts are Charles Scheeler's ''Classic Landscape,'' a view
of the Ford Motor Co.'s River Rouge plant near Detroit, an
up-to-the-minute industrial site when it was painted in 1927. The
other is ''Moon'' by Arthur Dove, typical of his work derived from
nature. Dove was a pioneer of abstract paintings, producing them
before many European artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ebsworth's collection harks back to 1913, the landmark year when
a show at New York's Lexington Avenue Armory gave the American art
world its first big taste of work by Pablo Picasso and other
artists working in France. Except for Briton David Hockney, the
current show is devoted entirely to Americans, some heavily
influenced by Paris, others determinedly independent.
</P>
<P>
   There's Edward Hopper's ''Chop Suey,'' two flappers from the
1920s at a table in a Chinese restaurant; major work by Georgia
O'Keeffe, marking her shift from the Atlantic Coast to the colors
and forms of New Mexico; and one by Jackson Pollock, the man some
called ''Jack the Dripper'' because of his special technique.
Pollack has said the most important paintings of the last 100 years
had been done in France, and there couldn't be such a thing as
isolated American painting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest paintings in the show is William Glackens'
''Cafe Lafayette,'' which looks much like the work of Pierre
Renoir. One of the most recent is by Hockney, who has lived in the
United States for decades and is closely identified with southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Twentieth Century American Art - The Ebsworth Collection''
will be at the National Gallery through June 11. Admission is free.
It will be on view at the Seattle Art Museum, Aug. 10 through Nov.
12.

<HEADLINE> Britain Tackles Forced Marriages  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The British government created a new unit Friday
to tackle the problem of forced marriages after receiving
increasing pleas by women wed without their consent, mostly from
Britain's South Asian community.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Office minister Baroness Scotland said the unit will
work with local community and religious leaders as well as foreign
governments to stem the practice of nonconsensual marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forcing children into marriage is wrong,'' she said at a
family conference in Leeds. ''It is not a legitimate cultural
tradition, nothing to do with love, and nothing to do with
religious practice ... There is not a major religion in the world
that preaches it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Office officials said the vast majority of cases involve
young women from Britain's Sikh, Hindu and Muslim communities duped
into marriages with men from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
   Often times, the women are only told that they are traveling to
their parent's home country and are unaware that upon arriving,
they will be forced to marry a stranger, the Foreign Office said.
Many are then made to sponsor their spouse's entry into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland cited the example of a young newlywed trapped abroad
who appealed to a British Embassy to ''help me to get out of this
country.'' Scotland did not provide details, but said the woman was
helped to escape. ''She was one of the fortunate minority,''
Scotland said.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland said the Foreign Office deals with around two people
forced into marriage every week, and estimated the number is in the
hundreds annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't tell you that forced marriages aren't a problem,''
said Syed Ali of London's Islamic Information Center, who welcomed
the new unit. ''But girls today are very sensible and much more
aware. It remains more of a problem with the uneducated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali cautioned that the new Foreign Office unit must be careful
to distinguish between forced marriages and arranged marriages,
which are common in many cultures and occur with the consent of all
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland said making that distinction would be one of the key
challenges of the new group.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are huge gray areas between forced marriages, which are
wrong, and arranged marriages,'' she said. ''We are not against
arranged marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Martin Baines, the community and race relations
officer for the Bradford Police Department, said his department
deals with about 200 forced marriages annually in his northern
city, with a large Asian population and a 60,000-strong Muslim
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can be a touchy issue,'' Baines said. ''But if we didn't at
least attempt to address it, the problem would be a lot worse for a
lot of people.''

<HEADLINE> Coceres Leads in Dubai Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Jose Coceres of Argentina
overcame 30 mph winds to shoot a 3-under-par 69 Friday for a
four-shot lead after two rounds of the Dubai Desert Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Coceres, who broke the course record with a 64 on Thursday, was
at 11-under 133 halfway through the tournament. Only three players
in the 141-man field broke 70.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the swing I have I hit the ball very low normally, so
that helps a lot in the wind,'' Coceres said. ''I concentrated well
shot by shot. I played a perfect round yesterday, but today I
played OK when I needed to and holed a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Westwood, who shared the lead with Coceres after the first
round, struggled to a 75 and dropped six shots off the pace. His
round included two double bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood called the conditions ''as close as it can to being
unplayable.''
</P>
<P>
   England's Jamie Spence shot a 67 to move into second place. Greg
Owen (70), Thomas Bjorn (71), Paul Affleck (71) and Jose Rivero
(72) were at 138.
</P>
<P>
   British Open champion Paul Lawrie and Colin Montgomerie managed
75s. Darren Clarke, who won last week's Match Play Championship,
shot a 70. Clarke and Lawrie were at 141, with Montgomerie at 146.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara (72) and fellow American Justin Leonard (73) were
at 145.
</P>
<P>
   Among those missing the cut were Seve Ballesteros of Spain and
Ian Woosnam of Wales.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Pits Education Vs. Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California voters face a test Tuesday:
Are they willing to risk higher property taxes to try to turn
around the state's struggling public schools?
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a measure on California's primary ballot that would
make it easier for school districts to borrow money for
construction and renovation projects. Such money is repaid out of
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quality schools come at a price and it is ridiculous to
pretend that we can achieve California standards with Mississippi
funding,'' said Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers
Association, the state's largest teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to turn around students' dismal performance on
achievement tests, California, like other states, has set new
standards for students, overhauled testing and started developing a
graduation exam.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 26 say that the need for school
construction money is crucial because of population growth,
California's aging schools, and the space crunch caused by state
efforts to cut class size.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 26 pits voters' interest in education -- rated their
No. 1 concern in poll after poll -- against their fervor for tax
cuts, which began with Proposition 13, a 1978 measure that rolled
back property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters ''are frustrated that so much money is being spent and
the results are less than glowing,'' said Assembly Minority Leader
Scott Baugh, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In California, local school bonds need a two-thirds vote from
the public for approval. Proposition 26 would lower the hurdle to a
simple majority of the school district's voters. Idaho, Missouri
and New Hampshire are the only other states that require a
two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 26 is financed by the teachers union and a coalition
of Silicon Valley leaders. It has the backing of major school,
business and high-technology groups.
</P>
<P>
   The only organized opposition is the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer
Association. Howard Jarvis co-sponsored Proposition 13; he has
since died.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the two-thirds requirement, which has been in the
state constitution for 120 years, protects homeowners on a fixed
income from property tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   An independent poll released this week found Proposition 26
favored by 49 percent of likely voters, with 39 percent opposed and
12 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Fuller of Yuba City, who has three children in public
school, said she supports increased funding but doesn't think many
Californians will agree ''unless it is explained better that the
money is necessary for basic curriculum, books, pencils,
teachers.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Is Going Independent  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McELHENNY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts, which stood alone in its support
for George McGovern against Richard Nixon in 1972, isn't the
Democratic stronghold it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   New figures show just 36 percent of the state's registered
voters are Democrats, compared with nearly 83 percent in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, when Massachusetts voters had the option of registering
as independents, the figure had plummeted to 46 percent. And, now,
for the first time, more than half of voters list themselves as
independent.
</P>
<P>
   ''People feel less and less compelled to stick with something
just because their grandfather did,'' said Mary Feely, a resident
of the city's Beacon Hill neighborhood who grew up in Dedham.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' strong Democratic identity stretches back before
the Civil War, when the state's flood of immigrants -- many of them
Irish -- joined the party in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The new immigrants saw the Democratic Party as a way to obtain
basic services and favors, from jobs to eyeglasses to a bed in the
hospital for a sick grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party discipline was very, very strong,'' said Thomas H.
O'Connor, a Boston College history professor and author of ''The
Boston Irish: A Political History.'' ''You could vote independent,
but you could never get a favor again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1860 presidential election, Massachusetts supported the
Democratic candidate, Stephen Douglas, over an Illinois Republican
named Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Civil War, when the Republican Party was viewed
as the party of emancipation and the Democrats as the party of
slavery and disloyalty to the Union, the state clung to the party,
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   That party loyalty, carried down over generations, continued
until well into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very difficult for an Irish-American to say he was a
Republican because his grandfather would turn over in his grave,''
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, as descendants of the last century's immigrants grew in
status and economic wealth, the Democratic Party's machine politics
became less important in the delivery of services.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the favors and services that the party had delivered
were replaced by government programs, particularly after World War
II. Programs such as welfare, Social Security, workers'
compensation, and the GI Bill of Rights provided forms of
assistance similar to what the party had always provided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government really cut the legs out from under the
local parties,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Massachusetts, home of the Kennedys, was the only state
to vote for Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern
against Republican Richard Nixon. But in the last three
gubernatorial elections, Massachusetts voters have elected
Republicans: William Weld twice and Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Massachusetts voters continue to vote overwhelmingly with
the Democratic Party -- even if their official party loyalty has
weakened.
</P>
<P>
   The state's congressional delegation is entirely Democratic -- 10
in the House and two in the Senate. The state Legislature has 163
Democrats and only 34 Republicans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Up 12 Pct. in Feb.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. auto sales were up 12 percent in February,
with broad gains for many models of cars, pickups, minivans and
sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the month was just
under 19 million light vehicles, second only to September 1986,
when the rate briefly jumped to 21 million vehicles. The strength
of the market surprised some automakers, who had expected the
demand for new vehicles to slow slightly after a record-setting
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most automakers reported their results Wednesday, but a few
major companies, including BMW and Mazda, did not report results
until late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The following table consists of February 2000 car and light
truck sales in the United States by the major automakers. Industry
totals include 23 automakers, not just those listed, and estimates
for Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   The table compares sales in February 2000 with sales in February
1999, and year-to-date totals for the two years. Light trucks
include pickups, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Results for General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler AG do not include U.S. sales of their European
brands: Saab, Jaguar, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Percentages are based on the daily sales rate; there were 25
sales days last month, compared to 24 sales days in February 1999.

<HEADLINE> China To Execute Deputy Governor  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese leaders are preparing to mark the most
public political event of the year, the annual session of the
national legislature, by executing a deputy provincial governor for
bribery.
</P>
<P>
   By putting to death one of the highest-level officials caught
for corruption, leaders hope to show China's political elite, now
gathering in Beijing, their resolve to wipe out the pervasive graft
that has undermined popular support for the ruling Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into smuggling and other corruption have shaken
two wealthy coastal provinces and reached into the apex of power,
the governing State Council and the party Politburo. The fallout
has caused friction among the powerful and raised worries about
party unity at a time of growing social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In an unpublicized speech at the party's top training academy
late last year, President Jiang Zemin warned that the communists
could be toppled in 10 years if corruption is not controlled, party
and legislative officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about protests over unemployment and by the banned Falun
Gong spiritual movement, Beijing is awash in security for the
10-day legislative session, which opens Sunday. Police grabbed at
least 10 Falun Gong members as they unfurled banners or raised
their arms in meditation poses Friday in Tiananmen Square, adjacent
to the Great Hall of the People, where the legislature will meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fight against corruption is a life-or-death political
struggle for the party and the nation,'' Wei Jianxing, a member of
the Politburo and the party's top anti-graft enforcer, said in a
January speech that was published in full for the first time
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wei listed five of the 17 high-level corruption cases
investigators broke last year as proof of ''our staunch
determination to punish corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those cases involves Hu Changqing. A former deputy
director of the State Council's Religious Affairs Commission and
then a deputy governor of Jiangxi province, Hu was sentenced last
month to death for taking bribes worth $658,000.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the corruption fight, Hu is due to be executed
sometime around the congress session, party officials said on
condition of anonymity. Amnesty International, the London-based
human rights lobbying group, issued an alert Friday that Hu's
execution was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The party-dominated National People's Congress has limited
authority and largely approves decisions made by the communist
inner circle. But among the nearly 3,000 delegates are powerful
provincial politicians and military commanders whose support
Chinese leaders need.
</P>
<P>
   With no major personnel shake-ups and only one procedural law on
the agenda, delegates will take up routine work. They will review,
and no doubt approve, the budget and government plans for the year
and work reports by the chief judge and prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet officials have said the government will push for a third
year of deficit spending to keep the economy growing at a 7-percent
clip. In a preview, Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily reported that
Premier Zhu Rongji will tell delegates Sunday the deficit will rise
10 percent to $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lackluster agenda, issues like corruption and China's
attempts to pressure rival Taiwan into unification talks are
expected to energize the closed-door sessions leaders use to lobby
delegates, the party and legislative officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the publicity given Hu's execution, party leaders have
been less forthcoming about communist China's largest corruption
scandal. The investigation into the smuggling of $9.5 billion worth
of oil and other goods through the port city of Xiamen has divided
the senior leadership, with President Jiang moving to protect a
Politburo protege, the party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Already more than 30 officials have been formally arrested, one
of the officials said, and hundreds of others have been questioned.
Among those implicated was the wife of Beijing party secretary Jia
Qinglin, a Jiang ally.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from others in the leadership, Jia divorced Lin
Youfang on Dec. 4, the official said. But he and other officials
said rumors that the scandal would taint the leadership and fears
that Jia would be ousted drove Jiang to have Lin tell a Hong Kong
satellite television channel that the couple never divorced.

<HEADLINE> Anguilla Votes for New Government  </HEADLINE>
By WYCLIFFE RICHARDSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Turnout was heavy as residents of
Anguilla, a British Caribbean territory, voted Friday for a new
government and an end to a political impasse that has frustrated
London.
</P>
<P>
   Anguilla, an island of 10,000 that depends heavily on upscale
tourism, elected a coalition government in March 1999 that quickly
crumbled in a dispute between Chief Minister Hubert Hughes and his
finance minister, Victor Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The political deadlock -- which left Hughes without a majority in
the seven-seat House of Assembly -- exasperated British officials,
who had hoped to discuss changes in the relationship between
Britain and its territories.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents, meanwhile, complained that the deadlocked
government was doing little to create jobs or respond to the London
proposal. Opposition members have boycotted assembly meetings and
finally forced Hughes to call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,517 people were registered to vote in Friday's elections
for the seven assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Friday he was confident he would retain power.
</P>
<P>
   ''My party will definitely form this government today, together
with some of the independents,'' he said as he cast his ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Anguilla National Alliance, led by Osbourne Fleming, joined
with Banks' party to field candidates in five of the seven
districts. Seven independent candidates are on the ballots, as are
candidates from a new party, Grassroots for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Before their split, Hughes and Banks had negotiated a deal with
Beal Aerospace, a U.S. company, to build a commercial rocket launch
pad on Anguilla's Sombrero Island.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is worth a potential $6 million annually to Anguilla's
economy -- roughly a fifth of the national budget. Development
awaits regulatory approvals from London.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still committed to see it through,'' Beal spokesman Wade
Gates said Friday. ''We are perhaps frustrated by the length of
time to get the project rolling, but we are still moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Guyana also is negotiating with Beal for a similar launch
facility.

<HEADLINE> Board Split Over Bidders for Royals  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Denver billionaire Donald Sturm and New
York lawyer Miles Prentice each submitted bids of around $115
million for the Kansas City Royals, The Associated Press learned
today.
</P>
<P>
   The bids have triggered a bitter split among David Glass backers
on the team's board of directors, said sources close to the
bidding, who spoke on the condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, the Royals' board chairman and retiring Wal-Mart CEO, and
rum heir Facundo Bacardi each made offers of about $90 million for
the small-market franchise.
</P>
<P>
   One source said the six-person board was divided during a
rancorous meeting Thursday night over whether to go with one of the
higher bids or with Glass, who is well liked by baseball
commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a fifth bidder also emerged whose identity could
not immediately be learned. His offer was said to be higher than
the $90 million range.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of several major league owners, Glass has been
considered the clear favorite to obtain the team. He has been
chairman of the Royals since shortly after the death in 1993 of
team founder Ewing Kauffman, who indicated that he wanted Glass to
own the team he founded in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   As a potential owner, Glass, 65, has been excluded from all
matters pertaining to the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kauffman's succession plan, all money from the sale will
go to Kansas City charities. Plus, the board does not necessarily
have to take the highest offer if it deems a lower bidder would be
more likely to keep the team in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Sturm had been the unknown fourth bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old telecommunications magnate made a winning bid of
$461 million last year in the auction for the Denver Nuggets of the
NBA, Denver Avalanche of the NHL and Denver's Pepsi Center. But the
deal later fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Sturm is the second-largest stockholder in Level Three, a
telecommunications conglomerate and owns several banks in Colorado
as well as a satellite company in Florida that transmits all of
NBC's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi, 33, is an heir to the Bacardi rum and wine empire. The
Royals would also be his first holding in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice is the least wealthy of the four known bidders, but has
pursued the team the longest. He put together a large group that
made a $75 million offer that the board accepted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Major league owners, almost a year later, tabled a vote on
whether to approve Prentice, and the bid was later rejected by the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bowing out, Prentice restructured his group and now
has fewer investors with more money.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four known bidders could be reached today for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Tobacco Workers Stay Proud  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINAR DEL RIO, Cuba (AP) -- With hands stained as brown as a rich
cigar and displaying impressive speed from 17 years of experience,
the slim woman whips through the new, green tobacco leaves,
preparing them for drying.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Hernandez could have sought other work, but she was born
and raised in the western province of Pinar del Rio, where half of
Cuba's famous tobacco is grown. And though the work is hard and the
pay is low, Hernandez says she is proud to be part of a
centuries-old tradition known the world over.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people only knew,'' Hernandez, 47, sighs, exhaling a stream
of cigarette smoke and complaining that her salary ''doesn't make
ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But here, tobacco is the only thing there is. And of course it
is the best in the world,'' she says with a little smile, her eyes
fixed on her pile of tobacco leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Pride was in full flower this week as Cuba celebrated the
country's second annual international cigar festival -- an event
designed to draw new attention to an already famous Cuban export.
An estimated 800 cigar aficionados traveled to Havana for the
festival, which began Monday night and was ending with a formal
dinner Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The festival not only paid homage to the hand-rolled cigars
coveted the world over, but acknowledged the economic importance of
tobacco, still Cuba's third most important export after sugar and
nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is also a leading employer, providing jobs for about
110,000 of Cuba's 11 million citizens, a good many of them here in
Pinar del Rio, about 90 miles west of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba last year exported 148.5 million cigars, about 20 percent
more than in 1998, said Oscar Basulto, president of Habanos S.A.,
the national tobacco company. This year, Cuba hopes to export a new
record of 160-165 million cigars, most to traditional markets such
as Spain and France.
</P>
<P>
   More than a hundred pairs of hands are involved in the nearly
yearlong process that begins with a seed as tiny as a grain of
sugar planted in mid-September and ends with the finished cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are the hands of the women who sit at school desks
where they split the leaves along part of the vein running down the
center -- a process later followed by the modeling and rolling of
the cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Making them by hand, that is the secret. If not, the quality
just isn't the same,'' says Modesto Reina, head of quality control
at an old two-story building.
</P>
<P>
   The women must process a daily quota of at least 18 pounds of
leaves, although some process up to 40 pounds a day. They all earn
the same -- about $20 a month, or the price of a decent Cuban cigar
in the capitals of Europe or on the black market in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   While most Cubans own their homes and receive many vital
services and even part of their food either free or heavily
subsidized by the government, the salaries are not always enough to
buy cooking gas, butter, and pay other family costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''One still has to struggle much to eat,'' Hernandez allows.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco workers still maintain their families'
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The struggle is daily, but I will stay with it until I die,''
says grower Francisco Mileans. ''Tobacco has always been in my
family. My father worked in it. I work in it. And so will my son.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mysterious group airing ads in the
presidential race promoting Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
environmental record is headed by Sam Wyly, a Texas entrepreneur
who has donated thousands of dollars to Bush's political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly's newly formed group, Republicans for Clean Air, is airing
some $2 million in TV ads that go after John McCain on the
environment and tout Bush's record. It would be an illegal donation
if the Bush campaign were involved with planning the ads, but the
Bush camp says it has nothing to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   The ad comes a few days before Tuesday's bloc of voting, when 16
states hold primaries, including New York, California and Ohio,
where the ads are running.
</P>
<P>
   ''Air pollution threatens the health of our children,'' Wyly
said in statement today. ''It causes smog, acid rain and is clearly
linked to global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups said that Bush has a terrible record
on the environment, particularly air pollution, and questioned the
motives of the new campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly and his brother, Charles, gave Bush a total of $210,273 for
his 1994 and 1998 gubernatorial races. Charles Wyly is a Bush
''pioneer,'' having raised $100,000 for his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign cried foul and asked that the ads be pulled
from the air. It charged that the Bush campaign must be behind the
ads and complained about them in a letter to the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   There were other connections between the Bush campaign and clean
air group. The woman who bought the time for the ads, Lydia Meurat,
is also the executive director of a political action committee led
by Republican Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, a longtime Bush backer.
Bonilla's spokeswoman and Meurat both said it was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   And the ads were placed by Multimedia, which has done work in
the past for campaigns run by New York Gov. George Pataki and by
former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, both Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Hollywood, this would be the plot of a bad spy movie. In
Washington, it's business as usual,'' Rick Davis, McCain's campaign
manager, said today in a statement calling Republicans for Clean
Air ''a sham group.''
</P>
<P>
   By McCain's count, the group was spending more than $1.5 million
in upstate New York, nearly $150,000 in Columbus, Ohio, and at
least $300,000 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Leading environmental groups say neither McCain nor Bush has a
strong record on the issue, but they prefer McCain. Republicans for
Environmental Protection has endorsed the Arizona senator. And the
Sierra Club has spent nearly $100,000 attacking Bush's record on
the environment as governor of Texas.

<HEADLINE> Texas May Drop Hawaii Opener  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas might cancel its Sept. 2 season
opener against Hawaii because of unexpectedly high travel costs to
Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking to negotiate or get out of it,'' said DeLoss
Dodds, Texas athletic director. ''It is a huge expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodds, who expected a decision soon, said the projected cost of
the charter flight -- about $350,000 -- was double what originally
was anticipated. The school expects to earn $175,000 in gate
receipts for playing the game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Yoshiba, Hawaii athletic director, said his school was
willing to work with the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's a money issue, we're open to negotiation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the game would lighten the Longhorns' schedule. Texas
is scheduled to play its first 11 games in consecutive weeks and
could play 13 games in 14 weeks, if it advances to the Big 12 title
game.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mack Brown said a similarly tough schedule last year left
his team exhausted at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current schedule is not really desirable for the welfare
of the football team, considering the cost,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Kill 37 Russian Troops  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBA-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels ambushed a column of
Russian Interior Ministry troops in the capital, Grozny, killing or
wounding dozens of soldiers, the military said today.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush Thursday was one of the largest rebel actions in
Grozny since Russian forces claimed to have taken full control of
the capital on Feb. 6 following months of shelling and street
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The attack indicated that the rebels remain a potent force,
still able to stage major offensives despite Russian claims that
the insurgents are in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the beginning of a guerrilla war,'' said Baultdin
Bakuyev, a Chechen field commander who said his fighters had
ambushed the police in Grozny, then managed to escape into the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels attacked the Russians with machine guns and grenades
as the Russian nine-truck convoy was en route to replace troops at
a guard post in the Staropromyslovsky district, on Grozny's
northwestern outskirts, the military command's press center said.
The battle lasted four hours, survivors told Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   The casualty toll was uncertain. The ITAR-Tass news agency cited
a regional military official as saying the death toll was 37 with
12 wounded, but later cited Deputy Interior Minister Col. Gen. Ivan
Golubev as saying 20 were killed and 29 wounded. Col. Gennady
Melnik, an Interior Ministry spokesman in Moscow, said he knew of
only 18 confirmed deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who is leading the Kremlin's media
campaign on Chechnya, said the police were attacked by rebels
''from well-protected firing points.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The factor of surprise played a large role,'' he said, and the
attackers were able to flee because they had mined their escape
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops were part of riot police unit sent to Grozny
after the Russian army took control of the city. They were from the
town of Sergiyev Posad, about 20 miles northeast of Moscow, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing that 1,420 Russian soldiers
had been killed and 3,896 wounded in battle since Oct. 1. The
casualty figures included the police killed Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, independent analysts and soldiers' rights advocates
have questioned the official casualty figures, accusing the
military of trying to cover up much greater losses.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. workers who entered the Staropromyslovsky district with the
first convoy of international aid to the Chechen capital discovered
''a devastated and still insecure wasteland'' still littered with
grenades and bodies, the U.N. refugee agency said from Geneva
today.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. monitors who traveled with the convoy confirmed there was
still fighting in certain areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Far more aid is needed for the 21,000 civilians still in Grozny,
said Ron Redmond, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees. He added that the 45 tons of food brought to the city so
far was ''a drop in the bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for another convoy. UNHCR says it must
assess the trial run first.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops continued to battle rebels in
Chechnya's southern mountains. Russian warplanes and helicopters
flew more than 90 combat missions over the past 24 hours in the
Argun Gorge region, where the rebels retreated this week after
leaving their last major stronghold, the town of Shatoi.
</P>
<P>
   A large contingent of federal troops was concentrated near
Duba-Yurt, at the northern end of the Argun Gorge.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy artillery bombarded suspected rebel positions in five
Argun Gorge villages, as well as around Kharsinoi, west of the
gorge, and Ulus-Kert, to the east.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 militants were concentrated near Ulus-Kert, the
military said. Rebel commanders claimed that about 2,500 of their
fighters had escaped east from the Argun Gorge into the Vedeno
Gorge early today.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground forces into Chechnya in late September after
Chechnya-based Muslim fighters invaded the neighboring republic of
Dagestan. Russian authorities also blamed the rebels for a series
of apartment building bombings in Russia that killed about 300
people.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in double slaying convicted in 1987 Massachusetts killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A past manslaughter conviction in
Massachusetts could lead New York prosecutors to seek the death
penalty for a man accused of killing two people during an attack on
his pregnant ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Carrasquillo, charged in last week's attacks, served eight
years in a Massachusetts state prison for the 1987 shooting of
another former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasquillo, 38, originally was charged with first-degree
murder for shooting Miriam Lopez Peres through the front window of
her upstairs apartment in Boston. However, under a deal with
prosecutors he pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors here are looking into the Boston slaying to see if
it will let them seek the death penalty here for Carrasquillo,
Chief Assistant District Attorney Nicholas DeMartino said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   New York's death penalty law allows for executing someone who
previously committed murder, or a crime in another state under
circumstances that would be equivalent to murder under New York
law, DeMartino said.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury is considering whether to bring first-degree murder
charges against Carrasquillo, who also could be sentenced to death
because he killed his victims while committing other felony crimes
-- breaking into the house where his ex-girlfriend was staying and
taking her and other family members captive.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasquillo was released from prison in April 1998 after
serving eight years of a 20-year sentence. Within four months of
getting out of prison, Carrasquillo came to Syracuse where he met
18-year-old Nancy Jacinto.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said Carrasquillo is the father of Jacinto's
9-month-old baby and of the twins she is now carrying. Jacinto
survived the attack and is recovering in the hospital. The fetuses
were not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinto was living with her sister Margarita Salvador and her
husband, Leonardo. The family said Carrasquillo was angry that they
tried to steer Jacinto away from him. He became violent after
learning that Jacinto had lied to him and was planning to move to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Police allege Carrasquillo broke into the Salvadors' home on
Feb. 24 and took Jacinto, her 17-year-old brother, Rumenige
Jacinto, and another relative hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Jacinto was tied up and repeatedly stabbed, her bound
brother was killed when he tried to intervene. Another family
member returned home and was taken captive.
</P>
<P>
   When the Salvadors came home from work, Margarita was shot when
she refused to lie down on the floor to be tied up. Carrasquillo
fled the apartment and was captured a day later.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasquillo's 1987 case drew widespread attention in Boston
because Peres had repeatedly called police for help. Peres was
beaten, harassed and raped by Carrasquillo, who also slashed her
brother while breaking into her apartment.

<HEADLINE> Teacher accused of affair with student in the 1970s is fired  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAUQUOIT, N.Y. (AP) -- Jay Johnson has taught school for over
three decades. Now, he's out of a job because of an affair he
allegedly had with a 16-year-old student more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 52, a high school French teacher at Sauquoit Valley
High School, was fired this week, three weeks after a report from
the state Education Department said he had had sex with the
unidentified girl at his home and fondled her secretly during class
in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I conclude that there can be no doubt whatever that committing
the acts charged warrants termination as misconduct of the worst
magnitude, a most serious breach of the trust regarding the mission
of the teacher for the welfare of the student,'' state hearing
officer Ben Falcigno wrote in the Feb. 7 report.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had been on paid suspension since shortly after the
allegations first surfaced more than a year ago, denied having a
relationship with the girl. He insists that he never harmed any of
his students.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is I spent 31 years at Sauquoit Valley schools
and gave them my life,'' Johnson told the Observer-Dispatch of
Utica. ''I do not believe I have done anything to hurt anyone at
Sauquoit Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Miller, the lawyer for the school district, located just
south of Utica, said it is unusual for schools to fire teachers for
misconduct dating back so far. But he said the Board of Education
was on sound legal footing when it voted Tuesday night to remove
Johnson from his tenured job.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-page state report details intimate notes Johnson
reportedly wrote on the girl's report card. The report also
contains a copy of the letter he reportedly wrote in her high
school yearbook shortly after the girl alleged that he ended their
affair in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Johnson singled out the girl for special
attention when she was in the ninth grade. By the time she was a
senior, she regularly sneaked out of her house late at night for
sexual liaisons with her teacher, she told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The girl told authorities she believed that Johnson would marry
her after she graduated in 1977, but said he broke off their
relationship shortly before school ended that year.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that the affair came to light in 1998 after a
new affair between Johnson and his former student, now a
38-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   When that two-year affair was discovered by Johnson's wife and
the woman's husband, Johnson's wife started sending letters to the
woman, to her company and to her mother, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman responded by filing a complaint with authorities and
sending a letter to Sauquoit Valley school officials in which she
detailed her previous affair with Johnson, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time that had elapsed was a real difficulty in this
case,'' Sauquoit Valley Superintendent Robert Hanna said. He
declined to speak about the details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The report also outlines Johnson's denial of the alleged sexual
and romantic relationship. He stated in the report that many of the
claims were implausible, such as the frequency of sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
   New York State United Teachers, whose lawyer represented Johnson
at his hearing, argued that the only proof of the 23-year-old
affair was the credibility of the woman making the accusations.
They charged that she made up the affair to explain her infidelity
with Johnson between 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesmen said they could not comment on the case until
they had a chance to review it in more detail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said at the time that I didn't do it, and that's what this
has been about for the last year,'' Johnson said. ''If they no
longer wish me to be there because of this thing, I guess I won't
be. But I've always done my best to be supportive of students at
Sauquoit Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   School attorney Miller said although the state's report alleges
that Johnson committed crimes, including rape, he could not face
criminal charges because the statute of limitations has expired.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Won't Suspend Nandrolone Users  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- FIFA has decided it won't suspend soccer players
who test positive for the banned steroid nandrolone following a
study that showed men naturally produce the substance.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer's governing body commissioned the study, carried out in
recent months by a Swiss-based researcher, ''to find out whether
the male body can produce nandrolone like the female body does when
pregnant,'' FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 148 Swiss top-level and second-division
soccer players, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was found ... that under physical stress (such as training
and exercise) men do indeed produce endogenously nandrolone in a
quantity that is such that the threshold value of two nanograms per
milliliter of urine could well be produced by the athlete
himself,'' Herren said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman added that it is not yet scientifically clear how
much nandrolone the body could produce. Tests showing values above
the threshold value currently trigger suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that reason FIFA says we, in our doping regulations ...
knowing that there is this possibility that the body itself
produces nandrolone, we cannot impose sanctions against athletes in
football who test positive for nandrolone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone has produced a recent spate of positive results in
top athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Former world champion sprinter Merlene Ottey and former Olympic
champions Linford Christie and Dieter Baumann have been among the
stars who have received recent bans after testing positive for the
drug. All have protested they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been puzzled by a sudden surge in positive tests
for nandrolone, which has been available for decades and is easily
detectable in standard urine controls.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the increase is the result of athletes' taking
supplements which, they may or may not know, contain nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amateur Athletic Federation in February agreed
to study the possible effect of food supplements on those who
failed the nandrolone tests. But pending the results, it is
retaining its penalties for athletes testing positive for the
banned steroid.

<HEADLINE> Jury looks at cop statements about Louima attack  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The jury in the trial of three officers accused
of a cover-up in the torture of Abner Louima focused Friday on
statements prosecutors say the defendants tailored to fit their
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In notes to U.S. District Court Judge Eugene Nickerson on their
third day of deliberations in Brooklyn, jurors asked to be read
testimony by James Burns, a former investigator who interviewed
defendant Thomas Wiese shortly after the Aug. 9, 1997 attack. They
also requested a statement defendant Thomas Bruder made to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Wiese, 36, Bruder, 33, and Charles
Schwarz, 34, conspired to clear Schwarz by lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was convicted in another trial last year of violating
Louima's civil rights by leading him into the bathroom of the 70th
Precinct station and holding him down while another officer, Justin
Volpe, sodomized the handcuffed Haitian immigrant with a broken
broom handle in a fit of rage. Schwarz faces a possible life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At the current trial, Burns described an interview in which
Wiese identified himself as the second officer in the bathroom.
Wiese said he never saw Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct
house's front desk.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burns, Wiese also said he helped Volpe escort
Louima toward the arrest processing room and was surprised when
Volpe took a sharp right to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, hearing noises, Wiese said he entered and was
shocked to find Volpe, broomstick in hand, with his foot on the
prostrate Louima's back. Wiese said he dragged Louima away as Volpe
claimed that the victim had soiled himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder told the FBI that he saw Volpe lead Louima to the
bathroom, trailed by Wiese -- not Schwarz. That contradicted an
earlier statement in which he said that Volpe was the sole escort.
</P>
<P>
   Louima has testified at both trials that two officers attacked
him. He positively identified one of his assailants as Volpe, and
the other as ''the driver'' of the patrol car that took him to the
station; records show the driver was Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have relied on records showing the three officers
made a flurry of phone calls to each other as investigators zeroed
in. The pattern and timing of the calls proved the officers were
trying to ''get their stories straight'' that Schwarz was never in
the bathroom, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has tried to convince the jury the story was true --
and that there could be no cover-up if Schwarz committed no crime.
Schwarz himself testified last week that during Volpe's attack, he
was outside inspecting his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving 30 years
in prison, also emerged as a key defense witness. He testified that
Wiese was the second officer, but did not participate in the actual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants face terms of up to five years if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Salad Blamed in Car Dealer Sickness  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Federal health officials have confirmed that a
salad packed with boxed meals shipped to Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge
dealerships was responsible for food poisoning in 333 dealership
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The large meals, assembled by HoneyBaked Foods Inc. of Toledo,
Ohio, included ham and-or turkey with several side dishes, packed
in ice and shipped by next-day delivery. HoneyBaked Foods is a
catalog business not affiliated with the Honey Baked Ham Co. of
Troy.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG has sent out about 3,000 of the meals over
the past two years to congratulate dealerships that received the
company's Five Star rating for sales performance. The company
stopped shipping the meals in early February after the first
reported illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   HoneyBaked Foods said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta determined that four kinds of salad made by another company
was the source of the outbreak, which caused one- to two-day bouts
of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The CDC said the symptoms were
similar to those from a Norwalk-type virus, one of the most common
causes of food-borne illness.
</P>
<P>
   CDC epidemiologist Alicia Anderson said of the 333 people the
CDC found had become sick from the meals, 11 were briefly
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   HoneyBaked Foods president Dan Kurz said the salads were
prepared by a Toledo-based catering service. He said HoneyBaked
will no longer buy foods from the service.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler spokesman Mike Aberlich said the company will no
longer ship meals to dealerships, but will instead give dealers
money to buy their own meals. The company will still work with
HoneyBaked Foods to arrange catering.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has about 4,500 Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep
dealerships in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Judges' Clerks Out-Earn Ex-Bosses  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For his job as the nation's top-ranking
federal judge, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist earns $181,400.
Not bad, but his own law clerks could beat that salary next year
simply by joining a major law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to join a trend that began in money-laden Silicon
Valley last year, the nation's leading law firms are offering the
best and brightest young lawyers starting salaries -- complete with
signing bonuses -- that spiral higher and higher. Annual
compensation has increased by up to $40,000 in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges are not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are following these developments with great interest,''
said David Hansen, a federal appeals court judge from Cedar Rapids,
Iowa. ''It's tough when you realize the compensation for a lawyer
three years out of law school exceeds that of the chief justice of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Williams, a federal appeals court judge from Chicago, is
more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an outrage,'' she said. ''These salaries for youngsters
devalue the experience judges take to the bench with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven-figure compensation for senior partners in large law firms
is not rare, and Hansen, who chairs a U.S. Judicial Conference
committee that tracks judicial pay, accepts the disparity as ''an
economic fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Federal judges' lifetime work has some monetary value down the
road,'' he acknowledged. A federal judge can retire at full pay at
age 65 after 15 years of service or at 70 after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Working as a federal judge's law clerk is a prestigious job with
a real-world payoff, and sparks vigorous competition among the
leading students at the top law schools. A Supreme Court clerkship
is the biggest prize of all.
</P>
<P>
   After clerking one year at a lower court and a year for a
Supreme Court justice -- a job that pays just under $50,000 -- a
lawyer typically is besieged by law firms offering employment as a
third-year associate. A year's salary at that level can reach
$175,000, not counting a signing bonus that can go as high as
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers fresh out of law school are lured away from
clerkships and offered entry-level salaries of $125,000 by many
large law firms, up as much as $45,000 over just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges have groused about their pay for decades, with
little effect because they lack a champion and a constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Congress stiffed them for five straight years -- doling out not
even a cost-of-living increase from 1993 through 1997. They got one
in 1998 and again in January.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's Supreme Court colleagues now earn $173,600; appeals
court judges get $149,900 and district court trial judges $141,300.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the two more recent raises, the buying power of federal
judicial salaries has dropped 13 percent since 1993. The situation
would have been far worse if not for a 25 percent increase that
took full effect in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, it's a privilege and an honor to be a federal judge, but
try telling that to someone who's got two kids in college, paying
$60,000 in tuition and watching the take-home pay take a nose
dive,'' said Ralph Mecham, director of the Administrative Office of
U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist makes pay a recurring theme of his yearend reports on
the state of the judiciary. ''More appropriate compensation'' is
vital to ''the quality and morale of the federal judiciary,'' he
said in January.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal judges leave for greener pastures, but court
officials worry more about the judiciary's ability to attract
topnotch legal minds to the bench in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an issue of arrogance,'' said Williams, president of
the 800-member Federal Judges Association. ''We just are grossly
underpaid in terms of our counterparts in private practice. We
should not be in a situation where a federal judge must rely on a
spouse who works outside the home, or only wealthy people can
consider judicial service.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many lawyers appointed to the federal bench are
nominated after years in lucrative law practices. Other traditional
sources for judicial posts, however, include lower-paying
governmental legal jobs and academia.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are signs of backlash to the higher attorney pay
from corporate clients, the salary surge for young lawyers
continues.
</P>
<P>
   That trend and a huge salary increase the president will receive
next January -- from $200,000 to $400,000 -- give federal judges hope
Congress will not go another five years before adjusting their
salaries.

<HEADLINE> Woman Barred From Contacting Houston  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- A New York City woman who wrote that
Whitney Houston is her ''supernatural reincarnated mother'' and has
sent her a four-tiered cake, underwear and other gifts has been
barred from contacting the singer.
</P>
<P>
   A judge issued a temporary restraining order Thursday against
Desiree D. Weeks, 36, in response to a lawsuit filed by Houston,
who lives in Mendham, about 35 miles west of New York City. Weeks
was not at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks began sending rambling letters to Houston's management
company in August, calling Houston ''Mommy'' and her ''supernatural
reincarnated mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every chance I get I make it known I belong to Queen Whitney
Houston,'' Weeks wrote in one letter.
</P>
<P>
   She called Houston's 7-year-old daughter her ''little sister''
and Houston's mother ''Nana,'' Houston attorney Thomas Weisenbeck
said. Weeks also sent Houston a bra and underwear, a makeup kit,
Valentine's Day candy and the cake, with plates and utensils,
Weisenbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   The letters came with various return addresses, including the
Bronx Psychiatric Center.

<HEADLINE> Grieve OKs 4-Year Deal With A's  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Outfielder Ben Grieve, the American League Rookie
of the Year in 1998, agreed today to a $13 million, four-year
contract with the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely overwhelmed by this and extremely happy,'' said
Grieve, whose deal was announced before Oakland's spring training
game against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, an outfielder, hit .288 with 18 home runs and 89 RBIs in
his rookie season. He tied an Oakland record with 41 doubles and
set an Oakland team rookie record for hits, 168.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start last year, Grieve came back to hit a
career-high 28 home runs and drove in 86 helping the Athletics stay
in the pennant chase until the last couple of weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The former first-round draft pick hit .265 overall last year,
but batted .303 over his final 115 games. He had hit just .131 over
the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Billy Beane said Grieve deserved the long-term
contract and the signing was central to Oakland's desire to keep
its core of rising stars together.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to look at what Ben has done,'' Beane said.
''Take a look at some of the numbers this guy has put up. He's
still a work in progress, but you don't want to lose sight of what
he's done already. He's pretty special. Any money Ben gets from
this contract is well-deserved and well-earned and the best is yet
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   With the signing of Grieve, the A's have seven players with
contracts that go beyond this season, including first baseman Jason
Giambi, second basemen Randy Velarde, designated hitter John Jaha
and pitchers Mike Magnante, T.J. Mathews and Omar Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the club holds an option for 2001 on pitcher Gil
Heredia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that was important is that Ben wanted to be here,''
A's president Mike Crowley said. ''He kind of validated what we're
trying to do here. The deal doesn't get done unless both sides want
it to get done and signing Ben sends a strong message to our
players our front office and staff and to our fans.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Reinstates Barkley Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- St. John's guard Erick Barkley, suspended for
three games this season, was reinstated again by the NCAA today.
</P>
<P>
   The university said Barkley must repay the $3,500 he received in
financial assistance from Maine Central Institute, the prep school
he attended before coming to St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, the leading scorer for the No. 18 Red Storm, will be
able to play Sunday at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased with the result and delighted that Erick will
play this weekend,'' athletic director Ed Manetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had been suspended for three games this month because of
what the NCAA said was an improper benefit -- he swapped cars with
the brother of his former AAU coach. St. John's appealed and the
suspension was reduced to two games.
</P>
<P>
   He was declared ineligible again Tuesday over his tuition and
fees for the 1997-98 academic year at Maine Central. The suspension
came shortly before what turned out to be 66-60 win over Seton
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's said it had investigated the tuition matter and found
no violations. The NCAA disagreed and told the school to declare
him ineligible immediately because it believed the church had paid
$3,500 of Barkley's $21,000 tuition.

<HEADLINE> Wider Chechnya Access Offered  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Russia accepted demands Friday that it
let European human rights experts into Chechnya to look for
evidence that civilians were mistreated as the Russian army crushed
Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has jockeyed with the United States and its European
allies for months, and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov's offer was
received with considerable skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, who holds the
rotating presidency of the European Union, welcomed the Russian
response. ''The facts point to change in the situation,'' Gama
said. ''A definitive solution has not been found, but things are
beginning to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Denying all the while that the bloodied area was sealed off from
outside observers and the media as Russian troops hammered Grozny,
the capital, into submission, Ivanov said his government was taking
''significant steps'' to allay Western misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   He alleged that Western reporters who got into Chechnya
disseminated ''false and twisted information'' and lectured a
French journalist that her newspaper printed unbalanced accounts of
the Russian offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Russia based its assault in the Caucasus on the twofold argument
that it had a right to stop Chechnya from seceding from Russia, and
the rebellion was fomented by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov held to this argument Friday. He said the fight against
separatism, extremism and nationalism ''in all forms is our common
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to the onsite surveys by experts including the Red
Cross' president at a joint session with senior American and
European officials. The meeting marked another step in coordinating
policy with Russia on such diverse topics as peacekeeping in the
Balkans and nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have taken a few small steps, but it is not enough, and
it is not convincing,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the Red Cross must
have access to camps where Chechens are interned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russians will be well-served if they resolve the doubts,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   And Chris Patten, a senior European Union official, stressed a
need for immediate delivery of food, shelter and clothing. ''We
gave Mr. Ivanov some concrete proposals. I hope he is going to be
open-minded,'' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   A European technical group is due to go to Chechnya on Monday.
But European officials said they still needed permission from
Russia to enter the republic as well as ''free mobility'' there.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, Albright had breakfast with Ivanov, and
Chechnya was the main item of conversation. ''We do not mince words
on this subject, and our differences are deep,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those deep differences over Chechnya, the United States
and its European allies moved to strengthen ties to Russia while
hoping for an impartial inquiry into the military campaign.
Albright and Ivanov both seemed determined not to let Chechnya
dominate their relations.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is looking for Russia's cooperation in difficult
peacemaking in Kosovo, the Serbian province where U.S., European
and Russian troops are trying to keep ethnic tensions from erupting
into widespread violence.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to help establish civilian institutions that
would lead Serbs and ethnic Albanians toward coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   On a related front, meanwhile, Albright endorsed creation of a
European security force that will enable Europeans to defuse crises
beyond their borders without American troops.
</P>
<P>
   But, Albright said, the United States will not abandon the
option of sending American troops into volatile situations in
Europe. ''We will always judge what is in our national interest,''
she said after a separate meeting of U.S. and European ministers.

<HEADLINE> Johnson: I Can Run 400 Even Faster  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- As Michael Johnson crossed the finish line of the
200 meters at the 1996 Olympics, his golden shoes glistening in the
darkness, he had run an astonishing 19.32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had cut a remarkable .34 seconds off his world record
and completed an unprecedented 200-400 Olympic double. He was
completely satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   As he crossed the finish line of the 400 meters at the 1999
World Championships in Seville, Spain, again wearing his golden
shoes, he had run another golden race, breaking the world 400
record at 43.18. The time was .11 seconds under the previous
record, but he was not totally satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to run 42 for the 400,'' Johnson said Friday. ''I
think I'm capable of running that. I don't think much about records
in the 200 anymore. I don't think I broke the 400 by enough. I
think I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will get his first opportunity at the 400 record shortly
when he competes in a race in Cape Town, South Africa. But it's too
early in the season to expect a record, and the competition will
not be severe.
</P>
<P>
   The race will be the culmination of a three-race tour of South
Africa. His first two appearances will be in 200s at Pietersburg
and Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been training toward another Olympic double since
November, and his South African races ''are a good way to break up
the monotony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes there will be tremendous pressure to repeat that
sprint sweep, but he is confident he can be the first male or
female to win both races at the Olympics twice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great about my chances of winning both again,'' he
said. ''I've been training very hard, the training's been going
well and I'm healthy. But there's a lot of pressure, even if you're
doing it for the first time. The advantage I'll have is that I've
done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is aware that if he doesn't win both gold medals, his
reverential image could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being in the sport this long, I don't let others expectations
affect me,'' he said. ''I'm used to winning races, but I know if I
win by only .02 seconds, they'll say, 'Michael is dead.' If I don't
win the 200 and 400 at Sydney, it (the adulation) won't be the same
as before. They come back, though, as soon as I break a world
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Sydney, Australia, for the Olympics, Johnson
will have to make the U.S. team at the Olympic trials in
Sacramento, Calif., in July. There, he will have to run only three
races each in the 200 and 400 as opposed to four apiece at the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trials will be a lot easier,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson has done for the past four years, he has skipped the
indoor season, including the USA Championships at the Georgia Dome
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like running indoors,'' said Johnson, 32, who set the
world indoor 400 record of 44.63 at the 1995 championships. ''I've
had to make adjustments as I've gotten older. Running indoors took
time away from my training (for outdoors). Also, when you don't run
indoors, you can keep working on things. You don't have to
interrupt your training. And it wasn't financially worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson dismissed the challenge of Maurice Greene, the world
record-holder at 100 meters, who has lobbied for a match race at
200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maurice Greene will get his opportunity if he makes the
Olympic team,'' Johnson said. ''I can't single out one person who
might be a challenger when he has to beat out a lot of other
challengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was in Atlanta to launch a program to help develop the
next generation of U.S. Olympic hopefuls through a $300,000
contribution from Samsung Telecommunications America to the Olympic
Community Development Program. The money is being distributed to
programs in Atlanta, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City and San Antonio.

<HEADLINE> Texas Cites Drifter Confession  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A drifter jailed for allegedly attacking
two girls is now linked to nine slayings in five states after
confessing to killing a family of four in Illinois in 1987, the
Texas Department of Public Safety said today.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lynn Sells confessed to the killings during an interview
in jail Thursday with investigators from the Jefferson County,
Ill., sheriff's office, department spokesman Tom Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a sadistic individual,'' Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Sells confessed to shooting Russell Dardeen of Ina, Ill., Vinger
said. He also confessed to fatally beating Dardeen's pregnant wife,
Ruby -- who gave birth during the attack -- their 3-year-old son,
Peter, and the newborn, a girl, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois authorities have not charged Sells, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sells, a former carnival worker who also rode the railroads, is
accused of slashing the throats of Kaylene Harris, 13, and Krystal
Surles, 10, as they slept Dec. 31 in the Harris family home near
Del Rio, about 150 miles west of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Kaylene died almost instantly, while Krystal ran to a neighbor's
house for help. She survived and helped create a composite portrait
that led authorities to Sells.
</P>
<P>
   Sells' confession Thursday brings to nine the total number of
killings in which Sells either has been charged or is implicated,
Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Vinger said the attacks were in Missouri in 1985; Illinois,
1987; Arizona, 1988; and in Kentucky and Texas last year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers are scheduled to escort Sells to Arkansas next
week, where is wanted for questioning in two other slayings, Vinger
said.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Group Backs Elian's Father  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A group of visiting American attorneys announced
their support Friday for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, father of the
6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has lost his mother,'' Dean Hubbard, spokesman for the
visiting labor lawyers, said of Elian Gonzalez. ''To separate him
from his father and his grandmothers is cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, of New York City, spoke after he and members of the
National Lawyers Guild met with Ricardo Alarcon, president of
Cuba's National Assembly and the communist government's lead man on
U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   Guild members have spent a week in Cuba meeting with Cuban
attorneys and studying this country's labor law.
</P>
<P>
   They also met with Gonzalez, who expressed gratitude for their
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have not implemented the decision and I still do not have
my son,'' said Gonzalez, referring to the Jan. 5 ruling by
Commissioner Doris Meissner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service that Elian should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution of the case has been delayed in the courts while
Elian's Miami relatives seek to block the boy's return to his
communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued at sea Nov. 25 after his mother and 10 others
perished when their boat capsized en route from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He became the subject of an international tug-of-war, with his
father demanding that the child be returned to him and their
relatives in Miami fighting to keep him in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Changes Europe Fund Sales  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the world's biggest
financial services company, said Friday it would tap Germany's
growing mutual fund market by selling the funds of competitors in
addition to its own.
</P>
<P>
   The move brings the American giant -- parent of Travelers
Insurance and Citibank -- into direct competition with only a small
group of German banks in handling a wide variety of different
funds.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Citigroup, which has 300 retail banks in Germany,
plans to launch the service in May, offering 400 different funds
from 14 different investment companies, spokesman Mirko Kaminski
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to give our customers a large range of products
better suited to their individual needs and investment goals,''
Kaminski said. ''That's what our customers are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup kicked off its European strategy in Belgium and
intends to offer similar services in other European countries if it
takes hold in Germany, Kaminski said.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, total assets invested in mutual funds have more than
doubled to $380 billion since 1995, according to Frank Bock at the
German Association of Investment Companies in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the concept of a fund ''supermarket'' has
solid roots with at least 40 banks offering such a selection, said
Ron Mandle, a banking analyst with C. Bernstein and Company.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most banks in Germany and Europe sold only their
own funds. But that's quickly changing as more Germans become
interested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, began selling funds
from other companies last year, and Germany-based Consor's Discount
Brokers also does the same. The banks profit by selling other
company's funds because they charge a service fee -- although that
fee is usually higher than the management fees charged for the
bank's own funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Citigroup is clearly taking the view that if
supermarket funds are popular in the United States, they will be
popular in Germany,'' Mandle said. ''And if you're one of the first
in the business, you're likely to end up the market leader.''

<HEADLINE> India's Bihar State Gets New Govt.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- The leader of a broad coalition was
designated head of government in India's poorest and most lawless
state Friday following a deadlocked election.
</P>
<P>
   As Nitish Kumar was being sworn in, a fierce gunbattle raging in
another part of Bihar state killed 11 armed guerrillas of the
People's War Group and two policemen. The violence was a somber
reminder of the tough task the new government faces in the state,
torn by caste clashes and guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bihar Gov. Vinod Pande, whose position is largely ceremonial,
appointed Kumar chief minister. Kumar was told to form an
administration and instructed to win a vote of confidence in the
legislature in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar immediately resigned his previous post as India's
agriculture minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar's appointment ended the 10-year run by Laloo Prasad Yadav,
who revolutionized Indian politics by leading a party of India's
poor and marginalized classes to power in Bihar.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav was chief minister until July 1997 when he was forced to
resign after being charged in a corruption case. Afterwards, his
Rashtriya Janata Dal party named his wife, Rabri Devi, to replace
him, even though she can barely read and write.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav's party and Kumar's alliance each won 123 seats in the
race for the 324-member state legislature. That left each party
scrambling for support from the other legislators.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rally; Dow Up 233.61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied today as the government's
employment report showed some easing of the tight labor market. The
news calmed investors' fears that the Federal Reserve will push
interest rates sharply higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 233.61 at 10,398.53, adding to the 302-point gain
already tallied this week by the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   With today's gains, the Dow is up more than 5 percent this week.
It is the first time since mid-August that the Dow has risen five
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 139.72 at 4,894.23, coasting well past its previous closing
record of 4,784.08, set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 26.80 at 1,408.56.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shot higher from the start today after the Labor
Department reported that 43,000 new jobs were created in February,
well below analysts' expectations and the weakest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment ticked up to 4.1 percent in February
from 4 percent in January, but it still remained at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing labor market has spooked Wall Street for
months, with many investors worrying about how continued growth
will affect businesses. Companies must offer competitive wages and
incentives to keep employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at
such low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big concern is that the economy was going to overheat and
employment was going to be one of the biggest problems,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''But we did not create nearly the number
of jobs that were expected and the unemployment rate went up.
That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rate four times since June in an
effort to slow the economy and control inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that the Fed would take a more aggressive stance in
boosting rates have led to great volatility in the stock market in
recent weeks. Blue-chip stocks have been under the greatest
pressure, with the Dow falling below 10,000 for the first time
since last April before recovering this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the jobs report today and data released Thursday showing
new-home sales plunged by 4.2 percent in January may be signaling
that the Fed's actions are having some effect.
</P>
<P>
   While most investors still believe that the Fed will likely
boost rates again soon -- maybe even at their meeting later this
month -- many now think that the hike won't be as sharp as
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The softer the economic numbers we see, the more lenient the
Fed will be,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Right now bad news is good news for this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Among industrial stocks in the Dow, DuPont rose 4~ to 51} and 3M
rose 3 15/16 to 90.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares also gained. Microsoft gained 3} to 97[ and
Cisco Systems rose 3~ to 136].
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 815.74 million
shares, up from 817.99 million shares on Thursday. On the Nasdaq,
advancers were ahead by an 8-to-5 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 12.17 at
596.21.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Names Interim Director  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- The University of Michigan selected
businessman William C. Martin as its interim athletic director on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a Michigan graduate, is president of First Martin Corp.,
an Ann Arbor real estate development company, and is the founder
and chairman of the board for the Bank of Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the four-person panel that reviewed the financial
management of the school's athletic department last year.
University president Lee Bollinger said Martin does not want to be
compensated.
</P>
<P>
   School spokeswoman Julie Peterson said the 59-year-old Martin
''has indicated he is not a candidate for the permanent position.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is effective Monday, with the university's Board
of Regents being asked to approve it at their March 20 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Martin would step in for Tom Goss, who resigned Feb. 8,
reportedly under pressure from Bollinger over his handling of the
NCAA's suspension of the Jamal Crawford, the basketball team's
leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports said Goss angered Bollinger by not telling him of
an NCAA probe of the eligibility of the freshman Crawford.
Bollinger has refused to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA suspended Crawford for six games for his living
arrangements while in high school.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Clash With French Troops  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Firing tear gas and stun
grenades, French peacekeepers punched a corridor through a crowd of
Serb protesters Friday, returning dozens of ethnic Albanians to
their homes in this divided Kosovo city.
</P>
<P>
   Some 34 people crossed the 3-foot-deep Ibar River in armored
personnel carriers, bypassing demonstrators on the city's main
bridge nearby, U.N. officials said. Those who crossed included
members of about 24 families, and most of them were said to be in
their 50s or 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's push to send home dozens of ethnic Albanian families
expelled from their apartments in the northern half of Kosovska
Mitrovica came after NATO failed to build a footbridge across the
river to link the apartment houses to the predominantly Albanian
southern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Serb protesters, determined to prevent the return of ethnic
Albanians, marched through the city to the three high-rises, trying
to push their way through a cordon of NATO troops and U.N. police.
They were shoved back.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers fired tear gas, and the Serbs retreated several yards
while French reinforcements, including about 80 police, rushed to
the scene. Three French peacekeepers were injured in the melee,
said Cpt. Frederic Beaumont, a spokesman for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Serbs also were treated for injuries, authorities at the
local hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second push, Danish armored personnel carriers lumbered
across through the river, pushing through the crowd to reach the
buildings. The Serbs rushed at the cordon of French troops, who
threw more tear gas and fired stun grenades to break a path through
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers' push came after several similar scuffles
Thursday, when about 200 chanting, rock-throwing Serbs prevented
the Albanians from reaching the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   With the forceful efforts to foster a return, French Gen. Pierre
de Saqui de Sannes, the NATO commander in charge of this section of
Kosovo, apparently intended to send a message. Despite the heated
atmosphere, the general insisted that the ethnic Albanians would be
safe because NATO peacekeepers ''can guarantee their security.''
</P>
<P>
   In another calculated show of force on Friday, the French kicked
down doors to break into the offices of local Serb leaders, looking
for three riot shields they say were taken during Thursday's
unrest. But Serbs gathered around the office building, forcing the
French to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic called the act ''a provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed violence in Kosovo has thwarted efforts by NATO and
Kosovo's U.N. administration to establish normality in the Serb
province eight months after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced
an end to the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and the pullout of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovska Mitrovica, 20 miles northwest of Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina, has been the scene of repeated ethnic unrest in
recent weeks, resulting in several deaths and dozens of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In another demonstration of Serb frustrations in Kosovo, some
1,000 people gathered in front of a local Serbian Orthodox church
in a southeastern Kosovo town to protest the recent killing of a
prominent Serb doctor there, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Josif Vasic, 38, the only Serb gynecologist in that region of
Kosovo, was shot and killed by unknown assailants firing from a
passing car on Feb. 26. At the time, Vasic was walking to work
through the Serb area of the town of Gnjilane, 22 miles southeast
of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   After the assembled Serbs observed a moment of silence for their
slain doctor, a local Serb priest, Zivojin Trajkovic, addressed the
gathering, comparing the situation in Gnjilane to ''much of the
rest of Kosovo, where the intensity of the violence and the ongoing
ethnic cleansing is such that most of the Serbs have left.''

<HEADLINE> BSkyB Buys Stake in Soccer Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB bought a 9.9 percent stake
in the Chelsea professional soccer team for $64 million Friday,
giving the satellite television company stakes in four English
Premier League teams.
</P>
<P>
   BSkyB also owns 9.9 percent of Manchester United, 9.08 percent
of Leeds United and 5 percent of Sunderland, as well as 9.9 percent
of Manchester City, a team in division one.
</P>
<P>
   BSkyB won't have a seat on the board of Chelsea but Sky Sports
Ventures, one of its subsidiaries, will act as the exclusive media
agent for the controlling company, the Chelsea Village Group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S cable operator NTL has 9.9 percent stakes in Newcastle
United and Aston Villa, while the British TV company Granada owns
9.9 percent of Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Office of Fair Trading, the government's trade
watchdog, prevented BSkyB from buying Manchester United for $1
billion. The Premier League has since imposed a 10 percent limit on
any company's holding in a soccer club. The league also approved a
rule preventing a company from owning shares in more than six
teams.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton criticized Congress
today for not voting on gun-control legislation, and called the
failure of a Senate vote on the issue Thursday ''a great credit to
the power'' of the National Rifle Association.

   Speaking to a gathering of communications technologists, Clinton
decried the fact a nonbinding resolution calling for final
congressional action on gun safety by April 20 failed on a 49-49
vote.

   Clinton said it is appalling that the measure was defeated
''after all we went through this week,'' referring to the shooting
death of a Michigan first-grader by a classmate and the killing of
three people in Wilkinsburg, Pa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Workers Strike  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Thousands of oil workers went on
strike Friday in Venezuela, endangering output from the third
largest petroleum exporter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The state oil monopoly implemented a contingency plan to ensure
continued exports and the government sent in the National Guard to
keep order. Unions said compliance with the strike was widespread,
but government officials called it a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The strike comes at a time when decreased world oil production
has driven international oil prices to nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Because Venezuela is one of the top three foreign suppliers of
oil to the United States, a supply disruption could mean even
higher gasoline and heating oil costs for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Initially, we're not likely to see a major effect on prices.
But the longer the strike lasts, the more likely supply from the
country will be affected,'' Tom Bentz, an energy analyst with
Paribas Futures in New York, told Dow Jones Newswires on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike against the state oil monopoly Petroleos de
Venezuela, or PdVSA, underscored growing strife for the government
of President Hugo Chavez, who came to power a year ago promising to
champion workers' rights but who insists the country's union
leadership is corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives said the strike will be ''indefinite'' and
will paralyze the South American nation's oil production. The work
stoppage was called to protest PdVSA's refusal to sign a
preliminary accord for a new labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   Oil accounts for about three-quarters of Venezuela's export
earnings. The country exports some 2.72 million barrels of oil per
day.
</P>
<P>
   PdVSA officials insisted the company will honor its supply
obligations through contingency plans with midlevel managers and
non-unionized workers helping run production operations.
</P>
<P>
   The contingency plan normally guarantees supplies of crude oil
and refined products for at least seven days. However, it was
unclear how long the supply could be guaranteed with the current
strike.
</P>
<P>
   There was disagreement about how many workers were striking.
Union leaders said it involved some 60,000 people, and Carlos
Navarro, secretary-general of the nation's umbrella union, said 90
percent of workers were complying with the strike call. But PdVSA
Vice President Domingo Marsicobetre told reporters only about 10
percent of Venezuela's oil workers were striking.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of (the company's) operations are seriously affected by
the strike,'' Marsicobetre said. ''We believe the call to strike
has been a total failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Hernandez, vice president of the Venezuelan Petroleum
Chamber, an organization representing petroleum-related businesses,
said 60 percent of workers heeded the strike call in the states of
Anzoategui and Zulia, where most petroleum facilities are located.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the PdVSA's shipping arm, PDV Marina, agreed Friday
to resume work, saying the company had ''committed itself to
restart negotiations for a new collective labor agreement,'' union
spokesman Humberto Arcinaga said.
</P>
<P>
   PdVSA President Hector Ciavaldini told reporters that some
employees did not show up to work because of ''acts of vandalism''
by union leaders. He said the leaders were offering alcoholic
beverages and money to get people to strike, preventing workers
from boarding buses and blocking access to oil facilities with
locks and chains.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of national guardsmen were sent in to maintain order at
oil installations.
</P>
<P>
   A collective contract for petroleum workers expired in November.
Government officials and oil union leaders announced Tuesday they
had reached a preliminary agreement on contract negotiations, but
the accord unraveled Wednesday when Ciavaldini said the company
itself had not signed onto the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ciavaldini and other company and government officials say they
do not want to negotiate a new contract until union leaders, whom
they say are linked to corrupt political parties, are replaced in
democratic elections. Union leaders deny allegations of corruption
and say Chavez is putting labor freedoms in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Venezuela's umbrella union, the Venezuelan Workers
Federation, said they may call a general strike of public-sector
workers to show solidarity with the oil workers.

<HEADLINE> Seinfeld Gets $40M Hamptons Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- His show was about nothing. His new
house in the Hamptons is about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld agreed to pay that for a 12-acre East Hampton
beach estate that once belonged to rock star Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   As the masters of a new domain on exclusive Further Lane,
Seinfeld and new wife Jessica Sklar will be with the beautiful
people during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors on Seinfeld's street include ''Saturday Night Live''
creator Lorne Michaels, designer Helmut Lang and writer James
Brady, and that's just the tip of the Hamptons' social iceberg.
Steven Spielberg and ''60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt own homes
on the island's East End, while frequent summer visitors include
Sean ''Puffy'' Combs and Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to keeping up with the Joneses, Seinfeld is more
than holding his own. Billionaire Revlon boss Ronald Perelman's
East Hampton estate is worth a mere $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld and Sklar already share a home on Manhattan's Upper
West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Details on how the purchase came about were limited. Jerry was
shopping for a Hamptons retreat, he was turned down a couple of
times, and yada yada yada ... he bought a $40 million home.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Paul Reiser brought Seinfeld and Joel together. Joel
reportedly gave the Seinfelds a personal tour of the property,
which the Piano Man purchased in the mid-1980s and redid in the
style of a Mediterranean villa.
</P>
<P>
   Joel's move is work-related. He wants a home on Long Island's
North Folk, closer to a recording studio where the Grammy winner is
working on a classical music album.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld, 45, is a native of the far-less-tony Long Island town
of Massapequa. He and his wife were married on Christmas Day 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The E.W. Scripps Co. has bought independent
television station KMCI in Lawrence, Kan., from Miller Broadcasting
Inc., officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps acquired KMCI under revised Federal Communications
Commission rules that permit single ownership of two television
stations in the same market.
</P>
<P>
   KMCI broadcasts in the Kansas City market where Scripps operates
the NBC affiliate KSHB-TV. KMCI's signal also reaches into the
Topeka, Kan., market.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps has programmed KMCI since 1996 under a marketing
agreement with Lawrence-based Miller Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps, based in Cincinnati, also owns and operates 19 daily
newspapers; nine network-affiliated television stations; three
cable TV channels, Home &AMP; Garden Television, Food Network and Do It
Yourself; and a TV programmer, Scripps Productions. The company
also operates United Media, which syndicates and licenses news
features and comics, and Scripps Howard News Service, and publishes
independent Yellow Pages directories.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Willing To Trade Ray Bourque  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Bruins are willing to trade 18-time
All-Star Ray Bourque, who has spent his entire 21-year career with
the team, if he wanted one last chance at a Stanley Cup before
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would try to,'' assistant general manager Mike O'Connell
said Friday. ''But this (rumors of a trade) happens every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has won five Norris Trophies as the league's top
defenseman, but he has never won an NHL championship. Although he
has always said he wants to finish his career with the Bruins, that
might be changing now that retirement looms for the 39-year-old
defenseman and Boston probably will miss the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who will make $6 million this year, the final season of
his current contract, hasn't said whether he will return for
another season.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald, citing a source it did not identify, reported
Friday that Bourque ''would welcome a trade'' and that he will be
dealt before the March 14 deadline. Bourque, his agent, Steve
Freyer, and O'Connell denied that Bourque wants out.
</P>
<P>
   ''No decision has been made in that department yet,'' Bourque
told the Herald after a 5-2 loss to Montreal on Thursday night.
''Obviously when things go like this it's tough. It's not the way
you want to end the season. You like to be in the dance. Right now
we're outside looking in.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the team has approached Bourque about staying
around after he retires. But Bourque has always said he won't make
any decisions until he is finished playing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he will assume Bourque wants to remain with the
Bruins ''unless Raymond states it's going to be different.'' If he
changes his mind, O'Connell said, the team owes it to its biggest
star to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even want to comment on that, because it gives it a
whole new life,'' O'Connell said. ''But he's been an outstanding
player, and role model.''

<HEADLINE> Community Mourns Slain 1st-Grader  </HEADLINE>
By RANDI GOLDBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- In a child's scrawl, the spelling not quite
right, a poem propped on an easel near 6-year-old Kayla Rolland's
gold-trimmed white casket Friday remembered the slain first-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ''A smile so bright
</P>
<P>
   ''Eyes so light
</P>
<P>
   ''A pertty girl like you brought the sun's daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Kayla was shot to death in her elementary
school, allegedly by a 6-year-old classmate, hundreds of tearful
mourners bearing flowers, cards and stuffed animals paid their
respects during a daylong visitation Friday. A memorial service was
planned Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Messinger clutched a pink ribbon while holding his
2-year-old son tightly and handing out laminated cards with Kayla's
picture. He said he knows Kayla's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure how they're going to cope with this. I don't know
how I would,'' he said. ''They're taking it hard. You're not
supposed to lose a little one this way.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes welling, Messinger bent down, kissed his son and told
him softly, ''I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She was too young,'' said Buffy Darling, one of the first to
arrive. ''She didn't even have a chance to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla, in a red dress, lay in an open white casket with gold
trim, a small doll of the TV character Barney beneath it. In her
hands was a small card with a poem titled ''I'm free.''
</P>
<P>
   A large poster board filled with signatures and messages from
students at Kayla's school stood near the casket. ''I'm sorry this
happened,'' said many of the messages.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, mourners had brought so many flowers that some had to
be placed in another room.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, someone left a small plastic pot with yellow flowers
next to a row of shrubs. A handwritten index card taped to the pot
carried a plea: ''Please pray for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral director Donald Lada passed out pink ribbons, and said
more than 7,000 already had been pinned to lapels and tied to radio
antennas.
</P>
<P>
   James Ray, superintendent of schools in Flint, said he came on
behalf of the entire Flint school community. The district planned
to donate books in Kayla's memory to Buell Elementary School, which
is in another district, in neighboring Mount Morris Township.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine the pain they are going through,'' Ray said.
''It hits you in the pit of your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Polacek, 20, came with 6-year-old cousin Kyle
Cornelison. She said she brought the child so he would understand
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it was sad and we talked about it a lot. I think he
understands better now,'' she said. ''It hit really close to home.
It kind of makes you think, 'Is this going to happen in our
classrooms?'''
</P>
<P>
   One mourner left near Kayla's casket a millennium edition Barbie
doll in its box, with Kayla's photo on it. ''The child who shot
little Kayla was only 6 himself, does he really understand what
he's just done?'' said a note with the memorial. ''I believe he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy has told police that it was an accident and that he
meant only to scare Kayla. The two are believed to have scuffled on
the playground the day before, with one slapping the other.
</P>
<P>
   No charges are expected against the boy, and the prosecutor -- as
well as many in the community -- has urged compassion for a child
they say was a victim of chaotic upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father is in jail and his mother was evicted from her
home a few weeks ago; the boy was staying with an uncle and another
man when he found the loaded .32-caliber semiautomatic gun.
</P>
<P>
   The other man, Jamelle James, 19, is accused of allowing the boy
access to the gun -- even twirling it in front of him -- and was
charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the ramshackle one-story house turned up a bag of
drugs, a loaded shotgun and ammunition. The boy's father, Dedric
Owens, said people at the house traded crack cocaine for guns.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his two siblings have been placed in the custody of
their maternal aunt.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani says he is loyal to Bush, downplays differences withPataki  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As is often the case in New York's
presidential primary campaigns, the local sideshow -- this time
featuring Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani --
threatened Friday to overshadow the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The front page of the New York Post was dominated by the
headline: ''AT IT AGAIN! Pataki &AMP; Rudy in backstage war over Bush
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With that going on, Giuliani went on the radio to pledge his
loyalty to George W. Bush's presidential campaign, downplaying
differences with Pataki over attacks by the New York governor on
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something that maybe some people just don't
understand. I'm a friend of John McCain,'' the New York City mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some people, they want to demand that you get
involved in negative campaigning and they question your loyalty if
you won't do it,'' the mayor added in an interview with Albany's
WROW-AM radio. ''In this particular situation, I'm extremely loyal
to Governor Bush. There is no hidden agenda ... I just happen to
have a great deal of personal regard for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in political circles that Giuliani,
running against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate,
believes McCain at the top of the GOP ticket in November is more
helpful than Bush in a moderate-to-liberal state like New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring the pot, McCain sent Giuliani a thank-you letter ''for
your extraordinary efforts to keep the tenor of the presidential
campaign in New York on a positive plane.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Your dedication to keeping on the rhetorical high road in
spite of pressure to do otherwise has been extremely courageous,''
McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping between the Pataki and Giuliani camps has clouded
the picture as Bush battles for victory in New York's GOP primary,
the big target for McCain in next week's ''Super Tuesday''
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two new statewide polls out Friday showed Bush and McCain locked
in a neck-and-neck race for the 93 delegates at stake in the New
York primary.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, those same polls showed Al Gore with
huge leads over Bill Bradley in the run-up to Tuesday's Democratic
primary. Bradley has long considered New York, where he played
Hall-of-Fame basketball for the Knicks, a must-win state.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for a fourth-quarter comeback, Bradley unveiled a
30-second television ad to run in New York City featuring former
New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch and major Knicks fan Spike Lee.
The unlikely duo touts what they see as Bradley's pluses. ''Tax
policy,'' Koch says. ''Jump shot,'' movie director Lee chimes in.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki-Giuliani contretemps was reminiscent of 1988 when
Gore, badly needing a strong showing in the New York primary to
keep his presidential hopes alive, was pushed into the background
as his top supporter, Koch, got into a verbal war with Jesse
Jackson. Gore finished third in the primary behind Michael Dukakis
and Jackson and soon left the race.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Giuliani has refused to join Pataki in criticizing
McCain and has repeatedly said nice things about the Arizona
senator.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pataki and his political allies launched an attack
against McCain, citing his Senate voting record as being ''as
anti-New York ... as anybody's in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused to allow his name to be used on a mailing to
New Yorkers criticizing McCain and he balked at attending a news
conference on Thursday with other mayors from across New York also
meant to attack McCain's voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's spokeswoman and one of his top political
advisers, said she was ''dumbfounded'' by the mayor's reticence to
join in, especially given his own campaign for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to be defending the state in the Senate, you
have an obligation to point out another senator's votes against
your interests and those of the constituency you want to
represent,'' the Pataki aide said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been chilly relations between Pataki and Giuliani
ever since the mayor crossed party lines in 1994 to endorse
then-Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki. Pataki won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani denied Friday that there was any tension between he and
Pataki and blamed the problems on ''staff members.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're united in our support of George W. Bush. We're united in
the support of my Senate candidacy,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Rise in Jobless Rate Buoys Wall St.  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 4.1
percent in February, and fewer jobseekers found work than in any
month since May. While fewer jobs is not good news to workers, the
report buoyed Wall Street investors who believed it could be the
start of a much-needed slowdown in the red-hot economy.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rallied. The Dow Jones blue-chip average gained well over
200 points in afternoon trading, and the Nasdaq index added more
than 130.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report by the Labor Department showing slower job
growth and no evidence of wage inflation calmed investors' fears
that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates sharply
to slow the economy and prevent an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, an economic indicator the markets could love,'' said
Merrill Lynch's chief economist Bruce Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   And a second report Friday also offered signs of a slowdown. The
Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories fell by a
bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in January, the steepest drop
since April. The decline was led by a huge 12.9 percent drop in
orders for electronics, the sharpest decline since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even though economists widely expect the Fed will boost rates
March 21, they said the unemployment report all but assures a
moderate move of a quarter of a percentage point, rather than a
half-point increase some feared.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has raised interest rates four times since June
to slow the economy and to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected uptick in last month's jobless rate followed
January's 4 percent rate, the lowest in 30 years. Many analysts had
predicted February's rate would hold steady.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise to many economists was the slowdown in job
growth, which has been particularly hardy in recent months. Only
43,000 workers found employment in February, a nine-month low. Most
analysts were forecasting that 228,000 workers would find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish growth in the service sector, normally an engine of job
creation in the United States, helped retrain overall job growth.
The sector added just 62,000 jobs in February, the fewest since
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Construction companies lost 26,000 jobs after posting a colossal
116,000 gain the month before aided by mild weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. job machine hiccuped in February, generating a
fraction of the new employment that had been expected,'' said Bill
Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors viewed this as the start of a slowdown in
the economy, economists were more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to call a turn in the trend, so Alan Greenspan
can't relax completely, but it's certainly the kind of report that
will help him sleep better,'' Cheney said. ''Another couple like
this for March and April and he might even put off any more
interest rate hikes for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists pointed out that job growth over the last three
months averaged a robust 245,000, a level that would be too strong
for the Fed's liking.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would need a couple of months of slower jobs growth to
make the case of a slowdown in the economy,'' said Sandra Shaber,
economist with the WEFA Group.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she
isn't concerned about the lower-than-expected 43,000 jobs created
last month. ''I think workers still feel secure about this job
market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 384,000 jobs were added to businesses' payrolls in
January thanks to better-than-normal weather in the early part of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February -- on target with most
analysts' expectations. In January, wages grew by a 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no indication that wage growth is exploding, which is
something the Federal Reserve would be on the lookout for,'' said
KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland.
</P>
<P>
   Economists always keep tabs on wage and job growth. While wage
and job gains are good developments for workers, economists and
members of the Fed worry that too-strong growth could spark
inflation. Their fear: Employers trying to attract qualified
workers will offer higher wages and benefits, forcing them to boost
the price of their products and thus setting off higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In February, 33,000 workers found jobs in the retail industry
with the largest gains in department and furniture stores.
Manufacturers, which lost 248,000 jobs last year, added 5,000 jobs
reflecting big gains in electrical equipment, automobile production
and industrial machinery.

<HEADLINE> Corrosion Cited in N.Y. Plant Leak  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- Highly pressurized, superheated water that
corroded a nickel-alloy tube from the inside was probably what
caused a radioactive leak at the Indian Point 2 power plant last
month, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan emphasized that an official finding
is weeks away and ''there are other pieces of that puzzle that we
still have to look at.'' But based on a videotape from a
remote-controlled camera sent into the tube, ''it's probable that
this was stress corrosion cracking,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An amount of radioactive steam too small to be measured escaped
into the atmosphere Feb. 15, when radioactive water from one of the
reactor's 13,000 tubes contaminated the clean water that is turned
to steam to drive turbines. There were no injuries at the plant 35
miles north of New York City, but it was the worst accident its
26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   If corrosion does turn out to be the cause, it could raise
questions about the industry's inspection practices. An inspection
at the plant in 1997 showed no sign of a crack in the tube that
leaked, Con Ed said. Con Ed had gotten NRC permission to postpone a
scheduled 1999 inspection because the plant had been out of service
for part of the intervening two years.
</P>
<P>
   NRC investigators suggested at a Wednesday night meeting with
Con Ed that if the crack could appear, deepen and break open
between inspections, the inspection schedule might have to be
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   ''If necessary, we will re-evaluate our own standards,'' said
Brian Sheron, the NRC's associate director for project licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed Vice President Stephen Quinn said a decision on more
frequent inspections should be made on ''sound, technical
knowledge'' and should await the completion of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The water that runs through the U-shaped tube starts out in a
highly purified state, Quinn said. But because it is heated to 500
degrees and pressurized to 2,200 pounds per square inch, it can put
stress on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan noted that the leak occurred in the bend of the tube,
whose walls are just one-20th of an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wanted to have it as thin as possible to get a good
transfer of heat,'' he said. Planners thought the material would
hold up well in the high heat and pressure, he said, ''but they
have been more susceptible to corrosion than initially was
believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Impurities in the water can make corrosion more likely, the
experts said. But James Riccio, senior analyst at Public Citizen in
Washington, said the alloy used in the tubes can develop stress
problems even when exposed to pure water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem isn't the water,'' he said. ''The problem is Con
Ed has water-soluble steam generator pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lochbaum, nuclear safety engineer for the Union of
Concerned Scientists in Washington, said that if the current
inspection finds other tubes have been corroded and stressed, they
should be replaced.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Town Seeks Best Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By JERRY SCHWARTZ, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- This old-line manufacturing center, a
union town where they like to vote for Kennedys, isn't the kind of
place where you might expect any kind of a groundswell for a
self-described conservative Republican from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But in just three days, 187 Democrats changed their party
registration -- evidently, so they could vote for John McCain in
next Tuesday's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state, about 30,000 Democrats changed their
registration before the Feb. 16 deadline. More than half of
Massachusetts' voters are unenrolled, or independent, and can vote
in either party's primary. Indications are, many will vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the first person, really, who made me want to unenroll,''
says city clerk David Rushford. He is 44, a Democrat since he was
18. Rushford says McCain ''conjures up my parents' experience as
Depression babies, World War II soldiers. ... It has to do with us
looking for a new hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Americans, people in Worcester will tell you
character counts for a lot. They yearn for a politician who's ...
different.
</P>
<P>
   It is the impulse that has prompted Democrats and independents
to turn out in force for GOP primaries in New Hampshire, South
Carolina and Michigan -- three states that had record voter turnouts
-- to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It is the impulse that has drawn people in recent years to Texas
billionaire Ross Perot, and to the pitchfork brigade of Patrick
Buchanan. It is the reason Minnesota chose Jesse Ventura, a chief
executive who once committed body slams for a living.
</P>
<P>
   It does not have to do with issues like abortion, where many of
these voters may differ with McCain. ''If you could tell me a voter
who was genuinely interested in issues in the past two elections,
I'd like to meet him,'' Rushford says.
</P>
<P>
   McCain must continue attracting Democrats and independents, as
well as the support of moderate Republicans, to fare well in a
batch of primaries Tuesday that could set the fate of his challenge
to the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Over morning coffee at the Honey Dew doughnut shop, John
Tibbetts says his appeal is simple: ''Bush is a regular politician
and McCain is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibbetts is angry because he will not be able to vote for
McCain. He and his wife Ann recently moved to Worcester from Gray,
Maine; somehow, in transit, these lifelong Republicans were
recorded as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't had as much interest in a candidate since John
Kennedy. What he says, I believe,'' says Tibbetts, a retired
telephone installer.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Novak agrees. ''I like the guy as a guy's guy -- you know
where he stands,'' he says. It is lunch now, and Novak and two
buddies -- David Brunelle and Joe Dalimonte -- are sitting on the
benches in the window of the Owl Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the three white-shirted financial advisors, all of
them Republicans, come to this old-fashioned tobacconist's shop on
Main Street to smoke cigars and ''discuss the issues of the day,''
says Dalimonte.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of this has to do with your other choices. When your
other choices are Al Gore and George W., it's a lot easier'' to
support McCain, Novak says.
</P>
<P>
   Dalimonte brings up the controversy over Bush's speech at Bob
Jones University, a South Carolina school associated with
anti-Catholic sentiments (do not underestimate the damage in an
Irish Catholic city like Worcester). ''He says now he regrets it.
That's a typical politician. After the fact, he's already gone. Why
not do it when you're right there?''
</P>
<P>
   There are Democrats in Worcester, many of them, who have little
use for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton did a hell of a good job for us,'' says Arthur Hart, a
retired steelworker and Gore man who is drinking at VFW Post 3657.
People support McCain because ''they just don't want to see Bush
get in.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Greendale fire station, Lt. Jim Trumble says most of the
men are for Gore, who touched their hearts with his remarks at the
memorial service for six firefighters killed in a December
warehouse blaze.
</P>
<P>
   He does not buy the idea that Americans want a heroic president.
''If they're looking for heroes, they would not have voted for Bill
Clinton. I think heroism is not a factor in an election. They're
looking for a new face, a new idea.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campus of Clark University, most students don't seem to
be looking, at all. ''Is McCain a Republican?'' one young woman
asks, blankly.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Took and Pamela Mulready, two seniors, are registered
voters. But they are unsatisfied with their choices and agree that
McCain, though unusual, is still basically a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Took says Americans are so hungry for real choices that they
would vote for anyone: ''If Bill Cosby ran, they'd vote for him! We
could have an actor as president!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she's just 21, too young to remember that it's
already happened.

<HEADLINE> U S West Threatens Quest With Suit  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Denver-based Baby Bell, is
threatening to sue merger partner Qwest Communications Inc. if it
backs out of their $40 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, which agreed to acquire U S West last July, reportedly
has been holding merger discussions with Deutsche Telekom AG. Qwest
chief executive officer, Joseph P. Nacchio, also was quoted in
newspapers Friday making comments that indicated the U S West deal
may not be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Roellig, general counsel of U S West, sent a fiery letter
to Qwest general counsel Drake Tempest on Friday, claiming Qwest
was ''in clear violation of our merger agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, U S West threatened to sue Qwest for damages
beyond the $800 million break-up fee in the merger contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such damages would very likely make the Pennzoil judgment pale
in comparison,'' Roellig wrote, referring to $10.53 billion jury
award against Texaco Inc. for using unethical tactics in trying to
break up the merger between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ultmately, the case was settled in 1988, and Texaco paid $3
billion to Pennzoil Co.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Denver-based Qwest was in a meeting and not

   When U S West and Qwest first announced their deal, they
promised to create a powerful communications company with customers
in 14 states, and an aggressive Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, Philip Anschutz, Qwest's largest shareholder,
was persuaded to support a deal with Deutsche Telekom after a
meeting with the German company's chairman Ron Sommer, according to
The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse of a deal with Qwest would be especially shocking to
U S West executives because Qwest wanted to acquire U S West so
badly last year that it launched a bidding war to break up a merger
agreement between U S West and Global Crossing Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of U S West were up $4.56\ at $75.31\ in afternoon
trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, where Qwest's stock
was up $4.93} at $64.06\. Deutsche Telekom's U.S. shares were up
$1.87{ at $98.93}.

   Jobless Rate Rises in February
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 4.1
percent in February, and fewer jobseekers found work than in any
month since May. A second report today also offered signs of a
slowdown. The Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories
fell by a bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in January, the steepest
drop since April. Even though economists widely expect the Fed will
boost rates March 21, they said the unemployment report all but
assures a moderate move of a quarter of a percentage point, rather
than a half-point increase some feared. The unexpected uptick in
last month's jobless rate followed January's 4.0 percent rate, the
lowest in 30 years.

   Citigroup Changes Europe Fund Sales
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the world's biggest
financial services company, said today it would tap Germany's
growing mutual fund market by selling the funds of competitors in
addition to its own. The move brings the American giant -- parent of
Travelers Insurance and Citibank -- into direct competition with
only a small group of German banks in handling a wide variety of
different funds. New York-based Citigroup, which has 300 retail
banks in Germany, plans to launch the service in May, offering 400
different funds from 14 different investment companies, spokesman

   DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. auto sales were up 12 percent in February,
with broad gains for many models of cars, pickups, minivans and
sport utility vehicles. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate
for the month was just under 19 million light vehicles, second only
to September 1986, when the rate briefly jumped to 21 million
vehicles. The strength of the market surprised some automakers, who
had expected the demand for new vehicles to slow slightly after a

   Wal-Mart Stores Ending Meat Cutting

   JACKSONVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest
retailer, is closing meat-cutting operations at 180 stores in six
states, though a spokeswoman denied the move was related to a
successful union vote at a store here. Two weeks ago, meat workers
at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Jacksonville voted 7-3 to join the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union. This would be the first
union in Wal-Mart operations. On Monday, however, Wal-Mart told
employees in Jacksonville and its other 700-plus supercenters that
the giant retailer will switch a number of the stores to
prepackaged meat.

   Germany May Change IMF Candidate
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both the United States and Europe are
signaling that they are searching for a graceful way to resolve a
nasty dispute over who should head the International Monetary Fund.
Although the European candidate to lead the 182-nation lending
agency, German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser, received 43
percent of the votes in an informal straw ballot by the IMF's
executive board yesterday, no candidate received the necessary
majority. Moreover, countries representing 36 percent of the IMF's
voting shares, a group that includes the United States, abstained
from the balloting. Germany signaled for the first time today that
it was ready to start looking for another European candidate who
could win U.S. support.

The talks are aimed at preserving their central role in

discussions. But the combination of the two markets' trading
systems is unlikely, said Bernard Madoff, head of Madoff

   Japan Says Debt Is Inevitable
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Weeks before Japan announces fiscal 1999 year-end
national debt statistics, the Finance Ministry said today that
maintaining a record-high amount of outstanding bonds will be
inevitable under current economic conditions. Japan had nearly
$3.35 trillion in outstanding government bonds -- more than any
other nation -- as of Sept. 30, 1999, the most recent Finance
Ministry figure. New data will be released on March 24. As a result
of heavy borrowing, Japan, the world's second-richest country
behind the United States, is also among the world's most indebted.
The ministry said its total debt forecast for 1999 exceeds $5.6
trillion.

<HEADLINE> Croat General Sentenced to 45 Years  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Handing down their harshest
punishment yet, U.N. judges sentenced a Croat general on Friday to
45 years in prison for atrocities committed by his soldiers during
the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict against Gen. Tihomir Blaskic reflected a bullish new
approach at the Yugoslav tribunal on the issue of command
responsibility, which has vexed war crimes prosecutions since the
Nuremberg trial of Nazi leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic, who commanded Bosnian Croat militia during the 1992-95
war, was found guilty Friday of war crimes, crimes against humanity
and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the protection
of noncombatants.
</P>
<P>
   He was the 14th suspect convicted at the tribunal but only the
first top military commander. The U.N. court has handed down
sentences against suspects from all sides of the Bosnian war since
its establishment in 1993 -- including prison camp commanders and
guards, and paramilitary fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel found Blaskic responsible for ordering an
''ethnic cleansing'' campaign against Muslim villages in the Lasva
River Valley, northeast of Sarajevo, which left hundreds of Muslims
dead and sent thousands more fleeing the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''The acts of war carried out with disregard for international
humanitarian law and in hatred of other people -- the villages
reduced to rubble, the houses and stables set on fire and
destroyed, the people forced to abandon their homes, the lost and
broken lives -- are unacceptable,'' said French judge Claude Jorda,
president of the tribunal, summing up the verdict after a 25-month
trial with 158 witnesses and about 30,000 pages of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Blaskic had argued that although he ordered
military operations he never ordered any atrocities, and that he
was dealing with ''poorly trained recruits'' in a new army with an
inchoate command structure.
</P>
<P>
   However, the judges ruled that the court ''has more evidence
than it needs to note that the chain of command was operating
satisfactorily.''
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors found solace in the verdict. One was Sulejman
Pezer, 60, of Ahmici, where paramilitaries under the general's
command slaughtered more than 100 men, women and children at
daybreak on April 16, 1993, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied, our souls are satisfied, even though it can't
be compensation for what we lost,'' Pezer said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the United States believes the verdict ''shows the progress that
the international tribunal is making in bringing justice to the
victims of war crimes in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Croatia complained that Blaskic, who voluntarily came to the
tribunal in 1996 to prove his innocence, was the victim of a
miscarriage of justice and welcomed an announcement by the defense
of an appeal. When Blaskic was indicted, Croatia responded by
making him a general in its regular standing army.
</P>
<P>
   In an important legal finding, the court ruled that Blaskic was
implementing policies formulated at the highest levels of the
Croatian government, making the Croat-Muslim conflict in Bosnia an
international conflict. The finding mirrors an earlier judgment
that confirmed Yugoslavia's involvement in the war on the side of
Bosnian Serbs
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes at a sensitive time in Croatia's cooperation
with the tribunal, with the newly elected government promising to
end years of stonewalling on extradition requests and granting
investigators access to war crimes sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian premier registered his dismay that key Bosnian
Serbs, including wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and military chief
Radko Mladic, remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry to see that the biggest war criminals from Bosnia
have not yet been brought to The Hague,'' Prime Minister Ivica
Racan said. ''When that happens, we will be able to give an overall
opinion on the Hague tribunal's work.''

<HEADLINE> Judge rules that Brennan improperly tried to shield $187,000  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A state judge ruled Friday that one-time
penny stock tycoon Robert E. Brennan improperly tried to shield
$187,000 from being used to compensate aggrieved investors.
</P>
<P>
   The money was placed in a retirement account last year, several
months before Brennan was to go on trial on state stock fraud
charges, in order to prevent it from being used to satisfy any
judgment, Superior Court Judge Philip M. Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement funds are normally immune from judgments, but not
when deposited to evade them.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who believe Brennan cheated them might may have to
wait for their cut, however.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman gave Brennan 20 days to get the order halted by an
appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   And Brennan lawyer Gerald H. Gline said that if the fund is
ultimately forfeited, it would be diminished by taxes and
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came as part of efforts by state prosecutors to find
and grab Brennan's assets on behalf of investors state regulators
believe he swindled.
</P>
<P>
   The collection efforts are the latest chapter in a 15-year saga
in which state and federal regulators have repeatedly sued him. The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission barred him from the
securities industry in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 56, became nationally known in the 1980s through
television commercials for his First Jersey Securities Inc. in
which he stepped from a helicopter and told investors to ''come
grow with us.'' The company has been inactive since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He declared bankruptcy in 1995, soon after a federal judge in
New York ruled that he cheated First Jersey investors and ordered
him to pay what is now more than $78 million to the SEC. The money
would go to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan avoided a trial on the state's lawsuit last year by
agreeing to pay $45 million to compensate investors. He denied
wrongdoing, but consented to a finding that he used ''substantial
influence'' at two brokerages to make ''unreasonably excessive
profits'' in low-cost stocks in which he held an undisclosed
interest from 1988-95.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also called for the state to get $55 million for
investors from Brennan's businesses, which are under the control of
a bankruptcy trustee.
</P>
<P>
   To begin paying off the $45 million, Freedman last year ordered
Brennan to pay one-fourth of his income, after business expenses.
That had amounted to $3,000 a month, a rate that would not retire
the debt for 1,250 years.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan recently took a pay cut that has reduced his monthly
payment to about $2,375 a month, according to figures from state
Deputy Attorney General Anna M. Lascurain.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan now earns $150,000 a year to attract members for a
private golf club at his former horse farm in Colts Neck, Due
Process Stables. He once lived in nearby Brielle, but now lives in
Juno Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, what he does is wine and dine people to join his
club, which I understand is very expensive,'' Freedman commented
during the hourlong proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, who was acting as his own attorney on other matters at
the hearing, noted that the bankruptcy court trustee is the
effective owner of Due Process.
</P>
<P>
   He also used the hearing to rebuke state prosecutors for
claiming, in court papers filed this week, that he attempted to
hide a half-million dollars he got from cashing chips at the Mirage
casino in Las Vegas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan claimed the matter had been ''examined in minutia'' four
years ago and was only raised ''to smear and embarrass me.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate, and walked away from reporters after the
hearing without commenting.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Backing IMF Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- European nations refused Friday to give up on
their German candidate to head the International Monetary Fund,
even though he failed to win crucial U.S. support in an informal
poll of the IMF's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   However, there also were signs -- even from Germany -- that the
Europeans may yet look for a new candidate as they discuss how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, which currently chairs and speaks for the 15-nation
EU, said the group still backs Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy
finance minister, after he finished first in Thursday's vote by the
IMF executive board but fell short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have endorsed the German candidate and we are still in that
phase,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said in Brussels,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser won the most support of three candidates, but more
than a third of the IMF board abstained, including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says it wants to stick to the tradition that the
IMF post goes to a European, but does not believe Koch-Weser has
enough experience or political clout. President Clinton has urged
the EU to nominate someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Germany still backs Koch-Weser, government spokeswoman Charima
Reinhardt said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres discussed the IMF debate by telephone
Friday, government officials said, and were to meet Saturday in
Oporto, Portugal, for more discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But a top aide to Schroeder, while calling the result of the
vote ''encouraging,'' hinted that Berlin, which pushed its European
allies to back Koch-Weser, might now consider a non-German
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also have to show solidarity toward our European partners
now,'' Michael Steiner, Schroeder's foreign policy adviser, said on
ARD television. ''Only together can we turn this first success into
a full success.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder praised Koch-Weser's first-place finish, with 43
percent, then added: ''I now assume that a common result with the
USA and Japan is achievable.'' He did not specify if that meant
Koch-Weser or another European.
</P>
<P>
   France, which overcame initial reluctance to back Koch-Weser
after heavy lobbying by Germany, said it would back the candidate
Europeans agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   ''My country has supported the European consensus on an IMF
candidate and will maintain the same attitude,'' Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said after EU foreign ministers met with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Albright made plain that Washington is waiting for the Europeans
to make up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States wishes to support a consensus European
candidate who is the most capable of leading this highly important
financial institution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan may withdraw its candidate, former finance ministry
official Eisuke Sakikibara, the Nikkei news service said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sakikibara received 9 percent of the vote in Thursday's straw
poll. The other candidate, acting IMF chief Stanley Fischer, a
naturalized American, received 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the United States would not support Fischer,
who was nominated by a group of African nations.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Rescuers Race To Help  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIBUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The water level in the flooded
Limpopo River valley dropped unexpectedly Friday, freeing thousands
of people who were marooned for days in trees and on rooftops
during Mozambique's worst flooding on record.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers have saved more than 12,000 people from the
floodwaters. But tragedy struck the rescue effort Friday when a
boat capsized, drowning four children. And in refugee camps, many
people went hungry for yet another day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect the floods' death toll to run into the
thousands, and the collection of corpses has been hampered by a
shortage of body bags. Aid officials said those stuck in trees were
being driven by hunger and thirst to eat the carcasses of drowned
animals and drink filthy floodwater, putting them at risk for
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The four children died after an inflatable boat carrying 17
refugees hit a tree and flipped over, said the boat's pilot, Peter
Britz.
</P>
<P>
   Britz and 13 others clambered up a tree and got a taste of what
thousands of people have endured since huge swaths of central and
southern Mozambique were flooded by torrential rains last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are snakes in the trees, stinging ants, wasps and lots
of mosquitos,'' Britz said after rescuers ferried him and the
others to safety hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people have been sitting in the trees all these days
with these things crawling on them and biting them,'' Britz said.
''I didn't realize what they were going through until I got stuck
in a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate 1 million people need food, medicine and
other aid throughout Mozambique. Getting it to them is a logistical
nightmare, with many areas still accessible only by air.
</P>
<P>
   At a refugee camp outside the southern town of Chibuto, scenes
of misery blended with a determination to persevere Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost my home, my crops of maize and beans, and 14 goats,''
says Antonio Bila, a grizzled 58-year-old farmer. ''But I've still
got my plow.''
</P>
<P>
   Once delivered to safety, many refugees remained hungry.
Millions of dollars in aid pledged from abroad has begun arriving
in Mozambique, but distribution problems seemed to be common.
</P>
<P>
   Local aid officials were doling out cornmeal soup to some of the
Chibuto camp's 1,500 flood victims while ignoring many others,
refugees told a reporter. One of those who went without was Anastas
Macele, who lay in the dust, semiconscious from exhaustion and
hunger, not far from a huge pot of simmering soup.
</P>
<P>
   Mathias Chauke, whose wife Gina lay in the shade of a tree, too
weak to move, repeatedly went to the aid officials with his empty
food bowl and was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not giving us anything to eat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A local relief official, Agostino Lumbele, said all the camp's
occupants would be fed by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   Supply didn't appear to be a problem. Several large bags of corn
flour from the U.N.'s World Food program lay in a food depot, along
with vegetable oil from the U.S. Agency for International
Development and cases of canned sardines. More food was being
offloaded from helicopters a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Rescues in the Limpopo valley had been expected to take three or
four more days, and the receding floodwaters came as a welcome
respite for weary crews. Lt. Col. Jaco Klopper, commander of the
South African air force's rescue operation, said Friday that rescue
workers thought most people caught by the Limpopo flood had been
moved to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will send out three aircraft (Saturday) to comb the area to
make sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The air force pilots who have been the backbone of the rescue
operations have earned widespread respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South Africans ... are real heroes,'' Mozambican Foreign
Minister Leonardo Simao said. ''It is touching to see this
solidarity unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican officials, meanwhile, said U.S. troops expected to
arrive in Mozambique soon were likely to be based in the central
city of Beira. U.S. Embassy officials declined to say where the 600
U.S. soldiers being sent from Europe along with helicopters and
other rescue gear would be based or when they would arrive.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Radio Stations Sold Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A holding company buying five southeast
Nebraska radio stations will sell those stations to a Monterey,
Calif., broadcasting company.
</P>
<P>
   Triad Broadcasting Co. is buying the stations from JC
Acquisition, a Wyoming holding company, for $12 million, through a
Triad subsidiary, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The stations are Lincoln's KEZG, KFGE, KKUL -- all FM stations --
as well as KLIN and Beatrice's KWBE, both AM stations.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Combs, general manager for KFGE and KOOL, said the
transaction will probably be final in April. He expects few
differences in format or staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Norton Warner, president of Warner Enterprises and
Community Media Inc., announced the stations' sale to JC
Acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's family owned and operated radio stations in the Lincoln
area for 28 years. Warner said he and his family decided to sell
the stations in order to pursue other business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   JC Acquisition, the holding company that purchased Warners'
assets is a Wyoming business owned by the Skull Valley Band of
Goshute Indians of Utah. Diversified Group Inc. of New York manages
the company.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Leader Vows More Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBA-YURT, Russia (AP) -- In the wake of a bloody ambush on
Russian troops in a city the Russians claim to control, a Chechen
rebel leader said Friday that more guerrilla attacks are coming.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush of a column of Interior Ministry troops in Grozny,
Chechnya's capital, killed or wounded dozens. It also demonstrated
that Chechen rebels, although weakened by months of bombing,
shelling and ground battles, are still able to penetrate Russian
lines and launch assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Baultdin Bakuyev, a Chechen field commander, said it was his
fighters who launched Thursday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the beginning of a guerrilla war,'' he told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose popularity ahead
of March 26 presidential elections is believed to be largely a
result of his tough stance against rebels, lashed out at Russian
commanders after the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is the degree of competence of the people who
organize the movement of servicemen in Chechnya,'' he said during a
campaign trip to the city of Surgut, according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The troops hit in the Thursday ambush were part of an Interior
Ministry riot police unit sent to Grozny after the Russian army
claimed to fully control the city on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels attacked with machine guns and grenades as the
nine-truck Russian convoy traveled to replace troops at a guard
post in Staropromyslovsky district, on Grozny's northwestern
outskirts, the military command's press center said. The battle
lasted four hours, survivors told Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was uncertain. The ITAR-Tass news agency cited a
regional military official as saying 37 people were killed and 12
wounded, but later quoted Deputy Interior Minister Col. Gen. Ivan
Golubev as saying 20 were killed and 29 wounded. Col. Gennady
Melnik, an Interior Ministry spokesman in Moscow, said he knew of
only 18 confirmed deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who is leading the Kremlin's media
campaign on Chechnya, said the policemen were attacked by rebels
''from well-protected firing points.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The factor of surprise played a large role,'' he said, and the
attackers were able to flee because they had mined their escape
route.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops continued to battle rebels in
Chechnya's southern mountains. Russian warplanes and helicopters
had flown more than 90 combat missions over the past 24 hours in
the Argun Gorge region, where the rebels retreated this week after
leaving their last major stronghold, the town of Shatoi.
</P>
<P>
   A large contingent of federal troops was concentrated near
Duba-Yurt, at the northern end of the gorge. Heavy artillery
bombarded suspected rebel positions in Argun Gorge villages as well
as spots to the east and west sides of the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing that 1,420 Russian soldiers
had been killed and 3,896 wounded in battle since Oct. 1. The
casualty figures included the policemen killed Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts and soldiers' rights advocates have
questioned official casualty figures, accusing the military of
covering up much greater losses.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground forces into Chechnya in late September after
Chechnya-based Muslim fighters invaded the neighboring republic of
Dagestan. Russian authorities also blamed the Chechen rebels for a
series of apartment building bombings in Russia that killed some
300 people.

<HEADLINE> Delta Ramp Workers Reject Union  </HEADLINE>
BY JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Baggage and cargo workers at Delta Air Lines
voted overwhelmingly not to join a union, handing the nation's
third-biggest and least-unionized carrier a major victory Friday in
a campaign both sides had portrayed as crucial to the airline's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Only 17 percent of Delta's 10,700 ramp and cargo workers voted
to organize.
</P>
<P>
   ''The employees have demonstrated their support for Delta and
for the continued partnership for Delta and Delta people,'' company
spokesman John Kennedy said. ''And that partnership works best
without a third-party intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers at the Transport Workers Union said they were
disappointed by the lopsided vote, which they attributed to a pay
raise the company announced in January. Younger ramp workers stood
to receive raises of up to 15 percent. Raises for other workers
ranged from 3 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We definitely thought it would be much closer,'' said Clyde
McAllister, a ramp worker and organizer at Delta's Dallas-Fort
Worth hub. ''It just shows that some people can be bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta had mounted an aggressive campaign to defeat the effort.
In October, 107 ground pilot training instructors voted to join the
TWU; about 200 Delta flight dispatchers belong to another union.
</P>
<P>
   The company's only large-scale union history is with pilots, who
organized 60 years ago. That group became part of the current Air
Line Pilots Association, which represents 9,300 Delta pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The company contends that more unions would limit its
flexibility and employees' job mobility, and would erase a 7
percent across-the-board cost advantage Delta claims to have over
more-unionized competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Delta said its ramp and cargo workers -- who earn from
$19,000 to $44,000 annually -- already earn wages at the industry's
top end.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the raise, which they classified as a desperate,
last-minute pitch to coerce votes, derailed their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new management system there is putting little pieces of
candy all over the place,'' said McAllister, a 31-year Delta
veteran. ''But people need to realize that without a contract to
protect themselves in this day and age, you've got no
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   TWU organizer Jeff Osborne, a ramp worker for American Airlines,
said the union would consult its attorneys about whether to pursue
legal action about the airline's campaign. He said workers had been
questioned about their vote, intimidated, harassed and that the pay
raise amounted to a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the raise had been under development for months and
had ''absolutely and emphatically'' no connection with Delta's
drive to ward off unionization.
</P>
<P>
   The unionization effort comes after several years of management
upheaval following the departure of former chairman and chief
executive Ronald Allen in 1997. Longtime employees grumble that a
former collegial spirit between management and labor had been
destroyed by an era of strict cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ''But since that covenant was broken, the board of directors
recognized it. They stepped in and have been doing something about
it,'' said Candace Browning, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said the vote would not affect the transport union's
efforts to organize Delta's 11,000 mechanics or 20,000 flight
attendants.

<HEADLINE> Support for U.S. Fugitive in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP) -- The lawyer for Ira Einhorn said Friday
he has been assembling backers to oppose his client's extradition
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Dominique Delthil said 50 people have signed a petition
saying they don't want to see Einhorn extradited. Delthil said he
has met with an adviser to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to lobby
for Einhorn, who was arrested in France in 1997 and faces retrial
in Philadelphia in the murder of his girlfriend 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   France's high court threw out an appeal by Einhorn last May,
leaving it up to Jospin to decide whether to sign an extradition
decree.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a political phase now. It's Jospin's decision, not
the courts,'' Delthil said at the news conference with Einhorn, who
is free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn, a 59-year-old former counterculture guru, fled the
United States in 1981, shortly before he was scheduled for trial in
a Pennsylvania court. He was sentenced in absentia to life in
prison for killing Helen Maddux in 1977. Her corpse was found
stuffed in a trunk in a closet at his Philadelphia home.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn and his wife, Annika Flodin Einhorn, live near Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Many French people were shocked Wednesday by the execution in
Texas of condemned killer Odell Barnes, who continued to profess
his innocence until his death. Delthil compared his client's case
to Barnes', saying there was ''something rotten'' about the U.S.
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn spoke only briefly, saying all the people imprisoned in
the United States are ''in his heart.''

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures registered mild price
gains Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade for a second straight
day.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices topped the mini-rally, rising when large commercial
funds took ownership of corn from the March contract. But volume
was thin and there was resistance to sending prices sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans edged higher in carryover from Thursday and in sympathy
with a strong rise in soyoil prices. New rumors surfaced of
possible U.S. soybean exports to China.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices were flat, with early selling by funds countering
any tendency to rise in lockstep with other farm commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was unchanged at $2.58\ a bushel; May
corn rose 1{ cent to $2.25{ a bushel; May oats rose \ cent to
$1.18{ a bushel; May soybeans rose 2{ cents to $5.13 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dispatching Envoy to Sudan  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is dispatching a
senior official to Sudan this weekend in what could signal a shift
away from its longstanding policy of trying to weaken the Islamic
regime there by isolating it.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Johnston, a former Democratic congressman from Florida who
was appointed special envoy for the war-torn country last August,
plans a four-day stay in Khartoum starting Saturday in which he
will talk with Sudanese both inside and outside government.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first high-level visit by a U.S.
official since President Clinton in August 1998 ordered a military
strike against a phamaceutical plant in Khartoum that was believed
to have been producing material for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   One deterrent to a trip by Johnston before now was a
recommendation by the State Department diplomatic security bureau
that Khartoum was too dangerous for a U.S. official to visit.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is now making an assessment on to whether it would be
safe for the United States to have a ''near continuous presence''
in Sudan after an 18-month period in which U.S. diplomats have
stayed away from Sudan because of security concerns, State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Johnston, who chaired the House International
Relations Committee's subcommittee on Africa as a member of
Congress, has a three-item agenda in his talks with Sudanese
officials.
</P>
<P>
   He will discuss ways of encouraging Sudan authorities to
participate more constructively to end Sudan's 30-year civil war,
press for greater protection of human rights and seek reliable
access for the delivery of humanitarian supplies, Rubin said. He
added that Johnston met recently with leaders of Sudan's rebel
movement in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Cohen, a former assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, sees the Johnston visit to Khartoum as a move toward
deeper engagement with Sudan. He said the administration may be now
embracing the view of humanitarian aid groups that the best way to
end the suffering in Sudan is to end the war, a goal that, he said,
can best be achieved if Washington becomes directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by James Bishop, a former U.S. ambassador to
Liberia who is now an analyst for Inter-Action, the umbrella
organization for numerous humanitarian assistance groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world needs to take a fresh look at this conflict and to
make a serious effort to try to see it resolved,'' he said. Over
the past 17 years, an estimated 2 million Sudanese are believed to
have died in the conflict, more than twice the number of all
war-related deaths suffered by Americans since 1776.
</P>
<P>
   The war basically involves the Muslim north against the black
African south, which practices traditional and Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, events seem to have weakened the hand of those
advocating an isolationist policy. In a power struggle, President
Omar el-Bashir has gained the upper hand over Islamist ideologue
Hassan Turabi, who headed the now-dissolved parliament. This has
enabled Sudan to project a somewhat more moderate image to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   European nations have been seizing on this development to
encourage the Clinton administration to become more deeply engaged
with Sudan, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army
alienated many supporters in the United States and elsewhere by
demanding that international relief agencies sign an agreement with
the SPLA or leave the country by this week.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the staffs of 11 aid agencies left the country
although it is not clear what the impact on aid recipients in the
southern region will be, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The SPLA demands undercut advocates in the administration and
the Congress for providing direct food aid to the rebels, a step
authorized by Congress late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the amendment, Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., has
said that providing food aid to the rebels would ''feed starving
people standing for democracy who want nothing more than to live in
peace, free from slavery, civilian bombing, government-manufactured
famine, and the worst forms of religious persecution.'' Efforts to
reach Brownback for comment this week were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts noted that the State Department's annual human
rights report, released last week, said that the SPLA, like the
government, was guilty of egregious rights violations as well,
including the killing of ''large numbers of civilians'' and the
''indiscriminate'' laying of landmines on roads and paths, leading
to the deaths of soldiers and civilians.

<HEADLINE> Chiquita Brands Reorganizes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Chiquita Brands International Inc., which lost
millions of dollars in 1999, said Friday it is reorganizing its
administration in an effort to boost sales and streamline service
to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Management said it is consolidating its banana and other fresh
produce businesses into a single ''Chiquita Fresh'' organization
for North America and Europe. The company hopes to pursue business
opportunities with Chiquita Fresh in the Far and Middle East. The
company is also streamlining management of its Chiquita Processed
Foods unit.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita Fresh will be led by Robert F. Kistinger, who has been
president of the Chiquita Banana Group. He will report to Steven
Warshaw, Chiquita's president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting to Kistinger and leading the Chiquita Fresh
organization in Europe will be Peter Horekens, who has been
president of Chiquita's European banana business, headquartered in
Antwerp, Belgium. Kistinger will lead the North American Fresh
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers want their suppliers to offer a broader product range
and year-round supplies, Kistinger said. Chiquita will rework its
operation so that sales representatives will be able to sell
bananas and other lines of fresh produce.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita reported last month that it lost $75 million, or $1.20
per share, in the fourth quarter and $49 million, or $1.01 per
share, for all of 1999. Net sales for 1999 were $2.6 billion,
compared with $2.7 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati-based company produces and distributes fresh
fruits, vegetables and processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chiquita were up 18} cents to $4.43} on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Reception Disappoints Some  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Human rights groups lamented the friendly
reception in Chile for Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Friday, noting the
former dictator seemed quite healthy despite being declared unfit
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's fooled the doctors and fooled the British authorities and
he's got a hero's welcome -- it's what we said would happen all
along,'' said Carlos Reyes of Chile Democratico, the London-based
organization of Chilean exiles, who watched Pinochet's arrival in
Santiago on television.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old general was allowed to leave Britain, where he
had been detained for 16 months, after doctors said he was too ill
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't in a wheelchair, despite all that they said about
him being ill and unable to move and that he was a broken man,''
Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pinochet got off his plane in Santiago in a wheelchair,
but quickly stood up and walked over to greet supporters and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's top law enforcement official, Home Secretary Jack
Straw, freed Pinochet on Thursday after ruling that he was mentally
unfit to stand trial on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   The former dictator, who doctors said suffered brain damage
after experiencing two small strokes last fall, had been wanted for
trial in Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland, accused of using
torture against political opponents during his 1973-90
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care
of Victims of Torture, also said Pinochet's appearance in Chile
raised doubts about the British medical team's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The medical foundation has suspected from the outset that
General Pinochet has sought to present himself in as poor a state
of health as possible in order to avoid extradition,'' Hogg said.
</P>
<P>
   French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said Friday that
Britain has agreed to review its extradition procedures in response
to discontent over Pinochet's release.
</P>
<P>
   ''British legislation has elements that we don't find in other
countries and which make extradition very difficult,'' she said at
a European Union meeting in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Other European officials expressed concern at Pinochet's
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lament how the situation has ended,'' said Javier Solana,
the EU's foreign policy representative. ''I understand the
frustration of the families of people who suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana said he hoped Chilean authorities would put Pinochet on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups also said they were disappointed by the
reaction of many Chileans, who lined the streets to cheer
Pinochet's return.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the television pictures didn't show was the grief and
distress of the relatives of the disappeared who may have lost
their greatest opportunity for justice,'' Amnesty International
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or
disappeared after Pinochet toppled an elected president in a 1973
coup.

<HEADLINE> Coke Rescinds Worker Waiver Policy  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola said Friday it won't require laid-off
workers to sign a waiver that had made them choose between
participating in a discrimination lawsuit pending against the
company or enjoying better severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver, which the company usually requires departing
employees to sign to minimize its future legal liability, left
black workers with a difficult decision because of a racial
discrimination suit filed last year by current and former black
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Signing the waiver granted workers enhanced severance benefits,
but they could not become members of a class of defendants if a
federal judge grants class-action status to the discrimination
suit. The workers also would not be able to collect part of any
future judgment if the plaintiffs win their suit.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver modification announced by Coke President Jack Stahl
pertains to all claims filed on or before Jan. 12, the date
plaintiffs filed an amended suit. The company said it would use a
new waiver reflecting the change and destroy all waivers that had
been signed.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is reducing its worldwide work force by 6,000, with 2,500
of the eliminated jobs coming from its Atlanta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to all Coke employees Friday, Stahl said the waiver
had ''contributed to confusion at a sensitive time for employees
departing our company.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal all along has been to treat departing employees with
the dignity and respect befitting Coca-Cola people and minimize any
problems, not cause more anxiety,'' Stahl wrote. ''We hope this
decision removes any confusion in this area and makes preparing for
the future easier for them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story ruled Feb. 4 that Coke could
use the waiver; plaintiffs appealed that decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Mehri, an attorney for the eight current and former
employees suing Coke, called the decision ''triumphant news'' for
black workers. About 500 workers were faced with a decision on
whether to sign the waiver, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain wade into brutal New York battle  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain and George W. Bush waded into each
other Friday in the battle for ''Super Tuesday'' delegates, with
Bush accusing McCain of shortchanging breast cancer research and
McCain charging his presidential rival was seeking to ''hijack the
campaign'' with big money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush turned to the pillars of Republican power in New York in an
effort to snuff McCain's insurgent campaign, but there was
controversy even there. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was resisting the
McCain-bashing efforts of Gov. George Pataki and other GOP state
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before Republicans vote in 13 states, there were no
signs that McCain was closing Bush's wide leads in California,
Ohio, Missouri and Georgia polls. New York was competitive and most
of New England was leaning McCain's way, but some advisers warned
privately the Arizona senator's candidacy was in jeopardy unless he
could generate fresh support this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain were ardently seeking the 101 convention
delegates at stake in Tuesday's New York election -- second-most to
California's 162.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, pummeled in new television commercials, was firing back
with a heavy telephone barrage targeting the crucial Catholic vote,
fully 46 percent of the state's GOP electorate. McCain aides
insisted the appeal was a positive one.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring the most controversy was a Bush commercial arguing that
McCain voted against breast cancer research. McCain's allies
demanded an apology, noting that McCain's sister -- Sandy McCain
Morgan -- has been diagnosed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has repeatedly voted to increase spending on
breast cancer research and the vote cited in the Bush ad was one
where he opposed putting breast cancer money in a military spending
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides rejected the criticism, and Bush himself attended an
event meant to underscore his commitment to fighting breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said the information for the ad was taken from
McCain's Web site, where the money was listed as ''garden variety
pork.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain's environmental record was under fire in a
widely run ad purchased by a private group not heard of before in
the campaign. McCain contended the effort was coordinated by the
Bush campaign, a charge Bush rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's a guy who gave waivers to 85 polluters, all of whom
gave to his campaign,'' said McCain. ''Somebody is putting in $2
million to try to hijack the campaign here in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's everything I've been fighting against,'' said McCain.
''Two million dollars in the last few days in this campaign can
make a difference in a race that is a statistical dead heat.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of the biggest prizes at stake Tuesday and the
ferocity of the fighting underscored the stakes. Polls have shown
Bush with a lead in California and Ohio -- two other ''Super
Tuesday'' prizes -- while New York is close.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers privately concede he's likely to lose
California and hope he can offset that with victories in New York,
New England and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly over-performed his poll ratings by drawing
unexpected numbers of independents and moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides were making a heavy effort to court Catholic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, McCain's calls have noted that Bush went to Bob
Jones University without quickly renouncing that school's
anti-Catholic bias. But the message was different in New York,
simply making McCain's economic pitch to a list of likely Catholic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned on Wall Street on Friday, McCain was seeking a
balance between responding to assaults and sounding his basic
campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be diverted,'' he said. ''If I've made mistakes in
this campaign it's because I've allowed myself to be diverted.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, McCain was spending a fair amount of time
responding to Bush. Rebutting the environmental accusations, Martha
Marks, head of a group called Republicans for Environmental
Protection, was at McCain's side praising his record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of the Republican candidates in this primary election, John
McCain has by far the best environmental record,'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said they'd benefit from a backlash because the ads
went over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bush campaign made a colossal mistake with these two
ads,'' said media strategist Mike Murphy. ''It the great, late
mystery smear.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York fight matched the enthusiasm of McCain's
insurgents, against the muscle of the GOP establishment, but there
were chinks in the establishment armor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Giuliani have both endorsed Bush, but Pataki has been
criticizing McCain repeatedly while Giuliani has refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some people, they want to demand that you get
involved in negative campaigning and they question your loyalty if
you won't do it,'' Giuliani said. ''In this particular situation,
I'm extremely loyal to Governor Bush. There is no hidden agenda.
... I just happen to have a great deal of personal regard for John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said voters could sort through the clutter on the last
weekend before the primary season's biggest day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people will figure it out,'' he said. ''If they don't
figure it out we will have run an honorable campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Bright Clothes a Triumph for Chanel  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON, AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Chanel's winter ready-to-wear collection was a
triumph Friday for bright young things -- and even for the not so
young.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully styled by Karl Lagerfeld, clothes danced along in a
white-silver space in the Louvre Carrousel that looked Japanese.
The clean space set off the peppy-clean clothes, from white short
furry skirts with puffy coats to dressy bright purple culotte
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Here was Chanel looking like Chanel, in some rosy tweed suits.
But there were new twists -- like the bootees with gaiters under a
lean, short and piped black and white checked coat.
</P>
<P>
   Logomania took hold, mainly in the crossed C hose and bootees.
</P>
<P>
   One original idea was the versatile use of new green denim --
especially in voluminous short skirts, shirred at the hip and
quilted at the hem. This was handsome, shown with a
huge-turtlenecked sleeveless sweater and quilted stole.
</P>
<P>
   For a seasonal Ritzy look, Lagerfeld put in lots of soft
marabout trim, looking excellent as a wrap with a beautiful
white-black windowpane check coat. A full black marabout skirt was
shown with a fancy black-gold pullover fashioned to have a
chocolate-bar effect -- a striking Chanel original.
</P>
<P>
   Glittery looks came out for evening -- elegantly young in
sparkling flower embroideries on tunics, or a short, above-knee
dress with geometric silver embroidery -- worn under a black-piped
white tweed coat.
</P>
<P>
   Colors like brick, raspberry and bordeaux kept the neat
coat-dresses and trouser suits in a peppy vein. This wasn't hip --
just fun and well-made clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Hanae Mori's collection, done with Pamela Mori, her
daughter-in-law, was a refined effort combining luxury and good
details. The flowing cashmere trouser suits with colored-braid
decor on sleeveless shell tops or trousers were admirable.
</P>
<P>
   The line here was long, with plenty of trousers and long skirts.
</P>
<P>
   A sparkling tapestry was used for a trouser leg in an ivory
pantsuit, or a short jacket in another ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny wet look snakeskin-type fabrics in green, dark crimson,
lavender in pantsuits or short skirt suits were suitably glitzy for
today's rich looks, discreet enough for the Hanae Mori touch.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot go wrong with the gorgeous georgette or chiffon
flowered wraps or kimonos flying airily over dark well-cut dresses
and trouser outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Montana showed off bold statements in leather, wool,
crepe. The beginnings looked all black, a bit dreary. But handsome
long coats, pants, a few shaggy mohair jackets, and good
craftsmanship saved clothes from the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Montana -- a mountain of success in the 1980s
-- has not shown, largely because he was bankrupt and bereft of
backers. In this, his second show since an investment group
bankrolled him, he shows that he is getting back to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Originalities in the show include lean velours trousers like
ponyskin, and a few shorts suits to offset all the long coats,
skirts, flaring pants.
</P>
<P>
   Sexier, brighter clothes came on towards the end, with red
leather minidresses and high boots, a long skirt unzipped at the
side, a ruffled, furry pullover for leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   Paco Rabanne retired from his couture business last summer, but
he's still very much in command for ready-to-wear and took a bow
for his show. Some good fitted trouser suits, and glamorous outfits
like mirror-sequin minis from the 1960s still give the Rabanne
house its creator's imprint.
</P>
<P>
   His audience wanted Rabanne's chain-mail or gleaming metal stuff
-- first created thirty-odd years ago -- and they got it. The teeny
silvery shorts with a silver fringed tunic, a slinky all-sequin
jumpsuit, a slithery silver mini for dancing were eye-catching
glitz.
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano, now a creative and sensational fixture for Dior,
also does his own line. He laid out a show at the far edges of town
that erupted into a carnival. Mambo tunes, mannequins with rooster
or ostrich disguises mixed with their clothes, cat masks and more,
all added up to a frantic moment.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rally; Dow Up 213.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied today as the government's
employment report showed some easing of the tight labor market. The
news calmed investors' fears that the Federal Reserve will push
interest rates sharply higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, while cautioning that a single good economic report
won't put an end to those worries, said investors interpreted the
news as a sign that four rate increases since last June may finally
be making an impact.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 213.99 at 10,378.91, adding to the
302-point gain already tallied this week by the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   With today's gains, the Dow is up more than 5 percent this week.
It is the first time since mid-August that the Dow has risen five
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 140.33 at 4,894.84, coasting well past its previous
closing record of 4,784.08, set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 25.06 at 1,406.82.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shot higher from the start today after the Labor
Department reported 43,000 new jobs were created in February, well
below analysts' expectations and the weakest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February. And the nation's
unemployment ticked up to 4.1 percent in February from 4 percent in
January, but it still remained at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing labor market has spooked Wall Street for
months, with many investors worrying about how continued growth
will affect businesses. Companies must offer competitive wages and
incentives to keep employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at
such low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big concern is that the economy was going to overheat and
employment was going to be one of the biggest problems,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''But we did not create nearly the number
of jobs that were expected and the unemployment rate went up.
That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rate four times since June in an
effort to slow the economy and control inflation. The jobs report
today and data released Thursday showing new-home sales plunged by
4.2 percent in January may be signaling that the Fed's actions are
having some effect.
</P>
<P>
   While most investors still believe that the Fed will likely
boost rates again soon -- maybe even at their meeting later this
month -- many now think that the hike won't be as sharp as
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The softer the economic numbers we see, the more lenient the
Fed will be,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Right now bad news is good news for this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Among industrial stocks in the Dow, DuPont rose 4\ to 51[ and 3M
rose 4[ to 90 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares also gained. IBM rose 5} to 109, Microsoft
gained 3{ to 96~ and Cisco Systems rose 4 1/16 to 136 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's sizzling initial public offering cooled a bit. Palm
Inc., a spinoff of 3Com Corp., sank 15 to 80 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 945.49 million
shares, up from 966.54 million shares on Thursday. On the Nasdaq,
advancers were ahead by a 3-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 10.56 at
594.60.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 27.38 to 1,409.14.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,715 up, 1,271 down and 527
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.14 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.18
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 13.84 to

<HEADLINE> Study: Weight Loss Benefits Health  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Overweight people who manage to lose just a
little bit of weight -- even just a pound a year -- may substantially
lower their risk of high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part, of course, is keeping the weight off. But a new
study shows that surprisingly little weight loss -- if it can be
sustained -- carries a big payoff in better health.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers looked at middle-aged people who took off a
pound a year for four years and then kept the weight off for at
least four more years. These people lowered their risk of high
blood pressure over the next 40 years by about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing, isn't it?'' said Dr. Lynn L. Moore, an
epidemiologist from Boston University. ''Even that modest amount of
weight loss makes a big difference. That's an exciting public
health message.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's findings were based on the landmark Framingham Heart
Study, which has followed the health of 5,209 residents of the
Boston suburbs since 1948. She presented the data Friday at a
meeting in San Diego of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure makes the heart work harder and is an
important underlying cause of strokes, heart attacks and kidney
disease. About 50 million Americans have high blood pressure.
Doctors have long known that too much weight is an important cause
of the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Smaha of Sayre, Pa., president of the heart
association, said the new findings show that people don't need
crash diets and big weight loss to be healthier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be able to tell my patients now that even a small
amount of weight loss can make a big difference,'' Smaha said.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Moore looked at 1,823 overweight men and women
between the ages of 30 and 65. Among them were 405 who lost 4 or
more pounds during the first four years of the study and still had
the pounds off four years after that.
</P>
<P>
   People who were between 30 and 50 when they lost the weight were
about 25 percent less likely to develop high blood pressure over
the next 40 years than were those who kept their weight reasonably
stable. The payoff was especially big for people between 50 and 65
and were significantly overweight when they took off a few pounds.
Their risk was 30 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   Those who took weight off and then put it back on did not
benefit, but they weren't harmed, either.
</P>
<P>
   Just why these people lost weight was not clear. However, Moore
speculated that it may not have been intentional. They might have
switched to more physically demanding jobs, bought houses that
required more yard work or did a variety of other things that gave
them more exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Another study by Christine L. Williams of Columbia University
showed that the ill effects of weight on blood pressure can be seen
even in the very young. She looked at 1,226 children age 2 to 5 who
enrolled in a poverty program in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 11 percent of the children had blood pressure that was
high or at the borderline. The risk of this was three times higher
in the heaviest 5 percent of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not cute for little children to be overweight and
chubby,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another study by Moore showed how overweight children may pick
up their eating habits from their parents. She found that the risk
of obesity in kids was especially high for those whose parents
fluctuated between strictly watching what they eat and going on
eating binges.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up; Nasdaq Hits Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks bounded higher today, giving Dow
industrials their best week since last July, after the government's
latest employment report showed some easing of the tight labor
market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors interpreted the report as a sign that
the Federal Reserve's four rate increases since last June may
finally be slowing the economy just enough to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 202.28 to close at 10,367.20. For the week, the
blue-chip index rose 505.08 points, its best performance since the
week ended July 2, 1999, when it rose 586.68.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, crossed 4,900 for the
first time and closed at a record high. The index rose 159.79 to
4,914.30, well above its previous closing record of 4,784.08, set
Wednesday.

Bill Painter, a trader at Federated Investors of Pittsburgh, said
portfolio managers were avidly buying shares of companies that have
been pounded down by investors' worries over interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of cash on the sidelines and some pent-up
demand to get into the market,'' he said. ''Last week opened up
some opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow plunged 357 points last week, capped by a 295-point drop
last Friday. In fact, the blue-chip index fell at least 200 points
in four of the past five Friday sessions.

<HEADLINE> U S West Threatens Qwest With Suit  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Denver-based Baby Bell, is
threatening to sue merger partner Qwest Communications Inc. if it
backs out of their $56 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, which agreed to acquire U S West last July, reportedly
has been holding merger discussions with Deutsche Telekom AG. Qwest
chief executive officer, Joseph P. Nacchio, also was quoted in
newspapers Friday implying that the deal with U S West may not be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Roellig, general counsel of U S West, sent a fiery letter
to Qwest general counsel Drake Tempest on Friday, claiming Qwest
was ''in clear violation of our merger agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, U S West threatened to sue Qwest for damages
beyond the $800 million breakup fee in the merger contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such damages would very likely make the Pennzoil judgment pale
in comparison,'' Roellig wrote, referring to $10.5 billion jury
award against Texaco Inc. for using unethical tactics in trying to
break up the merger between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the case was settled in 1988, and Texaco paid $3
billion to Pennzoil Co.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Denver-based Qwest declined to comment, as did a
spokesman for Bonn, Germany-based Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   When U S West and Qwest first announced their deal, they
promised to create a powerful communications company with customers
in 14 states, and an aggressive Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nacchio wanted to acquire U S West so badly that he
launched a hostile bidding war to break up a merger agreement
between U S West and Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based company
building an undersea fiber-optic cable network. That's why Qwest's
sudden change of heart is so bitter to U S West executives.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to employees Friday, U S West chairman, Solomon
Trujillo, ''pledged to fight for the interests of employees and
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo, who was already butting head with Nacchio, said
earlier this week that he would resign from the company after the
merger with Qwest closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio told analysts Friday that Trujillo's decision was ''in
the best interest of shareholders,'' and added, ''There's probably
lots of great opportunities (in the job market) for talented
people, and I'm sure Sol will have some.''
</P>
<P>
   In another strange twist, Qwest on Friday announced the team of
executives that would head the company when the merger with U S
West closes. The list of 17 executives included just six from U S
West.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, dismissed the gesture as a ploy on Qwest's
part.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is paying lip service but creating fear in the market that
he is willing to walk away,'' said David Brail, president and
portfolio manager for Palestra Capital, a hedge fund that owns
shares of U S West. Brail added that Nacchio is trying to force U S
West to ''take whatever deal is offered to them'' by Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, once a piece of the German post office, is
still too dependent on its home market and needs to expand in new
markets, analysts say. The company's failed attempt to acquire
Telecom Italia SpA last year has only strengthen Deutsche Telekom's
determination to succeed with its next deal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wall Street expects Deutsche Telekom to make an offer
for both companies, though the bid for U S West is not likely to be
as favorable as its current deal with Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''A deal that would be in everybody's best interest would
include both companies, given the current lay of the land,'' said
Tom Friedberg, an analyst with Janco Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's Nacchio and U S West's Trujillo are scheduled to meet
next week in Denver to discuss their merger and, presumably, any
interest from Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Under U S West's deal with Qwest, shareholders of U S West will
exchange one of their shares for 1.73 shares of Qwest's stock,
worth $111.15 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom offers a premium for Qwest's shares, which
rose $5.12{ to $64.25 Friday, analysts said there was little chance
the company would offer U S West the same 1.73-per-share exchange
ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of U S West, which had fallen 11 percent Thursday, jumped
$4.50 to $75.25 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche
Telekom's U.S. shares rose $2 to $99.06\.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Filings Down in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans who filed for
bankruptcy in 1999 fell 8.5 percent from the record high posted in
1998, federal court officials reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1.3 million federal bankruptcy petitions were filed
last year, down from the 1.44 million filed the previous year. More
than 1 million petitions have been filed each year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The data released by the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts showed that 1.28 million individuals and almost 39,000
businesses sought protection from creditors in federal bankruptcy
courts last year. In 1998, the corresponding figures were 1.44
million and over 44,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bankruptcy law provides various kinds of protection for
debtors.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy code's Chapter 7 is designed to allow individuals
to keep certain belongings while selling off other property to
repay creditors. Companies that file under Chapter 7 sell off all
assets and cease doing business.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, most filings -- 927,074 -- were filed under
Chapter 7. That was down from the 1.03 million filed under that
provision in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The code's Chapter 13 allows debtors to pay creditors in
installments, in full or in part, over a period of years. More than
376,000 individuals and 5,900 companies filed under that chapter
last year. Both figures were down from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One type of bankruptcy filing that climbed in 1999 involved
businesses that invoked the code's Chapter 11, which allowed them
to reorganize and continue operations while devising a plan to pay
off debts.
</P>
<P>
   There were 8,609 such filings last year, up from 7,524 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy code's Chapter 12, designed to meet the needs of
financially distressed family farmers, was used in 834 petitions
last year, as compared to 807 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the nation's bankruptcy capital last year was Los
Angeles, where 102,422 petitions were filed. By comparison, 44,790
were filed in Chicago and 41,247 in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Born INS Official Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official was indicted Friday on
charges of handing over U.S. secrets to a Cuban citizen and lying
about contacts with Cuban government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, has been jailed without
bond since his high-profile arrest Feb. 17 and faces arraignment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case led to the expulsion from the United States of a top
Cuban diplomat, Jose Imperatori.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal indictment, Faget was charged with communicating
national defense secrets, converting classified information to his
own use and three counts of making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Ed O'Donnell was in trial and not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview this week, Faget denied spying for the
Cuban government and said he ''would never do anything to hurt the
American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment offers little of substance beyond information
released by the FBI when Faget was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, 54, was regularly consulted about immigration cases
involving FBI informants and counterintelligence sources, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   He had secret clearance at the INS for 12 years but never
informed the agency about becoming executive vice president of
America-Cuba Inc., a company formed with New York businessman and
Cuban citizen Pedro Font to recruit trade with Cuba if the United
States lifts its trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Faget should have submitted an outside employment form
reflecting his ties to America-Cuba and Font, its president, the
indictment indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was introduced to Cuban government officials by Font, met
with them at least three times and talked to them by phone without
reporting his contacts to the FBI or INS, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   He was caught in an FBI sting Feb. 11 when he was shown secret
documents, was told ''very sensitive'' information that a Cuban
official was about to defect and then called Font 12 minutes later,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second call, Faget promised to keep Font informed while he
was traveling in China, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The false-statement counts charge Faget lied about contacts with
Cuban government officials and lied on a 1998 INS form saying he
had no foreign business connections.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Faget could face up to 35 years in prison and
$1.25 million in fines.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Wetlands Protections  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of deliberations, the Clinton
administration next week will impose tougher requirements on
developers to stem the loss of ecologically sensitive wetlands,
according to sources familiar with the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Homebuilders said Friday the new rules are unneeded and will
stall economic development, but environmentalists welcomed the
tighter restrictions, saying construction under old rules led to
the loss of thousands of acres of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers scheduled a news conference for
Monday to announce the new rules, which have been debated
internally for more than four years and were spurred by an
environmental group's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements will take effect in June, according to the
Army Corps' final draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 172-page regulatory overall will require developers to seek
special, individual permits to build if they want to fill in a
wetland of one-half acre or more. Prior to a lawsuit by the Natural
Resources Defense Council in 1996, the cutoff was 10 acres, a
standard the Army Corps later reduced to three acres.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also will end developers' use of a
streamlined ''nationwide permit'' process for most construction,
meaning that specific permits will have to be approved for each
project.
</P>
<P>
   Homebuilders have complained that this new process will delay
construction and require unnecessarily stringent review. They argue
that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form
new ones than are lost to the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mitchell, a Maryland builder who is president of the
National Association of Home Builders, predicted ''a dramatic
negative effect on the homebuilding industry'' because of delays
and more stringent wetlands protection requirements.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by a group of landowners and developers and
the National Association of Counties estimated the cost to the
economy of the new permitting process at $300 million a year.
However, the Army Corps has estimated the additional cost at closer
to $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bush administration, the government has had a goal of
having no net loss of wetlands, trying to reverse decades of
disappearing wetland acres.
</P>
<P>
   Although specific numbers are in dispute, environmentalists say
the country, nevertheless, is losing as much as 100,000 acres of
wetlands annually. They maintain a fifth of those losses have been
due to the Army Corps building permit policies.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have sought for years to abolish the so-called
nationwide Permit 26, which applies to development, including home
construction and road building, and replace it with individual
permits as the Army Corps now is going to do.
</P>
<P>
   David Rosenberg, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the nationwide permitting system amounted to giving
''rubber-stamp'' approval to construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been the single largest source of permitted wetlands
destruction in the country,'' Rosenberg said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Association of Home Builders argues that
wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands
than were lost under the nationwide permit system.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the group argues, the nationwide permitting
system has allowed for fast track approval of thousands of projects
without environmental damage. The average time to get an individual
permit approved was more than a year, compared with about a month
for the streamlined nationwide permit for construction projects,
the group estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The new reliance on individual permits, with a one-half-acre
wetlands threshold, ''means more regulations, delays and costs,
less flexibility'' for developers, said Mitchell.

<HEADLINE> Brewer Revives 'Miller Time' Theme  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Miller Time'' is back and those
celebrity-filled barroom debates about where Miller Lite gets its
flavor are out in the latest advertising for the nation's
third-best-selling brew.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign debuts later this month and carries the theme
''Grab a Miller Lite. It's Miller Time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Lite's fourth campaign in five years and is aimed at
helping sustain the sales momentum for Miller Brewing Co.'s
flagship brand that developed in the last half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The first three ads in the campaign are heavy on humor and male
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   In one commercial, a man with a metal plate in his head that is
receiving radio signals becomes the hero of his hospital ward as
the other patients tune him to the ballgame and kick open a cooler
of beer.
</P>
<P>
   In another ad, three pals desperate for ways to amuse themselves
in a deserted bar get so involved in describing what they see when
they rub their eyes that they miss the arrival and quick departure
of two stunning women. But a soda-sipping designated driver in a
third commercial gets an unexpected fringe benefit -- he gives a
ride to a group of women whose car has broken down.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign replaces a year-old ''Taste a Great Pilsner''
campaign that was modeled on the ''Tastes Great-Less Filling'' ads
from Lite's heyday in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics called the latest''Taste'' campaign a lame
imitation of the original. It featured celebrities like ex-baseball
stars George Brett and Robin Yount in good-natured debate over what
accounted for Lite's flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign helped ''get Miller Lite back on the radar screen
with consumers'' by reminding them what distinguished Lite from
other light beers, said Robert Mikulay, who was named last April as
Miller's top marketing executive in a management shakeup at the
Milwaukee-based brewer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new campaign, which comes from the ad agency Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather, ''does a better job focusing on those good times when
friends are together and Miller Lite inspires those connections.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ads ''create a stronger emotional connection for the
consumer to the brand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The approach also doesn't depend on using celebrities -- although
that is Lite ad alumnus Bob Uecker calling the game in the
''Radiohead'' commercial -- and it lends itself to using locations
outside the tavern.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth ad theme in five years for Miller Lite despite
a strong second-half sales performance in 1999 that boosted Lite
sales by 2.2 percent for the year, according to Beverage Marketers
Insights, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   That reversed a similar decline in 1998 and topped overall U.S.
beer market growth of just under 2 percent last year, the
publication said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikulay credited the improved performance to a combination of
factors that included new packaging, promotions and store displays
as well as advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no one thing that accounted for it,'' he said,
adding that ''while the turnaround has begun, we still have a lot
of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the gains, Miller Lite finished only slightly ahead of
Coors Light with 8.0 percent of the overall beer market versus 7.8
percent for the fourth-ranked brand.
</P>
<P>
   Budweiser was first at 17.5 percent of the market while Bud
Light, which dethroned Miller Lite as the top-selling light beer in
1994, was second overall at 14.2 percent in 1999, Beverage
Marketers Insights said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Miller Time'' concept was coined in the 1970s for Miller
High Life beer, but it was applied to Miller Lite for the first
time in ads that started in 1997, which featured quirky situations
created by a fictional adman named Dick.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign that used the theme ''Anything can happen at
Miller Time'' was aimed at introducing the brand to younger adult
drinkers but was criticized by Miller distributors as being
self-absorbed and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is good,'' was Lite's ad theme in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mikulay declined to say how much Miller would spend on the Lite
campaign this year but said it would be more than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Lite spent $75.5 million on advertising in the first 11
months of 1999, the latest period for which figures are available,
according to Competitive Media Reporting. That was 15.5 percent
below spending in the same period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> High sheriffs fight for their jobs  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state's high sheriffs went on the
defensive Friday, trying to shoot down legislative proposals that
would transfer their responsibilities to state agencies and put
them out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriffs said the push to abolish their elected office is
driven by public misconceptions that their system is inundated with
corruption and patronage. They blamed political grudges and
negative news stories for creating that image.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain at a loss to understand what the true issue being
addressed through the abolition of the sheriffs department is,''
New Haven County High Sheriff Frank Kinney said during a public
hearing before the Legislature's Program Review and Investigations
Committee. ''We are keenly aware of the negative publicity we have
received fueled by an unfriendly political environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gov. John G. Rowland said last year he wanted to get rid
of the high sheriffs, the system has been rocked by scandals and
embarrassments:
</P>
<P>
   --A Hartford County special deputy was charged with assaulting a
female prisoner in the Hartford Superior Court lockup.
</P>
<P>
   --The high sheriffs of Windham and New London counties have
pleaded innocent to criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   --A female prisoner was raped by male inmates while being
transported in a New Haven County Sheriff van.
</P>
<P>
   --A white special deputy in Windham County was charged with
firing shots at two black drivers in a case of alleged road rage
that crossed the border into Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The high sheriffs appoint deputies who serve legal papers such
as subpoenas and summonses. They also hire the special deputies who
guard courthouses and transport prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The bills considered by the Program Review committee Friday
would transfer the courthouse security and paper serving jobs to
the state's Judicial Branch, and would place the responsibility for
prisoner transport with the Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Judiciary Committee will hold a public hearing on
a bill which would place all the special deputy jobs under the
Judicial Department. The bill also would create a commission to
oversee and license the deputies, who would be called state
marshals.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John J. Ronan, the state's deputy chief court
administrator, said the Judicial Branch could easily absorb
oversight of courthouse security, but said prisoner transportation
would best be left to the DOC.
</P>
<P>
   Special deputies and deputies said they are worried the
Legislature will strip them of their powers of arrest. But key
lawmakers have assured them that they will still have peace officer
status.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriffs said there is no need to scrap the system, and
argued that improvements have been made. Hiring and training
standards have risen and the special deputies who are currently
paid on a per diem basis recently unionized and are bargaining for
a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any change that may be needed to provide better service to the
state can be made under the existing system,'' said Windham County
High Sheriff Tom White, who has been charged with embezzlement and
campaign fraud.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Steel Tariffs  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because American steel-makers were not harmed
by imports of an important kind of high-grade steel, tariffs will
not be imposed on the imports, the U.S. International Trade
Commission ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission rejected manufacturers' claims that Argentina,
Brazil, Japan, Russia, South Africa and Thailand drove down the
price of cold-rolled steel, a high-strength sheet metal used for
cars and major appliances, by dumping it on the American market.
Dumping is selling a product in a foreign market at a price below
the selling price at home or below the manufacturing cost.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a rare setback for the American manufacturers.
In a series of previous complaints, they had been largely
successful in arguing that they were harmed by imports discounted
to illegally low prices during the Asian economic collapse. Some
punitive tariffs already have been imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, the ITC said 'no' to these constantly complaining
protectionists who want to be able to import their own products ...
at the highest quality and best prices around the world but don't
want their customers to have the same privilege,'' said David
Phelps, executive director for the American Institute for
International Steel, which represents importers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese steel industry was so pleased with the ruling it
issued a response before the ITC announced its decision on a 5-1
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this is the beginning of the end of the
multimillion-dollar campaign by the U.S. steel industry to obtain
an effective ban on vital steel imports,'' said Hidenori Tazawa,
Chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Bethlehem Steel Corp. and LTV Steel Co.,
two of the companies that took the lead in pressing the trade case,
did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The ITC gets the last word on trade complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that feel they've been unfairly harmed by an import
file complaints with the Commerce Department, which investigates
claims and decides whether evidence of dumping exists. Once it gets
a case, the ITC decides whether a U.S. industry has been harmed and
whether penalties should be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-rolled flat carbon steel is pressed from hot-rolled sheets
into a thinner, stronger material that commands a higher price.
It's used in cars, washing machines, refrigerators and other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Imports of cold-rolled steel have declined in the year since the
steel-makers and unions put together their ''Stand Up for Steel''
campaign seeking legislative and regulatory help for the industry.
Steel-makers at one point contended imports had directly caused
about 10,000 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent steel import data reported by the Commerce
Department showed cold-rolled steel imports were down 51 percent
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The cold-rolled steel complaint was filed by Bethlehem; LTV;
Gulf States Steel of Gadsden, Ala.; Ispat Inland Inc., East
Chicago, Ind.; National Steel Corp., Mishawaka, Ind.; Steel
Dynamics, Fort Wayne, Ind.; U.S. Steel Group, Pittsburgh; Weirton
Steel Corp., Weirton, W.Va.; the United Steelworkers of America;
and the Independent Steelworkers Union.

   Jobless Rate Rises in February
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 4.1
percent in February, and fewer jobseekers found work than in any
month since May. A second report today also offered signs of an
economic slowdown. The Commerce Department said orders to U.S.
factories fell by a bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in January,
the steepest drop since April. Even though economists widely expect
the Fed will boost rates March 21, they said the unemployment
report all but assures a moderate move of a quarter of a percentage
point, rather than a half-point increase some feared. The
unexpected uptick in last month's jobless rate followed January's
4.0 percent rate, the lowest in 30 years.

inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 202.28 to close at

   McCaw Abandons Iridium Bailout Plan
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wireless magnate Craig McCaw is abandoning plans
to expand his budding satellite empire with a bailout of Iridium
LLC, the bankrupt operator of a space-based mobile phone network.
Last month, McCaw partnered with lead Iridium investor Motorola
Inc. to provide $5 million in operating cash for Iridium while
McCaw's company, Eagle River Investments LLC, weighed a bid to take
control of Iridium. Analysts had speculated McCaw would use Iridium
to build a customer base for his two future satellite ventures. But
in a statement issued today, Eagle River emphasized that Iridium
was designed primarily for voice service, while McCaw envisioned
his ventures with greater emphasis on high-speed transmission of
Internet traffic and other data.

   Bankruptcy Filings Down in 1999
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans who filed for
bankruptcy in 1999 fell 8.5 percent from the record high posted in
1998, federal court officials reported today. More than 1.3 million
federal bankruptcy petitions were filed last year, down from the
1.44 million filed the previous year. More than 1 million petitions
have been filed each year since 1996. The data released by the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts showed that 1.28 million
individuals and almost 39,000 businesses sought protection from
creditors in federal bankruptcy courts last year. In 1998, the
corresponding figures were 1.44 million and over 44,000.

growing mutual fund market by selling the funds of competitors in
addition to its own. The move brings the American giant -- parent of
Travelers Insurance and Citibank -- into direct competition with
only a small group of German banks in handling a wide variety of
different funds. New York-based Citigroup, which has 300 retail
banks in Germany, plans to launch the service in May, offering 400
different funds from 14 different investment companies, spokesman
Mirko Kaminski said. Citigroup shares were down [ at 100.

   Venezuela Oil Strike Called Off
</P>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's oil workers called off a
nationwide strike today, ending an hours-long work stoppage that
had threatened to disrupt production in the world's third-largest
petroleum exporter. International oil prices are at nine-year
highs, and analysts had said a long strike could have a further
effect on prices for gasoline and heating oil. The strike had begun
this morning, but was canceled late this afternoon. Carlos Ortega,
president of the country's largest union, said failure to suspend
it would have placed Venezuela's oil employees ''outside the law''
because of a new legislative decree.

   Delta Ramp Workers Reject Union
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Baggage and cargo workers at Delta Air Lines
voted overwhelmingly not to join a union, handing the nation's
third-biggest and least-unionized carrier a major victory today in
a campaign both sides had portrayed as crucial to the airline's
future. Only 17 percent of Delta's 10,700 ramp and cargo workers
voted to organize. Organizers at the Transport Workers Union said
they were disappointed by the lopsided vote, which they attributed
to a pay raise the company announced in January. Younger ramp
workers stood to receive raises of up to 15 percent. Raises for
other workers ranged from 3 percent to 15 percent. Delta shares
were up 3[ at 46 15/16.

   U.S. Auto Sales Up 12 Pct. in Feb.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. auto sales were up 12 percent in February,
with broad gains for many models of cars, pickups, minivans and
sport utility vehicles. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate
for the month was just under 19 million light vehicles, second only
to September 1986, when the rate briefly jumped to 21 million
vehicles. The strength of the market surprised some automakers, who
had expected the demand for new vehicles to slow slightly after a
record-setting 1999.

   Analysts Mull Palm's Stunning IPO
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Palm Inc. fell sharply today, as
investors who bought the stock on the blockbuster first day of
trading yesterday tried to cut their losses. Analysts said the
stock dropped partly because of profit-taking. But a greater number
of investors, who bought the stock at its peak on yesterday,
apparently sold their stakes to minimize damage. Several analysts
who follow the companies suggested Palm's fundamental outlook --
facing increasingly heavy-hitting competitors and a change in its
core business plan -- does not rate a high-flying stock valuation.
Palm shares were down 14 13/16 at 80\.

<HEADLINE> Whitman proposes meeting to resolve authority impasse  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman has proposed a meeting
with New York Gov. George E. Pataki to resolve an impasse that has
kept the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from approving
billions of dollars in projects for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The recent exchange of letters between the governors over the
bistate agency's stalled business began in late February, before
the last scheduled monthly meeting. Another board meeting is
scheduled on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from American and Continental Airlines, the board
last June approved $2 billion in expenses at Newark International
Airport and Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But plans to spend nearly $7 billion over the next five years
still await approval. They include money for a major expansion of
the Howland Hook Marine Terminal in Staten Island, N.Y., action
allowing private developers to take over the World Trade Center and
approval of a lease for the Maersk Sealand shipping terminal at
Port Newark-Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, who each control six votes on the Port
Authority's board, have disagreed over whether the authority spends
money fairly in both states. Pataki has said that the agency has
allocated more money to projects that benefit only New Jersey,
while New York has generated more income from Kennedy and the World
Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has argued that projects like the Maersk Sealand
shipping lease affect both states, keeping jobs in New York and New
Jersey and helping to retain the port's status as the biggest on
the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Feb. 25, Pataki wrote to Whitman, ''I have no
opposition to the Maersk transaction. I do, however, have concerns
over the large subsidy that results from this transaction and the
use of revenues generated by facilities in New York to finance this
subsidy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki urged Whitman to tell her commissioners to approve ''the
many projects that have languished for months,'' but said he
wouldn't support the Maersk lease until his concerns about the
subsidy are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Thursday, Whitman called Pataki's view that the
Maersk lease requires a subsidy on New York's part a ''misperceived
notion'' and suggested a face-to-face meeting to clear things up.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Charles Deister said Friday that Pataki hadn't
seen Whitman's Thursday letter and had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority's board, chaired by Whitman ally Lewis
Eisenberg, has met seven times in the past 14 months to approve
capital expenses. In many cases, the largest expenses, including
Maersk Sealand, have not been on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The agency operates the New York City area's three airports, the
six bridges and tunnels that link New York City to New Jersey, the
PATH commuter rail line, a New York City bus terminal and shipping
piers in New Jersey, Brooklyn and Staten Island.

<HEADLINE> US; North Korea Talks Set  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department in a memo to Congress has
expressed concern about ''possible North Korean pursuit'' of
materials needed to manufacture nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The department position was sent to House International
Relations Committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., on Feb. 15,
and a copy was made available to the Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea promised in a 1994 agreement with the United States
to freeze its nuclear facilities at two sites to prevent production
of nuclear weapons but there are no assurances that Pyongyang has
not engaged in secret nuclear weapons development activities
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The unclassified memo sent to Gilman said North Korea has
complied with its 1994 pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The document was triggered by a congressional requirement that
President Clinton ''certify'' that North Korea is acting in good
faith on nuclear and other issues in order for the Congress to
approve $15 million in assistance to Pyongyang promised under the
1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One congressionally mandated requirement called on the
administration to assert that North Korea was not developing a
capability to enrich uranium or reprocess spent nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, the memo said the evidence is inconclusive and,
in any case, judgments about North Korean intentions are difficult
to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the ambiguities, the memo said Clinton was unable to
certify that North Korea was not trying to develop a nuclear
weapons capability. It said Clinton had decided to exercise his
waiver authority on that point to ensure U.S. compliance with its
assistance commitments.,
</P>
<P>
   ''Possible North Korean pursuit of an additional capability to
produce fissile material is of concern to the United States,'' the
memo said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that former Defense Secretary William Perry, as part of
the North Korea policy review he carried out last year for Clinton,
had urged U.S.-North Korean negotiations to seek verifiable
assurances that Pyongyang does not have a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, asking not to be identified, said
it was impossible to make firm judgments about what North Korea has
been up to in the nuclear area.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration found itself unable to prove a negative,''
he said. ''And so we had to use the waiver.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been attempting to expand its dialogue
with North Korea, and a senior North Korean official is expected to
come to Washington in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said this week that the visit will be ''an
important opportunity for serious talks and progress on issues
central to peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the
Asia-Pacific region, including improving U.S.-North Korean
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-North Korean talks in preparation for the visit will be
held in New York starting on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush and McCain Close in NY  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain are in very
tight races in the New York primary and in the contest for the
overall popular vote in California, according to polls released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days before Tuesday's crucial primaries, McCain
leads in some Northeastern states, notably Massachusetts and
Vermont, while Bush is ahead in several states in other regions of
the country including Georgia, Maryland, Missouri and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has consistently held a 20-point lead among California
Republicans, and the winner of the party vote in California will
get the day's big prize -- the state's 162 GOP delegates. But the
McCain campaign is hoping to beat Bush among all California voters
to underscore his claim that he would be a stronger GOP candidate
in November.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a Marist poll and a Zogby-New York Post-WNWS poll
showed McCain and Bush locked in a dead heat in New York where the
Arizona senator hopes a win would keep his bid for the Republican
nomination alive.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a Zogby-Reuters-MSNBC tracking poll showed
Democratic front-runner Al Gore, Bush and McCain all even in the
open primary race. Gore was at 26 percent, Bush at 26 percent and
McCain at 24 percent, while Democrat Bill Bradley was at 9 percent
and Republican Alan Keyes was at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led Bradley in New York by about 20 points in both polls.
Gore also leads Bradley comfortably in other states that vote
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion showed
Bush with the support of 46 percent of the likely voters in
Tuesday's New York GOP primary to 45 percent for McCain, a
statistical tie. A Marist poll released earlier in the week gave
McCain a narrow edge among likely primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Initially, the whole Bob Jones controversy in South Carolina
primary created a reverse bounce, it benefited McCain,'' said
Marist pollster Lee Miringoff. ''But what has happened since is
that the response by McCain has made him seem like part of the
attack-counterattack on religion in politics. He may have gotten
into the mix a little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has more than a 30-point lead in Massachusetts and is
well ahead in Vermont, two states with open primaries, in polls
released this week. McCain usually gets heavy support among
independents and Democrats when they are allowed to vote in open
GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby tracking poll had Bush and McCain close in Connecticut,
a state where only registered Republicans can vote in the GOP
primary. Bush usually fares best with Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ahead by 20 points in Georgia, Maryland and Ohio and by
about half that margin in Missouri, according to Zogby tracking
polls. Georgia, Missouri and Ohio are open primaries, while
independents are allowed to vote in the GOP primary in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Marist's telephone poll of 191 likely Republican primary voters
and 244 likely Democratic primary voters in New York was conducted
Tuesday and Wednesday. The margins of error were plus or minus 7
percentage points for the GOP likely voters and 6.5 percentage
points for the Democratic likely voters
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby tracking polls in Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New York and Ohio were averages of three
one-night polls taken Feb. 29-March 2 and surveyed 350 to 450
likely voters for each primary. The margins of error range from 5
percentage points to 5.5 percentage points. California's poll had
800 interviews during the same period with a 3.5 percentage point
margin of error.

<HEADLINE> Floodwaters Drop Freeing Thousands  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIBUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The water level in the flooded
Limpopo River valley dropped unexpectedly Friday, freeing thousands
of people who were marooned for days in trees and on rooftops
during Mozambique's worst flooding on record.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers have saved more than 12,000 people from the
floodwaters. But tragedy struck the rescue effort Friday when a
boat capsized, drowning four children. And in refugee camps, many
people went hungry for yet another day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect the floods' death toll to run into the
thousands, and the collection of corpses has been hampered by a
shortage of body bags. Aid officials said people stuck in trees
were being driven by hunger and thirst to eat the carcasses of
drowned animals and drink filthy floodwater, putting them at risk
for disease.
</P>
<P>
   The four children died after an inflatable boat carrying 17
refugees hit a tree and flipped over, said the boat's pilot, Peter
Britz.
</P>
<P>
   Britz and 13 others clambered up a tree and got a taste of what
thousands of people have endured since huge swaths of central and
southern Mozambique were flooded by torrential rains last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are snakes in the trees, stinging ants, wasps and lots
of mosquitos,'' Britz said after rescuers ferried him and the
others to safety hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people have been sitting in the trees all these days
with these things crawling on them and biting them,'' Britz said.
''I didn't realize what they were going through until I got stuck
in a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate 1 million people need food, medicine and
other aid throughout Mozambique. Getting it to them is a logistical
nightmare, with many areas still accessible only by air.
</P>
<P>
   At a refugee camp outside the southern town of Chibuto, scenes
of misery blended with a determination to persevere Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost my home, my crops of maize and beans, and 14 goats,''
says Antonio Bila, a grizzled 58-year-old farmer. ''But I've still
got my plow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the buildings in Machanga district, in
southern Mozambique, have been destroyed, the Italian MISNA news
service quoted Italian missionary Rev. Ottorino Poletto as saying
Friday. Dozens of people were killed by collapsed buildings and
fallen trees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The generator and the grain mill at the mission were covered
by floodwaters, and the (mission's) students' foodstuffs, the
personal belongings, the school archive were destroyed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once delivered to safety, many refugees remained hungry.
Millions of dollars in aid pledged from abroad has begun arriving
in Mozambique, but distribution problems seemed to be common.
</P>
<P>
   Local aid officials were doling out cornmeal soup to some of the
Chibuto camp's 1,500 flood victims while ignoring many others,
refugees told a reporter. One of those who went without was Anastas
Macele, who lay in the dust, semiconscious from exhaustion and
hunger, not far from a huge pot of simmering soup.
</P>
<P>
   Mathias Chauke, whose wife Gina lay in the shade of a tree, too
weak to move, repeatedly went to the aid officials with his empty
food bowl and was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not giving us anything to eat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A local relief official, Agostino Lumbele, said all the camp's
occupants would be fed by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   Supply didn't appear to be a problem. Several large bags of corn
flour from the U.N.'s World Food program lay in a food depot, along
with vegetable oil from the U.S. Agency for International
Development and cases of canned sardines. More food was being
offloaded from helicopters a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Rescues in the Limpopo valley had been expected to take three or
four more days, and the receding floodwaters came as a welcome
respite for weary crews. Lt. Col. Jaco Klopper, commander of the
South African air force's rescue operation, said Friday that rescue
workers thought most people caught by the Limpopo flood had been
moved to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will send out three aircraft (Saturday) to comb the area to
make sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The air force pilots who have been the backbone of the rescue
operations have earned widespread respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South Africans ... are real heroes,'' Mozambican Foreign
Minister Leonardo Simao said. ''It is touching to see this
solidarity unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican officials, meanwhile, said U.S. troops expected to
arrive in Mozambique soon were likely to be based in the central
city of Beira. U.S. Embassy officials declined to say where the 600
U.S. soldiers being sent from Europe along with helicopters and
other rescue gear would be based or when they would arrive.

<HEADLINE> Borders Group Hires Advisors  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Seeking pop to its stock price's value, book and
music retailer Borders Group Inc. has hired an advisor to explore
strategic options that could include joining forces with another
company.
</P>
<P>
   In hiring Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's No. 2 bookstore
chain said Friday it seeks counsel on ''strategic alternatives''
that include the possibility of a leveraged buyout or a business
combination with another company.
</P>
<P>
   Borders Group's board ''intends to explore all alternatives for
the purpose of creating shareholder value,'' Gregory P. Josefowicz,
the Ann Arbor-based company's president and chief executive, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was viewed favorably by Wall Street, where
Borders Group were trading at $14.93} at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New
York Stock Exchange, up $2.06\ or 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While calling Borders Group ''an excellent company,'' analyst
Larry Crutcher said the bookseller ''just hasn't captured the
imagination of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Its share price has been down for the wrong reasons,'' in part
because it is viewed Internet latecomer to rivals Barnes &AMP; Noble
and online giant Amazon.com, said Crutcher, a managing director at
Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates Inc., an investment bank specializing
in media companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barnes &AMP; Noble jumped in right behind Amazon and ahead of
Borders'' in Internet retailing, Crutcher said. ''The stock market
tends to reward the new economy.'' Investors perhaps viewed Borders
Group ''more like a bricks-and-mortar company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Borders expects to announce 1999 earnings in line
with estimates, Josefowicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Borders Group's subsidiary Borders Inc. operates more than 290
Borders Books and Music Stores in the United States and Puerto
Rico. Borders Group also has 900 Waldenbooks stores, and an
electronic commerce site -- borders.com -- that has access to nearly
700,000 titles and more than 10 million books, music and video
items.
</P>
<P>
   Borders was founded in 1971 in Ann Arbor as a used bookstore.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani says he is loyal to Bush, downplays differences withPataki  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As is often the case in New York's
presidential primary campaigns, the local sideshow -- this time
featuring Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani --
threatened Friday to overshadow the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The front page of the New York Post was dominated by the
headline: ''AT IT AGAIN! Pataki &AMP; Rudy in backstage war over Bush
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With that going on, Giuliani went on the radio to pledge his
loyalty to George W. Bush's presidential campaign, downplaying
differences with Pataki over attacks by the New York governor on
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something that maybe some people just don't
understand. I'm a friend of John McCain,'' the New York City mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some people, they want to demand that you get
involved in negative campaigning and they question your loyalty if
you won't do it,'' the mayor added in an interview with Albany's
WROW-AM radio. ''In this particular situation, I'm extremely loyal
to Governor Bush. There is no hidden agenda ... I just happen to
have a great deal of personal regard for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in political circles that Giuliani,
running against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate,
believes McCain at the top of the GOP ticket in November is more
helpful than Bush in a moderate-to-liberal state like New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring the pot, McCain sent Giuliani a thank-you letter ''for
your extraordinary efforts to keep the tenor of the presidential
campaign in New York on a positive plane.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Your dedication to keeping on the rhetorical high road in
spite of pressure to do otherwise has been extremely courageous,''
McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the McCain camp acknowledged it was making telephone
calls to Roman Catholic voters in New York, a practice that began
in other states after Bush appeared at South Carolina's Bob Jones
University where some officials have expressed anti-Catholic views.
Unlike the other calls, McCain aides said the calls into New York
do not mention Bush's appearance at the school. The calls do note,
however, that ''John McCain spoke out against bigotry at Bob Jones
University.'' Forty-six percent of New York's Republican electorate
is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also launched two new TV ads, one calling on New Yorkers
to ''vote for the one Republican who can beat Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The sniping between the Pataki and Giuliani camps has clouded
the picture as Bush battles for victory in New York's GOP primary,
the big target for McCain in next week's ''Super Tuesday''
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two new statewide polls out Friday showed Bush and McCain locked
in a neck-and-neck race for the 93 delegates at stake in the New
York primary.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, those same polls showed Al Gore with
huge leads over Bill Bradley in the run-up to Tuesday's Democratic
primary. Bradley has long considered New York, where he played
Hall-of-Fame basketball for the Knicks, a must-win state.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for a fourth-quarter comeback, Bradley unveiled a
30-second television ad to run in New York City featuring former
New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch and major Knicks fan Spike Lee.
The unlikely duo touts what they see as Bradley's pluses. ''Tax
policy,'' Koch says. ''Jump shot,'' movie director Lee chimes in.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki-Giuliani contretemps was reminiscent of 1988 when
Gore, badly needing a strong showing in the New York primary to
keep his presidential hopes alive, was pushed into the background
as his top supporter, Koch, got into a verbal war with Jesse
Jackson. Gore finished third in the primary behind Michael Dukakis
and Jackson and soon left the race.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Giuliani has refused to join Pataki in criticizing
McCain and has repeatedly said nice things about the Arizona
senator.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pataki and his political allies launched an attack
against McCain, citing his Senate voting record as being ''as
anti-New York ... as anybody's in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused to allow his name to be used on a mailing to
New Yorkers criticizing McCain and he balked at attending a news
conference on Thursday with other mayors from across New York also
meant to attack McCain's voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's spokeswoman and one of his top political
advisers, said she was ''dumbfounded'' by the mayor's reticence to
join in, especially given his own campaign for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to be defending the state in the Senate, you
have an obligation to point out another senator's votes against
your interests and those of the constituency you want to
represent,'' the Pataki aide said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been chilly relations between Pataki and Giuliani
ever since the mayor crossed party lines in 1994 to endorse
then-Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki. Pataki won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani denied Friday that there was any tension between he and
Pataki and blamed the problems on ''staff members.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're united in our support of George W. Bush. We're united in
the support of my Senate candidacy,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Mauritanian Denies US Bomb Attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) -- A Mauritanian accused of plotting
bomb attacks against the United States denied the charges Friday,
saying he had no link to suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamedou Ould Slahi described himself in an interview Friday
with The Associated Press as a pacifist who doesn't want to kill
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no links with the organization of bin Laden and defy
anyone to prove the contrary,'' Slahi said at his home in a modest
neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, Nouakchott.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities have said the alleged plot was linked to bin
Laden. Slahi was arrested in Mauritania in January and released
last week after more than three weeks in detention.
</P>
<P>
   He had been living in Canada but left there in part because of
an investigation into the alleged bomb plot against targets in the
United States, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service has said.
</P>
<P>
   Slahi, however, said his arrest was ''a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All they (U.S. authorities) want is to convince the American
people that they have enemies that want to harm them, even if they
have come up with no proof of what they claim,'' said Slahi.
</P>
<P>
   Slahi said he had been studying in Canada and was also an imam
at a Montreal mosque. He returned to Mauritania because his mother
was ill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials accuse bin Laden, a Saudi believed to be living
in Afghanistan, of masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Those attacks killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   No specific evidence has been released linking bin Laden to the
newly alleged plot in the United States. Authorities have not said
what the targets of that plot might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Slahi acknowledged spending some years in Afghanistan during the
mid-1990s, saying he went to offer religious and moral support to
the Taliban, the strict Islamic militia that controls 90 percent of
the country. But he said he never met bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Slahi's arrest, law enforcement officials in
Washington said they wanted to question him. Slahi said he was only
interviewed by Mauritanian officials, but believed the questions
were supplied by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities said they uncovered the alleged plot
shortly after Slahi left Canada sometime around Dec. 14. That was
when they arrested Algerian Ahmed Ressam for allegedly trying to
smuggle bomb-making components into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam pleaded innocent to charges of planning an attack.

<HEADLINE> Rise in Jobless Rate Buoys Wall St.  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 4.1
percent in February, and fewer jobseekers found work than in any
month since May. While fewer jobs is not good news to workers, the
report buoyed Wall Street investors who believed it could be the
start of a much-needed slowdown in the red-hot economy.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks soared. The Dow Jones blue-chip average gained 202.28
points to close at 10,367.20, giving the index its best week since
July. The Nasdaq index crossed 4,900 for the first time and closed
at a record high 4,914.79, up 160.28 points. Its previous closing
record of 4,784.08 was set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report by the Labor Department showing slower job
growth and no evidence of wage inflation calmed investors' fears
that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates sharply
to slow the economy and prevent an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, an economic indicator the markets could love,'' said
Merrill Lynch's chief economist Bruce Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   And a second report Friday also offered signs of a slowdown. The
Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories fell by a
bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in January, the steepest drop
since April. The decline was led by a huge 12.9 percent drop in
orders for electronics, the sharpest decline since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even though economists widely expect the Fed will boost rates
March 21, they said the unemployment report all but assures a
moderate move of a quarter of a percentage point, rather than a
half-point increase some feared.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has raised interest rates four times since June
to slow the economy and to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected uptick in last month's jobless rate followed
January's 4 percent rate, the lowest in 30 years. Many analysts had
predicted February's rate would hold steady.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise to many economists was the slowdown in job
growth, which has been particularly hardy in recent months. Only
43,000 workers found employment in February, a nine-month low. Most
analysts were forecasting that 228,000 workers would find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish growth in the service sector, normally an engine of job
creation in the United States, helped restrain overall job growth.
The sector added just 62,000 jobs in February, the fewest since
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Construction companies lost 26,000 jobs after posting a colossal
116,000 gain the month before aided by mild weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. job machine hiccuped in February, generating a
fraction of the new employment that had been expected,'' said Bill
Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors viewed this as the start of a slowdown in
the economy, economists were more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to call a turn in the trend, so Alan Greenspan
can't relax completely, but it's certainly the kind of report that
will help him sleep better,'' Cheney said. ''Another couple like
this for March and April and he might even put off any more
interest rate hikes for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists pointed out that job growth over the last three
months averaged a robust 245,000, a level that would be too strong
for the Fed's liking.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would need a couple of months of slower jobs growth to
make the case of a slowdown in the economy,'' said Sandra Shaber,
economist with the WEFA Group.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she
isn't concerned about the lower-than-expected 43,000 jobs created
last month. ''I think workers still feel secure about this job
market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 384,000 jobs were added to businesses' payrolls in
January thanks to better-than-normal weather in the early part of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February -- on target with most
analysts' expectations. In January, wages grew by a 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no indication that wage growth is exploding, which is
something the Federal Reserve would be on the lookout for,'' said
KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland.
</P>
<P>
   Economists always keep tabs on wage and job growth. While wage
and job gains are good developments for workers, economists and
members of the Fed worry that too-strong growth could spark
inflation. Their fear: Employers trying to attract qualified
workers will offer higher wages and benefits, forcing them to boost
the price of their products and thus setting off higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In February, 33,000 workers found jobs in the retail industry
with the largest gains in department and furniture stores.
Manufacturers, which lost 248,000 jobs last year, added 5,000 jobs
reflecting big gains in electrical equipment, automobile production
and industrial machinery.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agencies Help Storm Victims  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- With Tropical Storm Gloria threatening to wreak
more havoc in flood-devastated Mozambique and its neighbors, aid
agencies and foreign governments on Friday stepped up their efforts
to help those who have lost everything to the waters.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies said they were bracing for the worst if the new
storm hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're holding our breath,'' said World Food Program spokesman
Trevor Rowe. If the storm strikes with its full power, Rowe said,
it will have a ''devastating, catastrophic effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mozambique, the United Nations estimates that between 800,000
and 1 million people have already lost their homes to the flooding
and are in urgent need of help. Roughly 180,000 homeless are
estimated to be children under the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Children's Fund warned that Madagascar ''could become
the next Mozambique,'' after Gloria swamped the Indian Ocean island
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The storms that have flooded the continent are landing their
worst blows here,'' said Sergio Soro, the UNICEF representative in
Madagascar. ''The island is like a punching bag right now,'' he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 600,000 people there have been affected by the
flooding, half of them children. At least 55 people have died, Soro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Weather Service said Friday that the storm had
been a hurricane but had weakened to a tropical storm. During the
next two days, the storm was expected to be over the strait between
Madagascar and the Mozambique mainland.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF began registering children and parents separated in the
floods, and arranged to fly in 60,000 syringes for an emergency
vaccination campaign against measles and meningitis in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still thousands of people who need rescuing,'' said
Rowe, from the food agency's Rome headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said it had 30 helicopters and 120 boats
working to rescue people and take them to safer ground.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Zambia, the International Organization for Migration
moved some 20,000 Angolan refugees to a new camp in anticipation of
a possible new flood.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said they were concerned about what would happen
when the flooding finally receded. UNICEF said land mines may have
been moved by the water to areas that had previously been cleared
and could cause injuries as people return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies said the response from the international community for
money had been good but that much more was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government on Friday approved the equivalent of
$59.5 million in emergency aid for Mozambique's flood victims. As
part of the aid package, Spain was to pardon debt worth $20.2
million, the total Mozambique debt to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Spain sent three military Hercules planes
carrying a mobile hospital to be built in Chaquelane, a town
located some 100 miles northeast of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies more than doubled its appeal for aid, saying it now needs
the equivalent of about $6.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program said Friday it is seeking funds to
increase deliveries of relief food to Africa by 100,000 tons this
year to feed people displaced by war and natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said $7
million in food aid and $4 million for search and rescue operations
were being provided through the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   He said a 25-member disaster assistance team arrived in
Mozambique on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's African neighbors have been unable to provide much
aid due to poor economies and a lack of resources, said Brig. Eric
Esikhaty, chief of operations for the Kenyan Army.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's neighbors, such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Kenya and
Tanzania have not contributed military hardware to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday that Britain would
divert a heavyweight supply vessel from the Persian Gulf to deliver
fuel, medicine and five helicopters to Mozambique. It is expected
to arrive in Mozambique in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's government, meanwhile, faced criticism Friday for
canceling only about 40 percent of the debt owed to it by
Mozambique rather than the full $375 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, Mozambique's former colonial ruler, announced Thursday
it was writing off the equivalent of $145 million of the country's
debt as part of an emergency aid plan.

<HEADLINE> US, North Korea Talks Set  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department in a memo to Congress has
expressed concern about ''possible North Korean pursuit'' of
materials needed to manufacture nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The department position was sent to House International
Relations Committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., on Feb. 15,
and a copy was made available to the Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea promised in a 1994 agreement with the United States
to freeze its nuclear facilities at two sites to prevent production
of nuclear weapons but there are no assurances that Pyongyang has
not engaged in secret nuclear weapons development activities
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The unclassified memo sent to Gilman said North Korea has
complied with its 1994 pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The document was triggered by a congressional requirement that
President Clinton ''certify'' that North Korea is acting in good
faith on nuclear and other issues in order for the Congress to
approve $15 million in assistance to Pyongyang promised under the
1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One congressionally mandated requirement called on the
administration to assert that North Korea was not developing a
capability to enrich uranium or reprocess spent nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, the memo said the evidence is inconclusive and,
in any case, judgments about North Korean intentions are difficult
to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the ambiguities, the memo said Clinton was unable to
certify that North Korea was not trying to develop a nuclear
weapons capability. It said Clinton had decided to exercise his
waiver authority on that point to ensure U.S. compliance with its
assistance commitments.,
</P>
<P>
   ''Possible North Korean pursuit of an additional capability to
produce fissile material is of concern to the United States,'' the
memo said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that former Defense Secretary William Perry, as part of
the North Korea policy review he carried out last year for Clinton,
had urged U.S.-North Korean negotiations to seek verifiable
assurances that Pyongyang does not have a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, asking not to be identified, said
it was impossible to make firm judgments about what North Korea has
been up to in the nuclear area.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration found itself unable to prove a negative,''
he said. ''And so we had to use the waiver.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been attempting to expand its dialogue
with North Korea, and a senior North Korean official is expected to
come to Washington in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said this week that the visit will be ''an
important opportunity for serious talks and progress on issues
central to peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the
Asia-Pacific region, including improving U.S.-North Korean
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-North Korean talks in preparation for the visit will be
held in New York starting on Tuesday.

first-quarter earnings may fall below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   President and acting chief executive officer Verne Istock and
chief financial officer Robert Rosholt said the company remains on
track to match the full-year prognosis they laid out in January.
</P>
<P>
   But they said first-quarter earnings could be as low as 60 cents
a share because of a seasonal decline in credit-card use and rising
interest rates. A consensus of Wall Street analysts had forecast
earnings of 65 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Bank One fell 81\ cents, or 3 percent, to $25.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange, just above the 52-week low of $23.18}
reached in late February.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One's problems stem from its First USA unit, the nation's
No. 2 issuer of credit cards behind Citibank. Its stock has fallen
by more than half since the announcement last August that First
USA's once-soaring growth had fallen off, the victim of squeezed
profit margins and issuing too many low-interest cards.
</P>
<P>
   Rosholt said the credit-card business is recovering, but ''it
will take the full year to achieve the turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Istock, a candidate for permanent CEO, said filling the post
remains the board's highest priority. He also reiterated that
company officials see it in shareholders' best interest not to sell
Bank One.

<HEADLINE> Louima jury ends third day of deliberations without verdict  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The jury in the trial of three officers accused
of a cover-up in the torture of Abner Louima ended its
deliberations for the day Friday after focusing on statements
prosecutors say the defendants tailored to fit their conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In notes to U.S. District Court Judge Eugene Nickerson, jurors
asked to be read testimony by James Burns, a former investigator
who interviewed defendant Thomas Wiese shortly after the Aug. 9,
1997 attack. They also requested a statement defendant Thomas
Bruder made to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The jury has deliberated more than 20 hours over three days
without reaching a verdict. It was to return to Brooklyn federal
court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As deliberations drew to a close Friday, police union officials
and defense attorneys said they were convinced there was a verdict.
But the rumors were false: Nickerson called weary looking jurors
into the courtroom and sent them home for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing you know is that the 12 jurors are taking their
responsibility very seriously,'' defense attorney Joseph Tacopina
said outside court.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the protests sparked by the acquittal of four
officers in the shooting of Amadou Diallo, Patrick Lynch, president
of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said he was worried that
''the anti-police atmosphere that is on the street may have seeped
into this courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Wiese, 36, Bruder, 33, and Charles
Schwarz, 34, conspired to clear Schwarz by lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was convicted in another trial last year of violating
Louima's civil rights by leading him into the bathroom of the 70th
Precinct station and holding him down while another officer, Justin
Volpe, sodomized the handcuffed Haitian immigrant with a broken
broom handle in a fit of rage. Schwarz faces a possible life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At the current trial, Burns described an interview in which
Wiese identified himself as the second officer in the bathroom.
Wiese said he never saw Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct
house's front desk.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burns, Wiese also said he helped Volpe escort
Louima toward the arrest processing room and was surprised when
Volpe took a sharp right to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, hearing noises, Wiese said he entered and was
shocked to find Volpe, broomstick in hand, with his foot on the
prostrate Louima's back. Wiese said he dragged Louima away as Volpe
claimed that the victim had soiled himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder told the FBI that he saw Volpe lead Louima to the
bathroom, trailed by Wiese -- not Schwarz. That contradicted an
earlier statement in which he said that Volpe was the sole escort.
</P>
<P>
   Louima has testified at both trials that two officers attacked
him. He positively identified one of his assailants as Volpe, and
the other as ''the driver'' of the patrol car that took him to the
station; records show the driver was Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have relied on records showing the three officers
made a flurry of phone calls to each other as investigators zeroed
in. The pattern and timing of the calls proved the officers were
trying to ''get their stories straight'' that Schwarz was never in
the bathroom, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has tried to convince the jury the story was true --
and that there could be no cover-up if Schwarz committed no crime.
Schwarz himself testified last week that during Volpe's attack, he
was outside inspecting his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving 30 years
in prison, also emerged as a key defense witness. He testified that
Wiese was the second officer, but did not participate in the actual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants face terms of up to five years if convicted.

<HEADLINE> House Members Urge US to Quit WTO  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of conservative House members promised
Friday to introduce legislation demanding that the United States
quit the World Trade Organization. The move will force the full
House to take up a second contentious trade issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, being led by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, guarantees a
vote within 90 days on withdrawing from the WTO, the Geneva-based
organization that has become a lightning rod for opponents of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1994 legislation that authorized U.S. membership in
the newly created WTO, Congress required the administration to
submit a progress report after five years of WTO membership about
the costs and benefits to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Upon receipt of that report, which the administration submitted
Thursday, any member of Congress can file a joint resolution
demanding that the United States withdraw its membership.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the issue cannot be bottled up in committee, the
1994 law required a vote within 90 days by the full House or
Senate, depending on where the withdrawal measure was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Clinton administration will be forced to defend
U.S. membership in the WTO at the same time it is seeking votes to
grant China permanent normal trade relations with the United States
as part of China's WTO membership bid.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who expected WTO opponents in the House to
file a withdrawal resolution, have indicated a vote on the issue
will occur before the House takes up the administration's China
request.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Paul, a longtime foe of the WTO, said he
submitted the resolution because the WTO ''is an egregious attack
upon our national sovereignty, and this is the reason why we must
vigorously oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents of the WTO make similar claims. Organized labor,
environmental organizations and consumer groups brought thousands
of demonstrators to the streets of Seattle last December for
protests against what the groups see as the WTO's unbalanced
emphasis on breaking down trade barriers no matter what the cost to
workers' rights and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   These groups have not indicated they will be backing the Paul
effort, however, because of worries that it would detract from what
they view as the real trade fight in Congress this year, the
administration's request to end the annual reviews of China's trade
status with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scheduling this vote before the China vote will be an effort
to demonstrate some sort of support for free trade. But obviously,
the big fight this year is going to be on China and not pulling out
of the WTO,'' said Patrick Woodall, a spokesman for Public Citizen
Global Trade Watch, a leading opponent of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The administration concluded in its report to Congress, released
Friday in its full printed version, that WTO membership has been
overwhelmingly beneficial to the United States. Benefits came, it
said, both through tariff reductions being implemented as part of
the last round of global trade talks and through the WTO's binding
dispute-resolution procedures.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has won a number of cases before the
WTO, it lost its biggest case so far just last week when the WTO
ruled that a $4 billion annual tax break for American exporters
violates global trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said the loss of the tax case underscored the arguments he
and other opponents are making that the United States has handed
over to an international tribunal its ability to make tax law.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's review of the impact of WTO membership on
the U.S. economy was only part of a 310-page report the
administration issues every year assessing recent trade
developments and laying out its trade agenda for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   WTO critics called the administration's assessment a whitewash
that glossed over the 135-nation organization's major flaws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Paul, other House members who have signed on as
sponsors of the withdrawal resolution are Reps. John Duncan Jr.,
R-Tenn.; Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.; Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.; Jack
Metcalf, R-Wash.; and Gene Taylor, D-Miss.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Flat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices were little changed Friday,
with traders moving into stocks as a government report of an
unexpected slight rise in the unemployment rate lowered the specter
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32 point, or 31\
cents per $1,000 in face value. The yield hovered around Thursday's
late rate of 6.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a boost to bonds was a Labor Department report that the
nation's jobless rate in January rose to 4.1, the first increase
since June.
</P>
<P>
   The report of a softening of the labor market helped bonds
because it reduced the likelihood of a resurgence of higher
inflation and lowered the threat of aggressive moves by the Federal
Reserve to pump up interest rates to cool off the economy. But
bonds' gains were limited because of money flowing into the stock
market, which rallied sharply on the calming employment report.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of short-term and intermediate Treasury securities were
unchanged to up 1/32 point, according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.79 percent, with the
discount up 0.04 percentage point from Thursday to 5.63 percent.
Six-month bills yielded 6.02 percent, as the discount remained
unchanged at 5.76 percent. One-year yields were 6.16 percent, with
the discount falling 0.02 percentage point to 5.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was unchanged at 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 3/32 to 93 1/16.
The yield to maturity of the index fell to 6.14 percent from 6.15
percent Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Fire Sprinkler Replacement Urged  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BASKERVILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A widely used automatic fire sprinkler
manufactured by the same company that had to recall another
sprinkler model in 1998 may not operate in a fire, the nation's
leading product safety testing organization said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some glass-bulb sprinklers produced by Central Sprinkler Co.
leaked and failed to work at required water pressures in tests by
Chicago-based Underwriters Laboratories, the country's largest
testing organization, and by FM Global, a commercial and industrial
property insurer based in Johnston, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ''UL recommends that these leaking sprinklers be replaced as
soon as possible,'' Underwriters Laboratories spokesman Tim
Montgomery said Friday in a phone interview. National Fire
Protection Association standards also require that leaking
sprinklers be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million Model GB sprinklers are installed worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many of Central's Model GB sprinkler heads
may be leaking, and neither Underwriters Laboratories nor FM Global
has received any report of Model GB sprinklers failing to activate
in a fire.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to consider any recall or replacement of the
sprinkler, said Brad McGee, senior vice president of Tyco
International, which acquired Central last year. The company
advises inspecting the sprinkler heads for signs of leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Glass-bulb sprinklers contain alcohol or another liquid in a
bulb mounted on the sprinkler head. Heat rising from a fire expands
the liquid, causing the glass to shatter. That releases the
sprinkler's plug and allows water onto the fire. An O-ring seal
keeps the plug from leaking.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters Laboratories observed crystallized deposits or
corrosion around the rubber seal, which indicated leaking water.
The sprinkler model recently was redesigned with a metal seal.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of the 135 sample sprinkler heads tested did
not operate at a water pressure of five pounds per square inch, the
pressure at which sprinklers are required to operate in order to
earn a Underwriters Laboratories listing. The heads also failed to
operate at 7 psi, the pressure required by National Fire Protection
Association standards.
</P>
<P>
   Water pressure in most buildings exceeds 7 psi, but some Model
GB heads tested by Underwriters Laboratories did not operate at 60
psi, which exceeds the water pressure available in some buildings,
including houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which ordered the recall
of Central's 8.4 million Omega sprinkler heads in 1998, is
conducting an investigation of all sprinklers used in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported in 1997 that the Omega sprinkler
had a 35 percent failure rate in tests conducted for the Fairfax
County, Va., Fire and Rescue Department and a 31 percent failure
rate in tests by Underwriters Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Despite problems with some sprinklers, fire sprinkler systems --
in use for more than a century -- are considered second only to
human firefighters in reliability.

<HEADLINE> There's more to potato chips than meet the eye  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Next time the deli worker drops a handful
of chips next to your turkey on whole wheat, think for a minute
about the folks at the National Potato Council and Empire State
Potato Growers.
</P>
<P>
   They spend more time you might realize thinking about you.
</P>
<P>
   ''Potato chips don't grow on the grocery shelves,'' said Chris
Voigt of the National Potato Promotion Board, who was among
hundreds of potato growers, processors and other industry people
who gathered Friday to discuss the surprisingly serious business of
snack food.
</P>
<P>
   On the agenda at the ''Chip Potato Seminar'' were discussions
about blight strains and other hazards, as well as motivational
talks and research briefings.
</P>
<P>
   All which make that pile of chips seem wholly unworthy of the
term ''junk food.''
</P>
<P>
   Potato growers must meet the strict standards of potato chip
makers, who want specific varieties and sizes of potatoes -- ones
that will soak up the least amount of oil in the frying process
while producing uniform chips.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Mahany knows all about the challenges, having worked his
family's Arkport farm since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're manufacturing something you can adjust the machine
and adjust your inputs and you can come up with something,'' he
said. ''But when you throw it out in the field and you have to grow
it out there it's not always going to turn out the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. consumers ate an average of 94.6 pounds of
processed potatoes each, according to the Empire State Potato
Growers. The number of potato chips included in that number is on
the rise, Voigt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot has to do with there's so much variety,'' he said. ''The
consumer can choose from the traditional potato chip or if they
want a low-fat version, or no-fat, organic, non-organic.''
</P>
<P>
   The choices will only grow in the future, he said. But it all
begins with the spud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Potatoes are affected by transportation rates, increasing fuel
costs on the farm, insurance, liability, there's just a whole
wealth of things that affect the farming community and the whole
food chain,'' Voigt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tremendous amount of steps in between having a
potato growing in the ground and appearing on the shelf.''

<HEADLINE> Borders Group Hires Advisers  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Seeking pop to its stock price's value, book and
music retailer Borders Group Inc. has hired an adviser to explore
strategic options that could include joining forces with another
company.
</P>
<P>
   In hiring Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's No. 2 bookstore
chain said Friday it seeks counsel on ''strategic alternatives''
that include the possibility of a leveraged buyout or a business
combination with another company.
</P>
<P>
   Borders Group's board ''intends to explore all alternatives for
the purpose of creating shareholder value,'' Gregory P. Josefowicz,
the Ann Arbor-based company's president and chief executive, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was viewed favorably by Wall Street, where
Borders Group were trading at $14.93} at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New
York Stock Exchange, up $2.06\ or 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While calling Borders Group ''an excellent company,'' analyst
Larry Crutcher said the bookseller ''just hasn't captured the
imagination of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Its share price has been down for the wrong reasons,'' in part
because it is viewed Internet latecomer to rivals Barnes &AMP; Noble
and online giant Amazon.com, said Crutcher, a managing director at
Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates Inc., an investment bank specializing
in media companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barnes &AMP; Noble jumped in right behind Amazon and ahead of
Borders'' in Internet retailing, Crutcher said. ''The stock market
tends to reward the new economy.'' Investors perhaps viewed Borders
Group ''more like a bricks-and-mortar company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Borders expects to announce 1999 earnings in line
with estimates, Josefowicz said.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged In Shooting Incident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A man has been charged with firing
several shots at the federal command post for the Eric Rudolph
manhunt in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At an initial appearance before a federal magistrate Friday in
Asheville, Eddie DeWayne ''Red'' Carringer, 31, was ordered held
without bail until a hearing next week.
</P>
<P>
   Carringer was arrested Thursday night by FBI agents and charged
with assault and attempt to murder a federal officer. If convicted,
he could face a maximum 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Several shots were fired across a soccer field about 300 yards
from the fenced compound on the night of Nov. 11, 1998. One bullet
pierced the building's wall and ''brushed the hair'' of one agent
while narrowly missing another, according to U.S. Attorney Mark
Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, charged in bombings in Birmingham, Ala., and the
Atlanta area, disappeared into the rugged western North Carolina
mountains in February 1998 and has been spotted only once since.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 202.28; Nasdaq at High  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks bounded higher Friday, giving the Dow
industrials their best week since last July, after the government
delivered a sign that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes
might finally be slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was sparked by a Labor Department report that showed
some easing of the tight labor market. The news reassured investors
that while the economy remains strong, it is not overheating.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 202.28 to close at
10,367.20. For the week, the blue-chip index rose 505.08 points,
its best performance since the week ended July 2, 1999, when it
rose 586.68. The rally helped the Dow continue its recovery from a
slump that last week sent it below 10,000 for the first time since
last April.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, crossed 4,900 for the
first time and closed at a new high. The index rose 160.28 to
4,914.79, well above the previous record of 4,784.08, set
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 13.84 to
597.88, a new record. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 27.41
to 1,409.17.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department reported 43,000
new jobs were created in February, well below analysts'
expectations and the weakest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to $13.53 in February. And the nation's
unemployment ticked up to 4.1 percent in February from 4 percent in
January, although it remains near a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing labor market has spooked Wall Street for
months, with many investors worrying about how continued growth
will affect businesses. Companies must offer competitive wages and
incentives to keep employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at
such low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big concern is that the economy was going to overheat and
employment was going to be one of the biggest problems,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''But we did not create nearly the number
of jobs that were expected and the unemployment rate went up.
That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rate four times since June in an
effort to slow the economy and control inflation. Friday's jobs
report, coupled with data released Thursday showing new-home sales
plunged by 4.2 percent in January, might indicate that the Fed's
actions are at last having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   While most investors still believe the Fed will boost rates
again soon -- maybe even at a meeting later this month -- many now
think the hike won't be as steep as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The softer the economic numbers we see, the more lenient the
Fed will be,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Right now bad news is good news for this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Among industrial stocks in the Dow, DuPont rose 3~ to 50} and 3M
rose 3 7/16 to 89{. Bill Painter, a trader at Federated Investors
of Pittsburgh, said portfolio managers were avidly buying shares of
companies that have been pounded by investors' worries over
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of cash on the sidelines and some pent-up
demand to get into the market,'' he said. ''Last week opened up
some opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow plunged 357 points last week, capped by a 295-point drop
last Friday. In fact, Friday's rally snapped a streak which saw the
Dow tumble at least 200 points in four of five Friday sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Dow's decline, technology stocks have risen. Most
were higher Friday, as well. IBM rose 5~ to 109, Microsoft gained
2} to 96[ and Cisco Systems rose 4 11/16 to 137 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's sizzling initial public offering cooled a bit.
Palm Inc., a spinoff of 3Com Corp., fell 14 13/16 to 80\.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.42
billion shares, compared with 1.45 billion in the previous session.
On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a 3-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained
0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Coke's Investor Retires in Style  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola's former chairman and chief executive,
M. Douglas Ivester, began his retirement last month with a $1.5
million check and a lucrative severance and pension package that
will pay him $115,000 monthly for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who officially retired Feb. 17, also will receive
$675,000 annually though February 2007 to serve as a consultant to
the Atlanta-based company he led until December, when he announced
his retirement plans. Coke has named Douglas Daft as Ivester's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation was released Friday in Coke's 2000 proxy
statement. Shareholders will meet April 19 in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The richest part of the deal involves the 1.95 million shares of
restricted Coke stock board members granted Ivester in 1983 and
1989. Ivester and other senior executives were not allowed to sell
the shares, but board members agreed to lift those restrictions on
Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   His shares were worth nearly $98 million based on Coke's price
of $50.12{ Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, 52, also will receive $4.5 million in three equal
payments through February 2002 in place of bonuses he will not
receive in retirement. He received the first $1.5 million check
last month.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the company's early retirement package, Ivester also
will receive $58,700 monthly atop a separate $56,300 monthly
payment he'll receive from age 55 until he dies. Ivester's wife
will continue to receive the $56,300 if he dies before her.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Chuck Reece said the board of directors developed
the package, which was then approved by the board's compensation
committee. He said board members sought to accomplish four goals
with the package: ensure a smooth transition from Ivester to Daft;
recognize Ivester's contributions during his more than 20 years at
Coke; retain him as a consultant; and keep him from competing
against Coke in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester also will get to keep his company car, a 1996 Mercury
Grand Marquis, his laptop computer and cell phones. Coke also will
pay his club memberships and home security system costs and provide
him an office and secretarial services through May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the proposals shareholders will vote on at
their annual meeting is a request from a New Jersey woman to
eliminate bonuses, stock options, severance contracts and stock
awards as part of manager's compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Coke directors are urging shareholders to vote against the
proposal by Mary Morse. She did not return a call Friday seeking
comment.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Commodity Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil's steamroller rally on the New York Mercantile
Exchange took a respite Friday as profit-taking ahead of the
weekend sent prices slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
   Most other energy prices also fell.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, cocoa prices rallied to five-week
highs and hogs also rose.
</P>
<P>
   In a climb that accelerated in mid-February, crude oil blasted
through the $30, $31 and $32-a-barrel barriers for the first time
in nine years. Short supplies and limited production have sent oil
soaring, pushing gasoline and heating oil prices to levels that are
stinging consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But commodity traders switched to a wait-and-see mode near
week's end as investors continued watching OPEC for a verdict on
what the next production agreement will bring.
</P>
<P>
   With a flurry of key meetings of oil ministers now over and
still no decision on what will happen when the current
output-slashing agreement on production limits expires March 31,
it's not clear when the bull market in oil will get its next push
up or shove down.
</P>
<P>
   But inventories are shrinking rapidly and any production
increase by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
is likely to take six weeks to get oil to the United States, the
world's biggest importer. As a result, the betting is there is room
for further price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''OPEC is clearly going to do something,'' said Bill O'Grady,
energy analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ''But it's
Friday and the market's been pretty strong,'' so some profit-taking
was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't have anything else going on on a Friday, that
tends to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell 18 cents
to $31.51 a barrel after trading as high as $31.84.
</P>
<P>
   April heating oil fell 0.57 cent to 78.89 cents a gallon and
April unleaded gasoline fell 1.19 cent to 97.61 cents a gallon.
April natural gas rose 4.2 cents to $2.825 per 1,000 cubic feet,
extending a two-week rally amid concern that storage levels won't
increase quickly enough this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In London, April Brent crude from the North Sea fell 23 cents to
$28.99 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa prices surged again with new-crop arrivals at West African
ports slowing and the main harvests almost fully done. World cocoa
supplies remain plentiful but a seasonal rise in prices usually
occurs after Ivory Coast and Ghana, the top two cocoa-bean
producers, have wrapped up most of their harvests.
</P>
<P>
   May cocoa settled up $24 at $845 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   Hog prices jumped nearly 2 percent on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on lighter marketing and expectations of reduced supplies.
</P>
<P>
   April lean hogs rose 1.08 cents to 59.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> No Venezuelan Oil Workers Strike  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Ending a threat to production in the
world's third-largest petroleum exporter, Venezuela's oil workers
called off a nationwide work stoppage Friday after just a few hours
away from the job.
</P>
<P>
   International oil prices are at nine-year highs. When the strike
began Friday morning, analysts said a long work interruption could
cut supply, putting further pressure on prices for gasoline and
heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   But late Friday afternoon, the strike against the state-owned
oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, was canceled. Carlos Ortega,
president of the country's largest union, said failure to suspend
it would have placed Venezuela's oil employees ''outside the law''
because of a new legislative decree.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, written by an assembly that revised Venezuela's
constitution last year, requires unions to choose new leaders
through open elections instead of the current practice of
hand-picking by party bosses. The decree went into effect Friday
when authorities published it in the Official Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   It was likely published as part of a government attempt to end
the strike. Ortega called the decree ''ominous'' and said it could
enable the government ''to begin a plan of massive firings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not willing to give them a pretext to do so and we have
decided to end the strike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The work stoppage had been called to protest the state oil
company's refusal to sign a preliminary accord that would have
provided the basis for negotiations on a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   The last contract expired in November. Workers, who earn about
$300 to $450 per month, have demanded that their pay roughly be
doubled. The company is offering a raise about $30 per month and
also wants to lower required severance payments to dismissed
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and oil union leaders announced Tuesday
they had reached a preliminary deal on contract talks, but the
accord unraveled Wednesday when company President Hector Ciavaldini
said the company hadn't signed on.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what the next step in working out a
new contract might be.
</P>
<P>
   Ciavaldini and other company and government officials say they
do not want to negotiate until union leaders, whom they say are
linked to corrupt political parties, are replaced in democratic
elections. Union leaders deny allegations of corruption and say
President Hugo Chavez is putting labor freedoms in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Oil accounts for about three-quarters of Venezuela's export
earnings. The country exports some 2.72 million barrels of oil per
day.

<HEADLINE> Stockbroker admits to cheating investors of $40 million  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Monmouth County stockbroker admitted
Friday that his bearishness led him to cheat 180 investors from
around the world of $40 million they gave his hedge funds over the
past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the longest-running bull market in history, John C. Natale
used their money to place high-stakes bets that there would be a
downturn, notably in technology stocks and their indexes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the time, I was shorting stocks in a rising market,''
Natale, 44, told state Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Falcone.
</P>
<P>
   To hide the mounting losses in his funds, Natale admitted he
created false audits, tax documents and monthly statements to his
investors showing strong returns.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the funds, called Cambridge Partners and Cambridge
Partners II, attracted more investors, allowing Natale to make good
on his inflated claims to those who cashed out, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   By his fraudulent reckoning, the funds were worth $50 million.
In reality, only $3 million remains, said the Long Branch man,
whose office was in Red Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities first learned of the fraud when Natale contacted the
state attorney general's office two weeks ago, prosecutors admit.
</P>
<P>
   A plea bargain was swiftly reached: Natale provided all his
records, pledged to cooperate, and agreed to repay the investors as
much as he could with the remaining money and his personal assets.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to three felony charges: securities fraud,
theft, and misappropriation of property.
</P>
<P>
   In return, prosecutors will recommend he be sentenced to no more
than 10 years in prison and be eligible for parole after four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are to be notified ''as soon as possible'' by a
court-appointed receiver who has taken control of the funds, state
Assistant Attorney General Kimberly McFadden Guadagno said.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver, James R. Zazzali, was named after Natale's plea by
state Superior Court Judge Benjamin R. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, who was state attorney general in the early 1980s under
Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, is to determine how much each investor lost
or gained, and whether those who made money might be required to
return a portion, Guadagno said.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali is to return to investors whatever money the state can
recover from Natale and the funds.
</P>
<P>
   One bright note for investors: some could get a tax refund since
their earnings were really losses.
</P>
<P>
   Natale remains free on $500,000 bail pending sentencing, set for
May 19.
</P>
<P>
   He was not available for comment after entering the plea.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Edward J. Plaza, told Falcone that Natale was
married with several children. Outside court, he declined to
elaborate on why Natale turned himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Natale said he was a graduate of St. John's University in New
York, and started Cambridge Partners in June 1992. It cost
investors $50,000 for one unit, although they could buy partial
units.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Partners II started in 1995, with units costing
$250,000 each, Natale said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are typically high-risk investment funds for wealthy
individuals and institutional investors who speculate on movements
in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like those managed and controlled by Natale, do not
register with stock regulators, which is permitted as long as they
do not advertise, state Deputy Attorney General Andrew L. Rossner
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors often learn of them from friends and
associates. Cambridge Partners II also had a high-tech booster: It
was listed on Web sites catering to hedge investors as a strong
performer, state investigators found.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loan Activity Studied  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A commission appointed by Congress to study
the International Monetary Fund and other lending agencies is
recommending that the IMF focus on short-term emergency loans to
countries in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The International Financial Institution Advisory Commission said
in a statement Friday that the 11-member panel unanimously
supported a proposal that the IMF restrict its efforts to
short-term relief for members having trouble meeting their
balance-of-payment obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current practice of extending long-term loans for poverty
relief or other purposes should end,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, pushing its own package of IMF
changes, also has recommended that the 182-nation institution leave
long-term development loans to its sister lending organization, the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In another unanimous vote, the advisory panel recommended that
the IMF, the World Bank and the various regional development banks
forgive all of the loans they are carrying to around 40 of the
world's poorest nations, many of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and World Bank, with the United States and other rich
countries, have launched initiatives to forgive a greater portion
of the debt owed by these nations than previous debt-relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The multinational agencies are not proposing to wipe out all the
debt as the commission did, in cases where the poor nations
demonstrate they are pursuing effective economic reform policies.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry O'Driscoll, staff director for the commission, said in
addition to unanimous recommendations, other parts of the
comprehensive report dealing with the future of the IMF and the
World Bank were approved on 8-3 votes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Driscoll refused to reveal those recommendations, saying they
have to be presented to Congress first. But he said the proposals
deal with ''extensive reforms'' of both the IMF and the World Bank.
The full report is to be released next Wednesday at a Capitol Hill
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, chaired by Alan Meltzer, an economics professor
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, was created by
Congress in 1998 as a condition for increasing U.S. financial
support to the IMF. Six members were appointed by House and Senate
Republican leaders and five by Democratic congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The three commission members who voted no on the final report
were appointed by Democrats -- C. Fred Bergsten, head of the
Washington think tank Institute for International Economics; Jerome
Levinson, a law professor at American University in Washington; and
former Democratic Rep. Esteban Torres of California.

<HEADLINE> Navy To Get EgyptAir Wreckage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators asked the Navy on Friday to
recover the remaining engine and more flight-control equipment from
the wreckage of an EgyptAir jet that crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean, killing all 217 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the plane has been recovered from the ocean
floor off the coast of Massachusetts, but officials close to the
investigation have said that examinations of the airliner's remains
have revealed no signs of mechanical failure that would have caused
the crash on Oct. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall has
disputed reports that investigators are increasingly convinced the
jet was crashed deliberately, saying his agency must conduct more
studies before they settle on a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''This effort is being undertaken to ensure that investigators
will have access to all available wreckage information that may
assist them in determining the cause,'' Hall said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An underwater survey of the debris after the December recovery
mission identified the possible location of other aircraft
components that might offer clues to investigators. The planned
recovery operation, which will take up to 10 days, is scheduled to
begin March 18. Once recovered, the additional parts of the Boeing
767 will be examined by investigators in Quonset Point, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have asked Boeing to help conduct tests, but an
NTSB source said some of that work has been delayed by a strike by
the company's engineers and technical workers.

<HEADLINE> Garcia Withdraws From MCI Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- A new European golf tournament
has prompted Sergio Garcia, and possibly Jean Van de Velde, to
withdraw from the MCI Classic next month.
</P>
<P>
   Both had said they would make their first appearance in the MCI
Classic, to be played April 10-16 at the Harbour Town Golf Links.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same week as the Seve Ballesteros Trophy, an
unofficial match-play event in Sunningdale, England, between
players from the British Isles and continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spoke with both of their agents and obviously both players
were under great pressure to play and represent their countries,''
MCI Classic tournament director Steve Wilmot said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Garcia confirmed he will play in the Ballesteros
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   But Van de Velde, the Frenchman who squandered a three-stroke
lead on the last hole of the British Open, said Friday evening he's
yet to make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde said he will wait until a meeting of the six PGA
tours at the end of the month before deciding which tournament
he'll enter.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue is the NEC Invitational, a $5 million
World Golf Championship event at Firestone limited to Ryder Cup and
Presidents Cup players.
</P>
<P>
   The European tour voted to change its qualifications in
non-Ryder Cup years by sending the top 12 players from its money
list. That likely would knock out Garcia, Van de Velde and two of
their Ryder Cup teammates -- Jesper Parnevik and Paul Lawrie -- who
are playing primarily in America this year.

<HEADLINE> Grieve, A's Reach $13M Deal  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Outfielder Ben Grieve wanted some long-term
financial security. The Oakland Athletics sought to lock up the
1998 AL Rookie of the Year in 1998 and gain a measure of cost
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they got what they were looking for Friday, when
Grieve agreed to a $13 million, four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, 23, who would have been eligible for arbitration after
this season, said he didn't want to worry about negotiating his
contract on a yearly basis. He also said he's unconcerned about the
possibility the market for baseball talent could take off again in
the coming years, leaving him with an undervalued deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always better to have some securitym and you just go out
and play and not worry about hitting 30 home runs or hitting .300
to get X-amount of dollars,'' he said. ''If I go out and play
better than the money I'm getting, that's just a bonus. I'll be
happy I'm playing better. And if I'm playing worse, I'll be happy
I'm making that much money. So, I'm happy either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, the fifth Oakland rookie to be picked for an AL All-Star
team, hit .288 with 18 home runs and 89 RBIs in 1998, tying an
Oakland record with 41 doubles and setting an Oakland team rookie
record for hits, 168.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start last year, Grieve came back to hit 28 home
runs and drove in 86 runs, helping the Athletics stay in the
pennant chase until the last couple of weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The former first-round draft pick hit .265 overall last year,
but batted .303 over his final 115 games. He had hit just .131 over
his first 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Billy Beane said Grieve deserved the long-term
contract and the signing was central to Oakland's desire to keep
its core of rising stars together. But it also had to be at a price
the A's could afford.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing I wanted to do in my tenure here is to have
drafted Ben with the (1994) second overall pick and see him walk in
three years,'' Beane said. ''So it's not just cost predictability
but what it represents. This is a sign that ownership is committed
to keeping the corps of young players here that we've drafted and
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to be in a situation where we're dealing with a
player of Ben's caliber on a year-to-year basis because we're then
subject to the volatility that exists in arbitration and eventually
free agency. So it is of the utmost importance that we have
planning, and this signing represents that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the long-term commitment to Grieve, the A's have seven
players with contracts that go beyond this season, including first
baseman Jason Giambi, second basemen Randy Velarde, designated
hitter John Jaha and pitchers Mike Magnante, T.J. Mathews and Omar
Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the club holds an option for 2001 on pitcher Gil
Heredia and outfielder Matt Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that was important is that Ben wanted to be here,''
A's president Mike Crowley said. ''He kind of validated what we're
trying to do here. The deal doesn't get done unless both sides want
it to get done and signing Ben sends a strong message to our
players our front office and staff and to our fans.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Florio maintains 2-1 lead with Democrats over unknownCorzine  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A new poll suggests Democrats still favor
former Gov. Jim Florio by a 2-to-1 margin over millionaire newcomer
Jon Corzine in the primary campaign for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is early in the race for the Democratic nomination. The
candidates' petitions for the June 6 primary are not even due for
another four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Rider University political analyst David Rebovich said he
would have expected to see Corzine a bit closer by now. ''He spent
$4 million already. I would have thought there would have been some
movement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These numbers do kind of reinforce that Florio not only has
broad name recognition, but broad acceptance from Democrats,''
Rebovich said. ''He also has a certain core constituency out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll by The Record of Hackensack, taken a week
ago and released Friday, asked Democrats how they would vote now.
Florio got 52 percent, Corzine only 18, and 30 percent said they
were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll interviewed registered voters, and the results
regarding Democrats have a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
In New Jersey, nonaffiliated voters can vote in any primary they
choose.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College poll released two weeks ago gave Florio a
57 percent to 22 percent lead over Corzine among those who
identified themselves as registered Democrats. The margin of error
for the survey of Democrats is 5.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Florio campaign was reserved in its response to the poll,
joyful at the winning result but cautious of the upward move
everyone expects from Corzine once his heaviest spending kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gov. Florio is delighted with the support the Democratic
primary voters are giving them. He is working very hard on a
retail, grassroots campaign to get his message on behalf of working
families out to the public,'' said spokesman Jim Lenard.
</P>
<P>
   Lenard said the campaign knows the race will tighten but is
surprised the lead has been this steady so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign said it was pleased that 38 percent of the
Democrats in the Record poll said they knew the candidate, although
only 24 percent of them had formed an opinion about him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our campaign is ecstatic about where we are in the campaign
right now,'' said campaign co-manager Steve Goldstein. ''Jon has
not aired a single TV commercial right now, yet one in five New
Jersey voters know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said Corzine has moved from utter anonymity to 18
percent support. ''That is a remarkable figure for a private
citizen who has not held office before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said Florio had a massive lead in polls simply because
people have heard his name before and know who he is. He said
negative views of the former governor, whose tax increases are
blamed for damaging his party in 1990, will topple the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jim Florio's popularity right now is a house of cards. If you
flick it, it will fall apart,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Private investors ante up $259M for waterfront project  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The final plans for Adriaen's Landing
link the downtown redevelopment project to a 40,000-seat football
stadium that will be built about three miles away in East Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland on Friday unveiled the latest version of
project designed to transform the city's waterfront into a
convention, entertainment and retail attraction by the summer of
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan I have forwarded to the Legislature moves this
project from concept to reality,'' said Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is being asked to commit $455 million in public
funds to the development, on the condition that at least $210
million in private investment can be raised.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference held across the street from the development
site, Rowland said investors have more than lived up to their end
of the bargain. The governor said the project has drawn about $295
million in corporate commitment from firms including People's Bank,
The Travelers and Phoenix Home Life Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope (lawmakers) get right to work on it,'' said the
governor. ''They have voted on part of this so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The project includes a 700-room convention center hotel and a
convention center. There are plans to build more than 260,000
square feet of entertainment and retail space and nearly 400
housing units. About 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100
permanent jobs are expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   Getting people to live downtown, said Rowland, ''will create a
vibrancy we've been trying to create for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been through several changes since first proposed
two years ago, and was expected to revolve around a waterfront
football stadium for the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots backed out of the deal last year, there was
talk of building a domed stadium on the site to house the
University of Connecticut's football program.
</P>
<P>
   But plans changed again when United Technologies Corp. donated
its 75-acre Rentschler Field in East Hartford for the UConn
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The school is upgrading up from Division I-AA to Division I-A
and needs at least a 35,000-seat stadium to make the transition.
UConn has applied to join the Big East. The NCAA has waived the
attendance requirement until the stadium is built.
</P>
<P>
   UConn football coach Randy Edsall said the renderings for the
open-air stadium gave him goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to be there the day they break ground on that,'' said
Edsall. ''Just knowing that you'll be standing on the sidelines and
selling that to potential student athletes, it gets your juices
going.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn Athletic Director Lew Perkins said the school hopes to
kick off in the new stadium in the fall of 2003 when it opens
against Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I feel this is the real deal,'' said Perkins. ''That
plan is unbelievable. It is a true partnership with UConn, the
state and East Hartford. Everyone is trying to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin
Sullivan said there's a sense the project may be at a critical fork
in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge project and there's a lot of money involved,''
Roy Occhiogrosso, spokesman for the senate Democrats. ''A full
commitment and a full-court press from the governor might help push
this thing in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mayor Mike Peters, the final plans means he'll finally have
some answers for his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a day has gone by when people stop and ask me 'what's
going on with Adriaen's Landing?' Finally we'll have a hole in the
ground and in the next four of five months we'll start building.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Workers End Strike  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Ending a threat to production in the
world's third-largest petroleum exporter, Venezuela's oil workers
called off a nationwide work stoppage Friday after just a few hours
away from the job.
</P>
<P>
   International oil prices are at nine-year highs. When the strike
began Friday morning, analysts said a long work interruption could
cut supply, putting further pressure on prices for gasoline and
heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   But late Friday afternoon, the strike against the state-owned
oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, was canceled. Carlos Ortega,
president of the country's largest union, said failure to suspend
it would have placed Venezuela's oil employees ''outside the law''
because of a new legislative decree.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, written by an assembly that revised Venezuela's
constitution last year, requires unions to choose new leaders
through open elections instead of the current practice of
hand-picking by party bosses. The decree went into effect Friday
when authorities published it in the Official Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   It was likely published as part of a government attempt to end
the strike. Ortega called the decree ''ominous'' and said it could
enable the government ''to begin a plan of massive firings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not willing to give them a pretext to do so and we have
decided to end the strike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez lashed out at the oil unions during a
televised speech Friday evening, saying they had been defeated in a
''thundering knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added a message to rank-and-file oil employees about
their union bosses: ''They all got rich at the cost of your
misery.''
</P>
<P>
   The work stoppage had been called to protest the state oil
company's refusal to sign a preliminary accord that would have
provided the basis for negotiations on a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   The last contract expired in November. Workers, who earn about
$300 to $450 per month, have demanded that their pay roughly be
doubled. The company is offering a raise about $30 per month and
also wants to lower required severance payments to dismissed
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and oil union leaders announced Tuesday
they had reached a preliminary deal on contract talks, but the
accord unraveled Wednesday when company President Hector Ciavaldini
said the company hadn't signed on.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what the next step in working out a
new contract might be.
</P>
<P>
   Ciavaldini and other company and government officials say they
do not want to negotiate until union leaders, whom they say are
linked to corrupt political parties, are replaced in democratic
elections. Union leaders deny allegations of corruption and say
Chavez is putting labor freedoms in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Oil accounts for about three-quarters of Venezuela's export
earnings. The country exports some 2.72 million barrels of oil per
day.

<HEADLINE> Customers expected to pick up Con Ed's shutdown cost  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The emergency shutdown of the Indian
Point 2 nuclear power plant is costing Con Edison $600,000 a day,
most of which will be passed on to ratepayers, the company
president said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Evans, Con Ed's president and chief operating officer,
announced the plan to recover costs as he testified at a state
Assembly hearing in White Plains City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed spokesman Robert Leonard said the company's 3 million
customers in New York City and Westchester could expect to see
increases averaging $2 a month in about three weeks. The utility is
permitted to recoup its costs whenever there's a plant shutdown and
it is forced to buy energy on the open market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, radioactive water leaked from one of the 13,000
tubes in Indian Point 2's steam generators in Buchanan, resulting
in a small discharge of radioactive steam into the atmosphere. The
increase in radioactivity was too small to be measured, but it
caused a shutdown and the first alert in the plant's 26-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky said that if Con Ed's ''corporate
decisions'' are found to be responsible for the shutdown,
''ratepayers should not have to get them off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For example, Con Ed might have failed to prudently replace
their steam generators,'' Brodsky said during a break in the
hearing. ''If so, there's no reason for consumers to suffer because
Con Ed was penny-pinching.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans confirmed that a corrosion crack was the probable cause of
the accident, and several Assembly members sharply questioned him
on why Con Ed had not replaced its steam generators, which are the
oldest of their type still in service in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed already owns replacements, but has not installed them
because of the $100 million cost and because the company has
learned to run the old generators safely by lowering temperatures
and altering water chemistry, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to go in and change the steam generators
prematurely,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Having spares on hand is insurance. Without them, the plant
could be down for 2{ years awaiting replacements when they're
needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky, however, compared the existing generators to a '75
Chevrolet -- ''at some point you just have to get it off the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And Evans acknowledged that the newer generators are closer to
state of the art. Their tubes, for example, are thermally treated
to reduce stress. But he said as long as the old ones meet safety
requirements, the right thing to do is leave them in place.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said repeatedly that Con Ed's ''top priority is to make
sure that Indian Point 2 operates safely and reliably as it has for
the past 26 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, that assertion brought a jeer from the audience,
and Brodsky once had to call for order.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Sandra Galef, whose district includes Indian
Point, asked Evans, ''Do you think we'd feel a little safer if we
had new steam generators?''
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' he said. ''I would not.''

<HEADLINE> Sports Agent Black Ponders Future  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Sports agent Tank Black pleaded
innocent to criminal fraud and money laundering charges Friday,
then left the courthouse free on $1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets back to his office in Columbia, S.C., there won't
be much of a business left to run.
</P>
<P>
   One of Black's few remaining big-name clients, Toronto Raptors
star Vince Carter, ''suspended'' his relationship with Black
pending the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Black could be sentenced to a jail term of up to
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a window open for a reunion between Carter and Black?
Neither Carter nor his mother, who manages his son's financial
affairs, said as much when they made the announcement Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Their only look forward was the announcement that they would not
interview prospective new agents until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish to make it clear that Vince will not entertain any
proposals for representation until after Aug. 1,'' Michelle
Carter-Robinson said. ''Anyone who makes such a proposal prior to
that time will be disqualified from consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was the cornerstone of Black's roster at Professional
Sports Management Inc., and as late as last week, the Raptors
forward made a public statement in support of Black.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's mother described the decision to temporarily sever ties
with Black as ''very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   It was surely even more painful to Black, who has seen most of
his clients defect, accusing him of scheming them out of millions
of dollars through a series of elaborate schemes.
</P>
<P>
   When his trial begins May 1, it should bring on a parade of NFL
players, many of whom used to be stars at the University of
Florida, which sits just a few miles west of the federal courthouse
in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   And if the 9{-hour detention hearing he endured is any
indicator, the trial should be engaging, if not out-and-out
combative.
</P>
<P>
   To prove he was a flight risk, federal prosecutors detailed
Black's alleged role in an unrelated Michigan drug case. They say
Black and his associate, Linda Wilson, helped Detroit-area drug
dealers launder money and escape the country.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Sanford called Black a ''liar''
and a ''cheat,'' but in the end conceded Black would probably
''stick around'' for the trial if the judge granted bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''But at some time, he'll run,'' Sanford predicted. ''He'll
fold. Because he has no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Using evidence obtained during a search of Black's office and
testimony from an indicted witness, Sanford alleged that Black and
Wilson laundered millions of dollars for the drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford claimed Wilson met in parking lots with money launderers
to hand over drug proceeds worth nearly $900,000, mostly in $10 and
$20 bills. The prosecutor alleged Black offered to ''clean up the
money'' for a service charge of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Black won the bond hearing because his attorney,
Peter George, was able to prove the agent had ''nowhere to go and
no way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Black's funds have been frozen due to a civil case filed
by the Securities and Exchanges Commission last week.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled for next week to unfreeze some of the
funds so Black can afford living expenses in Columbia, where he'll
have to adhere to a curfew and live under the watch of his pastor.

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Facility Vote Delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- City Council postponed a vote until next
week on a new practice facility for the Philadelphia Eagles after
shouting union members forced Friday's hearing to be recessed.
</P>
<P>
   The council is considering a bill, proposed by Mayor John F.
Street, that would guarantee that the city would pick up the cost
of a new practice facility if a deal for new stadiums isn't in
place by Nov. 3. The delay in the vote gives the Street
administration and council time to address concerns of some council
members on behalf of city workers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's brief hearing ended after Thomas Paine Cronin,
president of the AFSCME District Council 47, a union representing
5,500 white-collar city workers, urged council members not to vote
until the city workers' contracts were settled from this summer.
But workers from building trades unions, who want the jobs the
practice facility would create, shouted Cronan down.
</P>
<P>
   As the shouting continued, Council president Anna Verna recessed
the hearing. The council meets again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During a luncheon promoting the upcoming NCAA women's Final
Four, Street emphasized the importance of building new stadiums and
investing money to attract major events to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need new stadiums to help us compete,'' Street said.

<HEADLINE> Starks Stuck With Bulls For Now  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- John Starks is stuck with the Chicago
Bulls. For now.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Kenneth Dam said Friday he didn't have the
jurisdiction to rule on Starks' unusual request to leave the Bulls
and join a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   Starks offered to forfeit the rest of his $4 million salary if
the Bulls would waive him, clearing the way for him to sign with a
team headed for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The case will likely now go to a grievance arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't talk about that right now,'' Starks said when reached
at his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Starks made it clear when he was traded to Chicago from Golden
State last month that, at age 34, he wanted to play for a
contender. Bulls general manager Jerry Krause tried to trade Starks
before last week's deadline, but there were no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Starks then asked to be released, saying he was willing to give
up roughly $900,000 in salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this team was in the playoff race, I'd love to be here. No
question,'' he said Thursday night. ''But that's not the case. ...
Every player that plays the game wants to win a championship. I'm
no different.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks and Miami Heat were interested in adding him
if he won his case, several league sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The players union argued that, if Starks was willing to give up
his salary, the league shouldn't stand in his way of joining a team
with a shot at a championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the league countered there is no provision in the collective
bargaining agreement for such a move, so it shouldn't be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Dam agreed with the league, saying it hadn't circumvented the
collective bargaining agreement. But if the league didn't
circumvent the rules, Dam said, the case should be heard by a
grievance arbitrator. Dam is a system arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears very likely this matter will be brought up before
the grievance arbitrator within the next week,'' union spokesman
Dan Wasserman said.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is happy with Dam's decision, spokesman Brian McIntyre
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt the rules were upheld and we have to be consistent for
all 29 teams,'' he said. ''You can't be changing rules in the
middle of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls can still release Starks and let him sign with another
team, but they'd have to pay the remainder of his salary. Starks
would still be shut out of the playoffs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Players released after 11:59 p.m. on March 1 who then sign with
another team are not eligible to compete in the playoffs. Starks
wanted his release retroactive to Wednesday night to make him
eligible for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bulls certainly accept the system arbitrator's decision
that this is a matter for the grievance arbitrator,'' Krause said
in a statement. ''Accordingly, in the meantime, we retain John
Starks until the matter is resolved. He is a professional and we
expect him to act as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks sat out Chicago's last three games with what was said to
be tendinitis in his left knee. He has promised that, if he stays
with the Bulls, he won't cause any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would just have to be here. That's just how it goes,'' he
said Thursday. ''Once I stepped in a Bulls uniform, I'm a Bull
through and through until I leave.''

<HEADLINE> Group: Texas Low In Cancer Screens  </HEADLINE>
BY KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While George W. Bush criticizes John McCain
for not supporting breast cancer programs, Bush's own state ranks
low on breast-cancer screening. And it has the nation's highest
percentage of women without health insurance, a private group says.
</P>
<P>
   Four in ten women over 50 in Texas have not had a mammogram in
the past two years, according to a report by an Austin, Texas-based
coalition of women's' health groups.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas is last among states ranked for the number of
uninsured women, with nearly 22 percent of women having no health
coverage, according to a study by the Institute for Women's Policy
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Campaign for Women's' Health, a coalition of 50 local
groups, estimates that 1.7 million women in the state are not
covered. Women without health insurance are less likely to get
checkups and screenings, said Peggy Romberg, executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't support the group's request for $40 million in state
funds for breast cancer exams, a program that had won the backing
of the state health commission, said Romberg.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett disputed her account,
saying the governor's budget director met with Romberg and
supported the group's request, although it was made after Bush
submitted his budget to the legislature without such funding.
Lawmakers didn't approve the late request, Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop Friday at a breast cancer research center in
New York, Bush said he hadn't provided funds for breast cancer
research in Texas because ''most of the money comes from the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign says the governor has a strong record on women's
health. He began a breast cancer awareness program and signed bills
requiring HMOs to cover minimum hospital stays after mastectomies.
Texas' 1999 budget provides $110 million in new funds for a cancer
center, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began running a TV ad in New York this week accusing McCain
of opposing women's' health programs. In the ad, a breast cancer
survivor says McCain opposed funding for two breast cancer programs
in New York and dismissed them as ''garden variety pork'' spending.
</P>
<P>
   The two examples cited in the ad came from a list of 800
programs costing $13 billion that McCain objected to in this year's
budget increase.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that he voted at least 10 times for appropriations
that included money for cancer research and that he cosponsored
bills setting standards for mammography testing equipment and
requiring insurers to cover minimum hospital stays for
mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   His allies demanded an apology from Bush, noting that McCain's
sister -- Sandy McCain Morgan -- has been diagnosed with breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's own state does better than Texas by some measures of
women's health, but still ranks lower than many states.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Arizona ranked 23rd out of 50 states for breast
cancer screenings in 1997, with 74 percent of women over 50 getting
mammograms, according to a government study. In that study, Texas
ranked 41st with 68 percent getting the exams.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was 44th in a ranking of uninsured women, with 17
percent of the state's females lacking health insurance, according
to the Institute for Women's Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and Texas both rank slightly below the national average
in breast cancer deaths, with each having about 23 deaths per
100,000 people, according to data from the American Cancer Society.
The national average is 25.4 deaths per 100,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Judge rejects middle-income challenge to school funding system  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS MARTELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A state Superior Court judge has rejected a
lawsuit from 42 middle-income school districts who wanted to
overturn New Jersey's school funding system because it relies too
heavily on property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision handed down nearly two years after the lawsuit was
filed, state Superior Court Judge Paulette Sapp-Peterson ruled that
because the courts have not used funds as the only yardstick for
fairness in education, the challenge to the school funding law
''raises no issues of constitutional significance.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the school districts, however, said the ruling
will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit argued that by relying so heavily on property taxes,
New Jersey's system of funding public schools unfairly charged some
property taxpayers more than others for the same basic education.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by 42 middle-income school districts and
seven taxpayers in response to the long-standing legal dispute over
how New Jersey should fund education. New Jersey has had a long
tug-of-war over how it should pay for poor, largely urban school
districts designated as having ''special needs.'' For years, the
funding of the poorest districts was compared to that in the
richest districts. A new school funding law increased state aid to
the poorer districts, and promises to make tangible changes in
areas such as curriculum and offerings for preschool.
</P>
<P>
   All through this debate, middle-income districts complained they
were being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years we've been hearing from the governor that if you've
got a property tax problem, it's a local problem,'' said David
Coates, attorney for the districts. ''But what we've seen in these
districts is a shift in responsibility from the state to the
property taxpayers. When the governor says it's a local problem,
that's nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates used the East Windsor school district as an example,
saying that over the past 15 years the state's contribution to the
district's budget shrank from 49 percent to about 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Peretzman, spokesman for the state Department of
Education, said state aid to schools increases every year, and that
''a significant amount goes to districts of all types.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe our funding formula is fair and equitable, and that
some recent changes we've made will make it fairer and more
equitable,'' Peretzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-income districts were seeking to have the state's
system of school funding declared unconstitutional. If a court
agreed with that, Coates said, then the Legislature would have to
figure out a new funding scheme. When the lawsuit was filed two
years ago, forcing the state to pay for at least half of the cost
for school districts would have cost about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's sky-high property taxes have long been a cause for
concern in the state, but lawmakers and governors have not favored
shifting the property tax burden to another tax, such as the sales
or income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said the fact that some property taxpayers are forced to
pay more than others based on the wealth of their communities
''raises a constitutional question.'' He said the law turns the
state's constitutional requirement that each child receive a
''thorough and efficient'' education into a series of unfunded
mandates that must be picked up by property taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In her decision, Sapp-Peterson relied on the state Supreme Court
decisions on school funding for poor districts. She said the court
allowed some spending disparity to exist, as long as poor students
were guaranteed a thorough and efficient education.

<HEADLINE> Artist to recreate Amistad slave ship for church, travels to S.C.  </HEADLINE>
By JOY RUSSELL PEREZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An artist who hopes his bronze sculptures of
slaves will help sway the debate over the flying of the Confederate
flag in South Carolina has won a commission from a Plainfield
church to create a replica of part of the Amistad slave ship.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Jackson, 38, of Maplewood, and the Rev. James Colvin of
the United Church of Christ in Plainfield said they reached an
agreement for Jackson to create the permanent artwork there.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 45 percent of our church is African-American, and we
wanted a great symbol for them in the church,'' Colvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the project are not finalized, the belly of
the slave ship will be made of wood from South Carolina and will
have three nylon sails that can be lowered and raised, Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin said he is scheduled to meet with other church leaders to
discuss the large-scale project and fund raising for it. The
project is estimated to cost $30,000 and would take several weeks
to complete, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Jackson will travel to Columbia, S.C., with 100
of his two-foot-long bronze sculptures, which depict slaves as they
appeared aboard the ships that brought them from Africa, lying
prone, wrists and ankles bound in chains, wearing only a loin
cloth. He plans to present 50 copies to Gov. Jim Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   His aim is to persuade leaders in South Carolina to remove the
Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome in Columbia, where
Jackson was raised.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina NAACP Conference of Branches and the Black
Caucus of South Carolina are trying to arrange a one-day exhibition
of Jackson's work in the Statehouse rotunda, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jackson exhibited his Slave Series sculptures at his
South Orange gallery, attracting about 200 guests.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the statues came from watching the Steven
Spielberg film ''Amistad,'' he said. The 1997 movie depicts the
trial of 53 Mende tribesmen kidnapped from the West African country
of Sierra Leone and sold into slavery. They later rebelled aboard
the Spanish ship La Amistad off the coast of Cuba, seized the ship
and killed two crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   For hours during his exhibit, Jackson lay on termite-infested
wood which came from an East Orange church that had been heavily
damaged in a fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a changed man,'' said Jackson after the event. ''I don't
know how people could've been in that position for so long with
chains on them. I had splinters in my back and legs. I don't ever
want to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is selling the bronze slave statues for $300
apiece, said he earned enough after the exhibit to pay the
gallery's overdue utility bill of about $4,000.

<HEADLINE> Accused Algerian Trial Moved to L.A.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The trial of Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian accused of
bringing explosive materials into the country from Canada, was
moved Friday from Seattle to Los Angeles because of publicity over
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Ressam, 32, had argued that a fair trial in
Seattle would be impossible because of ''pervasive and ongoing''
publicity. Prosecutors argued that none of the news coverage of
Ressam had reported pejoratively about his background.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Coughenour granted the defense request,
and the trial is scheduled to begin July 10 in Los Angeles, said
Harold Malkin, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news coverage has included a high degree of speculation,
an assumption of guilt, and a focus on possible local targets,''
Coughenour wrote. ''In particular, (it) repeatedly conveys the
sense that anyone in Seattle might have been a victim of a narrowly
averted terrorist attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 for allegedly crossing from
Victoria, British Columbia, to Washington state with explosives and
timing devices in his rental car. He has pleaded innocent to
charges that he conspired to blow up targets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam had a one-night reservation at a motel near Seattle's
Space Needle, and the fears that the link created were cited as one
reason for the cancellation of the New Year's bash there.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Changing Meat Departments  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Seven butchers who took on the nation's biggest
retailer by joining a union are facing an uncertain future now that
Wal-Mart has decided to replace meat cutting departments at 180
stores with prepackaged meat.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the butchers at the Jacksonville, Texas Wal-Mart
voted 7-3 to join the United Food and Commercial Workers, the first
successful union vote in the country at a Wal-Mart, a company well
known for its opposition to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials hoped the vote in the tiny Texas town southeast
of Dallas would be a precursor to other successful elections, but
now they face a legal fight to make the election stick.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, with about 885,000 workers in 2,985 U.S. stores, is
the nation's biggest private employer. The company is so opposed to
unionization of its workers that, during the past holiday season it
barred Salvation Army charity workers from its stores after union
organizers demanded that they be allowed in as well.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Friday that it has been planning for months to
replace the butchers in its Supercenters with meat cut and wrapped
by outside suppliers, said spokeswoman Jessica Moser, from
Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our decision to expand case-ready meat has nothing to do with
what went on Jacksonville,'' Moser said. Prepackaged meat ''has a
better appearance and longer shelf life'' and is easier to track
inventory. The displaced workers will be offered other jobs at
their stores, Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   The butchers aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just remodeled our store. They spent about $40,000 on a
new wrapping machine. They just got new pans to hold the meat,''
said Maurice Miller. ''If they'd been thinking about this for
months, why would they spend all that money?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a 45-year-old meat cutter, was on the winning side of
last month's election to Local 540 of the United Food and
Commercial Workers. Local and national union officials said
Wal-Mart's decision to abolish the meat departments was a direct
response to the Jacksonville vote, along with a pending election at
its store in Palestine, Texas, and organizing efforts at about 20
Wal-Marts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a ploy by Wal-Mart. It's an attempt to demoralize
the workers,'' said John Rene Rodriguez, a Dallas-based business
agent for the local. ''Wal-Mart has always been anti-union.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart officials announced their plan to close meat-cutting
operations during a hearing Monday before a unit of the National
Labor Relations Board. Wal-Mart has argued to federal labor
regulators -- thus far unsuccessfully -- that all 300 store employees
in Jacksonville, and not just the meat cutters, should have been
able to vote on joining a union. Now it insists that union
officials took improper actions to influence the Jacksonville vote.
A labor board hearing is scheduled for March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials accused Wal-Mart Friday of violating federal
labor law. Greg Denier, a union spokesman in Washington, said
Wal-Mart cannot legally eliminate meat-cutting operations in
Jacksonville without first negotiating with the 10 employees and
the union. He said the union will file an unfair labor practices
complaint with the labor board and, if it loses there, take the
retailer to court.
</P>
<P>
   But a Washington lawyer who represents employers defended
Wal-Mart's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's well-established that employers have prerogatives about
basic business decisions,'' said Mark A. de Bernardo, a managing
partner of Littler Mendelson, the country's largest employer law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legally is this an option for Wal-Mart? Yes, recognizing that
the timing is going to raise some eyebrows,'' de Bernardo said.
</P>
<P>
   The meat-cutting departments that will close in May or June are
located in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas and
Missouri. Moser, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company plans
to switch entirely to prepackaged meat at all its 700 Supercenters,
but she said there is no timetable for eliminating butchers at the
remaining stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has drawn fire before for letting its corporate
ideology be a part of its stores' operations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance it been criticized by Planned Parenthood refusing
to sell morning-after birth-control pills. Music companies
complained about its ban of some rap CDs. Wal-Mart said the albums
were offensive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A municipal judge has been accused of taking
bribes to fix cases in the latest indictment to come out of a
federal probe into organized crime in Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoning County Court Judge Martin Emrich, 44, of Youngstown,
was indicted on charges of racketeering and conspiracy to
extortion, U.S. Attorney Emily Sweeney said Friday in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
   Emrich solicited and sometimes received money or another form of
payment to influence his decisions in criminal cases, according to
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   He also is accused of getting landscaping materials and services
for his home in return for fixing a driving under the influence
charge against an associate of Lenine Strollo, a convicted mob
boss.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was not at his office Friday. A telephone message was
left with a member of his staff. A message left for his lawyer,
John Juhasz, was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Youngstown, a northeast Ohio city, has for decades had a
reputation as a haven for organized crime and was once nicknamed
''Crime Town U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation has resulted in more than 50
convictions since 1997.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The final plans for Adriaen's Landing
link the downtown redevelopment project to a 40,000-seat football
stadium that will be built about three miles away in East Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland on Friday unveiled the latest version of
project designed to transform the city's waterfront into a
convention, entertainment and retail attraction by the summer of
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan I have forwarded to the Legislature moves this
project from concept to reality,'' said Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is being asked to commit $455 million in public
funds to the development, on the condition that at least $210
million in private investment can be raised.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference held across the street from the development
site, Rowland said investors have more than lived up to their end
of the bargain. The governor said the project has drawn about $295
million in corporate commitment from firms including People's Bank,
The Travelers and Phoenix Home Life Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope (lawmakers) get right to work on it,'' said the
governor. ''They have voted on part of this so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The project includes a 700-room convention center hotel and a
convention center. There are plans to build more than 260,000
square feet of entertainment and retail space and nearly 400
housing units. About 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100
permanent jobs are expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   Getting people to live downtown, said Rowland, ''will create a
vibrancy we've been trying to create for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been through several changes since first proposed
two years ago, and was expected to revolve around a waterfront
football stadium for the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots backed out of the deal last year, there was
talk of building a domed stadium on the site to house the
University of Connecticut's football program.
</P>
<P>
   But plans changed again when United Technologies Corp. donated
its 75-acre Rentschler Field in East Hartford for the UConn
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The school is upgrading up from Division I-AA to Division I-A
and needs at least a 35,000-seat stadium to make the transition.
UConn has applied to join the Big East. The NCAA has waived the
attendance requirement until the stadium is built.
</P>
<P>
   UConn football coach Randy Edsall said the renderings for the
open-air stadium gave him goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to be there the day they break ground on that,'' said
Edsall. ''Just knowing that you'll be standing on the sidelines and
selling that to potential student athletes, it gets your juices
going.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn Athletic Director Lew Perkins said the school hopes to
kick off in the new stadium in the fall of 2003 when it opens
against Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I feel this is the real deal,'' said Perkins. ''That
plan is unbelievable. It is a true partnership with UConn, the
state and East Hartford. Everyone is trying to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin
Sullivan said there's a sense the project may be at a critical fork
in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge project and there's a lot of money involved,''
Roy Occhiogrosso, spokesman for the senate Democrats. ''A full
commitment and a full-court press from the governor might help push
this thing in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mayor Mike Peters, the final plans means he'll finally have
some answers for his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a day has gone by when people stop and ask me 'what's
going on with Adriaen's Landing?' Finally we'll have a hole in the
ground and in the next four of five months we'll start building.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Release Columbine Tapes  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Videotapes, diaries and lists made by two
teen-age gunmen before they stormed Columbine High School cannot be
released to the public so long as they contain the identity of a
student, a judge ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year-old woman sued Jefferson County authorities to
prevent the release of the material compiled by Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold on the grounds that publicity would put her in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes initially were viewed by a Time magazine reporter who
wrote of their contents. Other reporters, and victims' families,
then were allowed to see the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed under the anonymous name ''Michelle Doe,'' is
one of three ongoing suits that concern the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's hearing, Judge Ruthanne Polidori extended an
order she issued in January, preventing authorities from releasing
the gunmen's material if it contained the student's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said authorities do not expect
to release the tapes or other evidence until all three cases are
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators collected the tapes and other evidence after the
April 20 massacre, the worst school shooting in U.S. history.
Harris and Klebold killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves.
Both had suggested they would avenge the slights and insults they
had received from other students.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate hearing, Philip Duran, 23, was charged with
contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allegedly supplying
a handgun and a sawed-off shotgun to Klebold and Harris. He earlier
pleaded innocent to supplying a minor with a handgun and possessing
the shotgun.

<HEADLINE> FDA: Gene Therapy Rules Violated  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration accused a
University of Pennsylvania researcher Friday of violating safety
regulations in a gene therapy experiment in which a patient died.
</P>
<P>
   In a stern warning letter, the FDA said that Dr. James M. Wilson
of the University of Pennsylvania ''violated regulations governing
the proper conduct of clinical studies'' in a series of gene
therapy experiments designed to correct a liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson headed a gene therapy experimental study that was halted
after the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger of Tucson, Ariz. The
teen-ager is the first patient known to have died as a direct
result of a gene therapy experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter, the FDA ordered Wilson and the University of
Pennsylvania's Institute for Human Gene Therapy to continue
cessation of all current human experimental drug trials and not to
apply for new studies until ''corrective actions have been
implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   A warning letter is an FDA procedure that notifies a researcher
or institution of what the agency considers to be violations of
federal law. It means that unless the offending actions are
corrected, the agency can take some enforcement action without
further notice.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania said in a statement that it takes
the FDA letter ''extremely seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the university had already answered many of
the allegations contained in the letter and was ''disappointed''
that the FDA discounted or rejected those earlier responses.
</P>
<P>
   The warning letter said the university had 15 days to report on
steps it plans to correct the violations.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger suffered from an inherited liver condition caused by a
genetic flaw. He was enrolled in an experiment designed to test if
such disorders can be corrected with new genes. In the experiment,
a virus modified to carry the corrective gene was infused directly
into the liver.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager died last September just four days after he was
injected with the gene therapy drug. An autopsy report blamed his
death on the effects of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-page letter sent to Wilson said than an inspection showed
that the University of Pennsylvania researchers failed to properly
report serious reactions experienced by patients who had the gene
therapy before Gelsinger.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also said the university failed to make a timely
report about the death of at least two lab monkeys in similar gene
therapy experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The warning letter accused the university of:
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to properly report changes in the experimental
protocol. Among the changes was elimination of a provision to stop
the experiment if two patients experienced serious liver toxicity.
''These protocol revisions reflect significant changes that affect
the safety of study subjects,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to immediately notify or properly report serious
adverse reactions in four patients. An annual report by the
university, the letter said, ''misrepresented the true nature of
the toxicities experienced by these four subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   --Enrollment of new patients in the experiments using higher
doses despite adverse reactions experienced by earlier patients at
lower doses. ''Your actions demonstrate a disregard for the
protocol stopping rules you had agreed to follow that were designed
to protect the safety of study subjects,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to properly report liver damage found in a laboratory
monkey even though the results suggested ''a significant risk for
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to revise informed consent documents for new patients
after some earlier patients had serious side effects. This meant,
the letter said, that some patients were not told ''new information
about the possible risks of participation.''
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to properly conduct the required laboratory tests on
patients either before or after the experiment. ''We conclude that
the (institute) did not exert due diligence to ensure that the
follow-up tests were performed according to the protocol,'' the
letter said.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Ken Griffey Jr.'s first game in a Cincinnati Reds'
uniform was
somewhat underwhelming.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Griffey singled and struck out twice as the Minnesota Twins beat
the Reds 5-3 on Friday in a split-squad game in Sarasota, Fla. And
just 3,439 showed up at 7,500-seat Ed Smith Stadium on a sunny
afternoon to watch Griffey's debut. Many fans wore Junior's No. 30
jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fine,'' said Griffey, acquired from Seattle on Feb. 10.
''Get my two or three at-bats like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't be that big of a deal,'' he said, his cap
backward and arms folded across his chest. ''I don't want to sit
there under a microscope every day. I just want to play ball and be
part of this team, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou did provide some sparks in Vero Beach, Fla.,
homering on his first pitch following a 17-month layoff,.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the second, Alou drove a fastball from loser Mike
Judd over the right-center field fence, the first of four Houston
homers in a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who hit .312 with 38 homers and 124 RBIs with the Astros
in 1998, missed all of last year after falling off a treadmill and
tearing the interior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He had
surgery exactly a year ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like I told Baggy on the ride here, it was a special day for
me today,'' Alou said, referring to teammate Jeff Bagwell. ''A year
ago, I was in surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look back on all the hard work I did in the offseason, it
paid off. I've been swinging the bat pretty good this spring. My
knee feels good. I am satisfied with the results so far, maybe a
little surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, hardly looking like he missed an entire
season, had two hits and two RBIs as the Atlanta Braves defeated
the Kansas City Royals 7-3 in Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga started his second exhibition game in a row after
sitting out last season while undergoing successful treatment for
cancer in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Cat lined a two-out single to right in the first inning,
driving in the Braves' first run. He came through again in the
third, singling to left to give the Braves a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told myself when I got my first hit of the spring, I would
be ready,'' said Galarraga, who played first and batted fifth for
the first three innings. ''I got two hits, so I guess I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jupiter, Fla., new Mets ace Mike Hampton had a rough outing
in New York's 5-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Hampton, in his
first game in a Mets' uniform, allowed four runs and five hits in
two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''My location was bad,'' said Hampton, acquired from Houston in
a December trade. ''That's normal for everybody this time of year.
This is typical, about where I was at this time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Cardinals' big hits off Hampton went to the opposite
field. Fernando Tatis had a two-out, RBI single in the first. In
the second, Mark McGwire had an RBI single to right and Ray
Lankford got a two-run double when left fielder Jay Payton missed a
shoetop catch.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Phillies 12, Indians 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., Chuck Finley, signed away from Anaheim for
$27 million over three years, was perfect in his first spring
outing for the Indians, retiring six straight batters with three
strikeouts.
Tigers 5, Pirates 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Rob Fick hit a two-run homer and Dean Palmer
a solo shot for Detroit. Dave Mlicki, who won a career-best 14
games for Detroit last season, started and allowed three hits in
two innings.
Orioles 6, Reds (ss) 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Calvin Maduro and Mike Timlin each
threw two scoreless innings, and Jeff Conine hit a two-run single
in the seventh.
Devil Rays 6, Marlins 5:
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., former-Marlin Randy Winn hit a
three-run homer with one out in the bottom of the ninth off Armando
Almanza.
Twins (ss) 10, Rangers 9:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Jon Schaeffer singled home the winning run
off Chuck Smith in the ninth. It was the first win of any kind for
Minnesota against Texas in two years. The Twins lost all 13
meetings with the Rangers last year, going 0-9 during the regular
season.
Blue Jays 7, Yankees 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Tampa, Fla., Andy Pettitte allowed two runs and four hits in
2 1-3 innings Friday. Toronto's Alberto Castillo had an RBI single
in the sixth inning, giving him four RBIs in two days against New
York, and Chad Mottola had a two-run double during a three-run
seventh-inning. Jim Leyritz had a solo homer for the Yankees.
Angels 8, Mariners 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Mo Vaughn, who needed 57 at-bats to hit his
first home run last spring, connected on his first pitch this year,
a 400-foot drive off Jamie Moyer.
Rockies 10, Diamondbacks (ss) 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Terry Shumpert's three-run triple highlighted
a seven-run fourth. Five Rockies pitchers combined to limit the
Diamondbacks to four hits.
Padres 13, Giants 12:
</P>
<P>
   At Scottsdale, Ariz., Barry Bonds went 2-for-2 with two RBIs and
hit his first home run of the spring, a towering drive off winter
workout partner Dan Serafini.
Cubs 14, White Sox (ss) 12:
</P>
<P>
   At Mesa, Ariz., Julio Zuleta hit two towering home runs, and
Mark Grace also homered and had five RBIs as Cubs rallied from a
6-0 deficit.
White Sox (ss) 6, Diamondbacks (ss) 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Melvin Rosario doubled and scored on a
throwing error in the 10th. Joe Crede's two-out, two-run homer gave
the White Sox a 5-4 lead in the ninth, but a two-out single by
non-roster infielder Cesar Morillo tied it in the bottom half.
Athletics 9, Brewers 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Bo Porter hit a three-run double and Jorge Velandia
a two-run homer to lead Oakland. Ben Grieve, who earlier in the day
agreed to a $13 million, four-year contract, went 1-for-3 with
three RBIs. Jose Hernandez hit a two-run homer for the Brewers.

<HEADLINE> Temple's Lyde Suspended Over Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Temple center Kevin Lyde was suspended
Friday while the university investigates possible NCAA rules
violations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Lyde's family or his AAU coach paid for a
high school summer course he took in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Immediately upon receiving a phone call from a Washington Post
reporter early Thursday evening, March 2, Temple began an
investigation,'' athletic director Dave O'Brien said Friday in a
statement. ''We immediately reached out to the NCAA and the
Atlantic 10 Conference, and have engaged an outside law firm
specializing in NCAA matters to get all the facts and put this
matter to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The school said Lyde would miss Saturday's game against George
Washington, the regular-season finale for No. 5 Temple
</P>
<P>
   Lyde, a native of Washington, D.C., came to Temple as a freshman
in 1998 out of Oak Hill Academy in Virginia. He has started 24
games this season for Temple (22-5).

<HEADLINE> NCAA Reinstates St. John's Barkley  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- St. John's sophomore guard Erick Barkley, who
missed three games this season for two NCAA rules violations, was
reinstated Friday and will be available for the 18th-ranked Red
Storm's regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's was forced to declare its leading scorer ineligible
last Tuesday, and he missed that night's victory over Seton Hall --
the Red Storm's eighth in a row. The NCAA requested further
information regarding payment of part of Barkley's tuition at Maine
Central Institute for the 1997-98 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was reinstated, Barkley must give back $3,500 of his
tuition, which is approximately $22,000. The restitution is for the
amount St. John's said Barkley received from Riverside Church, a
New York AAU program for which he played. He can donate the money
to a charity of his choice, and has until his eligibility expires
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm (21-6) play at Miami on Sunday, then have a
first-round bye for next week's Big East tournament at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's coach Mike Jarvis said the team's mood was
considerably better than it was earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one was doing cartwheels but everyone was happy,'' he said.
''I would say they were temporarily relieved. It's like playing a
game. It's not over until the fat lady sings and I haven't heard
her sing yet. The clock still has time on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who averages 16.7 points per game, was suspended for
three games by the NCAA in early February for exchanging vehicles
with a family friend. After an appeal, that punishment was reduced
to two games.
</P>
<P>
   The first two games he missed -- Boston College and Providence --
were the first of the team's current eight-game winning streak.
After he returned, he was a key part of the Red Storm's impressive
victory run over ranked opponents Syracuse, Connecticut and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis credited the players for the way they have handled the
emotional ups and downs off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been fantastic. They've basically made it as
enjoyable as it's ever been as far as coaching goes,'' he said.
''I've found myself being a fan of theirs more than I normally
would be because of the maturity level and how they take care of
business. They seem really focused and workmanlike yet they are
still having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's was rebuked by the NCAA last week over the Barkley
case. NCAA president Cedric Dempsey issued a statement saying the
school had incorrectly portrayed that it had been treated unfairly
during the second investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis still feels there can be a positive result from the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day we've been spending time dealing with things you
shouldn't have to deal with,'' he said. ''What can make this
enjoyable is even the possibility of being involved in what has to
happen inevitably, change, positive change. If that's the end
result it will all be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati freshman DerMarr Johnson was suspended one game last
month and also ordered to make restitution for money he was given
to help with his tuition at Maine Central Institute.

<HEADLINE> Dragila Sets World Pole Vault Mark  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- For the third time this season, Stacy Dragila set
the world indoor pole vault record. For the first time, she
collected a bonus -- $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila's latest record-smashing performance of 15 feet, 1}
inches came Friday night during the USA Track and Field
Championships at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there's more to come,'' the exhausted Dragila said
after breaking her record by one-quarter inch on her first attempt,
then missing three times at 15-5. ''It's right there. I'm
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragila's first try at 15-5 wasn't close, but her final two
efforts were strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like I was rushing those last three jumps,'' she said.
''I didn't feel patient when I got upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, she had trouble at some lower heights.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't come into the competition until the bar was at 13-6\.
She cleared that height on her second attempt, went over 13-10 on
her first try, and missed once each at 14-2, 14-6 and 15-0 before
clearing,
</P>
<P>
   ''My jumps at the lower heights were cruddy,'' Dragila said.
''It was a long competition (because of the field of 26). I waited
more than an hour to come in. My adrenaline was running fast. It
took a while for me to calm down and feel the jumps. My last three
jumps probably were my best. I really felt those.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragila was the first woman vaulter to leap 15 feet indoors Feb.
19 at Pocatello, Idaho. Later in that meet, she improved the record
to 15-1{, before missing three times at 16-0. Those big jumps
earned no financial rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money was a bonus tonight,'' Dragila said. ''I was looking
for the heights.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14th-place finisher, Samantha Shepard, a high school
sophomore from Weston, Mass., bettered the scholastic record of
12-10, clearing 13-0\, but it won't be considered a record because
it didn't come during a high school meet.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's other finals, Adrien Sawyer won her first national
title, taking the women's long jump at 21-5{, and LaVar Anderson
captured his first U.S. championship, soaring 55-5{ in the men's
triple jump.
</P>
<P>
   In other events, Jearl Miles-Clark, the 1993 world indoor
champion at 400 meters, ran the fastest time in the world this year
in winning her preliminary heat at 51.36, and 39-year-old Johnny
Gray, winner of seven outdoor titles in the 800 but seeking his
first indoor championship, qualified for Saturday's final with a
second-place finish in his heat at 1:50.56.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Carlette Guidry, attempting a sweep of the women's 60 and
200, won her 200 preliminary heat at 23.05, the fastest time among
the qualifiers, and Hazel Clark, a three-time NCAA indoor champion
at 800 meters while at Florida, led the qualifiers into Saturday's
final, winning her heat at 2:05.80.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer's success was a victory for perseverance and
determination.
</P>
<P>
   She was born with a dislocated left hip, an injury that wasn't
noticed until she was about 9 months old when her parents saw that
she always was turning her left foot in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't supposed to even walk,'' Sawyer said. ''I'm a miracle
child.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sawyer was just over a year old, doctors recommended that
she wear a brace on her left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, now both preachers, told her not to use the brace.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, her parents were playing music at home when
the ''miracle'' occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got on a table and stood up,'' said Sawyer, a former Big 12
champion while at Texas A&AMP;M. ''I guess I was destined to do track
and field.''

<HEADLINE> Fired Pageant Executive Sues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The former head of the Miss America
Pageant has sued to try to force pageant officials to drop a
longtime ban on contestants who've been married or had abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Beck, who was fired in September as the pageant's
chief executive officer, sued the pageant on Jan. 10 for wrongful
termination. Beck's lawsuit also asks a court to order Miss America
officials to eliminate the 50-year-old ban.
</P>
<P>
   David B. Frisch, chairman of the pageant Board of Directors, one
of those named in the lawsuit, declined comment Friday because of
the pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In his Superior Court lawsuit, Beck said the rules should be
changed to include divorcees or women who've had abortions to
comply with New Jersey laws against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In September, pageant officials quietly adopted the changes
proposed by Beck, but quickly dropped them after a firestorm
erupted against them. Beck, who had two years remaining on his
contract, was fired two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling in favor of Beck could have far-reaching implications
for the pageant. After the changes were approved in the fall, state
pageants took the Miss America Organization to court to block them,
and former Miss Americas and current contestants spoke out against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Beck sued the pageant and its board members, accusing them of
retaliating against him for telling them that the contestant
contracts violated state anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant then refused to pay him the severance pay called for
in his employment contract, according to the lawsuit filed on
Beck's behalf by lawyer Linda Kenney.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney did not return a telephone message left at her office
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Guards Killed In Armored Car Heist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) -- Masked gunmen with assault rifles
ambushed and killed two armored car guards in a strip mall before
escaping with three bags of money Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At least three men were involved in the heist. Police Capt.
Richard Perkins said the robbers had arrived at the mall to wait
for the armored car guards about 2{ hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''It obviously was not your run-of-the-mill robbery,'' Chief
Michael Mayberry said. ''This was well-planned.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know how much money was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Mayberry said the Armored Transport of Nevada guards were
attempting to take bags of money into a store in Henderson, 10
miles southeast of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Two robbers gunned down the first guard as he walked toward the
store with a bag of money. The second guard, the driver, was shot
when he went to investigate, Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe one of the guards exchanged gunfire with a robber
and wounded him, possibly in the leg. They found blood in an
abandoned getaway car.

<HEADLINE> Gun Dealer Sentenced to 10 Months  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A gun dealer was sentenced to 10 months in
prison Friday for selling two guns used by a white supremacist in a
shooting rampage last summer that killed two people and injured
nine others.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fiessinger, 65, could have received up to five years in
prison for selling guns without a license. Prosecutors, however,
acknowledged his cooperation in the investigation of the shooter,
Benjamin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree began July 2 in the Chicago area. Smith
killed Ricky Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University basketball
coach, wounded six Orthodox Jews and shot at an Asian-American
couple, who were not hit.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, Smith fired at Asians and blacks in three other
Illinois cities, wounding three people. On July 4, he killed an
Asian student in Bloomington, Ind., before killing himself later
that day.
</P>
<P>
   A Bryco .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a .22-caliber
handgun were found with Smith's body after he committed suicide.
Fiessinger admitted selling those guns to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Fiessinger already had been under investigation. The day before
Smith began his rampage, federal agents searched Fiessinger's house
and seized 27 guns.

<HEADLINE> Community Mourns Slain 1st-Grader  </HEADLINE>
By RANDI GOLDBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- In a child's scrawl, the spelling not quite
right, a poem propped on an easel near 6-year-old Kayla Rolland's
gold-trimmed white casket Friday remembered the slain first-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ''A smile so bright
</P>
<P>
   ''Eyes so light
</P>
<P>
   ''A pertty girl like you brought the sun's daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Kayla was shot to death in her elementary
school, allegedly by a 6-year-old classmate, hundreds of tearful
mourners bearing flowers, cards and stuffed animals paid their
respects during a daylong visitation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a memorial service Friday night, some 1,000 mourners packed
Brown Funeral Home to grieve. Many hadn't known Kayla, and many
wept.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla's older sister, Elizabeth, joined other relatives in
taking turns reading a poem as they cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could they do that to Kayla?'' the Rev. Gene Warren asked
the mothers and fathers, some with their children and babies. ''I
don't have the answers. ''But I know she's with Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman told the crowd, ''These are our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This child could be yours, and it could have been yours that
pulled the trigger. What's wrong with this picture?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners was Rob Parcels, who wept as he pointed to
his heart and said, ''I feel it right there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to think anymore,'' he said. ''What are we
going to do now, have 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds with guns?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier during the visitation, Scott Messinger clutched a pink
ribbon while holding his 2-year-old son tightly and handing out
laminated cards with Kayla's picture. He said he knows Kayla's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure how they're going to cope with this. I don't know
how I would,'' he said. ''They're taking it hard. You're not
supposed to lose a little one this way.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes welling, Messinger bent down, kissed his son and told
him softly, ''I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She was too young,'' said Buffy Darling, one of the first to
arrive. ''She didn't even have a chance to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla, in a red dress, lay in an open casket, a small doll of
the TV character Barney beneath it. In her hands was a small card
with a poem titled ''I'm free.''
</P>
<P>
   A large poster board filled with signatures and messages from
students at Kayla's school stood near the casket. ''I'm sorry this
happened,'' said many of the messages.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, mourners had brought so many flowers that some had to
be placed in another room.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, someone left a small plastic pot with yellow flowers
next to a row of shrubs. A handwritten index card taped to the pot
carried a plea: ''Please pray for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayla's uncle, Tim Rolland, said the family was grateful for all
the support. Though he and his wife, Connie, said the day was very
hard on them, Mrs. Rolland was hopeful something good might come of
Kayla's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody needs to keep their eyes and ears open. There needs
to be more help for those adults and children who need it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Austen Cox asked her grandmother, Frankie Cox,
to bring her even though she lives in a nearby town and didn't know
Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wanted to get some flowers, so I took her and she spent
her own $5.38,'' the grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral director Donald Lada passed out pink ribbons, and said
more than 7,000 already had been pinned to lapels and tied to radio
antennas.
</P>
<P>
   James Ray, superintendent of schools in Flint, said he came on
behalf of the entire Flint school community. The district planned
to donate books in Kayla's memory to Buell Elementary School, which
is in another district, in neighboring Mount Morris Township.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine the pain they are going through,'' Ray said.
''It hits you in the pit of your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Polacek, 20, came with 6-year-old cousin Kyle
Cornelison. She said she brought the child so he would understand
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it was sad and we talked about it a lot. I think he
understands better now,'' she said. ''It hit really close to home.
It kind of makes you think, 'Is this going to happen in our
classrooms?'''
</P>
<P>
   One mourner left near Kayla's casket a Barbie doll in its box,
with Kayla's photo on it. ''The child who shot little Kayla was
only 6 himself, does he really understand what he's just done?''
said a note with the memorial. ''I believe he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy has told police that it was an accident and that he
meant only to scare Kayla. The two are believed to have scuffled on
the playground the day before, with one slapping the other.
</P>
<P>
   No charges are expected against the boy, and the prosecutor -- as
well as many in the community -- has urged compassion for a child
they say was a victim of chaotic upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father is in jail and his mother was evicted from her
home a few weeks ago; the boy was staying with an uncle and another
man when he found the loaded .32-caliber semiautomatic gun.
</P>
<P>
   The other man, Jamelle James, 19, is accused of allowing the boy
access to the gun -- even twirling it in front of him -- and was
charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the ramshackle one-story house turned up a bag of
drugs, a loaded shotgun and ammunition. The boy's father, Dedric
Owens, said people at the house traded crack cocaine for guns.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his two siblings have been placed in the custody of
their maternal aunt.

<HEADLINE> Washington Boy Allegedly Fires Gun  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEHALIS, Wash. (AP) -- A 5-year-old boy who had been arguing
with a playmate got his mother's gun, loaded it, then pointed it at
two children before firing at the ground, neighbors and police
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the Feb. 23 incident. But it took several
days and a fatal shooting involving two Michigan 6-year-olds before
police were notified of the 5-year-old's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Chehalis Police Chief Randy Hamilton said two boys were
squabbling when the 5-year-old said he wasn't afraid because his
mother had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The other boy didn't believe him so the 5-year-old retrieved the
weapon and ammunition from inside his home then went back outside,
Hamilton said. To prove the gun was real, the 5-year-old loaded and
fired, witnesses told police.
</P>
<P>
   The .25-caliber automatic handgun was turned over to police the
same day by a neighbor who asked police to take it for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Officers weren't told about what happened until Tuesday -- the
same day Kayla Rolland was allegedly shot by a 6-year-old classmate
in Mount Morris Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old was referred to a counselor. No charges were
filed because the gun apparently had been stored properly, Hamilton
said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Makes Foreign Policy Speech  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The nation needs a president with a more
consistent foreign policy that goes beyond being ''the world's
volunteer fire department,'' Democrat Bill Bradley said Friday,
turning to a broad issue just before the primary season's biggest
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not done enough to explain either to the world or to
our own people what criteria we will use in the future to determine
our willingness to act,'' Bradley told 500 students in a packed
hall at Brown University. ''The next president must create a
foreign policy vision that moves beyond such ad-hoc firefighting,
for both the world's sake and for our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Students gave Bradley an enthusiastic reception but sat quietly
as the former New Jersey senator delivered his lengthy, formal
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spelled out his thoughts in a long-promised foreign
policy speech just before the ''Super Tuesday'' primaries. Many
analysts say Vice President Al Gore could all but sweep Bradley out
of the race for the Democratic nomination that day.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley criticized the Clinton administration for putting its
trust in ''old leaders who did not deliver on promises'' in Russia,
and for sending ''inconsistent signals'' on China's human rights
record and its treatment of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In his most specific reference to Gore, Bradley said the vice
president hurt the chances for a trade agreement with China last
month when labor leaders claimed he pledged to them that he would
negotiate tougher requirements on China. The White House insisted
that Gore meant he would seek tougher labor standards in future
trade agreements, not the one pending with China.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway said Bradley ''doesn't
have much standing to criticize the Clinton-Gore foreign policy
record when his own record is a series of waffles, flip-flops and
bad votes.'' He cited in particular Bradley's 1991 vote against
authorizing military force against Iraq in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley briefly shifted campaign gears two weeks ago and began
taking a more confrontational approach to Gore. But he has returned
in recent days to speeches that largely ignore Gore and offer
Bradley's promises to ''think big'' on such issues as child poverty
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether he was pursuing a graceful way to exit the
race, Bradley said: ''I'm in this to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign no longer seems to consider Bradley a
serious threat. Campaign manager Donna Brazile told reporters
Friday that it is now mathematically possible for Gore to collect
the 2,169 delegates necessary for the nomination by March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned Friday at Raines High School in Jacksonville,
Fla., built in 1965 to accommodate 1,550 but now holding more than
1,700 students. Gore told the predominantly black student body that
he would, as president, invest federal money in alleviating
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also visited Atlanta and faced questions about the
conviction this week of his friend and former political
fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, on charges of arranging illegal donations
to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Atlanta's FOX News on whether Hsia's guilty verdict
reflected on him, Gore said, ''I hope it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As the trial pointed out, this was an allegation against
her,'' he added. ''The problems both parties had in '96
demonstrated freshly the need for campaign finance reform and I
support it very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, continuing to look past Bradley to the fall
campaign, Gore took a shot at Republican front-runner George W.
Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush said the other day that my proposal for the
modernizing of schools and giving help in building new classrooms --
he derided it as 'bricks and mortar.' Well, since he doesn't have
any plan to help build new schools, his plan is smoke and
mirrors,'' Gore said. ''I'd rather have bricks and mortar than
smoke and mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore won a standing ovation in the noisy school gymnasium when
he went after the ''One Florida'' initiative of Bush's brother,
Jeb, the Florida governor, banning affirmative action in state
university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Affirmative action is still needed,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Gore gave back to the Democratic Party
establishment that made him its favorite for the 2000 nomination,
headlining a $1-million Atlanta fund-raising dinner for the Georgia
Democratic Party. Without mentioning Bradley, Gore appealed to
Democrats to unite behind him. ''I ask you to stand with me for
Democratic purposes and principles,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also unveiled a new television ad outlining why he wants to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   ''A president that's really doing the job the way it's supposed
to be done is committed in his or her own heart to fight for all
Americans, and especially people who haven't had somebody fight for
them in the past,'' Gore says in the ad. ''That's why I want to be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, still hoping to win primaries Tuesday in New York and
in New England, released a made-for-New York television ad
featuring two Big Apple big shots, filmmaker Spike Lee and former
Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt-speaking Koch this week put the odds ''5-1 against''
Bradley winning in his state and added, ''If he loses New York,
he's out.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Attacks Mystery TV Ads  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain and George W. Bush waded into the
battle for ''Super Tuesday'' delegates here Friday, with Bush
accusing McCain of shortchanging breast cancer research and McCain
charging his presidential rival was seeking to ''hijack the
campaign'' with big money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush turned to the pillars of Republican power in New York in an
effort to snuff McCain's insurgent campaign, but there was
controversy even there. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was resisting the
McCain-bashing efforts of Gov. George Pataki and other GOP state
leaders who back Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a friend of John McCain,'' said the New York City mayor,
who's campaigning for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before Republicans vote in 13 states, there were no
signs that McCain was closing Bush's wide leads in California,
Ohio, Missouri and Georgia polls. New York was competitive and New
England was leaning McCain's way, but some advisers warned
privately the Arizona senator's candidacy was in jeopardy unless he
could generate fresh support this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain were ardently seeking the 101 convention
delegates at stake in Tuesday's New York election -- second-most to
California's 162.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, pummeled in new television commercials, was firing back
with two new radio ads and a telephone barrage targeting the
crucial Catholic vote, 46 percent of the state's GOP electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch being given to Catholic voters touts McCain's economic
plans and his chances to win in November, but also notes that
McCain spoke out against ''bigotry'' at Bob Jones University in
South Carolina. The script does not mention Bush's visit to that
school, which McCain has criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring the most controversy was a Bush commercial arguing that
McCain voted against breast cancer research. McCain's allies
demanded an apology, noting that McCain's sister -- Sandy McCain
Morgan -- has been diagnosed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has repeatedly voted to increase spending on
breast cancer research and the vote cited in the Bush ad was one
where he opposed putting breast cancer money in a military spending
measure. A new McCain radio ads calls the Bush spot ''shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing we need is a politician like George Bush
spreading fear,'' says the ad, running in New York. ''Reject his
negative politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejected the criticism at a cancer research center on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a pink breast cancer awareness ribbon on his lapel,
sitting between a doctor and a breast cancer survivor -- and with
former presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole in the front row -- the
Texas governor said cancer research was a legitimate use of tax
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ad speaks to programs that he called 'garden-variety
pork,''' Bush said at a news conference after his session at the
Stony Brook Breast Cancer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the senator should be squealing about pork and
then squealing when somebody disagrees with one of the cuts he
wants to make. That's what the ad says,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the illness suffered by McCain's sister, Bush said:
''All the more reason to remind him of what he said about the
research that goes on here. I'm sorry if that's the case; that
obviously is very difficult for her and her family.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when McCain watched Bush's response on the evening news,
his jaw clenched and he said almost under his breath, ''I hope my
sister isn't watching television tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain's environmental record was under fire in a
widely run ad purchased by a private group not heard of before in
the campaign. McCain contended the effort was coordinated by the
Bush campaign, a charge Bush rejected.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded with a new radio spot in New York, which
pointed out that under Bush's leadership Texas ranks last among
states in toxic air pollution from industrial facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's a guy who gave waivers to 85 polluters, all of whom
gave to his campaign,'' said McCain. ''Somebody is putting in $2
million to try to hijack the campaign here in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's everything I've been fighting against,'' said McCain.
''Two million dollars in the last few days in this campaign can
make a difference in a race that is a statistical dead heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas investors Sam and Charles Wyly, prominent Bush donors and
supporters of his state and national campaigns, were behind the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ''There is no connection between my campaign and this
ad. We had no knowledge whatsoever that Sam Wyly was going to run
this ad. There is no coordination.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of the biggest prizes at stake Tuesday and the
ferocity of the fighting underscored the stakes. Polls have shown
Bush with a lead in California and Ohio -- two other ''Super
Tuesday'' prizes -- while New York is close.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers privately concede he's likely to lose
California and hope he can offset that with victories in New York,
New England and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly over-performed his poll ratings by drawing
unexpected numbers of independents and moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned on Wall Street on Friday, McCain was seeking a
balance between responding to assaults and sounding his basic
campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be diverted,'' he said. ''If I've made mistakes in
this campaign it's because I've allowed myself to be diverted.''

<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Dave Eichelberger and Roy Vucinich
shot 5-under-par 66s on Friday to share the first-round lead in the
Toshiba Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit some good shots,'' Eichelberger said. ''But the main
thing was the putter. I think I had 23 or 24 putts. That's what
made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichelberger, the defending U.S. Senior Open champion, had six

<P>
   ''I missed the green and couldn't get it up and down,'' he said
of the bogey on the par-3 13th hole. ''I've putted well this year
and I've been in a position to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really have a strategy or goal each day. I just try to
hit it as hard as I can on the first tee and then shoot as low as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nelson and Howard Twitty opened with 67s on the Newport
Beach Country Club course. Defending champion Gary McCord and 1995
winner George Archer topped an eight-player group at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Fleisher, a two-time winner this year, shot a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Vucinich, a rookie on the 50-and-over tour, had five birdies in
his bogey-free round, including a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th
to tie Eichelberger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five-under was a little more than I was expecting today. I
just wanted to get off to a decent start,'' said Vucinich, who
saved par on the fifth and sixth holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those two holes were the only times I was in any kind of
trouble out there. I knew that putt on 18 was a tie for the lead. I
knew it meant I would be paired with Eichelberger and Nelson
tomorrow and I look forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my young career, it is going to be a good opportunity.
Tomorrow is going to be an entirely new experience for me. And hope
I can learn from the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was 4-under after four holes, including an eagle at the
par-5, 549-yard third. He watched playing partners Arnold Palmer
(79) and Lanny Wadkins (78) have trouble with the course.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has only one top-10 finish this year, a 10th-place tie in
the season-opening Mastercard Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The start of this year has not been like it's been in previous
years,'' Nelson said, ''but I've found some things in my swing and
with my putter that has helped.''

<HEADLINE> Armored Cars Spill Coins  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An armored car dropped about 400,000 pennies on a
highway in
Washington state Friday, a day after Wisconsin officers scrambled
to scoop up $1,000 in quarters spilled on a freeway there.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''It was all pennies -- pennies from heaven,'' Trooper Monica
Hunter said of the spill on an Interstate-5 off-ramp in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The truck was moving quickly and ''the back door flew open and
out came the pennies from heaven,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Transportation Department personnel picked up the coins
with no help from passersby, Hunter said. ''We didn't allow anybody
to be enterprising on this one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, a 50-pound bag of quarters fell from the rear of
an armored truck on U.S. 53 in a suburb of Eau Claire on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen employees of the security company and five police
officers collected the coins, and no passersby tried to make off
with any, said police Sgt. Harry Gordee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very orderly,'' Gordee said. ''If it had been $100
bills lying there, who knows what would have happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter in Washington state said coins were hardly the most
unusual highway spills.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple weeks ago it was cut-up cows -- there was blood and
animal parts everywhere,'' she said. ''The stench from that was
horrible.''

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--McCain-Conn, 1st Ld-Writethru, 370  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- In a speech filled with patriotism and
promises of government reform, Arizona Sen. John McCain urged
Connecticut voters to cast ballots for change by voting for him in
Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of over 1,500 at Sacred
Heart University Friday night without any competition from Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, who canceled a planned visit to another
Catholic university in town.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cited scheduling conflicts in canceling a planned
appearance Friday at Fairfield University.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said when he started campaigning in Connecticut seven
months ago a poll showed him with just 3 percent of the vote,
compared to 61 percent for Bush. Recent polls show the pair in a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, with your help and your participation, we are going to
carry the state of Connecticut on Tuesday by an overwhelming
margin,'' McCain said. ''There are too many 'McCainiacs' in the
state of Connecticut for us to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hoping for strong showings in key northeast states
including New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain played to one of his strengths, praising war veterans and
recounting his own days as a POW in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He stood on a stage in front of an American flag that stood 40
feet wide and 16 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said if elected he would work for school choice; tax code
reform; and tax cuts for working families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Donald Trump needs a tax cut, but not as bad as you
do,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite speaking at a Catholic school, McCain did not address
the recent controversy swirling around Bush, who has come under
fire following an appearance at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina, which has been characterized as an anti-Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to make a campaign stop in Connecticut on
Saturday. He is expected to receive the endorsement of New Jersey
Gov. Christie Whitman during a rally at the Sheraton Hotel at
Bradley International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Diary Filled With Hate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A diary kept by a 17-year-old boy
who tried to recruit classmates to carry out a Columbine-style
attack on his high school is filled with swastika drawings and
ramblings of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Derik Lehman, a junior at Royal Palm Beach High School, wrote
eight pages of a composition notebook with yearnings to kill fellow
students who had ridiculed him, according to the state attorney's
office. On a map of the school's classrooms, Lehman allegedly
suggested 25 to 40 people could be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am lost. My hate is unconditional. I look up to people like
Hitler and I grin at Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's act of murder
and suicide,'' said one entry in the diary released by the state
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold fatally shot a teacher and 12 classmates at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in April before killing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The teen's attorney said her client needs psychiatric treatment,
not imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Suskauer said Lehman never had possession of a firearm
or explosives, nor did he have the means to carry out his alleged
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who knows Derik knows he wouldn't act on it. It may
very well have been a reaction to other people,'' Suskauer said,
referring to her claim that Lehman, who is pudgy, has been
traumatized by students teasing him about his weight.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman faces adult charges of solicitation to shoot into a
public building after he allegedly attempted to recruit other
students. The third-degree felony carries a maximum five-year
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman is out of jail on house arrest and is receiving daily
psychiatric treatment. He was suspended from school and efforts to
expel him are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The teen was detained Feb. 3 after three students and one of
their fathers told school officials that Lehman asked the boys to
help with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Officers searched his home and found the diary, a map of the
school and an Internet manual on making bombs. No weapons or
bomb-making materials were found, but Lehman was trying to obtain
them, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had access to firearms I really do think I would fall
into insanity,'' said a dairy entry dated Jan. 23. ''I hate people
so much I would be willing to kill them. It's sad that I am nothing
but hate incarnate.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe the rantings in the diary were deadly
serious. ''The state's position is that this was a plan put
together to be put into action,'' said Mike Edmondson, Krischer's
spokesman. ''The state's concern was to avoid the potential for a
major tragedy at this high school.''

<HEADLINE> University Drops Dating Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Bob Jones University will drop its ban on
interracial dating as a result of the criticism that followed
George W. Bush's visit to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of today, right now, we're dropping it,'' Bob Jones III
said on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on interracial dating was just one criticism Bush faced
after his visit to the Greenville school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apologized earlier this week for failing to criticize the
anti-Catholic views of the university when he visited last month.
During his appearance there, the Texas governor told his audience
that he shared their values.
</P>
<P>
   The university had banned interracial dating, although it
started admitting black students after the IRS revoked its
tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told King that the school had no biblical reference to
support its ban, but that it was ''an insignificant'' part of the
school's stance against a one-world order. Jones said the blending
of worldwide governments, ethnic groups and religions would signal
the coming of the Antichrist and so the school stands against that.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Bob Jones University used full-page newspaper
advertisements in USA Today and South Carolina's largest newspapers
to answer some of the national criticism directed at it.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Ends Flight in Myanmar  </HEADLINE>
By KATE N. GROSSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- American balloonist Kevin Uliassi's attempt to
make history by circling the globe alone ended in disappointment
Friday in a field in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, more
than 13,000 miles from liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi, 36, brought his balloon down safely 10 days after
beginning his journey from a quarry in northern Illinois. Uliassi
ended up about 1,200 miles short of the solo long-distance record.
</P>
<P>
   Flight spokesman Bo Kemper said he didn't know why Uliassi
decided to come down, but Uliassi had said he was unsure whether he
had enough fuel and supplies to make it across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Little, a member of the flight crew, said the Myanmar
military sent a message to the command center through the State
Department that Uliassi was not injured in the landing.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi later was able to leave a brief message on his parents'
answering machine that he was ''A-OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi was taken to a hospital, where an examination found that
he suffered only a few bruises, Little said. Uliassi was to spend
the night at the hospital, where he hoped to get his first full
night of sleep since the balloon lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi last communicated with his flight crew in the Chicago
suburb of Homewood 13 hours before he landed, when he told them he
was going to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   When Uliassi's flight command center noticed he was descending,
the crew sought assistance from the State Department, which had the
Myanmar government initiate a search and rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper said officials in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, told
him Uliassi touched down around 4:30 a.m. Chicago time near some
railroad tracks and a road. Authorities said Uliassi landed 310
miles north of the capital, Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a controlled descent,'' Kemper said. ''It was a nice,
normal landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar, one of the world's poorest nations, is controlled by
its military. Foreign donors, including the United States, have
restricted aid since a 1988 crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising
in which thousands of protesters were gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi's flight crew spent much of Friday trying establish
phone contact with him. They were also making plans to possibly
send a relative to Myanmar to help bring Uliassi home. Although the
crew didn't know exactly where Uliassi was, they could still keep
tabs on him because he was carrying equipment that tracks his
location.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and English
balloon instructor Brian Jones became the first people to circle
the world nonstop in a hot air balloon, landing safely in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   This was Uliassi's second try at becoming the first person to
circle the globe alone. On his first attempt, in 1997, his balloon
ruptured over O'Hare International Airport, forcing him down in
Indiana. Uliassi lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., but has lifted off
from the Chicago area to be close to his family and ballooning
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his wealthier rivals, including Chicago millionaire Steve
Fossett, Uliassi relies on sponsors and donations. He raised
$500,000 for this trip and had 15 volunteers staff his flight
command center round-the-clock.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett holds the solo balloon flight record -- 14,235 miles --
set in 1998. That trip ended when a storm off the Australian coast
sent his balloon into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would think in Kevin's case that he has to be very
pleased,'' Fossett said before the flight ended. ''He's making one
of the finest balloon flights ever, and he had not previously made
a long balloon flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi avoided major problems, but some maneuvering he did last
week to steer clear of threatening storm clouds in the Atlantic may
have proved his undoing. He had to change altitude several times,
leaving him with less fuel than he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''In any long-distance balloon flight there are several points
where a 'go' or 'no-go' decision has to be made,'' said Scott
Lorenz, another flight spokesman. ''It's water, water everywhere
and it's several days without any land in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   To count as an around-the-world flight, a balloon must cross all
lines of longitude, without using the shortcut of making the trip
close to the earth's poles, according to the Federation
Aeronautique Internationale, the governing body of air sports. The
distance around the globe at the equator is 24,902 miles, but it is
shorter at higher latitudes.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Backing IMF Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- European nations refused Friday to give up on
their German candidate to head the International Monetary Fund,
even though he failed to win crucial U.S. support in an informal
poll of the IMF's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   However, there also were signs -- even from Germany -- that the
Europeans may yet look for a new candidate as they discuss how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, which currently chairs and speaks for the 15-nation
EU, said the group still backs Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy
finance minister, after he finished first in Thursday's vote by the
IMF executive board but fell short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have endorsed the German candidate and we are still in that
phase,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said in Lisbon,
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser won the most support of three candidates, but more
than a third of the IMF board abstained, including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says it wants to stick to the tradition that the
IMF post goes to a European, but does not believe Koch-Weser has
enough experience or political clout. President Clinton has urged
the EU to nominate someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Germany still backs Koch-Weser, government spokeswoman Charima
Reinhardt said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres discussed the IMF debate by telephone
Friday, government officials said, and were to meet Saturday in
Oporto, Portugal, for more discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But a top aide to Schroeder, while calling the result of the
vote ''encouraging,'' hinted that Berlin, which pushed its European
allies to back Koch-Weser, might now consider a non-German
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also have to show solidarity toward our European partners
now,'' Michael Steiner, Schroeder's foreign policy adviser, said on
ARD television. ''Only together can we turn this first success into
a full success.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder praised Koch-Weser's first-place finish, with 43
percent, then added: ''I now assume that a common result with the
USA and Japan is achievable.'' He did not specify if that meant
Koch-Weser or another European.
</P>
<P>
   France, which overcame initial reluctance to back Koch-Weser
after heavy lobbying by Germany, said it would back the candidate
Europeans agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   ''My country has supported the European consensus on an IMF
candidate and will maintain the same attitude,'' Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said after EU foreign ministers met with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Albright made plain that Washington is waiting for the Europeans
to make up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States wishes to support a consensus European
candidate who is the most capable of leading this highly important
financial institution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan may withdraw its candidate, former finance ministry
official Eisuke Sakikibara, the Nikkei news service said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sakikibara received 9 percent of the vote in Thursday's straw
poll. The other candidate, acting IMF chief Stanley Fischer, a
naturalized American, received 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the United States would not support Fischer,
who was nominated by a group of African nations.

   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- At a memorial service tonight, some 1,000 mourners
grieved for Kayla Rolland, the 6-year-old girl who was shot to death in her
elementary school, allegedly by a 6-year-old classmate. Kayla, in a red dress,
lay in an open casket, a small doll of the TV character Barney beneath it. In
her hands was a small card with a poem titled ''I'm free.'' The boy who shot
Kayla has told police that it was an accident and that he meant only to scare
her. The two are believed to have scuffled on the playground the day before. No

Chile Gives Pinochet a Hero's Welcome

<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 84, returned home a free man
and was greeted by thousands of cheering supporters after 16 months of detention
in Britain. Opponents, however, vowed to prosecute him at home for the abuses of
his 17-year regime. An official government report says 3,197 people died or
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he toppled the
elected Marxist president in a 1973 coup. Pinochet was arrested in London on
Oct. 16, 1998, on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Britain considered
extraditing him to Spain and then set him free, saying he was too ill for trial.

for a new candidate as they discuss how to proceed. Germany's deputy finance
minister Caio Koch-Weser won the most support of three candidates, but more than
a third of the IMF board abstained, including the United States. The White House
says it wants to stick to the tradition that the IMF post goes to a European,
but does not believe Koch-Weser has enough experience or political clout.

   CHIBUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Thousands of people who were marooned for days in
trees and on rooftops during Mozambique's worst flooding on record were freed

thousands. Rescuers have saved more than 12,000 people. Officials estimate 1
million people need food. Meantime, U.S. troops headed for southern Africa to

NCAA Reinstates St. John's Barkley
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- St. John's sophomore guard Erick Barkley, who missed three
games this season for two NCAA rules violations, was reinstated today. St.
John's was forced to declare its leading scorer ineligible last Tuesday. The
NCAA requested further information regarding payment of part of Barkley's
tuition at Maine Central Institute for the 1997-98 academic year. Though he was
reinstated, Barkley must give back $3,500 of his tuition. The Red Storm (21-6)
play at Miami on Sunday, then have a first-round bye for next week's Big East

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations on Friday named a
Senegalese officer to head the new U.N. observer mission to the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Maj.-Gen. Mountaga Diallo, who served in the West African force
in Liberia during its 3{-year civil war, will head the 5,537-member
force, which has a dual role of monitoring Congo's shaky cease-fire
and laying the groundwork for a possible U.N. peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels took up arms in eastern Congo in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila from power. Citing concerns
about security along their borders with Congo, Rwanda and Uganda
backed the rebels, while Kabila enlisted the support of Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   All the key factions signed the cease-fire agreement last summer
in Lusaka, Zambia, but fighting has continued -- particularly in the
eastern part of the country.

<HEADLINE> No. 16 Virginia 72, Wake Forest 47  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MACENKA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Telisha Quarles and Svetlana Volnaya
powered a second-half run that helped No. 16 Virginia extend its
dominance of Wake Forest with a 72-47 victory in the Atlantic Coast
Conference tournament Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Quarles finished with 16 points, including 4-of-5 from 3-point
range, and Volnaya added 12 points as Virginia (23-7) improved to
47-1 against the Demon Deacons, including victories in their last
45 games.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Cavaliers secured a berth in Sunday's semifinals
with a 13-0 surge in the second half. Volnaya had a 3-pointer and
an assist in the run and Quarles hit a pair of 3-pointers to help
Virginia build a 23-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers also got 14 points and four steals from Renee
Robinson and 11 points from Schuye LaRue.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest (7-21) never led on the way to losing for the 10th
time in 11 games. Alisha Mosley had 16 points for the Demon Deacons
and LaChina Robinson had 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers opened the game with a 20-4 run and led by 15
after a first half in which they held the Demon Deacons to
29-percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest put together a 9-0 surge early in the second half,
capped by a 3-pointer from Val Klopfer, that made it 41-31 before
Volnaya and Quarles finished off any hopes by the Demon Deacons for
an upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers pushed their lead as high as 27 in the closing
minutes.

Human Resources Ponders Next Move After Audit Report
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A team of outside auditors has completed its
review of a federal job-creation project that mysteriously migrated
from Montreal to Prime Minister Jean Chretien's riding.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no word Friday on the next move by the Human
Resources Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have received a report but have no comment at this time,''
said department spokesman Ghyslain Charron.
</P>
<P>
   The forensic audit, by the Toronto firm Kroll Linquist Avey, was
commissioned a week ago after reports that a $165,000 grant that
was supposed to create jobs in Montreal may have generated work in
Chretien's constituency of St-Maurice instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the study was announced, Human Resources said that,
depending on the outcome, it was prepared to take ''any necessary
action,'' including pursuit of the project sponsors for repayment
of the funds if appropriate.

Truckers Roll on Parliament Hill To Protest Fuel Prices
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- About 150 truckers roared up Parliament Hill with
horns blazing Friday to protest escalating fuel prices, but they
found nobody home.
</P>
<P>
   Without assurances of tax relief from a government whose key
ministers were on spring break, protesters accused oil companies of
gouging and called for rotating boycotts of Canada's biggest oil
companies, starting with Esso.
</P>
<P>
   They also issued a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''If nothing gets done in the next week, you're going to see a
major shutdown of trucking across Canada,'' said organizer Dwayne
Mosley, head of the Greater Ottawa Trucking Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll filter down to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley had Liberal backbencher Mac Harb draw randomly from a bag
filled with the names of the three major refiners, producers and
retailers -- Shell, Petro-Canada and Esso. Esso, owned by Imperial
Oil, was the loser.
</P>

Federal Government Withdraws Motion To Limit Opposition Powers
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Liberal government withdrew a motion Friday
that would have changed parliamentary rules and limited the tactics
opposition parties use to protest legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was promptly replaced by another that could be seen
as more palatable to opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Government House leader Don Boudria had introduced measures
Wednesday that would have prevented parties from bombarding the
Commons with hundreds of amendments at a time -- a strategy used to
voice dissent against a bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the four opposition parties joined forces to decry the move,
accusing Boudria and the government of an affront to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Boudria responded suddenly Friday by scrapping his original
motion, in favor of one that would still allow the opposition to
present piles of amendments to a bill, but which would cut down the
time it takes to vote on each item.

Fans at Brier and Across Canada Expected To Watch Schmirler
Funeral
</P>
<P>
   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Fans across the country --
including at the Brier in Saskatoon -- will be tuned to their
televisions Monday for the funeral of Olympic champion curler
Sandra Schmirler.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon draw at the men's curling championship will be
pushed back so curlers and fans can watch the 1 p.m. CT (2 p.m. ET)
service from Saskatchewan Place, the site of the Brier.
</P>
<P>
   Schmirler, 36, died Thursday after battling cancer since last
summer. Her service at a Regina funeral home is to be broadcast
live on the sports channel TSN.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that Brier organizers would juggle draws
so that competitors who knew Schmirler could travel the 250
kilometers south to attend.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Criticizes Liberals  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson
said Friday night it is ''unseemly'' that religion has become a
part of the presidential primary debate, but he declined to endorse
a candidate or comment on Republican hopefuls George W. Bush and
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ask me after Tuesday what I think and I'm sure I'll have a lot
to say,'' Robertson said during a question-and-answer after giving
a speech to the University of Virginia's debating society.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and
Regent University in Virginia Beach, recorded a telephone message
to voters before last week's Michigan primary in which he called a
McCain campaign leader a ''vicious bigot'' who has attacked
religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fired back Monday in Virginia Beach, characterizing
Robertson and Jerry Falwell, founder of the now-defunct Moral
Majority, as ''agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson refused to address McCain's attack specifically, but
said he agreed with and will follow Falwell's pledge earlier this
week to forgive McCain and turn the other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals, however, got no such free pass from the former GOP
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Liberals have systematically performed what could be called a
moral lobotomy on the people of this country,'' Robertson told
about 300 students. He also described himself as a ''Jeffersonian
conservative'' and encouraged those ''who support Jefferson's
ideals to rise up and assert our God-given liberties and fight
against the rule of the liberal left.''
</P>
<P>
   While declining repeatedly to state his choice in the GOP race
between Bush and McCain before Super Tuesday, Robertson praised
fellow conservative broadcaster Alan Keyes, who has remained in the
Republican race despite garnering only a smattering of support.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's added a great deal to this presidential campaign, but if
you're hoping he's going to be the nominee for president, it ain't
gonna happen,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considers Democratic President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore members of the liberal left, Robertson said: ''I
wouldn't say they fit into that category.'' He paused before
adding, ''But they are Democrats,'' prompting laughter from the
audience and Robertson himself.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Yzerman scored on a power play with 5:02
left in regulation as Detroit finished with 54 shots but settled
for a 2-2 tie with the Washington Capitals on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which trailed 2-0 after the first period, tied the
score when Yzerman took a pass from Nicklas Lidstrom at the top of
the left of the faceoff circle and his slapshot got past Olaf
Kolzig, who ended up with 52 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skating a man down, the Capitals scored 16 seconds into
the game on a goal by Andrei Nikolishin. He won a faceoff and sent
the puck back to Peter Bondra whose initial shot was stopped by
Detroit's Chris Osgood, who finished with 19 saves. Joe Murphy
slapped the rebound into Osgood's stick before Nikolishin put in
the second rebound for his ninth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington scored again nearly eight minutes later when Jeff
Halpern collected a Steve Konowalchuk centering pass in between the
circles and sent a high wrist shot past Osgood. Konowalchuk's pass
was intended for Ulf Dahlen, but it deflected to Halpern, who
scored his 10th goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The two first period goals was a stark contrast for the Red
Wings, which, before Friday, had outscored opponents 70-45 in the
first period of games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pulled to 2-1 when Vyacheslav Kozlov batted a deflected
shot by Yzerman out of the air behind Kolzig. The goal was Kozlov's
18th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, coming into to Friday's game, had beaten the Capitals
seven consecutive times, including a four-game sweep of Washington
in the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which has now earned a point in 15 of its last 16
home games, played Friday's game without center Jan Bulis, left
wing Richard Zednik and defenseman Sergei Gonchar, who have
combined for 39 goals and 66 assists for Washington this season.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike York had a goal and an assist to lead the
New York Rangers to a 4-2 victory over the Florida Panthers on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves, Alexandre Daigle and John MacLean also scored for
New York, which moved into seventh place in the Eastern Conference
playoff race, a point ahead of idle Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter made 19 saves for his 21st win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Whitney and Mark Parrish scored for the Panthers, who are
only one point ahead of second-place Washington in the Southeast
Division. Both teams have 17 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   New York took a 1-0 lead at 11:19 of the opening period. Sylvain
Lefebvre's shot from the left point was stopped in front as goalie
Trevor Kidd went down when Theo Fleury skated into him. While Kidd
scrambled to get up, York passed the puck to the right crease,
where Graves swept the puck into the open right side.
</P>
<P>
   Daigle scored his 100th NHL goal for a 2-0 lead seven seconds
into a power play. Daigle won a faceoff and the puck wound up on
Brian Leetch's stick at the left point. He crossed it to Mathieu
Schneider, who ripped a slap shot that Daigle tipped past Kidd at
17:26.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams scored on a penalty to Schneider at the end of the
period. MacLean tried to clear the puck down the right side.
Whitney, at the left point, got tangled with a linesman, and
MacLean skated past the pair, moved down the right side and beat
Kidd with a slap shot at 19:36 for a short-handed score.
</P>
<P>
   Florida scored 14 seconds later when Viktor Kozlov fed Whitney
with a perfect pass down low. He cut in front of Richter and lagged
the puck before flicking it in. Kozlov is third in the NHL with 45
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish benefited from a video review to score his 22nd goal at
3:01 of the second period. He poked the puck under a prone Richter
and just over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   York restored New York's two-goal lead with a power play tip-in
at 6:21 of the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 20-0-0 when scoring at least four goals in a
game this season.

dating as a result of the criticism that followed George W. Bush's visit to the

has left several people dead and dozens injured, indicates that progress made
since NATO forces moved into Kosovo in June ''is not yet irreversible,'' Annan
said in a 46-page report to the U.N. Security Council. U.N. administrator
Bernard Kouchner, who is to brief the council on the situation in Kosovo on

elected Marxist president in a 1973 coup. Pinochet was arrested in London on
Oct. 16, 1998, on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Britain considered
extraditing him to Spain and then set him free, saying he was too ill for trial.

7.7 seconds left. But Jones was called for an offensive foul on the
inbound play, and Charlotte lost its final chance to tie.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, who also recorded seven assists, sank a pair of free
throws to seal the win. Malone added 19 points and 13 rebounds, and
Hornacek and Bryon Russell had 13 points apiece for the Jazz, who
have won three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis had 13 points for the Hornets, losers in three
straight at home, followed by Elden Campbell with 12 points and 11
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored eight points during Utah's 16-4 surge to open the
third quarter, and the Jazz held a 61-51 lead on Stockton's jumper
with 5:32 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Jones scored the final five points of the quarter and narrowed
the Jazz' advantage to 64-60 entering the final period. Campbell
and Jones were the only Hornets players to score during a 13-point
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by a pair of 3-pointers from Davis, Charlotte opened the
fourth with a 10-0 run to take the lead, ending with Eddie
Robinson's dunk with 8:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied five times before Charlotte took its last lead
at 82-80 on a pair of free throws from Jones with 2:02 left. Eleven
seconds later, Stockton tied it with a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   With an 8-0 run to open the second period, Utah took a 31-29
lead on a Quincy Lewis runner in the lane with 8:25 left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Keyed by seven points from Davis in the final 7:12 of the second
quarter, Charlotte rallied for a 47-45 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Hornets will play host to the Chicago Bulls on Sunday
in a game postponed from Jan. 12, the day Charlotte forward Bobby
Phills died in an automobile accident. ... Hornets power forward

<HEADLINE> LAPD Disbands CRASH Anti-Gang Units  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Police Department said Friday all of its
CRASH anti-gang units will be disbanded in the aftermath of a
corruption scandal involving one of the elite squads.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bernard Parks ordered that the units be deactivated by
March 12 and that the officers return to patrol duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department will audit the functions of these disbanded
units, including such things as their gang files,'' a statement
said, indicating a search for trouble beyond what has been revealed
in a probe of the unit at the department's Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations spiraling out of the Rampart Division's Community
Resources Against Street Hoodlums -- or CRASH -- have painted a
picture of rogue officers operating like a gang themselves,
beating, framing, and even shooting suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Since the scandal broke last fall, at least 20 officers have
been relieved of duty, and 40 convictions have been overturned.
Dozens of other criminal cases are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The department plans to activate new organizations called
Special Enforcement Units in about 30 days, which will operate
under different requirements than the old CRASH units. The role of
the new units will be detailed later, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers in the new units will receive special training on its
mission and strategies and will have to operate under the same
rules as uniformed patrol officers, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The CRASH units date to the late 1970s. There are 18 citywide,
with eight to 12 officers in each.

<HEADLINE> Tenn GOP Gets Billboard By Gore HQ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Republican Party patted
itself on the back last November after securing one side of a
billboard just down the street from Vice President Al Gore's
national campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's crowing about renting the other side -- the panel facing
the Gore office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt bad that the staff ... couldn't see our message out
their window,'' said state Republican chairman Chip Saltsman.
</P>
<P>
   The new billboard message went up Friday, showing Gore's picture
and a quote from Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
asking of the vice president, ''Why should we believe you will tell
the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a
candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said Tennessee Republicans are
''playing games'' with a message of ''personal attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They wasted their money if they're trying to bother us because
our view of the billboard is thoroughly obscured by a row of
beautiful trees,'' Hattaway said.

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Michigan 72, Northwestern 39  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Alayne Ingram scored 16 points as No. 22
Michigan continued its most successful women's basketball season
ever by routing Northwestern 72-39 in the quarterfinals of the Big
Ten women's basketball tournament Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan (22-6) pulled ahead with a 27-6 run that developed as
Northwestern (7-21) was going 10 minutes without a field goal in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines, who are ranked in the Top 25 in women's
basketball for the first time ever, took the lead for good 8-7 when
Ingram sank her second of four 3-pointers to begin the run.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern's only points in the run came when two free throws
by Tami Sears snapped a run of nine consecutive Michigan points.
Another Ingram 3-pointer gave Michigan a 19-9 advantage with 6:20
left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern had led 7-5 after Leslie Schock threw in a jumper
with 16:11 left in the half. It didn't get another field goal until
the first of two straight by Billiee Russell with 6:10 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's second brought the Wildcats to within six and Michigan
responded with 13 straight and led 32-15 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan dominated inside, outscoring the Wildcats 42-18 and
outrebounding them 50-37. Michigan had 21 fast-break points, while
Northwestern had none. Michigan also recorded a 9-1 advantage in
second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern, which didn't have a player finish in double
figures, shot 27 percent in the first half (6-of-22) and 29 percent
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had 24 turnovers and Michigan turned them into 23
points.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, which went into the game having already set a school
record for victories in a season, will play defending NCAA champion
Purdue in Saturday's second semifinal. Fourth-ranked Penn State
will face Illinois in the other semifinal.

<HEADLINE> More Clothing Co.'s Added to Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Six more American clothing manufacturers were
added to a class-action lawsuit Friday alleging sweatshop
conditions at factories in the Northern Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., Calvin Klein Inc., Brooks Brothers Inc.,
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch Co., The Talbots Inc. and Woolrich Inc. were
added to the lawsuit filed on behalf of 30,000 current and former
garment workers employed in factories there.
</P>
<P>
   The six manufacturers join The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, Wal-Mart and
J.C. Penney in being accused of violating U.S. labor laws in a
conspiracy with foreign-owned subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   Nine companies, including Ralph Lauren, Nordstrom and J. Crew,
agreed to settlements last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll fight it,'' Levi Strauss spokeswoman Linda Butler said
Friday, adding that her company stopped manufacturing garments in
the islands in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the time we were there, we rigorously applied our code
of conduct to the contractors that we used. We believe they were in
full compliance with our workplace standards and with applicable
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rubin, an attorney representing the workers, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our information from talking to workers who manufactured
garments for Levi's is that their rights have been violated
repeatedly over the last 10 years,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The factories are located on the western Pacific island of
Saipan, part of the U.S. territory about 3,700 miles southwest of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Saipan is a 13-mile-long island in the Northern Marianas, which
the Unites States seized from Japan in World War II. The Northern
Marianas have a commonwealth relationship with Washington, leaving
control of immigration and minimum wages in local hands and
exempting Saipan's exports from U.S. duties.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that garment workers, mostly young women,
work 12-hour days, seven days a week, in unsafe conditions for less
than the legal minimum wage. Lawyers for the workers say they are
kept in guarded barracks enclosed by barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in January 1999 seeks an undisclosed amount of
money for a factory monitoring program and to compensate the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Trial is set for Feb. 27, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Begins in Russian Election  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH INGRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Locking his eyes on the television camera,
Russia's Communist Party chief promised to raise salaries and lower
taxes. A regional governor pledged to strengthen laws instead of
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Russia's March 26 presidential election hit the
airwaves Friday, the first day when candidates could take advantage
of free ad time on Russian TV and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The five-minute spots, and a series of televised, four-candidate
debates starting next week, are intended to give all 11 candidates
an equal shot at reaching Russia's far-flung voters. Most of the
candidates have neither the funding nor the time to do much
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir Putin, of course, is the exception. As
the incumbent, he has been able to camouflage campaigning as state
business, visiting factories, state farms, hospitals and military
units with plenty of TV cameras to record his encounters with local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as his challengers recited their election pledges on
TV, Putin was visiting Surgut, a major oil- and gas-producing
center in western Siberia. His campaign pledge? Not to make
''unrealistic promises.''
</P>
<P>
   In their TV ads, most of Putin's rivals opted for no-frills
delivery of their campaign platforms. Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist Party leader, sat stiffly underneath a portrait of
Russia's favorite poet, Alexander Pushkin, and told Russians they
were in for economic disaster if they kept Putin in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The authorities are hiding the real situation,'' he warned.
''If the existing course continues, the Russian economy will crash
at the beginning of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov promised to immediately raise salaries, lower taxes,
and guarantee cheap housing, free education and medical care. He
also repeated his call for renationalizing property that he claimed
was illegally privatized.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Titov, the reform-oriented governor of central
Russia's Samara region, alternated the recitation of his
achievements in Samara with filmed scenes from his home district,
and a campaign jingle.
</P>
<P>
   He boasted that Samara had some of the highest salaries and
pensions in the country, and that unlike the situation in much of
the country, they were paid on time. He called for ''strengthening
the rule of law, not of bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Ella Pamfilova, the only woman competing in the race, admitted
she had no chance of unseating Putin. For her, she said, a
successful campaign would mean attracting enough votes to prove
that Russia couldn't simply be divided into pro-Putin and
pro-Communist camps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more you show support for our position, the greater the
chances of our being able to represent it under any authority,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been sensitive to complaints that his domination of
the opinion polls, which consistently reflect more 60 percent
support for him. Zyuganov, his closest challenger, has been polling
just about 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush and McCain neck-and-neck in New York  </HEADLINE>
With AM-NY--New York Primary, Bjt
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain are locked in a neck-and-neck race in New York just days
before the state's ''Super Tuesday'' primary, two statewide polls
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Al Gore maintained hefty leads over
former Sen. Bill Bradley in both polls.
</P>
<P>
   The poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion
showed Bush with the support of 46 percent of the likely voters in
Tuesday's GOP primary to 45 percent for McCain, a statistical tie.
Alan Keyes trailed at 2 percent. A Marist poll released earlier in
the week had McCain at 51 percent with Bush at 44 percent among
likely primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   A poll for the New York Post conducted by Zogby International
had Bush at 44 percent among likely primary voters to 40 percent
for McCain, also a statistical tie. Keyes was at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore led Bradley, 60 percent to 28
percent, in the Marist poll. In the Zogby poll, Gore led Bradley,
62 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Marist's telephone poll of 191 likely Republican primary voters
and 244 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted Tuesday and
Wednesday. The respective margins of error were plus or minus 7
percentage points for the GOP sample and 6.5 percentage points for
the Democratic sample.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's telephone tracking poll sampled 431 likely Republican
primary voters and 395 Democrats on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday. The respective error margins were 5 percentage points for
each sample.

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam in Takefuji Lead  </HEADLINE>
By GORDON SAKAMOTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- Karrie Webb brings out the best in
Annika Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the same group as the LPGA Tour's hottest player,
Sorenstam shot her second straight 4-under-par 68 on Friday to take
the lead in the Takefuji Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy it very much,'' Sorenstam said of playing with Webb,
the Australian star seeking her fourth victory in four 2000 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's playing so well and I like to think I can feed off of
that. She has so much confidence in her putting -- hopefully, it
will rub off on me. I think we played similarly today, so maybe
we're feeding off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   First-round leader Janice Moodie of Scotland was a stroke back
at 7-under 137 after a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Webb was hanging around, too. She completed an up-and-down round
of 70 (five birdies and three bogeys) for a 6-under 138 total. She
made an 18-foot putt and a 25-foot chip on the final two holes on
the Kona Country Club course.
</P>
<P>
   Also at 138 was Colombia's Marisa Baena, who picked up four
strokes over the final 11 holes for a 68.
</P>
<P>
   England's Laura Davies reached 5-under through 12 holes, but
bogeyed two of the last five holes to finish alone in fourth at
140. The group at 3-under included Chris Johnson, Mhairi McKay,
Jill McGill, Dana Dormann, Gloria Park, Lorie Kane and Jane Geddes.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on the 6,257-yard Kona Country Club might have
contributed to the cut soaring to 5-over. Seventy-five of the 125
players made it to the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam has hit 31 of 36 greens in regulation in her two
bogey-free rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy with the way I'm hitting the ball,'' the Swedish
star said. ''It's fun to hit the ball consistently like that. I get
up to my ball in the fairway and feel very confident with the
yardage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not seeing anything but a big green and where I need to
hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she was two strokes higher, Webb felt she played better
in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I missed quite a few short ones,'' she said. ''I hit it close
to the hole, but I wasn't always on the right side. I had a lot of
putts down grain and cross grain, and it's basically a guessing
game with those.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit the ball better than I did yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb won the LPGA's Australian Ladies Masters on Sunday. She won
The Office Depot in January in Florida in her only other LPGA
start, and added the Australian Women's Open title two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The $800,000, 54-hole tournament is sponsored by Takefuji Corp.,

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Fights Dismays Council  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council said Friday it was
dismayed at renewed fighting in Afghanistan, and implied a Taliban
offensive was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, however, said Friday that it had launched the
most recent battle and had captured a strategic Safad Kotal
mountain pass. The assault was launched in Dar-e-Suf, about 240
miles north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, said Ustad Ata
Mohammed, a spokesman for the opposition interviewed Friday by
satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Francesc Vendrell, the secretary-general's new personal
representative to Afghanistan, told the Security Council at a
briefing Friday that the United Nations couldn't confirm who was to
blame, council diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the insistence of Russia, the council issued a statement
implying the Taliban was responsible, the diplomats said, speaking
on condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Council members were dismayed ''with reports of a new offensive
launched by the Taliban which once again could undermine
international efforts to facilitate the restoration of peace in
Afghanistan and contribute to further deterioration of the
humanitarian situation in the country,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, there have been several reports of increased
fighting in Afghanistan, where the Taliban army rules about 90
percent of the country and the opposition the remaining 10 percent.
The fighting has been restricted to northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban espouse a harsh brand of Islam that targets women
and girls, bans most forms of light entertainment and requires men
to wear beards.

   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Ashley McElhiney scored 14 points as
Vanderbilt capitalized on No. 10 LSU's shooting problems to beat
the Lady Tigers 59-46 on Friday night in the SEC tournament
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-seeded Vanderbilt (20-11) will play second-ranked
Tennessee in the semifinals Saturday night. Tennessee beat Florida
91-79.
</P>
<P>
   LSU (22-6) had the worst half ever in school history in the
first when it hit just 5-of-26 for only 11 points, way below its
previous low of 20 points against Purdue in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Chantelle Anderson added 13 points for Vanderbilt and Zuzi
Klimesova had 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Tigers came in with four starters averaging in double
figures. But leading scorer Marie Ferdinand summed up their
problems. She was 2-of-11 for four points.
</P>
<P>
   Only April Brown (15) and Katrina Hibbert (10) got into double
digits for LSU.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers didn't quit despite turning in their worst scoring
performance of the season. They pulled within four twice, the last
at 37-33 on a three-point play by Brown with 7:59 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson hit a jumper, and LSU never threatened again.

rebounds as Denver's reserves led the Nuggets to a 122-88 win over
the Golden State Warriors Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was 13-for-20 from the field. Chris Gatling added 18

seven points in the quarter. The Nuggets regrouped with Jones and
Gatling coming off the bench to hit two baskets each to make it
54-46 at halftime.

Notes: Denver activated forward Ryan Bowen and placed guard Bryant
Stith on injured reserve with a sprained right quadriceps muscle.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Tennessee 91, Florida 79  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee coach Pat Summitt reminded
her No. 2 Lady Vols they would need help from the bench to win
their 10th SEC tournament championship.
</P>
<P>
   April McDivitt heard and obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman guard came off the bench and scored 11 of her
career-high 19 points over a four-minute stretch of the second half
Friday in helping Tennessee hold off Florida 91-79 in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have April step up and get a spark ... really turned that
game around,'' Summitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols (26-3) needed the help against seventh-seeded
Florida (17-12), which has beaten Tennessee only once in 28 games.
Tennessee trailed 50-49 with 16:52 left when McDivitt took over.
</P>
<P>
   Her jumper put Tennessee ahead to stay at 51-50 with 15:55 left
in sparking a 12-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, she stole the ball, ran for a layup and hit the
free throw for a three-point play. Center Michelle Snow called that
play -- in which McDivitt finished sprawled under the basket -- the
difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only did she make the play, she drew the foul and got the
fans in it,'' Snow said of the mostly Tennessee crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McDivitt capped the spurt with two 3s, the last from the top of
the key for a 64-54 lead with 12:04 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''April is a player,'' Florida coach Carol Ross said. ''We knew
she's a great shooter. Again, Tennessee's got a great bench. I say
they always will. You have to be able to answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida couldn't match McDivitt as Tonya Washington, who scored
16 points in the first half, got only two in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're obviously disappointed we couldn't put together a
40-minute game,'' Ross said of her Lady Gators, who shot 62 percent
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tennessee obviously picked it up a notch. Their intensity was
stronger in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamika Catchings led the Lady Vols with 23 points, Michelle Snow
had 19, and Semeka Randall 15.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will face Vanderbilt in Saturday's semifinals.
Vanderbilt beat No, 19 LSU 59-46 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee trailed by as much as seven in the first half and had
trouble shaking Florida in the opening minutes of the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols eventually built the lead to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Travis' drive for a 50-49 lead was the Lady Gators'
last. They now are 0-5 against Tennessee in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tombi Bell led Florida with 24 points, Washington finished with
18, Travis had 14 and Brandi McCain 13.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks 5, Lightning 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Tony Amonte had two goals and an assist Friday
night as the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning
5-1 in a game that included a second-period fight between Chicago
goaltender Steve Passmore and Tampa Bay goalie Dan Cloutier.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Yves Leroux, Bryan McCabe and Steve Sullivan also scored
for the Blackhawks, who have won three of their last four. Todd
Warriner connected for the Lightning, which has lost three
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Passmore and Cloutier tangled with 1:49 left in the middle
period after all 10 skaters on the ice had joined an altercation in
the Lightning zone. Cloutier, who had replaced starter Zac Bierk
after the Blackhawks' second goal at 10:37 of the first period,
charged down the ice and met Passmore at the Chicago blue line.
</P>
<P>
   The goalies grappled, circled around and exchanged a series of
punches. Cloutier received a minor penalty for leaving the crease,
a major for fighting, a misconduct and game misconduct -- requiring
his ejection from the contest. Passmore received a minor for
leaving the crease and a major for fighting, but was allowed to
continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago center Doug Gilmour, the subject of ongoing trade
rumors, sat out because of sore ribs. He was slashed Sunday in a
game at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago led 2-0 after the first period on goals by Leroux and
McCabe. Leroux opened the scoring at 8:55 from the edge of the
crease, McCabe made it 2-0 1:42 later on a shot from the top of the
circle that squeezed through Bierk's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan extended the lead to 3-0 at 1:54 of the second. After
circling the net, he tucked in a shot from the far post before
Cloutier could move across the goalmouth. Warriner scored for Tampa
Bay with 3:44 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte scored his 31st goal of the season at 6:47 of the third
to make it 4-1 after he pounced on a Tampa Bay giveaway. Amonte
swept in his 32nd goal with 4:47 left after being left open at the
edge of the crease.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die In News Helicopter Crash  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A television news helicopter crashed and burned in
a suburban neighborhood Friday, killing the pilot and cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   The WTVJ-TV helicopter was returning to the station from a
school bus accident. The helicopter was about 50 feet from another
helicopter when it appeared the pilot attempted to make a high-bank
turn, said Sonny Bushnell, who was playing golf nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then the tail ... just snapped off,'' Bushnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Al McGuire, a ramp agent at Tamiami Airport, where the
helicopter was based, said witnesses heard a popping sound before
the craft plunged straight down and exploded.
</P>
<P>
   It crashed into a small traffic circle in a residential
neighborhood in southwest Miami-Dade County. No injuries were
reported on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   WTVJ anchorwoman Jennifer Valoppi said on air that the crash was
''just an incredible shock to all of us here at NBC-6 and a very,
very sad moment. That was Sky 6, our own chopper with two of our
own people on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Camerman Rob Pierce, 34, had worked for the station for 10
years. Information on pilot Ruben Rivero was not available, the
station said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a devastating loss for WTVJ,'' news director Tim
Geraghty said. ''The two people on board were close and dear
colleagues.''

<HEADLINE> Diallo Lawyers To Meet Reno Deputy  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for the four New York City police
officers acquitted in the fatal shooting of a black man said they
will meet with Attorney General Janet Reno's top deputy Monday and
urge him not to pursue civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   John Patten, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said Friday
there is no basis for federal prosecutors to prosecute such a case.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no civil rights violation,'' Patten said in a
telephone interview. ''It was a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his first public comment on the case, told
a Democratic fund-raiser in San Francisco Friday night that he
believes the race of the victim, Amadou Diallo, was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pretend for a moment to second-guess the jury,''
Clinton said. ''But I know most people in America of all races
believe that if it had been a young white man in a young all-white
neighborhood, it probably wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Diallo's parents and black activists met for almost
two hours with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. They pressed
him to have the Justice Department take on the case and to bring
attention to the broader issue of police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the meeting were the Rev. Al Sharpton, NAACP
leader Kweisi Mfume and former New York City Mayor David Dinkins.
Afterward, nearly 2,000 demonstrators marched around the Justice
Department chanting and waving placards.
</P>
<P>
   Holder made no guarantee that charges would be sought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I indicated that the review is a priority, that we have not
ruled anything out and that it will be conducted as thoroughly and
expeditiously as possible,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   To gain a conviction, federal prosecutors would have to prove
the officers -- Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth
Boss -- intentionally violated Diallo's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the early hours of Feb.
4, 1999, as the West African immigrant stood in the vestibule of
his Bronx apartment building. The officers testified they fired at
Diallo when he reached for what they thought was a gun. It turned
out to be his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a jury of eight whites and four blacks acquitted the
officers of all charges, which ranged from second-degree murder to
reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a mixed jury. That in itself is a powerful statement,''
Patten said. He added there was no intent to kill Diallo and said
that even the jury agreed there were no racial overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because Al Sharpton is in the streets saying it's about
race doesn't make it about race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boss' attorney, Steven Brounstein, said he hoped the matter
could be resolved quickly. ''We don't want this hanging over
anyone's head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, and Tom Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment
Association and of the Washington-based National Association of
Police Organizations, also plan to attend Monday's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Court Orders Releases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- The Guatemalan Supreme Court on Friday
ordered the release of four Belizean military officials whose
imprisonment fueled a century-old border dispute between the
Central American neighbors. The four were freed shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   Three soldiers and a police officer from the Belize Defense
Force were arrested on illegal weapons charges Feb. 24 after they
were found with machine guns and pistols in what Guatemalan
officials insist was in the northernmost Guatemalan state of Peten.
The Guatemalan military says it has scientific proof the four were
in Guatemalan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Belizean officials say they never crossed the border and were
actually arrested in Belize's Toledo District.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrests last week marked the latest chapter in a nearly
150-year-old territorial dispute. Guatemala has claimed parts and,
at times, even all of Belize as its rightful territory. Though
Guatemala officially recognized Belize's borders in 1992, the
disagreement was reignited in recent months by the deaths of two
Guatemalans at the hands of border guards from Belize.
</P>
<P>
   After the recent arrests became public, Belize immediately
called off a round of scheduled peace talks with Guatemalan
officials in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court judges gave no explanation for their decision.
