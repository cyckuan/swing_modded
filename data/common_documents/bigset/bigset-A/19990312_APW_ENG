<HEADLINE> Otters Who Bit Girl Spared, For Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The lives of four otters were spared Friday  
when the parents of a little girl who was bitten by one of the 
creatures decided to go ahead with rabies shots without having the 
animals killed and tested first. 
</P>
<P>
	The little girl, 17-month-old Rachael Gold of New York City, was  
bitten on the finger during a visit earlier this month to Flamingo 
Gardens, a nature park north of Miami, when she got too close to 
the animals' cage. It was not clear which otter bit her. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachael's parents could have demanded that the otters be tested  
for rabies -- which requires that the animals be killed -- to 
determine whether Rachael really needed to undergo the regimen of 
five rabies shots. 
</P>
<P>
	But amid protests from animal lovers who were outraged that  
Fatty, Chrissy, Blinky and Big-Um faced death, Rachael's parents 
decided to go ahead with the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't going anywhere without a big fight,'' activist  
Maria Lopez said of the otters. She was one of about 40 protesters 
who assembled at the entrance to the park before word of the 
reprieve. Protesters carried signs that said, ``Save the Otters'' 
and ``Honk'' in support. 
</P>
<P>
	The otters are still not out of danger. Rachael has food  
allergies and asthma, and if she has an allergic reaction to the 
shots, her parents, Gene Gold and his wife, Leslie Price, could 
suspend the treatment and have the animals killed and tested to be 
sure that the shots are absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials said the parents never should have taken their  
daughter so close. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents went off the beaten path and went to the side of  
the exhibit where only employees are allowed,'' said animal 
director Michael Ruggieri. ``The mom pushed the baby right up to 
the wire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gold said there were no signs designating the area closed to  
the public, and park officials admitted there was no gate blocking 
access to the area. One was installed on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting rabies shot was once a far more painful process than it  
is today. In the past, the shots were given in the stomach. Today 
they are given in the arm for adults and the thigh for children.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Economy Shrinks Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy shrank for a record fifth straight  
quarter, the government said Friday in a report likely to increase 
pressure for efforts to propel the economy out of its worst 
recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the 0.8 percent drop in gross domestic  
product in the October-December quarter came as a government panel 
approved a 7.5 trillion yen ($62.5 billion) bailout package on 
Friday for 15 of its largest banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad-loan cleanup, using taxpayer money, is the cornerstone  
of a government plan to pull the country out of its worst recession 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures on GDP -- the measure of all goods and services  
produced in the country -- showed that the economy will shrink 3.2 
percent in the 1998-99 fiscal year if the pace continues. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mark the first time the Japanese economy has  
contracted for two fiscal years in a row since the end of World War 
II. The economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the 1997-98 fiscal year, 
which ended March 31, in the first full-year decline since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	For the July-September 1998 quarter, the GDP contracted 0.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismal show is likely to set off calls for Tokyo to do more  
to turn the economy around, said Kenneth Landon, senior currency 
strategist at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that these figures were so much worse than expected  
leads me to believe that the government has underestimated the 
economy's weakness up until now,'' Landon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials, however, played down the need for more  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cabinet is proceeding with every conceivable policy  
measure. We're starting to see results here and there,'' said chief 
government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at a record high 4.4 percent and a credit  
crunch squeezing companies, the Japanese government has already 
earmarked 81.9 trillion yen ($682.5 billion) in the budget for the 
next fiscal year for public works spending, tax cuts and other 
stimulus measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In one sign of good news, a research company said Friday that  
corporate bankruptcies were down last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunging 40 percent compared to a year earlier, the number of  
bankruptcies dropped below 1,000 for the first time in six years, 
Teikoku Data Bank said. Bankruptcies have fallen since October, 
when a loan-guarantee system for small and medium-sized companies 
was set up. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the massive bank bailout  
would put the financial industry -- hobbled by at least 70 trillion 
yen ($584 billion) in bad loans -- on track to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the injection of public funds, we are now about to  
achieve stability in the financial system,'' he said, adding that 
the economy ``may now have turned the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said things were unlikely to get better soon.  
</P>
<P>
	Brian Rose, chief economist at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo,  
said he expected the economy to continue to shrink for at least 
another two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Young, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo,  
said he also remained cautious. ``The economy is still very, very 
fragile,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  76ers Won't Discipline Iverson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers had two team meetings  
Friday and decided that Allen Iverson should not be disciplined for 
missing practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Brown said he would follow the team's  
recommendation, and Iverson scored 28 points in the Sixers' 100-93 
overtime victory over New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need him on the court,'' co-captain Harvey Grant said.  
``I'm sure he realizes we need him on the court, and we need his 
leadership on and off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, had an unexcused absence from  
the team workout Thursday. Brown didn't comment on whether Iverson 
would start or play against the Nets, but said in a radio interview 
that he'd let the team decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get this thing straightened out, and I will do what  
they tell me to do,'' Brown told WIP sports radio about an hour 
before the scheduled meeting. ``I'm going to sit down with my team, 
and they're going to tell me what is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players met Friday morning to discuss the Iverson issue, and  
Brown and the coaching staff joined them for a second meeting about 
an hour before the game against the Nets. They explained the team 
rules to Iverson and stressed that they are not to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for family members to let bygones be bygones,''  
Iverson said after the game. ``It's time to move on. I talked to 
them about what I thought about the situation, and they talked to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No rules were changed, except one: From now on, practices will  
be closed to the media except for a few minutes at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not show at practice Thursday, the morning after the  
76ers played poorly but beat the Charlotte Hornets 85-70. He has 
since explained that he missed practice because his longtime 
girlfriend was sick after a miscarriage last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson missed practice once last week for that reason but was  
excused by the team. He apparently asked his bodyguard to tell 
Brown he wouldn't be at practice and assumed that would be the end 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen came in and addressed the situation,'' said his  
backcourt partner, Eric Snow. ``I think it was a miscommunication 
on his part, and a miscommunication on our part, because we didn't 
know the answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After attending practice Friday, Iverson said he was miffed at  
Brown for talking about his private business with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to rip me, rip me to my face in front of my  
teammates,'' Iverson said. ``Keep it in the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Iverson feuded when the coach first took the 76ers job  
last year, but had ironed out their differences -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get a handle on him when I first got here,'' Brown  
said. ``You try everything in your power to watch people grow and 
develop. You do everything you can to see that it happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes along the line you make mistakes, you make some  
mistakes personally. And I think I've made some tremendous mistakes 
not nipping this thing in the bud right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow and Grant, the two team captains, said everyone on the team  
was happy with how the controversy was handled. Sixers president 
Pat Croce agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the team wants is fine with me,'' Croce said. ``My  
whole goal is to win.''

<HEADLINE> Drunk Driver Said To Crash MADD Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) -- A man with four drunken driving  
convictions was arrested on DWI charges again, this time after 
allegedly plowing into a car operated by the state executive 
director of MADD. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Podzka, 48, was driving with a suspended license when his  
car hit Barbara Harrington's as she headed home from a Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving meeting Tuesday night, police said. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal  
limit, the Boston Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka was immediately arrested, and police said they  
confiscated four cans of beer -- two of them open -- from an area 
near his car. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness told police he saw Podzka frantically hurling beer  
cans into the woods immediately after the crash, said state police 
Sgt. Ron Sieberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka was convicted of drunken driving four times between 1981  
and 1989, according to police records. He also faced drunken 
driving charges two other times but was not convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harrington was not in her office Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Like all crashes involving repeat offenders, the crash  
involving MADD Massachusetts' executive director is another call to 
action for cracking down on people with a record of drinking 
alcohol and then getting behind the wheel,'' MADD national 
president Karolyn Nunnallee said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka pleaded not guilty Wednesday and was released without  
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Podzka, nor his lawyer, Nancy Golden, returned calls  
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Budget Has Too Much Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Among the $41 million of miscalculations  
in the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's budget, one stands out: too 
much beer. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's new president, Mitt Romney, said Thursday that  
the 2002 Winter Games are now expected to cost $81 million more 
than when the budget was written last fall, and half of the amount 
is due to wrong assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Those bad assumptions mostly had to do with federal funding,  
Romney said, but staffers say some of the mistakes came in 
calculations for beer, gravel and building supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	When they reviewed the budget at Romney's behest this winter,  
staffers decided that sponsor Anheuser-Busch was donating more beer 
than could be consumed during the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	That lowers the value of the brewery's contribution, which, even  
though it is not cash, comes off the revenue projections. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC needs beer during the Games to sell at concession stands  
and provide in hospitality areas, but it can't sell what it does 
not use under the terms of the $50 million sponsorship deal with 
Anheuser-Busch. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee can trade the brew for something it does need,  
possibly with another sponsor, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something we can't use,'' said senior vice president  
of operations Bill Wagner, named to the post on Thursday. ``We 
never say that. We'll use any (contribution) we can get. We just 
have to figure out how to use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for some of the other products expected to be  
donated to the organizing committee. In the case of building 
supplies such as gravel, organizers overestimated the value of 
expected contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Such contributions, known to organizers as ``value-in-kind,''  
are tricky to put a price tag on, Wagner said. ``The assumptions at 
the time of budget was that all of that was going to be 100 percent 
budget-relieving,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items comprising the $81 million include $9 million the  
SLOC now expects to pay for legal fees and marketing because of the 
scandal, $5 million for a medals plaza that it is not certain will 
be donated and, importantly, $25 million more for computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Those higher costs could push the SLOC's budget to $1.52  
billion, which Romney proposes to fund by going after $67 million 
more from new revenue sources and cutting the SLOC spending with a 
hiring freeze and other measures worth $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Board of Trustees Management Committee did not act  
on his plan on Thursday, Romney said he's operating under his own 
contingency plan trimming $84 million in frills from the budget, 
bringing it $17 million below last fall's $1.44 billion budget 
level.

<HEADLINE> Two Sets of Twins Face Off in NCAAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Those uniform numbers will sure come in handy  
when Georgia meets Liberty in the NCAA women's tournament Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Bulldogs, led by twins Kelly and Coco Miller, face a  
set of Liberty lookalikes, Sarah and Sharon Wilkerson, in a 
first-round game at the Mideast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little different, going twin on twin,''  
Coco Miller said. ``But I think it will be fun. It's always neat to 
see how other teams play me and Kelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 Millers are carbon copies of each other, right  
down to their matching hair styles and a penchant for wearing their 
Nike wrist bands just below the left elbow. To the casual observer, 
they are distinguishable only by their uniform numbers -- Kelly 
wears 23, Coco is 35. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may confuse them a little,'' Coco said grinning, looking  
for any advantage over the Wilkersons. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty's identical twins are four inches shorter and easier to  
tell apart. Sharon revealed her penchant for individualism last 
summer by picking a different coiffure than her sister, adding 
blonde highlights to her dark brown hair, allowing it to grow 
longer and dropping the bangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom used to dress us alike and I hated it so much,'' Sharon  
said. ``When we were freshmen and sophomores, we had the same hair, 
the same bangs. It was hard to tell us apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, both sets of twins possess a unique bond that  
cannot be defined in earthly terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can look at Sarah, whether she's passing or shooting, and  
tell exactly what she's going to do,'' Sharon said. ``It takes a 
long time for other players to develop that kind of relationship. I 
guess it's like John Stockton and Karl Malone. We just feed off 
each other. It's hard to guard because we don't have to talk to 
communicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coco Miller led Georgia in scoring with an average of 19.4  
points per game, Kelly was second at 18.0. Kelly was the team 
leader in steals and assists, Coco ranked second and third in those 
categories, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Wilkerson was Liberty's second-leading scorer at 16.0  
points per game, Sarah ranked third with an average of 12.2. Sarah 
led in assists, Sharon was second. Sharon shot 42.1 percent from 
the field, Sarah connected at 41.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sets of twins could wind up guarding each other, but  
neither coach expects the dual matchups to overshadow the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no different than the other eight kids on the team  
playing against kids who aren't twins,'' said Andy Landers, coach 
of third-seeded Georgia (21-7). ``It's not about who may or may not 
guard each other. This is about Georgia and Liberty. If we lose 
sight of that, I'll be upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've been reading, both sets of twins are a lot  
alike,'' said coach Rick Reeves of 14th-seeded Liberty (21-7), 
making its third straight NCAA appearance. ``They are the type of 
kids who will play hard for 40 minutes, then shake hands at the end 
and appreciate the opportunity they got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Millers have been virtually inseparable their entire lives --  
rooming together, going to class together, playing sports together. 
Still just sophomores, the Minnesota natives refuse to look ahead 
to the inevitable moment when they must go their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a tough subject,'' Coco said. ``We never talk about  
that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilkersons, who are juniors, began to make the break last  
summer by living apart for the first time. Sarah went home to 
Princeton, W.Va., and left behind Sharon, who had a job and wanted 
to stay close to campus so she could work out in her spare time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't like I expected,'' Sharon said. ``I expected to miss  
her more than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The break will be complete May 1, when Sarah marries her high  
school sweetheart and changes her last name from Wilkerson to 
Farley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time they learned not to be together,'' Reeves  
said. ``That might be an uncomfortable situation when Sarah gets 
married.''

<HEADLINE> Six Children Dead in St. Louis Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Six children died Friday in an apartment fire  
that authorities believe was arson. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters found three children dead from smoke inhalation.  
Three others who were huddled together and unconscious in a closet 
died in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims range in age from 1 or 2 to early teens.  
Firefighters are not sure of their relationship but said they 
believed one family lived in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	A man was arrested hours after the fire broke out. Police said  
the suspect was believed to have been in a fight outside the 
apartment building prior to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have a fire at 4:30 p.m. on one of the busiest  
intersections in St. Louis, 50 feet from the firehouse, and it is 
fully engulfed in flames within minutes, there's a pretty strong 
indication it was intentional,'' St. Louis Fire Chief Neil 
Svetonics said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman believed to be the mother of some of the children was  
not home at the time of the fire, but arrived just as firefighters 
were extinguishing it, fire Capt. Duane Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said flames were shooting out of the windows when she  
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw the fire and then we saw a girl hanging out the window  
crying `Help me, help me and my kids,''' said Selina Bailey, who 
was picking up her younger sister from cheerleading practice in the 
neighborhood. ``This is a sad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman escaped the fire by jumping out of a window in the  
third-floor apartment. Rose William, a neighbor, said the woman 
landed on her face. The woman suffered burns and broke her leg.

<HEADLINE> DNC To Announce LA Convention Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee is expected  
to announce Monday that its 2000 presidential convention will be 
held in Los Angeles, ending weeks of rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials said Thursday the DNC and the city have  
come to terms, though they still were in the final stages of 
negotiations. Only minor details were left to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	While Denver and Boston were the two other finalists, it has  
been clear for weeks that Los Angeles would serve as convention 
host. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention is expected to bring 20,000 delegates, their  
families and media members to Los Angeles. Democrats last held 
their convention in Los Angeles when President Kennedy was

	Market Ends Lower; Dow Down 21.09  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks lost momentum today, forcing the Dow  
Jones industrial average to pause in its trek toward 10,000, after 
several big companies issued disappointing earnings forecasts. At 
the close on Wall Street, the Dow was down 21.09 at 9,876.35. The 
blue-chip index had come within 42 points of 10,000 in early 
trading before giving up ground. Broader market indicators were 
mostly lower. Disappointing news from Microsoft and software maker 
Oracle led to broad selling in technology stocks. The 
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 30.71 to 2,381.54.

	Major Oil Producers OK Lower Output  
</P>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Oil prices jumped to five-month  
highs today on news that major oil producers agreed to cut 
production by more than 2 million barrels a day in an attempt to 
bolster depressed oil prices. Saudi Arabia's oil minister said all 
OPEC members except Iraq have committed to the cutbacks, as did 
non-OPEC members Mexico and Oman. Discussions are under way with 
other non-OPEC countries. The agreement is effective April 1. It 
must be formally approved at that meeting of the Organization of 
the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Today's announcement pushed up 
contracts for April delivery of light, sweet crude 47 cents to 
$14.78 per barrel this afternoon on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange -- the highest level since early October.

	Producer Prices Post Big Decline  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Falling prices for vegetables, heating oil and  
new cars in February helped produce the sharpest decline in more 
than a year in prices charged by factories, refineries and food 
processing plants. The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for 
finished goods fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent last month, 
the most in 13 months, mostly reversing an unusually large 0.5 
percent increase the month before, the department said today. 
Analysts had attributed the January gain, and a 0.4 percent 
increase in December, to a variety of special factors and 
February's bigger-than-expected drop reinforced their view that 
inflation pressures in the production process can scarcely be 
found. 

</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid Stock Sinks  
</P>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. warned today its quarterly  
earnings will be substantially below analysts' expectations, and 
its stock price tumbled. The Camp Hill, Pa.-based drug store 
company said its earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter would be 30 
cents to 32 cents per share, compared to Wall Street projections of 
52 cents a share. The company blamed the largest portion of the 
expected shortfall on costs associated with the opening of 206 new 
stores in the last 45 days of the quarter, and losses from 
liquidating the inventory in 208 stores in recent months. Rite Aid 
stock fell 14 1/2 to 22 1/2.

	DirecTV, Broadcasters Settle Suit

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Customers of America's largest satellite TV  
company who aren't entitled to receive CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox 
programs by satellite will keep getting them that way for awhile 
under a deal announced today. DirecTV and the National Association 
of Broadcasters, whose members include the four major broadcast 
networks, have agreed to settle a lawsuit over which viewers can 
watch network programs sent to them by satellite. A federal judge 
in Miami who has been hearing the copyright dispute would have to 
approve the deal.

	Calif. Regulators Seize Company  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a first for California, state regulators  
have taken over an ailing health care network, vowing that service 
to the company's 1.3 million patients statewide will not be 
interrupted. The state Department of Corporations yesterday placed 
MedPartners Provider Network into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
The Los Angeles Times reported today that the takeover was to 
ensure the company wouldn't close without making arrangements to 
care for patients.

	Japanese Economy Shrinks Again  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy shrank for a record fifth straight  
quarter, the government said Friday in a report likely to increase 
pressure for efforts to propel the economy out of its worst 
recession in 50 years. The announcement of the 0.8 percent drop in 
gross domestic product in the October-December quarter came as a 
government panel approved a 7.5 trillion yen ($62.5 billion) 
bailout package on Friday for 15 of its largest banks. The bad-loan 
cleanup, using taxpayer money, is the cornerstone of a government 
plan to pull the country out of its worst recession since World War 
II.

	Lawmaker Wants FCC Revamped  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency responsible for overseeing  
television and telephone companies needs to be revamped to have a 
competitive, rather than regulatory, mission, one of the House's 
top telecommunications lawmakers said today. The House Commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee headed by Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., 
is holding a hearing on the Federal Communications Commission next 
week. Republican lawmakers have criticized the FCC for acting too 
regulatory, particularly in its implementation of a 1996 law 
freeing cable, local and long-distance companies to get into each 
other's business. But it's not clear whether any measure to 
overhaul the FCC could pass Congress and be signed into law.

Corp., said it will move its headquarters to Houston and eliminate

<HEADLINE> Cohen Ends Middle East Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen wrapped up a  
week-long Middle East trip today with calls on Israeli politicians 
and a ceremony to thank the Israeli soldiers who responded last 
summer to the U.S. embassy bombing in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen traveled to the Israeli defense ministry for the ceremony  
on behalf of the Israeli military rescue team that rushed to 
Nairobi after terrorists attacked the American embassy there. 
</P>
<P>
	``You showed the world that amidst the debris of cruelty there  
is a compassion that has the power to restore,'' Cohen said. ``And 
your noble deeds also remind the world of a fundamental truth -- 
that our nations stand together and we know that a strike at one is 
a strike at both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu, Cohen also paid courtesy calls on the two opposition 
party candidates vying to win Israel's top political post in May 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen met with centrist party candidate Yitzhak Mordechai and,  
just before departing Israel, with Labor Party candidate Ehud 
Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	The point was to underscore the Clinton administration's strict  
neutrality in the elections. There's been much speculation in the 
Israeli press that Cohen's itinerary might somehow be aimed at 
helping Netanyahu or one of the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter who is in office from the U.S. position as  
far as one party or the other,'' Cohen said. ``We will always 
maintain a strong tie to Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also met with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens for an  
honors presentation to some of the 170 members of Israel's 
Homefront Command sent to Kenya last Aug. 7 following a devastating 
terrorist bomb attack that collapsed a building near the U.S. 
embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialists in search-and-rescue, emergency medicine,  
communications and public affairs traveled to the scene early the 
day after the bombing at the orders of Netanyahu and Arens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli team was credited with rescuing three people from  
the rubble and medical teams assisted many more.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Re-Sign Kicker Vinatieri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots kept free agent  
place-kicker Adam Vinatieri, signing him Friday to a three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri, a restricted free agent, had reportedly been  
considering at a three-year, $2.5 million deal with the expansion 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the Patriots deal were not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri is among the league's best, scoring a career-high 127  
points last season to rank fifth in the NFL. Only Denver's Jason 
Elam has scored more points in his first three seasons, beating 
Vinatieri 370-362. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pats first signed Vinatieri as a rookie in 1996 as a  
non-drafted free agent from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he kicked 31 field goals, including a franchise  
record-tying 55-yarder.

<HEADLINE> Wheelchair Mom Found Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- With her 5-year-old daughter sitting on  
her lap, Kelly Dillery rolled her wheelchair out of the courtroom 
as the cheering from her supporters grew louder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery was acquitted Thursday of charges that she  
endangered the child by riding along streets with the girl strapped 
to her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Disability activists had rallied to her defense and railed  
against prosecutors for bringing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reaffirms for all of us that we have a right to live our  
own lives,'' said Mary Butler, director of the Center for 
Independent Living in nearby Elyria. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery, 30, hugged her lawyers upon hearing the verdict and  
wiped away tears as relatives rushed from their seats to embrace 
her. She could have been sentenced to six months in jail and fined 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she said she is now ``just looking forward to being  
with Kelsi,'' her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery, who has muscular dystrophy, was charged after a  
driver told police that Kelsi had hit her head on the mirror of a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Rob DeLamatre said Ms. Dillery was putting Kelsi in  
danger by riding in traffic. Police have suggested alternative ways 
of travel, but she continues to ride in the street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery says she must travel in the street because some  
sidewalks aren't accessible to her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney K. Ronald Bailey argued that prosecutors and  
police pretended to know how the handicapped should conduct 
themselves without knowing anything about the limitations of their 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've never sat in the seat of a wheelchair, but they can  
tell you what it must be like,'' Bailey told the jury in closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery previously had been convicted twice of using her  
wheelchair in a street and was fined $50 for each offense. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen of her supporters sat in wheelchairs in a  
lobby outside the cramped courtroom and cheered when they heard the 
verdict announced on closed-circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wore pink and green buttons saying ``Ban cars, not Kelly.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Unhappy With NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- With three former East Bloc allies entering NATO  
today, Russia is vehemently opposed to the alliance's enlargement, 
which it considers a direct threat to its borders and security. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians across the spectrum, from President Boris Yeltsin to  
his Communist foes, are convinced that NATO's eastward expansion 
can only be targeted at Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	In less than a decade, they have seen Poland, Hungary and the  
Czech Republic transformed from Russia's ramparts to a potential 
forward base for what is seen here as an ever more aggressive 
Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds very elegant, the idea of spreading democracy in  
Eastern Europe, but it actually means not allowing Russia and its 
partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States to get political 
and economic cooperation underway with Europe,'' said Vladimir 
Volkov, head of the Institute for Slavic Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ordinary Russians share that view, and see NATO as a prime  
instrument for isolating their nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst for the Segodnya daily,  
said that NATO expansion was at the root of the steadily increasing 
anti-Western sentiment in Russian society -- a mood he said was even 
worse than in Soviet times. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of the 90s, there was a totally different  
atmosphere in Russia: It was very pro-western,'' Felgenhauer said. 
``NATO expansion helped change the general mood toward the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Russia has watched its own world influence and defense  
capabilities decline, it has regarded NATO's increased activity in 
Balkan hot spots such as Bosnia and Kosovo with intense suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	With Russia's cash-strapped military close to collapse and its  
units short of everything from food to weapons, Russians ask why 
NATO continues to add new members and sophisticated new weapons. 
NATO officials counter that the alliance has always been purely 
defensive and is not aimed at anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials are alarmed over the possibility of NATO  
forces being deployed close to Russia's borders, and they fear that 
NATO's new military doctrine will enshrine an expanded sphere of 
activity beyond its members' borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussion of the draft doctrine is on NATO's agenda for  
discussion during a summit in April. 
</P>
<P>
	So was the ceremony marking full membership for Poland, Hungary  
and the Czech Republic -- until NATO officials realized that would 
almost guarantee Russia's boycott of the alliance's 50th 
anniversary jubilee. They moved up the date for induction to today. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Yeltsin will probably skip the April summit, his  
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's reaction to NATO's admission of new members ``remains  
negative. He doesn't think that this is a constructive step,'' 
Yakushkin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, a high-ranking Defense Ministry  
official, said that Russia was not planning any response to the 
three East European countries' inclusion in NATO, the Interfax news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he warned that ``further enlargement, which is  
diminishing Russia's geopolitical and military-strategic space, may 
force Russia to take responsive measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is particularly concerned that the three Baltic republics  
on its western border -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- as well as 
Ukraine, to the southwest, will also be invited to join NATO.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 26.64 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market fell today, keeping the Dow  
Jones industrial average from reaching 10,000, amid weakness in 
technology issues and Dow component Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was down 26.64 at 9,870.80.  
The Dow came within 42 points of 10,000 in early trading before 
giving up some ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow came within 65 points of 10,000 before  
closing at 9,897.44. Broader market indicators were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointing news from Microsoft and software maker Oracle led  
to broad selling today in technology stocks. The Nasdaq composite 
index, which reflects the performance of many high-tech issues, was 
down 17.55 at 2,394.70 . 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle fell 8 3/16 to 28 11/16 after the company's third-quarter  
sales fell short of analysts' expectations. Microsoft was down 3 
15/16 at 167 1/2 after the company said it would defer about $400 
million in revenue from its third to its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm equipment maker Caterpillar, down 5 1/8 at 45 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, said its first quarter would fall far short of 
analyst expectations because of lower machine and engine sales. 
Also, on the Big Board, IBM also fell 3 5/8 at 179 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The market initially moved higher today after the Labor  
Department released its Producer Price Index, which dropped a 
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in February, indicating that 
inflation remains under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping some stocks was a move by OPEC officials to cut oil  
production in an attempt to boost sagging crude prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was fell 3.07 at 1,294.61, after  
hitting a high of 1,302.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues had a narrow margin over advancers on the NYSE,  
where volume came to 262.23 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.78 at 610.89 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.42 at 720.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.09 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 5.31 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
up 5.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP 2000 Political Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Republican Lamar Alexander, hoping  
his education plan will carry him to the White House, went 
classroom to classroom Friday pledging to make fixing schools his 
first priority. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the former Tennessee governor's plan: a national  
voucher system that would give $1,500 to low- and middle-income 
parents to help them send their children to the public or private 
schools of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	It would cost $2 billion a year over five years, he said, to be  
paid in part from the budget surplus. While he raised taxes as 
governor to finance school improvements, he ruled out doing so as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say school-choice voucher programs would drain resources  
from schools that can't immediately compete with private schools or 
affluent public ones. Battles have erupted in several states over 
the programs and California voters have soundly rejected them twice 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said in an interview his plan is different because it  
would not redistribute state money but rather bring more dollars in 
from Washington. He likened it to existing federal scholarships 
that students can take to any college, public or private. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the idea helped to make California colleges some of the  
best in the world, why don't we use it to make California schools 
the best in the world?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	His voucher system would be run by the Education Department,  
which he wanted to abolish in his first campaign for the Republican 
presidential nomination, in 1996. ``My thinking has evolved,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also favors scrapping tenure, to make it easier to  
fire bad teachers, and turning every school in the country into a 
charter school. Such schools are typically created by groups of 
teachers, community members or parents and are free of many state 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Puente learning center, where most of the students are  
Hispanic, Alexander played up the virtues of speaking multiple 
languages. But in the interview, he called bilingual education 
programs a failure because they do not result in effective English 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	He would replace bilingual education -- outlawed in California by  
voters last year -- with programs to improve the English skills of 
nonnative speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also proposed establishing a foundation financed by $1  
billion in private money that would provide grants or 
optional-repayment loans for English instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The former head of the University of Tennessee acknowledged that  
aside from the voucher system, few of his proposals could be 
directly set in motion from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job of the president is to see an urgent need, to set an  
agenda and persuade half the people it's right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he thought education will become the defining  
issue of the campaign, Alexander said: ``If it doesn't, I'll be 
back in Tennessee.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush picked up support from another GOP  
governor Friday for his likely run for the Republican presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania said of Bush: ``I like the  
inclusiveness of his politics, and I like the inclusiveness of his 
ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Bush received the backing of a majority of the  
nation's Republican governors, but Ridge did not sign the letter of 
support at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation is looking for leadership and we have a candidate  
who can fill that,'' said Ridge. ``There's a determination and a 
toughness in Governor Bush that I think combines the best of 
President and Mrs. Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge also said Bush's pragmatic approach would be good for the  
party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like 'the politics of what works,''' said Ridge. ``He's  
demonstrated himself in politics in Texas'' by beating a popular 
incumbent governor and winning re-election in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said Friday he will begin running weekly radio  
addresses in Iowa, with the first scheduled for Sunday. His 
campaign is buying the radio time. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's initial broadcast, supporting the use of ethanol,  
will air Sunday morning on KASI in Ames and Sunday evening on WHO 
in Des Moines.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Seeks Basketball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia is searching for someone to lead the  
men's basketball program, and only those with head coaching 
experience need apply. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ron Jirsa admitted Friday he was ``surprised'' by the  
decision to fire him after only two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Vince Dooley dismissed Jirsa on Thursday, one  
day after Georgia closed a disappointing 15-15 season with a 77-57 
loss to Clemson in the first round of the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs lost 11 of their final 14 games, sealing Jirsa's  
fate by closing out with a four-game losing streak. He had a 
two-year record of 35-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley made a point to say he will only pursue candidates who  
are proven winners as head coaches. Jirsa had no head coaching 
experience at any level when he was picked to succeed Tubby Smith 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be talking with everyone in the industry,'' Dooley said.  
``We've already had some conversations and we'll have some more. I 
would certainly like to have someone in place by April,'' before 
the national signing day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those being mentioned in the media as possible candidates  
are Buzz Peterson of Appalachian State, Steve Alford of Southwest 
Missouri, Mike Bray of Delaware, Tommy Amaker of Seton Hall and 
Leonard Hamilton of Miami. Another candidate who doesn't fit 
Dooley's head-coaching requirement is Quin Snyder, the top 
assistant for No. 1 Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some names in my head,'' Dooley said. ``Definitely.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa, who had indicated he would meet with the media Friday,  
decided instead to release a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must admit that I was surprised to be dismissed yesterday,  
but that is the nature of the coaching business,'' he said. 
``Foremost, I would like to express my strong feelings toward our 
players in the program. They kept fighting through a tough 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs signed five players during the early signing  
period, including Marietta High School standout Ezra Williams. The 
three members of Jirsa's staff are under contract until June 30 and 
will try to convince the recruiting class from having a change of 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though we know they will not carry on with the enthusiasm we  
would like because of the situation, I do sense this staff feels a 
great deal of responsibility and loyalty to the fact they are under 
contract,'' Dooley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa said his ``biggest regret is that I will be unable to  
complete this recruiting class and coach these talented young men 
who have already committed to the university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs also hope sophomore star Jumaine Jones will  
reconsider his decision to enter the NBA draft. If Jones leaves, 
Georgia will have only one returning player, freshman D.A. Layne, 
who averaged more than five points per game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa said he hoped to land another coaching job, and Dooley  
promised to do ``everything we can to help him. He is a proven 
assistant coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love coaching,'' said Jirsa, who still had three years left  
on a Georgia contract that paid him a total of about $350,000 per 
year. ``There will be other challenging opportunities ahead for Ron 
Jirsa.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Debate Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is ready next week, after two  
failed attempts, to vote on a bill aimed at ensuring construction 
of a national missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea born in the Reagan administration is being revived in  
Congress amid growing concern over an attack by terrorists or a 
rogue state. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Democrats managed twice to block debate by one vote.  
Thursday night, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
announced agreement with the Democrats to let the debate go forward 
with a vote as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, fearing the vote would hinder  
negotiations with Russia over changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile Treaty, has threatened a veto of the measure which would 
state: 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is  
technologically possible an effective national missile defense 
system capable of defending the territory of the United States 
against limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, 
unauthorized or delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., introduced the bill on the Senate  
floor late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is progress,'' said Cochran. '' We're very proud to see  
this momentum to address this issue that is so important for the 
national security interests of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, administration officials at a congressional  
hearing outlined steps being taken to defend U.S. troops and 
civilians against various types of missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that  
China and Russia have held talks on the prospects of a U.S. 
anti-missile umbrella and are united in their opposition to the 
system. China also is concerned about the possibility of U.S. 
arrangements with Japan or Taiwan on missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	A House version of the bill cleared the House Armed Service  
Committee by a 50-3 margin last month. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton included money in his fiscal 1999 budget  
request for beginning to build such a system, but Republicans want 
faster spending. Clinton also has delayed until June 2000 a 
decision on whether to go ahead with a full-scale system. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have pushed for a missile defense system since  
the early 1980s, when President Reagan proposed a space-based 
shield against incoming missiles. The issue has drawn increased 
Democratic support with the firing of a ballistic missile by North 
Korea last year and reports that Iran is developing an offensive 
missile program.

<HEADLINE>  Businesses Criticize Ecuador Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Business leaders and leftist-led unions  
assailed the president's emergency economic package Friday, saying 
it was crippling Ecuador as the country tries to overcome its worst 
fiscal crisis in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad doubled the price of gasoline Thursday,  
proposed raising taxes and ordered banks to remain shut for a fifth 
straight day to give the government time to implement the harsh 
austerity program. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative Social Christian Party, which has supported  
some of Mahuad's policies since he took office last year, now finds 
itself opposed to many reforms. Party leaders will meet this 
weekend to decide on a response. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is mired in its worst economic crisis in recent decades,  
hammered by $2.6 billion in damage from El Nino-powered floods last 
year and low prices for oil, its main export. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of an impending financial meltdown in the poor Andean  
nation led to massive bank withdrawals last week and caused the 
national currency, the sucre, to lose a quarter of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before Mahuad announced his measures, Central Bank  
President Luis Jacome and three of four members of the bank's board 
of directors resigned. On Friday, they said they took the action 
because of ``political and economic differences'' with the 
government. Mahuad has not yet named replacments. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations came at the end of a nationwide two-day strike,  
which turned violent at times, ended Thursday. Some 235 people were 
arrested and 19 were injured in street clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of union members, students, Indian groups and  
leftist parties announced another strike for Wednesday to force 
Mahuad to back down. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 teachers began a hunger strike in the Italian Embassy  
in Quito. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the measures announced by Mahuad must still be approved  
by Congress, where Mahuad's centrist Popular Democracy party lacks 
a majority and needs the support of other parties to pass 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some business leaders blasted Mahuad's proposals to raise sales  
tax from 10 percent to 15 percent and partially freeze bank 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Account holders with more than $185 in checking accounts or $385  
in savings accounts can withdraw up to half their money. The rest 
has been frozen -- in the case of checking accounts, for a year; and 
six months for savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm asking myself how businesses are going to pay their  
expenses and payrolls if their deposits are frozen?'' said 
Francisco Alarcon, president of the Chamber of Commerce in 
Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Other business leaders warned of a wave of inflation as the  
doubling of the price of gasoline filters through the economy. 
Inflation in Ecuador was already running at near 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some business leaders, however, called the measures tough but  
necessary to end Ecuador's tradition of populist politics and state 
intervention in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ecuador has to accept these measures as a dose of sacrifice  
demanded by the president,'' businessman Gustavo Pinto said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions already were upset with earlier austerity measures  
that have ended fuel subsidies, frozen wages and caused prices to 
soar for already impoverished Ecuadoreans.

<HEADLINE> TV Chef Ruggerio Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just months ago, celebrity chef David Ruggerio  
was really cooking. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his own cable TV show, a popular cookbook and a Manhattan  
restaurant that sported his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the restaurant is shuttered, the show is history and  
36-year-old Ruggerio is awaiting sentencing after admitting to 
wildly inflating restaurant credit card receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruggerio's guilty plea Thursday to a charge of second-degree  
attempted grand larceny avoids prison time but carries five years 
of probation and 500 hours of community service. He must also repay 
$140,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused Ruggerio and two restaurant employees of  
inflating the tips on 26 credit card payment slips last May and 
June before submitting them for payment to Paymentech Merchant 
Services Inc. of Dallas, his credit card processor. 
</P>
<P>
	Paymentech put money matching the credit card totals into the  
restaurant's bank account, and Ruggerio wrote checks against the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	The requests for payment carried gratuities ranging from $5,000  
to $30,000. The $30,000 tip was added to a $1,000 dining bill -- a 
3,000 percent tip, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of billing the exorbitant tips to customers,  
Paymentech notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is between him and Paymentech,'' said Charles Carnesi,  
Ruggerio's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's bookkeeper, Desmond Brusch, has also pleaded  
guilty to attempted grand larceny. A hearing for its maitre 
d'hotel, William Bart, is scheduled for March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruggerio, of Amity Harbor, N.Y., said as he left court that his  
restaurant is closed and he no longer has his TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ruggerio to Go'' premiered on the Food Network last October,  
and he operated a restaurant on 57th Street named David Ruggerio. 
In 1997, he was host of a PBS series on Little Italy and published 
a companion cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be sentenced May 6.

<HEADLINE> Violinist Yehudi Menuhin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who thrilled his first  
audience when he was 7 and went on to become one of the century's 
leading classical musicians, died today. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin, who also won recognition for his extensive writings and  
numerous benefit concerts promoting world peace, died of heart 
failure in a Berlin hospital, concert promoter Jutta Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin (pronounced men'-you-in) had been scheduled to conduct  
the Warsaw Symphony Orchestra in Berlin in a Tuesday night concert 
of Mendelssohn and Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending, but Adler said it was likely  
to be held in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yehudi Menuhin was a major figure in this century: an  
extraordinary musician, and a great humanitarian,'' the violinist 
Isaac Stern said today. ``His style of playing, particularly in his 
early years, was a stunning patrician elegance with a very natural 
musical line which fitted the style of whatever composition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born April 22, 1916, in New York of Russian Jewish parents,  
Menuhin astonished a San Francisco audience at the age of 7 with a 
debut violin performance that was by all accounts brilliant for a 
violinist at any age. 
</P>
<P>
	He often played chamber music with his two piano-playing  
sisters, Yaltah and particularly Hephzibah, who died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after his debut, he played at New York's Carnegie  
Hall with the New York Symphony Orchestra under the direction of 
the great German conductor Fritz Busch. By 13, he had already won 
accolades in Berlin, Paris and London. 
</P>
<P>
	In one famous incident, at his first concert in Berlin a few  
days short of his 13th birthday, Albert Einstein followed Menuhin 
backstage, hugged him and declared: ``Now I know there is a God in 
heaven!'' 
</P>
<P>
	So began a glittering international career in which he has  
performed with leading conductors and orchestras all over the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Fear that Menuhin's precocious brilliance would dissipate as he  
grew older proved groundless. He continued to play with a wonderful 
purity of tone and strong, clear line. 
</P>
<P>
	His brilliance as a performer and conductor was matched by his  
concern for humanity and, most impressively, his work as an 
educator. Generous with his talents and time, Menuhin founded a 
music school in his name in Britain and a foundation in Brussels, 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Christmas, Menuhin was promoting music teaching in  
British schools because he believed it could play a vital role in 
civilizing society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Art reflects the refinement of a civilization,'' he said.  
``Music goes both ways. You make yourself heard and listen to 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin lived in central London with his second wife, the  
ballerina Diana Gould, with whom he had two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	He received an honorary knighthood in 1965, but could not use  
the title until he became a British citizen in 1985. He became a 
lord in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin's first marriage, in 1938, was to Nola Nicholas, the  
19-year-old daughter of an Australian millionaire. They had one son 
and a daughter before they were divorced in Carson City, Nev., in 
1947 on grounds of ``simple incompatibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He married Miss Gould later that year, and she was credited with  
helping him through a period of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, Menuhin had come under criticism in America  
and Israel for his support for individual Germans. He defied acrid 
personal attacks to play for the Germans in Berlin in 1947, just 
two years after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He did so, he said, to further tolerance and ``the brotherhood  
of man'' -- expressions which to him were not empty phrases, but 
full of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	Elmar Weingarten, general manager at the Berlin Philharmonic,  
said Menuhin will always be remembered most in Berlin for having 
made that ``first contact with cultural Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Germany, and of course the Berlin Philharmonic, are very  
grateful for him having made this very meaningful gesture at that 
early time just after the war,'' Weingarten said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grievance was forgotten in Israel after his first few  
performances there in 1950, and he was accepted as a favorite son. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not, however, refrain from criticisms of the Israeli  
government. After the Six-Day War, he insisted on performing 
charity concerts in the Arab world and in 1975, he came out in 
favor of Israel's exclusion from UNESCO conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1950s saw Menuhin at the height of his powers. One of the  
foremost violinists of his age, he delighted audiences around the 
world with his smoothness of tone and the sheer physicality of his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	His classical works, including his beloved Beethoven Violin  
Concert, were received rapturously wherever he played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listening to his recordings, it is indescribable what he was  
able to communicate through his fiddle,'' the violinist Itzhak 
Perlman said today. ``Incredible. He was musical in a technical 
way, in a gutsy way, in an emotional way. It was fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Menuhin wasn't afraid to experiment with different  
repertoires, playing with artists from the Indian sitar master, 
Ravi Shankar, to the virtuoso jazz violinist, Stephane Grappelli. 
</P>
<P>
	More than once he introduced to the public works by famous  
composers. Bela Bartok, for instance, wrote ``Sonata for Violin'' 
especially for him. 
</P>
<P>
	His listening tastes, likewise, were not confined to the  
highbrow. He was an admirer of the early Beatles music, but was 
knocked off-balance by a Rolling Stones concert, which he left 
after a few numbers. ``I am no longer sure that music is a 
universal language,'' he said sadly afterward, complaining that the 
music was devoid of subtlety, variety and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
	Deeply spiritual, Menuhin was a follower of Indian mysticism,  
which influenced both the way he lived and the way he viewed death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later every birth must become a death,'' Menuhin  
wrote in a 1997 edition of his autobiography. His own wishes for 
the way this passage should be marked ``are based on the idea of a 
happy picnic on a river bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``My preference is for whatever will reunite me most quickly  
with the sources of life, accompanied by folk music and dance. ... 
Back to the earth, under a tree, or in a river, that is what I 
choose.''

<HEADLINE> N.M. Seeks Nuclear Shipments Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Mexico officials asked a federal judge  
Friday to block plans to begin shipping radioactive waste to an 
underground storage site in their state. The government agreed to 
keep the waste where it is while awaiting a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department is ready to make the first shipments of  
so-called ``transuranic'' radioactive waste to the Waste Isolation 
Pilot Plant in New Mexico as soon as possible, but state officials 
argued a state permit was required first. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and four environmental groups asked U.S. District  
Judge John Garrett Penn to issue an injunction for waste shipments 
to the WIPP, as the site is commonly called, pending the state 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can bring in the waste before the permit, we might as  
well not have a permitting process,'' Lindsay Lovejoy, the state's 
deputy attorney general, told the judge. He argued that by law the 
department needs the state permit to begin accepting shipments at 
WIPP near Carlsbad, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	To allow shipments now, he argued, would disrupt the permit  
process. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department attorneys maintained that the transport  
of 36 drums of waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, also 
in New Mexico, does not require the state permit because the 
material, although radioactive, does not contain any toxic 
chemicals covered by the state hazardous waste law. And they 
contend the site, having been approved by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, has been cleared for waste shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have agreed that no wastes will be shipped for at  
least 11 days and Penn indicated that he would rule on whether to 
issue an injunction by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson reiterated in  
testimony before a congressional committee on Friday that the 
administration remains opposed to construction of an interim 
storage site for high-level nuclear spent fuel in Nevada. Thousands 
of tons of the high-level waste remains at commercial nuclear power 
plants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends an interim storage site would reduce  
the incentive for permanent burial of this waste at Yucca Mountain 
in Nevada where scientists currently are trying to determine if the 
geology there is suitable for long-term burial. 
</P>
<P>
	High-level nuclear waste is largely spent reactor fuel, while  
the transuranic waste destined for WIPP is radioactive waste left 
over from federal weapons production such as clothing, tools, rags 
and other contaminated material. 
</P>
<P>
	While the requested injunction on waste transport to WIPP would  
apply to only the Los Alamos shipments, the court decision likely 
also would affect Energy Department plans to begin taking 
radioactive wastes from its facility in Idaho. Under an agreement 
with Idaho the department has promised to begin taking wastes from 
there by April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department attorney Wendy Blake argued that the WIPP  
site is ``legally opened and determined to be safe'' and there is 
no reason to block the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	To the contrary, she maintained, delaying the shipments would  
set back the government's broader cleanup efforts at some two dozen 
sites were radioactive waste currently is held. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn pressed Blake on what harm she could show if waste  
shipments were delayed until the end of the year when a state 
permit was likely to be approved, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake said there was no assurance the state would issue a permit  
that soon and that the wastes pose a risk to the public and 
environment because the current temporary storage sites ``do not 
offer the level of protection that WIPP does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Ward, an attorney representing four environmental groups  
that joined the state in seeking the injunction, countered that the 
Energy Department has never said the waste is not safe where it 
currently is being stored. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups joining New Mexico in seeking an injunction were the  
Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund, 
the Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety in Santa Fe, N.M., and 
the Southwest Research and Information Center in Albuquerque, N.M.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Attorney Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- An attorney for the Bishop Estate, Hawaii's  
richest and most influential charitable trust, apparently committed 
suicide a day after getting caught having sex in a hotel men's room 
with an estate trustee, police said. Then the trustee took an 
overdose of sleeping pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustee, Gerard Jervis, 50, was taken by ambulance Thursday  
to a hospital, where police said he was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 3, Rene Ojiri-Kitaoka, 39, was found dead in her car in  
the closed garage of her home. The car's engine was still running. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ojiri-Kitaoka and Jervis had been discovered having sex the  
night before in a men's room at the elegant Waikiki Prince Hotel, 
police said. Both are married. Hotel security took their pictures, 
and the two were escorted off the property and told not to come 
back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jervis' lawyer, Ronald Sakamoto, said Jervis was distressed over  
Ms. Ojiri-Kitaoka's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ojiri-Kitaoka was chief legal counsel for Kamehameha  
Investment Corp., a Bishop Estate subsidiary. Jervis is chairman of 
the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust, with an estimated worth near $10 billion, was created  
in 1884 by the will of a Hawaiian princess. Its assets are used to 
support Hawaii's Kamehameha Schools, which educate children of 
Hawaiian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees are under investigation by the state for alleged  
mismanagement and kickbacks.

<HEADLINE> Fox Won't Sponsor America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There won't be any Fox Sports Net logos  
plastered across ESPN's coverage of the America's Cup after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has agreed to let Young America, a syndicate of the  
New York Yacht Club, out of a sponsorship agreement signed in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract included that Fox Sports Net ads would appear on  
the sails and hulls of two of Young America's yachts during 
America's Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for the America's Cup, Fox Sports has  
generously agreed to release us from the contractual obligations 
that ESPN objected to,'' said John Marshall, president of Young 
America. ``Fox Sports Net agrees with us that our partnership has 
fueled a dispute that has become a distraction from our mission of 
winning the Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN had signed the final contract to air the event last week,  
and the syndicates had a 30-day window to agree to the terms, which 
stipulated that the telecast was clear of competing network logos. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN had said it would pull out of the event unless those terms  
were met. 
</P>
<P>
	It already had agreements from America's Cup 2000, the event  
organizer in New Zealand, and the America's Cup Challenge 
Association, which represents the competition's 15 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But final approval hinged on a unanimous decision by the 15  
challenge teams -- including Young America. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fox Sports Net didn't wait until the 30 days expired before  
ending the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we gave money to help build a winning U.S. entrant, we  
did it to bring the Cup back to America and it was a good marketing 
opportunity,'' said Fox Sports Net spokesman Vince Wladika. ``When 
it became apparent the televising network was willing to sacrifice 
the event along with America's chances of reclaiming the Cup, we 
felt it was our duty to put our own interest behind that of 
America's reclamation of the Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Raises Funds for Texas Rep. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEXARKANA, Texas (AP) -- President Clinton repaid Texas Rep. Max  
Sandlin's loyalty during his impeachment by coming here through 
inclement weather to help raise money to clear Sandlin's campaign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fights for you up there,'' Clinton told Sandlin supporters  
at a reception before a $1,000-a-plate dinner at a private home. 
The reception was moved to a nearby community center because the 
tent in which it was to be held was flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he came to support Sandlin, a Democrat first  
elected in 1996, out of more than sheer party loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this last year, ... he was one of the most serious,  
substantive, thoughtful and effective advocates, asking all the 
members of the Congress to read the Constitution, read the history 
and uphold their oath,'' Clinton said. ``For all those reasons, you 
should be very, very proud of your congressman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money raised Friday -- about $540,000 -- will go toward  
erasing the $738,025 Sandlin owes from his 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is looking forward to making similar appearances  
during his remaining two years in office. He spoke last week at a 
fund-raiser for Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., another staunch 
supporter during the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the idea that, if I can stay healthy, I can spend quite  
a few years trying to give back to this political system and to 
candidates and to people I believe in who have given me so much,'' 
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE>  Market Ends Lower; Dow Down 21.09 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average paused in its  
climb toward 10,000 Friday as technology stocks, the force that has 
propelled Wall Street higher in recent weeks, turned into an 
obstacle the stock market could not overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, the market's best-known indicator, came within 42  
points of 10,000 before giving up ground and closing at 9,876.35, 
down 21.09 on the day. However, the blue chips ended the week with 
a gain of 140.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were also lower Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Disappointing news from Microsoft and software maker Oracle set  
off broad selling in technology stocks. The technology-laden Nasdaq 
composite index fell 30.72 to 2,381.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle, down 8 5/16 to 28 9/16, said third-quarter sales fell  
short of analyst expectations. Microsoft slipped 1 1/4 to 160 3/16 
after announcing it would defer about $400 million in revenue from 
its third quarter to its fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The news from both companies came as an unpleasant surprise to a  
stock market that has surged higher this year largely on enthusiasm 
about high-tech and Internet companies. A hint of trouble in tech 
stocks is an impetus to take profits for many investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people think we need the tech stocks to push the market  
through 10,000,'' said Robert Freedman, executive vice president 
for John Hancock Funds in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he was optimistic.''We will get to 10,000... the  
market has shown a lot of resiliency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was enough bad news Friday to depress the market whether  
or not it was moving toward a new psychological barrier. 
Construction equipment maker Caterpillar, a component of the Dow 
average, warned that its first-quarter results would fall far short 
of expectations because of lower machine and engine sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar fell 6 3/16 to 44 11/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks, which rose earlier this week, generally reversed  
course Friday. Analysts questioned whether production cuts 
announced Friday by major oil-exporting countries will actually 
support higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we want to rely on oil stock to push the market  
higher,'' Freedman said. ``We need the old favorites, the big-caps 
and technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Goldman, market strategist with Weeden &AMP; Co. in  
Greenwich, Conn., said he expects the market to soon hit 10,000 but 
gains will be tougher to make because market leadership remains 
limited to several dozen big stocks. ``There's just not much 
breadth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's pullback, which followed a 124.60-point gain in the Dow  
Thursday, might have been expected as Wall Street approached a new 
milestone. As the blue chips reached 1,000-point marks in the past, 
stock traders often took profits, perhaps expecting that other 
investors might become nervous and bail out once the big number was 
actually reached. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest New York Stock Exchange decliners Friday was  
pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which fell 14 7/16 to 22 9/16 after 
warning that higher expansion expenses would curtail first-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The market fell despite another positive report on the U.S.  
economy. The Labor Department said wholesale prices fell a 
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in February, indicating that 
inflation remains under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10 to 9 margin on  
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.09 to 1,294.59.  
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 815.91 million shares, vs. 902.62 million in  
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.13 to 611.54, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.44 to 721.21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.70 to 398.38.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.09 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 5.31 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
down 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.22 percent.

<HEADLINE> Atom Laser Invented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A device that spews streams of atoms like a  
mythical ray gun has been developed by scientists who believe it 
one day could revolutionize computer chip making. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report published today in the journal Science, researchers  
say the new device, called an atom laser, was made possible by 
nudging super-cold atoms into a beam that could be fired in any 
direction, said William D. Phillips, leader of the federal team 
that made the device. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips compared the atom laser to the optical lasers now use  
in everything from light shows to eye surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``An optical laser works by sending out a very narrow beam of  
photons (light elements),'' Phillips said. ``An atom laser works 
like a light laser, except it is sending out atoms instead of 
photons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concept may hint at the legendary atomic ray gun of science  
fiction, but Phillips said there's no obvious weapons use. 
</P>
<P>
	However, just as when the optical laser was invented 40 years  
ago, the potential applications of an atom laser may not yet be 
apparent, said Phillips, a Nobel laureate who works for the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The more immediate use would be to create measuring and  
navigation devices that could be up to 10 times more precise than 
the optical laser systems now in use, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology first  
developed an atom laser in 1997, but the technique used there only 
permitted the atoms to spill downward, in response to gravity. 
Instead of a narrow beam, the atom laser was like a dripping blob. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' approach has the advantage of making a more narrow  
beam and of being able to point it in any direction, Wolfgang 
Ketterle, a leader of the MIT team, said in a statement in Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The atom lasers originate with a concept first conceived 70  
years ago by Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The famed physicist suggested that matter would reach a bizarre  
state if all the atomic motion, or natural vibration, in a cloud of 
atoms could be brought to a near standstill. The lack of motion 
causes the matter to become extremely cold -- almost to absolute 
zero -- and the atoms to link up in a lock-stepped single unit. It's 
rather like arranging a jumble of identical books into a neat, 
perfectly aligned stack. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Colorado researchers proved the theory correct by using  
magnetic fields to still a cloud of atoms and produce what is known 
now as a Bose-Einstein condensate. Researchers quickly realized 
that if the perfectly aligned atoms could be moved as a coherent 
unit, they would form an atom laser, just as perfectly aligned 
photons can form optical lasers. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' team created a Bose-Einstein condensate using sodium  
and then hit the frozen cloud with two pulsing light lasers of 
slightly different frequencies. The different frequencies caused 
the sodium atoms to escape from the condensate and move outward in 
a coherent beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said his group advanced the MIT work, which he called a  
``landmark experiment,'' by learning how to use the laser beams to 
accelerate atoms to a speed of about 2 1/2 inches a second. This is 
enough to make the beam multidirectional. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet unlike a light laser, the atom laser works only if it is  
shooting into a vacuum, said Phillips. If it is shot into the 
atmosphere, the atom laser would break up as the atoms in the beam 
encounter atoms in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The atom laser may one day be used to build extremely small  
computer chips, perhaps even constructing the devices one atom at a 
time, Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Child Support Jail Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It's not slave labor to lock up a parent  
who owes child support and refuses to take a job that would pay the 
debt, a federal appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday held a federal  
law that makes it a crime to ``willfully'' fail to support a child 
in another state is violated by a parent who rejects available 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress did not mean to let absentee parents evade their  
parental obligations by refusing to accept gainful employment,'' 
wrote Judge Alex Kozinski. The case involved an Alaska man who owed 
nearly $57,000 in support for three children in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Constitution forbids imprisonment for debt in most  
cases, prison can be used to enforce a parent's obligation to a 
child, ``a matter of vital importance to the community,'' Kozinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which involved the federal Child Support Recovery  
Act, is binding on federal courts in Alaska, Arizona, California, 
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Ballek quit a high-paying construction job after his  
divorce in 1988 and worked at a series of low-wage jobs that left 
him unable to pay support, the court said. He was sentenced to six 
months in jail and ordered to pay $56,916 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the evidence showed Ballek could have paid his  
debt if he had remained in construction work. When he reduced his 
income to a level that was inadequate to pay support, he broke the 
law regardless of whether he was motivated by spite, laziness or 
simply a desire to change careers, Kozinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A parent with minor children at home cannot quit work and  
become a hobo or go back to school as the fancy moves him,'' 
Kozinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Supreme Court reached the same conclusion last  
year in a case based on state child-support law.

<HEADLINE> Molester Gets 99 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A man who molested his two  
stepdaughters for years and claimed he was merely trying to give 
them sex education was sentenced to 99 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old maintenance man pleaded guilty to aggravated  
sexual assault of a child. The girls' mother, 39, is awaiting trial 
on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The stepfather admitted fondling the girls but said he and their  
mother thought they were teaching them to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned they were going to go out and get themselves  
hurt or get pregnant,'' he said at his sentencing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The older girl, now 15, testified that when she was 11, her  
stepfather and mother showed her sexually explicit pictures and had 
sex in front of her, and her stepfather fondled her. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger girl, now 14, said that the abuse started when she  
was 10 or 11 and continued at least once a week for three years.

<HEADLINE>  Belle Says He Won't Talk to Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Albert Belle ended his era of good  
feeling with the Baltimore media, saying Friday he will no longer 
speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle made the decision in the wake of coverage of his tirade in  
the Orioles clubhouse Thursday. The brooding slugger threw two bats 
-- shattering one of them -- his glove and batting helmet into his 
locker after a questionable third-strike call in the middle of an 
exhibition game against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in the clubhouse Friday for comment on the incident, Belle  
said, ``I'm done. I'm done with you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter then said, ``Forever?'' and Belle nodded. When asked  
why, Belle turned around and stared at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day he signed a $65 million, five-year contract with the  
Orioles in December, Belle smiled broadly and said: ``Whereas in 
the past I have cut the media off completely, I have made great 
strides to be accessible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle did just that in his first three months with the team. In  
January he attended a two-day, fan-oriented event in Baltimore, 
signing hundreds of autographs and speaking openly with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, shortly after reporting early to spring training last  
month, Belle surprised Baltimore reporters by walking into the 
cramped press room and answering all their questions. Two days 
later, he accommodated the national media with a lengthy news 
conference in the Baltimore dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	His uncharacteristic friendly nature was the subject of a  
feature article in Sports Illustrated, and for a while it seemed as 
if playing in fan-friendly Baltimore would produce a kinder, 
gentler Albert Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	But that no longer appears to be the case, at least as far as  
beat writers covering the Orioles are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	The press on Friday also received another backlash from the  
coverage of Belle's tirade -- the Orioles clubhouse was closed 
during their exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Team 
officials instituted the new policy, which is to remain in effect 
for the remainder of the spring, because Belle lost his cool during 
the game while a handful of reporters were in the clubhouse waiting 
to speak to starting pitcher Mike Mussina.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Anxiety Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- Effexor, a popular drug for depression, can  
now be marketed for anxiety as well, making it the first medication 
federal regulators have approved for both disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave manufacturer  
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories permission late Thursday to sell its 
extended-relief Effexor capsules for generalized anxiety disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most prevalent anxiety disorders, it affects an  
estimated 5 percent of people. Patients generally worry 
uncontrollably about everyday events, and many are irritable, 
restless and easily tired, have trouble sleeping and concentrating, 
or are bothered by muscle tension. 
</P>
<P>
	Effexor is taken in a single daily dose of 75, 150 or 225  
milligrams. The company said that in clinical trials of the 
different dosages, patients receiving the drug showed a greater 
reduction in anxiety than patients given a dummy pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst is a division of American Home Products, based in  
Madison, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Picture of Mars Crater Taken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Smile, Mars -- NASA is snapping your  
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Happy Face Crater'' was captured in a wide-angle image  
recorded by Mars Global Surveyor's camera on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The feature, which has a much more mirthful appearance than the  
better known but decidedly grim ``Face on Mars,'' is really the 
134-mile-wide Galle Crater on the eastern side of a basin called 
Argyre Planitia. 
</P>
<P>
	Features within the circular crater form the eyes and smiling  
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	In color, the picture has a bluish-white tone caused by frost,  
according to Malin Space Science Systems Inc., which operates 
Surveyor's camera from San Diego and released the images Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Happy Face'' was first noticed in images sent back to  
Earth during the Viking 1 mission to Mars in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Viking missions also returned images of the not-so-happy  
``Mars Face,'' a feature that looked like a skull with empty eye 
sockets. That spawned theories that the mile-long feature was the 
creation of some intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Mars Global Surveyor's modern camera took a look at the  
same area a year ago, the gape-mouth visage vanished as sharp 
detail revealed a natural feature, perhaps a butte or mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Global Surveyor, managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion  
Laboratory, was launched in 1996 and reached the planet in 
September 1997. It began its main science mission this week after a 
long delay in achieving the proper orbit for mapping.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Collectibles Nearly Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio's death was bound to create  
a seller's market for memorabilia of the Yankee Clipper. Finding 
people willing to part with their mementos has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Bookston, owner of Florida Rare Coins &AMP; Collectibles, had  
11 DiMaggio items in his New York store when the Hall of Famer died 
Monday. By late Thursday afternoon, there were three. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are interested in his stuff, but it's hard to  
get hold of it,'' said Bookston, whose small South Florida shop 
operates on the ground floor of the same office building where 
DiMaggio used to do his banking. 
</P>
<P>
	From DiMaggio's adopted hometown to the World Wide Web, interest  
in the baseball great's autograph has soared in the days following 
his death. As a result, the price for many items has just about 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten a lot of calls, but I don't have much,'' said  
Steve Ryan, president of North Shore Sports, a Chicago auction 
house that specializes in game-used memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said he had been thinking about putting together a special  
auction of DiMaggio items until he took stock of what was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just not enough material,'' said Ryan, who soon will  
conduct an auction featuring only Michael Jordan items in the wake 
of the NBA great's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Michael Jordan, we've got jerseys for 75 percent of the  
years he played in the NBA. Shoes, a large assortment of stuff. I 
thought this would be a great opportunity to jump on for DiMaggio. 
But I can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bookston showed off a display case featuring a black-and-white  
shot of DiMaggio kneeling in his Yankees uniform, accompanied by a 
signed baseball. An item like that sold for $300 two weeks ago, but 
now it's up to $550. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's been getting five to 10 inquiries a day about  
DiMaggio items this week. And before that? ``Maybe one or two a 
week. Maybe one a month,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Glaskin, whose Sports Collectors Warehouse sits a couple of  
punts from the Miami Dolphins' complex in Davie, said he had about 
a dozen DiMaggio items in stock when the Yankees great was 
hospitalized in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had four baseballs and five or six 8-by-10s on plaques,'' he  
said. ``I sold them all right in that time. Usually I only sold one 
or two a year. But no matter what I had at that time, I could have 
sold it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was one of the first to discover the power of the  
memorabilia market, but he was a finicky signer. He spurned many 
requests to sign bats and jerseys, often limiting his autographs to 
balls and photos. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a deal to sell limited edition bats six years ago,  
DiMaggio agreed not to sign any more bats for five years. That 
agreement expired shortly before he took ill. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the website for B&AMP;J Collectibles in Lakewood, N.J.,  
listed one of those limited edition bats for $3,495. It also had a 
DiMaggio autographed ball for $399 and an autographed 16x20 photo 
for $349. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe's prices always have been high to start with,'' B&AMP;J owner  
Bill Rodman said. ``He just brings a different kind of collector, 
more of a fan than a collector. It's what's going to keep interest 
in his stuff a lot longer.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: Premature Births Up for Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of single-born premature babies among  
black women decreased nearly 10 percent between 1989 to 1996 but 
increased 8 percent among whites, government researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Premature births dropped from 180.4 per 1,000 live births among  
black women in 1989 to 162.5 in 1996, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention said Thursday. The rate among whites climbed 
from 74.8 to 80.8. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the narrowing of the racial gap, black babies are still  
nearly twice as likely to be born premature than white ones, the 
CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said they were unable to explain the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it reflects things such as improved health status  
among African American women in general and possibly improved 
access to prenatal care,'' said Dr. Lucinda England, a CDC 
epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate dropped 3.6 percent among Hispanics, 2.8 percent among  
American Indians and Native Alaskans and 2.3 percent among Asians 
and Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures include medically induced births, but Ms. England  
said such births played only a small role in the increase among 
whites. Part of the reason for the increase among white women was a 
jump in the birthrate of infants born at 33 to 36 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the U.S. rate of premature single births inched up 0.3  
percent to 97.3 per 1,000 live births. There was a 19 percent jump 
among premature multiple births.

<HEADLINE> Min. Cheating Probe May Take 2 Mos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- University of Minnesota president Mark  
Yudof on Friday asked state senators for two months to investigate 
allegations of academic fraud in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof, speaking to the Senate Higher Education Budget Division,  
called the allegations ``very serious business,'' but said it was 
too early to elaborate on the investigation's course. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most critical thing is to do the right thing,'' Yudof  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university declared four players ineligible before  
Thursday's first-round NCAA tournament game against Gonzaga pending 
the outcome of an inquiry. With only eight healthy players left, 
the Golden Gophers lost 75-63. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we did the fair thing for the institution,'' Yudof  
said. ``But I didn't like that part of it. I didn't like that we 
went from newspaper allegations ... to suspending them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported the allegations Wednesday.  
A former university employee told the newspaper she had done course 
work for at least 20 basketball players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof told the committee, which controls higher education  
funding, that an outside law firm would be brought in to 
investigate. He said he did not know how much the inquiry would 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof expressed concern about an apparent shift in a statement  
by Jan Gangelhoff, the former office manager in the university's 
academic counseling unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press initially reported that Gangelhoff said coach  
Clem Haskins gave her $3,000 for unapproved tutoring. Gangelhoff 
then told WCCO-TV and the newspaper that the person who gave her 
the money said it came from Haskins. While Gangelhoff didn't know 
for sure whether the money came from the coach, she said she 
believed it did. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff did not return a message left Friday by The  
Associated Press at her workplace, a casino in Danbury, Wis. No 
residential number for Gangelhoff is listed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has denied paying Gangelhoff for tutoring and has denied  
knowledge of any academic cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	A second former university employee came forward Thursday with  
an allegation of academic impropriety at the school. Rick Marsden, 
a former academic counselor for the team, told the Pioneer Press 
that Haskins asked him in 1986 to do course work for a player. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden, who is gay, is suing the school for sexual harassment.  
The allegation is in an affidavit filed Jan. 6 in his lawsuit, 
though it does not identify the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was him,'' Marsden said. ``He asked me to write a paper for  
(the player) and I told him I absolutely would not. He swore at me; 
I swore at him and then I told my boss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Marsden said doctors determined he was mentally unable to work  
in men's athletics after he suffered what he called a mental 
breakdown last fall. His request to be transferred to another 
department was denied and he has been on unpaid leave since Dec. 
17.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Poised To Win Overall Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Poised to win the prestigious  
overall World Cup title, Lasse Kjus still cannot escape Hermann 
Maier's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a fourth place in Thursday's super-G that boosted Kjus  
to a 92-point lead over fellow Norwegian Kjetil Aamodt in the race 
for the overall title with only two races remaining, the spotlight 
just refused to land on the modest Norwegian. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead it was riveted on Maier, who finished a disappointing  
seventh in the super-G, an even he dominated all season and 
clinched the title last week on the strength of four wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Dejected after the race, Maier created a stir, announcing his  
intention to skip the final slalom race -- which would end any hope 
for the overall -- and compete only in the giant slalom, where he 
still has a chance to defend his crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier trails Kjus by 102 points and a race victory in the  
overall standings. A race victory is worth 100 points -- so Maier 
needs to race twice to have any chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Later pressured by team officials, Maier changed his mind and  
said he would race in both the slalom and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the World Championships in Vail, Colo., last month when  
Kjus became the first skier ever to win medals in all five 
disciplines, ``the Herminator'' still stole the show thanks to a 
highly publicized meeting with Terminator movie star Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	A beer-drinking, playful prankster, often guided by his  
emotions, Maier easily eclipses Kjus, a soft-spoken Norwegian who 
says little and always seems relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kjus does speak, it is often direct.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the only opponent who is a serious threat to me is  
Aamodt,'' Kjus said following Thursday's super-G, discounting 
Maier's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who has already won the season's downhill title and is  
trying to repeat his 1996 overall World Cup crown, could lock up 
the title as early as Saturday after the men's slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier's chances are almost nil. The powerful Austrian would have  
to win the giant slalom, do well in the slalom and hope the 
Norwegians bomb in both races. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the chances of that happening, a downcast Maier  
answered: ``With luck eluding me all season, that's doubtful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maier has only raced in two slaloms this season, both part of  
combined events, and did poorly in what is by far his worst event. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's scheduled women's super-G was canceled because of high  
winds and heavy snowfall on the course. The race will not be 
rescheduled and the season's standings will be the final standings, 
giving Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer the super-G season title to 
add to the coveted overall title she clinched last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A women's slalom is also set for tonight.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Share Prices Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices slipped Friday amid fears that  
the stock market's recent surge might have peaked. The dollar rose 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 13.28  
points, or 0.09 percent, to close the day's trading at 15,488.86 
points. On Thursday, the average closed up 22.14 points, or 0.14 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.90 yen, up 0.16 yen from late Thursday in  
Tokyo and above its late New York level of 119.33 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell in afternoon trading as caution spread among  
investors over the direction of the market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	While improved sentiment fueled a strong rally in Japanese  
shares earlier this week, players said the market's surge may be 
reaching its limit, and that there is still much concern over 
Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 124.60  
points to close Thursday at 9,897.44 -- a new high. The rally was 
buoyed by higher oil stocks and more evidence that the U.S. economy 
is growing at a non-inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 0.57 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,195.61 
points. The TOPIX closed up 8.71 points, or 0.73 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained strength after the  
government announced that Japan's real gross domestic product 
shrank a higher-than-expected 0.8 percent in the October-December 
quarter, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	That marks the fifth straight quarter -- the first time ever --  
that Japan's GDP contracted. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar was the Bank of Japan's generous  
increase in the surplus of banking reserves in the money market on 
Friday, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.14 yen, up from  
131.77 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.715 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.755 percent, 
pushing its price up to 100.67 yen from 100.35 yen.

<HEADLINE> Starr, McDougal in Uphill Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Juggling a criminal case and damaging  
revelations about his own office, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
is fighting an uphill battle: The prosecutor has put President 
Clinton's former business partner on trial, but it is Starr's own 
office that is getting much of the scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's trial  
here, Charles Bakaly, who became Starr's spokesman last spring 
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, abruptly resigned 
Thursday. His resignation came after Starr asked the Justice 
Department to investigate Bakaly in connection with a news leak -- a 
front-page story in The New York Times that said Starr had 
concluded the president could legally be indicted while still in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 31 article came amid a federal judge's probe -- pushed  
along by Clinton's legal team -- into possible leaks by Starr's 
office and a separate Justice Department inquiry into Starr's 
handling of the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly had gone on TV the day after the Times story appeared,  
declaring the ``information did not come from our office. ... We 
did not leak this information. ... We do not leak grand jury 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's referral to Justice came after his office conducted its  
own inquiry, according to a source familiar with the situation. The 
inquiry indicated Bakaly may have had some involvement in the leak, 
but he denied wrongdoing, said the source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., today called the situation ``really  
astounding,'' adding that it will play a part in the debate over 
whether and how to renew the independent counsel statute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's to Judge Starr's credit,'' commented Sen. Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah. ``I think it shows that he's going to do what's 
right, regardless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly has hired his own lawyer, former FBI general counsel  
Howard Shapiro, who says he is confident Bakaly will be found to 
have violated no statute, regulation or court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said Thursday he accepted Bakaly's resignation with  
``regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, Starr's prosecutors have laid out evidence  
that links a $27,600 Whitewater loan in Clinton's name to a 
fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal. The link comes through a 
series of financial transactions involving the savings and loan 
Mrs. McDougal owned with her husband, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	On trial for refusing to answer questions of Starr's office on  
whether Clinton knew about the transactions, Mrs. McDougal is 
trying to shift attention to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, sought to show that Starr had rushed  
to the aid of her ex-husband while she was allowed to ``languish'' 
in jail. Jim McDougal cooperated with Starr's probe. Mrs. McDougal 
didn't. Now she's on trial for criminal contempt and obstructing 
Starr's investigation of the 1980s Whitewater land venture formed 
by the McDougals, Clinton and his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering from more than a decade of bad health, Jim McDougal  
died last year, but it was his information that led to Mrs. 
McDougal being put on trial. Jim McDougal tipped off Starr to the 
Clinton loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Hickman Ewing said the more Geragos mentions  
prosecutors, the more likely it is Ewing will load up the witness 
list with his own prosecutors to rebut Geragos' accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	When the trial resumes Monday, former prosecutor Amy St. Eve  
will testify, Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said Starr's office had passed up numerous opportunities  
to question Mrs. Clinton and former Whitewater real estate agent 
Chris Wade about the financial dealings tying the Clinton loan to 
the $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	And Geragos tried to suggest that Starr was relying on perjured  
testimony from Jim McDougal, referring to McDougal's testimonial 
``flip-flop'' in which he denied under oath at his own trial that 
Clinton attended a meeting where the $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 
was discussed. Convicted of 18 felonies, McDougal later told 
Starr's investigators that Clinton had arrived as the meeting was 
breaking up and had asked about the $300,000 loan.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Women's Basketball Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coach Geno Auriemma was not surprised -- and he should not have  
been -- by top-seeded Connecticut's blowout Friday of St. Francis, 
Pa., in the opening round of the NCAA Mideast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, playing at home in Storrs, Conn., were simply too  
fast, too strong and too tall for the Red Flash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talent and difference was really obvious, and we wanted to  
take advantage of that,'' Auriemma said after a 97-46 victory. 
``And that's what we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Flash, the Northeast Conference champs, are 0-4 in the  
NCAA tourney. The Huskies are making their 11th straight appearance 
in the postseason and won the national title in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (28-4) dominated from the opening tip with a  
smothering pressure defense and a speedy transition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Svetlana Abrosimova's free throw and a layup by freshman Asjha  
Jones gave the Huskies a 3-0 lead in the first minute. Junior Jess 
Zinoble converted a three-point play at the 18:45 mark to tie the 
game, the closest the 16th-seeded Red Flash would get. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut then went on a 19-2 run, fueled by 10 points from  
Shea Ralph and five from Abrosimova. The Huskies shot 63 percent 
from the field and held St. Francis (18-12) to 17 percent en route 
to a 59-20 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really came out really strong and jumped down their  
throats,'' said Amy Duran. ``That's key for us, to put them back on 
their heels. If we can keep doing that we'll be fine,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paige Sauer had 13 points and 11 rebound in a dozen minutes. At  
6-foot-5 five, she towered over the smaller St. Francis squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrosimova, Ralph and Duran had 13 points each for Connecticut.  
The Huskies outscored the Red Flash 52-20 inside and had 31 points 
off St. Francis' turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinoble led St. Francis, outrebounded 57-24, with 22 points.

<HEADLINE> Marbury Comes Closer to Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Since learning his moves on the asphalt  
courts of Brooklyn, Stephon Marbury has dreamed of playing in New 
York as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	He's happy to settle for a few miles outside Manhattan.  
</P>
<P>
	Marbury joined the New Jersey Nets Friday, eager to reach his  
lofty basketball goals just outside the city called the ``Mecca of 
Basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the Nets' game against Philadelphia -- about a dozen  
exits south on the New Jersey Turnpike -- Marbury was introduced at 
a news conference with his mother and father seated in the front 
row. A day after being traded by the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 
nine-player deal, Marbury signed a $70.9 million, six-year contract 
with the Nets and proclaimed his lifelong dreams fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not quite. Winning would be nice. From the New York  
playgrounds to the NBA, that's the true way to measure men of 
Marbury's talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prayed for this day to come since I was a child,'' Marbury  
said. ``For all the things that we've wanted to achieve in life, 
it's all coming true. It's a dream. For it to happen here, it's 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement that Marbury's arrival sent shooting through the  
Nets organization had to be tempered immediately. Marbury couldn't 
play Friday night against the Sixers because Sam Cassell -- traded 
to the Bucks in the deal -- didn't report to Milwaukee, Nets general 
manager John Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey dressed only eight players for the game and almost  
signed assistant coach Jack Haley to a 10-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Marbury couldn't play in the Nets' 100-93 loss to the  
Sixers, he got in his new teammates' faces in the locker room after 
the game -- with words of encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win,'' Marbury said. ``When you win, you do what it  
takes. They don't look at it like I'm jumping down their throat. 
They know I just want to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury's agent, David Falk, predicted that the Nets would soon  
agree to terms with Marbury's new backcourt mate, Kerry Kittles. 
Marbury was adamant that New Jersey had to keep Kittles if he was 
going to play for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it can be done (Saturday) we'll certainly try it,'' Falk  
said. ``If it can't, then we'll try to do it in July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Nets, bringing Marbury home was perhaps the only way  
they could salvage a difficult season in which they had the worst 
record in the Eastern Conference. It saved coach John Calipari's 
job for now, but perhaps that will last only if he wins with the 
true point guard he's always coveted. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, the prodigal son of a basketball family from New York's  
Coney Island, always has wanted to play for the Knicks. New York 
reportedly made a last-minute offer to Minnesota, but it wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey also got Chris Carr and Bill Curley from the  
Timberwolves and Elliot Perry from Milwaukee in the blockbuster 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	It brings Marbury back home; if not to the heart of the city  
where he grew up, only a short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people ask me, `What about New York?' '' Marbury  
said. ``Well, God does everything for a reason. I accept where I'm 
going, and I thank the New Jersey Nets for giving me the 
opportunity to come here and perform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury's mother, Mabel, wasn't crazy about the idea of her son  
coming home. Too many distractions, she said. Too much chaos. 
Marbury had escaped all that, hadn't he? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the big city, and a lot of things are happening in New  
York,'' she said. ``Minnesota is so laid back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Donald Marbury, didn't share that opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	``His name is Marbury,'' he said. ``What else can I say? What  
distractions? There's no more distraction that winning the New York 
City championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of lengthy phone conversations with his family,  
Marbury decided that he and Falk would pursue a trade -- preferably 
to a New York area team. He wasn't worried about following another 
great New York point guard, Kenny Anderson, who never lived up to 
expectations with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been walking around with that since I was a kid, with the  
pressure of winning a city championship all my life,'' Marbury 
said. ``So I had the weight of New York City on my shoulders all 
along. I don't think this is going to be any different.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Shares Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft stock slipped Friday after the company  
said it would defer about $400 million in revenue because of a 
delay in introducing Office 2000, the latest version of its suite 
of business software. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of a pending corporate reorganization helped keep the  
shares actively switching between positive and negative territory 
throughout the trading session. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it still expects to meet Wall Street's  
third-quarter earnings estimate of 65 cents a share, due to 
improved investment income. The company expects sales of about $4.2 
billion, compared with earlier analysts' estimates of $4.6 billion 
or higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the deferred revenue, equal to about 8 cents a share in  
net income, will be recognized in the fourth quarter when Office 
2000 is shipped, chief financial officer Greg Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	Office 2000, a revamped version of Office 97 package of  
word-processing, spreadsheet and database software, was originally 
expected to be on store shelves by the end of March, when the third 
quarter ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's stock activity was also influenced by a new report that  
Microsoft plans to announce as soon as next week a restructuring 
into four major groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported the software giant will  
rejigger its structure into groups for corporate enterprise, aimed 
at selling products to corporate chief information officers; 
applications, targeted at ``knowledge workers'' including analysts, 
administrators, writers and researchers; software programmers; and 
consumers, for online and Internet customers who use their 
computers for entertainment and personal applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported a similar plan last month.  
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman wouldn't offer many details.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, Microsoft is planning to make some adjustments to the  
internal structure, but we're not confirming any dates or 
details,'' spokesman Dan Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's reorganization plan doesn't appear to be  
specifically related to its ongoing antitrust case in Washington, 
D.C. But Scott McAdams, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen Inc. in 
Seattle, said it may help the company pre-empt the effects of a 
negative court verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me to see them do it,'' he said. ``If you  
think the stars are lining up to force you to do something some 
day, better to be pro-active than be ordered to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reorganizations, he noted, are not rare at Microsoft, a company  
that has grown explosively in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every couple of years they turn the battleship around,'' he  
said. ``They've mostly all worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports indicate the reorganization was being driven by the  
company's president, Steve Ballmer, second in command to founder 
and Chairman Bill Gates. Microsoft would use the reorganization to 
focus the company's efforts on customers rather than around 
particular product lines and engineering efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer has been overseeing the Interactive Media Group, which  
includes the online Microsoft Network and may be renamed the 
consumer division. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will temporarily divide responsibilities for the  
consumer unit between Jon DeVaan, who has overseen development of 
Microsoft Office, the suite of software applications that includes 
Word and Excel; and Brad Chase, a marketing manager who 
masterminded the launch of Windows 95 and Internet Explorer, The 
Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The division aimed at software developers will reportedly be  
headed by Paul Maritz, who has overseen nearly all software 
development at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In settling on the reorganization plan, people familiar with the  
matter told The Journal that Ballmer rejected more far-reaching 
initiatives, including a proposal to spin off MSN into a separate 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reportedly has courted but failed to land several  
top outside media executives to head MSN.

<HEADLINE> IOC Set for `Painful' Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- International Olympic Committee president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch is warning members that they need to make 
``structural changes'' to restore the organization's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing next week's IOC meeting as the most important of his  
presidency, Samaranch said in a letter sent to all members that 
``painful'' decisions are needed to clean up after the Olympic 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called an extraordinary general assembly next  
Wednesday and Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to deal with the 
worst crisis in the IOC's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The session will vote on the expulsions of at least five members  
in connection with the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake 
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members have already resigned.  
</P>
<P>
	The assembly will also vote on a series of reform measures,  
including an overhaul of the bidding and site-selection process for 
the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Samaranch's letter, dated March 9, was obtained by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must confess that I consider the coming extraordinary  
session one of the most important in our history, and the most 
important of my presidency,'' said Samaranch, who has been in power 
since 1980. ``Our duty requires that we take concrete decisions, in 
some cases painful ones, for the whole world will be observing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and Samaranch have come under severe attack from outside  
critics following revelations of cash payments and other improper 
inducements received by IOC members from Salt Lake and other bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must defend our organization, and the Olympic Games,  
through our future actions,'' Samaranch said. ``We must also defend 
the honor and integrity of our members ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the support of international federations and national  
Olympic committees, Samaranch said, ``I am convinced that ... we 
will succeed in bringing about the structural changes that are 
necessary for us to be able to move toward the third millennium 
with confidence and determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am counting on you all to contribute ... to defining a new  
policy for the IOC, in a spirit of renewed unity,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also told members the conclusion of the IOC's  
investigation into the Salt Lake scandal has been delayed and won't 
go before the executive board until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the best efforts and sacrifices of the commission  
members, the report has not yet been finalized,'' he said. ``It 
appears that it will take longer to conclude than was originally 
planned. As soon as it is complete, it will be submitted to the 
executive board for its meeting on 15th March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members resigned or were ousted in the first phase of the  
inquiry that concluded in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the IOC inquiry panel has been looking into 19 other  
cases -- three holdovers from the first phase, plus 16 additional 
names cited in a Salt Lake ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one more member is expected to be expelled in the  
latest phase, while the bulk of the others are expected to be 
exonerated or receive warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, an IOC member since 1987,  
will be ousted under the recommendation of the six-man panel, 
Olympic sources familiar with the case have told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork was named in a Utah ethics report last month that said  
his wife, Julia, borrowed $30,000 from Salt Lake City bid chief Tom 
Welch ``to help a friend in a serious situation.'' The report said 
the money, withdrawn by Welch from his children's' trust fund, was 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those still under investigation from the first phase is  
South Korean executive board member Kim Un-yong, the highest 
ranking IOC delegate implicated so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim faces allegations that he used Olympic connections to help  
secure lucrative jobs for his children in broadcasting and 
entertainment. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--SLOC leader Mitt Romney announced a hiring freeze, reductions  
in staff travel and other cuts to save $14 million. He also 
highlighted $84 million worth of expenses -- including extra 
furniture, decorations, and a planned memorial plaza -- that are not 
crucial to the games and should be contingent on revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	--A former organizer at the heart of the Salt Lake Olympic  
bribery scandal says the senior U.S. official of the games knew 
about the vote-buying scheme. Dave Johnson, who was senior vice 
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and long involved 
in the city's Olympic campaign, told The New York Times that he 
discussed ``everything'' about the program with IOC member Anita 
DeFrantz. DeFrantz, now an IOC vice president, denied Johnson's 
statements.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Won't Block AOL-Netscape Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has cleared the way for  
America Online's proposed $4.3 billion merger with Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, the department's antitrust division said  
it also would not challenge an alliance proposed between AOL and 
Sun Microsystems, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The division has decided that it will not challenge the  
transactions, having concluded that neither the merger nor the 
alliance violate the antitrust laws,'' the government said in the 
statement announcing it had closed its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of Netscape by AOL, the world's largest online  
service provider, would create a single Internet company with 
remarkable reach across the high-tech world -- and challenge 
Microsoft Corp.'s dominance in key areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Whitney, an AOL spokesman, said the company was pleased with  
Justice's announcement and was looking forward to the vote by 
Netscape shareholders. The proposed merger faces no other 
regulatory hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance could pose dramatic new competition for Microsoft,  
which has been sued by the federal government for alleged antitrust 
violations. That trial, which began in October in U.S. District 
court, is on a month-long recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's ``Netcenter'' Web site is among the four most popular  
on the Internet with more than 20 million visitors each month. The 
AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo! sites are the other three most popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, AOL would acquire Netscape's pioneering  
Navigator browser software, which was introduced in 1994 and helped 
popularize the Internet. The software is now used by millions of 
people to view information on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Internet software competes directly against  
Netscape's, and its Microsoft Network online service is a rival to 
AOL although it has been far less successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Many industry observers believe the planned Netscape-AOL deal  
might hurt the Justice Department's pending antitrust case against 
Microsoft, which has argued that the deal proves the high-tech 
industry is fast-changing and highly competitive.

<HEADLINE> 3 Convicted in Youngstown Mob Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Three men who allegedly arranged the shootings  
of two prosecutors were convicted today of working for the mafia in 
Youngstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Altshuler, 68; Lavance Turnage, 26; and Jeffrey Riddle,  
38, were the latest to be convicted in an investigation that also 
brought a deal with mob leader Lenine Strollo and indictments 
against public officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Altshuler, Turnage and Riddle, all of Youngstown, were sentenced  
to life in prison with no parole on the convictions of 
racketeering, conspiracy to racketeering and illegal gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo, 68, pleaded guilty last month to running the operation  
in eastern Ohio, plotting to kill a rival gang leader, running a 
numbers game and bribing officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed his three employees arranged the 1996  
killing of Ernie Biondillo -- Strollo's rival -- and the woundings of 
Mahoning County Prosecutor Paul Gains days before he took office 
and former Prosecutor Gary Van Brocklin. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo testified in the U.S. District Court trial that  
Altshuler arranged the Biondillo killing. Turnage and Riddle were 
convicted of carrying out the acts of violence to further mob 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Van Brocklin resigned as an anti-crime task force  
prosecutor after trial testimony linked him to Strollo. Van 
Brocklin, who testified for the prosecution, admitted on 
cross-examination that he was once Strollo's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo testified that he arranged to have Van Brocklin shot in  
1996 when he refused to delay Turnage's trial on robbery and 
felonious assault charges. The shooting resulted in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo also testified that he had Gains shot in late 1996 for  
refusing to cooperate with the mob. He hoped to replace Gains with 
attorney Michael Rich who has since pleaded guilty to accepting mob 
bribes in exchange for rigging civil service tests so Strollo could 
control police hiring in a town bordering Youngstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Altshuler, a friend of Strollo's for 30 years, shock his head  
slightly after the verdicts were read. Riddle belched and looked 
down at his fingernails as Judge Kathleen O'Malley asked the jurors 
their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys had urged jurors not to believe Strollo and  
other witnesses who cut deals with prosecutors for their testimony 
in return for lighter sentences. Strollo could receive as few as 12 
years instead of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury deliberations began Wednesday. The verdicts were announced  
about 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdicts bring to a resolution allegations that first  
surfaced in December 1997 when Strollo and dozens of others -- 
including his associates and public officials -- were indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one chapter in an ongoing book, I guess,'' said Assistant  
U.S. Attorney Craig Morford. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this can be a new beginning for the Mahoning Valley,  
which has seen dozens of convictions on mob-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnage's attorney, John Ricotta, said he was disappointed but  
not surprised at the verdict given the fact Strollo had testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Youngstown for decades has fought a reputation as a haven for  
organized crime and once was nicknamed ``Crime Town U.S.A.'' Mafia 
families from Cleveland and Pittsburgh have engaged in a long fight 
for control of the area, which is between those two cities.

</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins, a staunch  
defender of the homeless and refugees in rulings that challenged 
national policy, died Thursday of colon cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he created ``safe zones'' for the area's homeless to  
stay without threat of police arrest, ruling that Miami had 
violated the Constitution by seizing and destroying the meager 
belongings of homeless people while chasing them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision inspired community leaders to establish what is now  
a nationally recognized system to help the homeless -- shelter, job 
training, counseling and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins' rulings on behalf of Haitian and Cuban refugees vexed  
the Bush and the Clinton administrations' efforts to repatriate 
thousands of refugees from the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba. Both decisions were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins was appointed a federal judge in 1966 by President  
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	He became chief judge in 1977 and took senior status in 1983,  
but continued a heavy caseload. He also sat on panels of the 11th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Rev. Walter Allen ``Al'' Dealey Jr., a retired  
newspaper executive and Presbyterian minister, died Tuesday of 
complications from a stroke. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealey was a grandson of Dallas Morning News founder George  
Bannerman Dealey and son of Walter Dealey Sr., a business executive 
at the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Dealey was an executive at the newspaper before  
enrolling in the Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working full time at the newspaper in June 1937. Four  
years later, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve. After retiring 
from active duty with the rank of major, Dealey returned to the 
newspaper and assumed a management position. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1956, Dealey returned to Dallas to organize the  
Churchill Way Presbyterian Church, where he was the first pastor. 
In 1962, he resigned his pulpit to open a full-time office for 
pastoral counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealey is survived by wife Willene Hinchliffe Dealey, two sons,  
four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Blues singer Lowell Fulson,  
instrumental in the early careers of Ray Charles and B.B. King and 
whose 1954 hit ``Reconsider Baby'' was recorded by Elvis Presley, 
died Sunday of kidney disease, diabetes and congestive heart 
failure. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulson was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1993, and his  
``Them Update Blues'' was nominated for a 1995 Grammy. Among his 
other hits were ``Tramp,'' ``Blues Shadows Falling'' and ``Lonesome 
Christmas'' in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	His first success, ``Reconsider Baby,'' came immediately after  
he signed his first record contract. He helped then-newcomers 
Charles and King in the 1950s.

	MONTREAL (AP) -- Camille Laurin, the political architect of the  
controversial language law promoting the use of French in Quebec, 
died Thursday of cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurin entered the legislature in 1970 with a handful of other  
members of the separatist Parti Quebecois members. He was named to 
the Cabinet when Rene Levesque took power in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	As minister of cultural development, he was the driving force  
behind Law 101, the Charter of the French Language, which was 
adopted in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The law restricts the use of English. Among other things, it  
requires immigrants to attend French schools and large companies to 
operate in French.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Harry Ford, a leading poetry editor, died of a  
heart attack March 5. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was the senior poetry editor at Alfred A. Knopf publishing  
house, and had edited the work of poets including Wallace Stevens, 
Langston Hughes, Richard Wilbur, Howard Moss and Mark Strand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford joined Knopf in 1947 as an assistant production manager and  
design director, and worked with poets on the side. He did not turn 
fully to poetry until after he joined Atheneum, a publishing house 
created by Alfred Knopf Jr., in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	His devotion to poetry and poets earned him several honors  
including the PEN American Center's eighth biennial Publisher 
Citation, a reading in his honor sponsored by the Academy of 
American Poets and the first National Poetry Series Editor's Award 
in 1992

newsroom lawyer for The Boston Globe, died Wednesday at his home in 
Naples, Fla. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Micciche worked for the Everett News Gazette, Stars and Stripes  
and the Portsmouth (N.H.) Herald before joining the Globe in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	While covering the Massachusetts Legislature from 1956 to 1969,  
he studied law at Suffolk Law School. He graduated in 1968 and 
passed the bar examination that year. 
</P>
<P>
	As in-house newsroom counsel, he was consulted on the legal  
aspects of breaking stories by reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his newspaper career in Everett as a copy boy when he  
was 12. He later became a reporter for the Portsmouth Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	After covering the state Legislature, Micciche wrote about  
politics for the Globe's editorial page for a year, and then went 
to the paper's Washington bureau. He covered Congress, the Supreme 
Court and the White House during Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	Micciche is survived by his wife Theresa, a son, two daughters  
and two grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lee Philips, a movie actor and television  
director, died March 3 from complications of Parkinson's disease. 
He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips had roles in ``Marty,'' the 1957 version of ``12 Angry  
Men,'' ``The Hunters'' and ``Middle of the Night,'' among other 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed the 1971 television series ``The Man and the City,''  
starring Anthony Quinn and Mike Farrell. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lott Teases Gore on Internet Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by Vice President Al Gore's claim  
that he created the Internet, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott 
made a surprising revelation of his own Friday, taking credit for 
inventing the paper clip. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing off the latest salvo in a game of political tit-for-tat  
begun a day earlier, Lott issued a tongue-in-cheek news release 
saying he ``created'' the paper clip. 
</P>
<P>
	``During my service in the United States Congress, I took the  
initiative in creating the paper clip,'' said Lott, R-Miss., 
echoing nearly word for word Gore's pronouncement about creating 
the Internet. ``Paper clips bind us together as a nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also provided some ``early designs'' for the paper clip,  
including a straight line and a V-shaped model. And the news 
release stated: ``Lott refused to answer questions about whether or 
not he was also the Fifth Beatle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been having a field day with the vice  
president's claim, made Tuesday during a CNN interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to cite accomplishments that separate him from another  
Democratic presidential hopeful, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New 
Jersey, Gore said: ``During my service in the United States 
Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet, originally called ARPANET, dates to 1969, when the  
Defense Department began funding the project. Gore, then 21, was 
still eight years away from joining Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides say their boss has a rightful claim, having promoted  
the Internet and government funding for the project while in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	They're returning Republican fire with some humor of their own.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's no surprise that Senator Lott and his fellow Republicans  
are taking credit for an invention that was created a long time 
ago,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``After all, they're the 
party whose ideas will take us back to the Dark Ages.''

<HEADLINE> Bruno Calls Lewis Not Truly British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former WBC world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno  
says London-born Lennox Lewis will never be accepted as British, 
even if he beats Evander Holyfield in Saturday night's fight in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox has got to understand that he went to Canada and won a  
gold medal for Canada,'' Bruno was quoted as saying in Friday's 
Daily Mail newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``British people are always going to think: `Why did he do  
that?'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno, who fought and lost against Lewis in 1993 as a contender  
for the WBC title, said Lewis will never win the hearts of the 
British public despite promoting himself as a British champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 33, moved to Toronto when he was 12 and won a boxing gold  
medal for Canada at the 1988 Soeul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno said Lewis' double allegiance ``leaves a little bit of a  
stigma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a gold medal for Canada...You can't go to  
another country and say: ``Oh I'm flying the flag for the British 
people, but I used to fly the flag for Canada,'' Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bruno said he had respect for Lewis and a win over  
Holyfield would give his former rival ``undeniable boxing 
credibility.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Bank Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breaking a daylong stalemate over consumer  
privacy, the House Banking Committee overwhelmingly approved 
legislation to lift Depression-era barriers between banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel voted 51-8 Thursday to adopt the complex measure and  
send it to the full House. The Clinton administration has expressed 
strong support for the bipartisan House bill but has threatened to 
veto financial overhaul legislation pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have an excellent bill that will be signed into  
law,'' Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the committee's senior 
Democrat, said after the evening vote. ``We have a bill that brings 
us into the 21st century (and) protects and promotes consumer 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress tries again to overhaul the financial services laws  
and allow the three industries to get more deeply into each other's 
businesses, fears have arisen about how customer information will 
be shared among affiliates of the big new companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Banking Committee spent three days laboring on a draft of  
the bill. As the drafting proceeded Thursday, several lawmakers and 
aides worked feverishly behind the scenes on a consumer privacy 
measure to be attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the privacy measures proposed, authored by Reps. Jay  
Inslee, D-Wash., and Robert Weygand, D-R.I., would have required 
new financial conglomerates to give consumers the right to opt out 
of arrangements for sharing all of their personal data with 
affiliated companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an ``opt-out'' is considered less stringent than an  
``opt-in,'' which requires a consumer's express written consent 
before personal data can be used by a financial institution or 
disclosed to others. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers eventually voted, 52-6, to adopt a milder  
proposal by committee Chairman James Leach, R-Iowa. It would 
restrict the sharing of customers' health information among 
affiliated companies but would allow their transaction data, such 
as checking account history, to be shared even if they made an 
opt-out request. Under current law, opt-out requests apply to a 
consumer's credit history but not to his or her transaction data. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal banking regulators have pointed to consumers' growing  
fears about companies' enhanced ability to track, use and sell 
personal financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the legislation would create serious privacy risks for Americans as 
banks, brokerages and insurers compiled profiles of customers' 
buying habits, hobbies -- even health information. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible scenario: A woman's husband has died, and she has  
received a check from his life insurance policy. The insurance 
company tips off an affiliated securities firm, and she starts 
getting phone calls from a broker trying to sell her the latest hot 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Or: A bank customer applies for a loan. The loan officer checks  
with the bank's affiliated health insurance company and discovers 
that the customer has cancer. The loan is denied for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists for the banking, securities and insurance industries  
indicated earlier Thursday that adoption of Inslee's tougher 
privacy measure could kill their support for the overall 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, one of the key reasons the industries have been pushing  
financial overhaul legislation is that it would open numerous 
opportunities for them to market their services by using shared 
customer data. 
</P>
<P>
	A current example is the big effort by financial giant Citigroup  
to sell Citibank customers the investments and insurance offered by 
the bank's merger partner, Travelers Group. Over the next six 
months, New York-based Citibank plans to train and license up to 
3,000 of its branch employees in financial analysis and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup, created by one of the biggest mergers in U.S.  
corporate history, got permission from the Federal Reserve to 
operate for several years, so the company didn't have to wait for 
enactment of financial overhaul legislation before it combined.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The King wasn't exactly treated like royalty by  
Britain's Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Friday that Elvis Presley's estate cannot stop a  
London businessman who sells Elvis memorabilia at a store called 
Elvisly Yours. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was the latest round in the 17-year fight between the  
Presley estate and Sid Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Justice Simon Brown said there should be no ``assumption  
that only a celebrity or his successors may ever market -- or 
license the marketing of -- his own character.'' 
</P>
<P>

of our history, part of our culture,'' Shaw said.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Saves Twin Infants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A firefighter's daring rescue saved twin infants  
from an apartment building fire that injured 35 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze that broke out at 12:47 p.m. Thursday started in a  
restaurant on the ground floor and reached the top of the 11-story 
building within 20 minutes, said fire department spokesman George 
Semidey. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters used aerial ladders to rescue several people in the  
building. Among them was Linda Kalodner, who first passed her 
6-month-old twins to fireman Matt Barnes from her ninth-floor 
apartment window, 100 feet above the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes had to tie himself to a ladder and reach over a 4- or  
5-foot gap to grab the children as Ms. Kalodner dangled them, one 
at a time, out the window. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire injured 29 civilians and six firefighters, officials  
said. Most of the injuries were minor, including smoke inhalation 
and burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were able to keep the fire from spreading to  
neighboring buildings on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Its cause was 
under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Marks Day Ship Finally Sank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- The sinking of the ship that ran aground  
off the Oregon coast has been declared ``Two-thirds of the New 
Carissa at the Bottom of the Ocean Day.'' Now attention turns to 
the other third, the stern, mired in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing more stubborn and uncooperative than Mother  
Nature was the New Carissa herself,'' Gov. John Kitzhaber wrote in 
his declaration Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We burned her, we burned her again, then we broke her in half,  
dragged her out to sea, then dragged her through a hurricane, but 
to everyone's displeasure, she wound up back on Oregon's coast,'' 
he said in the declaration, released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The saga that went on for more than a month finally came to a  
partial end Thursday afternoon, but the 420-foot bow of the New 
Carissa did not go quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	In what looked like a sea battle 300 miles out in the Pacific,  
Navy demolitions experts first blew holes in the ship with 
explosives, then a destroyer riddled the wreck with 70 artillery 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	When the stubborn ship insisted on staying afloat, they brought  
in a nuclear submarine that fired a torpedo, which provided the 
knockout blast. The ship gurgled back-end first below the surface 
and now sits two miles down, where its 130,000 gallons of fuel oil 
onboard can do no more harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The 639-foot New Carissa first washed ashore at Coos Bay on Feb.  
4 and began leaking oil four days later. Efforts to burn the 
400,000 gallons of fuel oil on board succeeded in burning only half 
of it away. The ship split in two and spilled 70,000 gallons on 
southern Oregon's pristine beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	When salvage crews tried to tow it out to sea last week, it  
broke away from the tow line and washed ashore, spilling more oil 
on that beach. It was hauled out to sea Monday for what proved to 
be the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard, salvage officials and others were to meet  
Friday to look into how to remove the 220-foot stern still mired in 
the sand.

<HEADLINE> George Jones Develops Pneumonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer George Jones has  
developed pneumonia and has been placed back on a ventilator as he 
recuperates from a car crash, his record company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained in critical but stable condition at Vanderbilt  
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Jones has been placed back on a ventilator to help  
him breathe and to save his strength. He is responding to 
medication and is healing slowly, according to a statement from 
Asylum Records. 
</P>
<P>
	``George is a fighter and I know that he will overcome this  
setback,'' said his wife, Nancy. ``I truly believe that everyone's 
prayers and well wishes are making a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, suffered a collapsed lung and a lacerated liver when  
he crashed his sport-utility vehicle into a bridge near his 
Franklin home on March 6. He was talking to his stepdaughter on a 
cellular phone at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been on a ventilator from the day of the accident until

<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A search team on Thursday found the  
body of a Marine Corps pilot near the wreckage of his jet, which 
crashed a day earlier in the Alaska Range, Air Force officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was identified as Maj. Timothy M. Curry, 35, of  
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	His F/A-18C Hornet fighter jet crashed Wednesday night north of  
12,300-foot Mount Deborah, about 80 miles south of Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was assigned to the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron at the  
Marine Corps Air Station at Iwakuni, Japan. He was in Alaska to 
participate in a training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter lifted the search team to examine the wreckage at  
an elevation of 6,800 feet. The search had been hampered by heavy 
snow, wind and low-lying clouds, Air Force Sgt. Angel Newman said 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was participating in Northern Edge, a joint military  
training exercise, when his plane was reported missing at Wednesday 
night. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Mark Arkansas Birthplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One month to the day after he was acquitted in  
the Senate impeachment trial, William Jefferson Clinton returns to 
a place called Hope to dedicate his birthplace as a historical 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope is the small town in Arkansas that candidate Clinton said  
he still believed in in 1992, and it is where the president buried 
his mother, Virginia Kelly, in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton has employed subtle symbols as he seeks to move  
beyond the impeachment drama, the White House cast this visit as 
more of a sentimental journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is certainly looking forward to going back home  
to Hope to dedicate his boyhood home so others can visit it as 
well,'' said White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss. ``It certainly will 
be an emotional and touching day for the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Clinton won acquittal on March 12 he returned to  
New Hampshire, whose primary voters gave his campaign a new lease 
on life in 1992 when he was dogged by charges of infidelity and 
avoiding the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout that campaign, Clinton reminded voters of his  
small-town roots and promised a better way for America. ``I still 
believe in a place called Hope,'' was one of his most memorable 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	The house on South Hervey Street where he was born 52 years ago  
has been open to tourists since June 1997, and visitors have come 
from all 50 states and 43 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places  
in 1994, the official notice identified the property with 
``Clinton's humble beginnings,'' his ``inner strength'' and the 
``dedication to purpose that has sustained him throughout his 
distinguished political career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was raising money for Democrats in Texarkana,  
Texas, and Little Rock, Ark., during his three-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though Clinton spent much of his boyhood in Hot  
Springs, Ark., longtime Arkansas friend Skip Rutherford said the 
dedication ceremony would make it a ``very special'' homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hope is particularly significant in his life, because of his  
roots there and it is the place where his mother is buried,'' 
Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics is very personal here,'' Rutherford said. ``The vast  
majority of people that President Clinton will see on his visits to 
Hope, Texarkana and Little Rock will be people that he knows both 
personally and professionally. The large majority he'll be able to 
call by their first name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will include Mack MacLarty, a Hope native who served as a  
top presidential adviser and is returning to welcome Clinton. An 
absence will be felt, too: Hope was the home of Vincent Foster, the 
White House lawyer who committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The site includes a garden dedicated to Clinton's mother and is  
designed to evoke a Southern neighborhood in the 1940s. Visitors 
first pass through a neighboring dwelling, as if they're stepping 
off the porch to visit the Clinton home.

	State funds to help convert the site into a museum hit a snag  
earlier this week when lawmakers rejected a $500,000 spending 
request. But state officials attributed that to a procedural 
misstep and questions about the source of the money and said it 
didn't represent opposition to Clinton.

<HEADLINE>  Swingley Maintains Iditarod Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANVIK, Alaska (AP) -- Doug Swingley maintained his lead Friday in  
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, becoming the first musher to 
reach the frozen Yukon River. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, the 1995 winner from Lincoln, Mont., arrived at this  
riverside checkpoint at 11:42 a.m. local time, later sitting down 
to a catered, seven-course dinner after ensuring that his 14-dog 
team had been bedded down. 
</P>
<P>
	He shared the meal with three-time winner Martin Buser of Big  
Lake, who pulled into Anvik at 1:23 p.m. But Swingley declined to 
share the $3,500 in First-to-the-Yukon cash he received. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not giving me half of that dessert?'' Buser teasingly  
asked Swingley. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley also had been first to reach the race's midway point at  
the namesake community of Iditarod, where he collected $3,000 in 
gold dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley's team appeared to be moving about 1 mph faster than  
that of Buser, who has dropped six of the 16 dogs he began the race 
with Saturday in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dogs are running fine,'' Swingley said. ``I'm just having a  
good time. I've been switching some dogs around, the leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was running third, 25 miles behind in  
Shageluk. Swenson is the Iditarod's only five-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
	DeeDee Jonrowe, second last year, was a close fourth Friday  
afternoon, checking in at Shageluk at 1:15 p.m., or a scant 14 
minutes behind Swenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley has managed to hold onto his lead despite two bouts of  
sled trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke a sled runner late Wednesday between Ophir and  
Iditarod, but still was first to the official halfway point. Race 
judges ruled at the time that Swingley's sled was too badly damaged 
for him to continue using it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second broken sled of the race for Swingley.  
</P>
<P>
	He snapped a main stanchion Monday on a rough trail heading into  
the Alaska Range. Using a foot-long piece of willow and several 
hose clamps, he splinted the broken strut and kept it together 
until Takotna, where he had the spare waiting. He later used the 
first sled to replace the damaged spare. 
</P>
<P>
	From Anvik, it's an 18-mile run downriver to Grayling. Mushers  
often encounter face-numbing winds as they peer ahead looking for 
the tripods and taped lath marking that stretch of the trail on the 
Yukon River ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six mushers started the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to  
Nome. Five teams have scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will collect $54,000 from the $450,000 purse. Prize  
money is paid to the first 20 finishers.

<HEADLINE> Christian Leaders Indicted on Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Leaders of a Christian ministry were  
running a Ponzi scheme when they promised a double return on 
donations, prosecutors alleged in indictments charging fraud, 
conspiracy and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven leaders of Greater Ministries International Inc. were  
arrested Friday. In a 20-count indictment unsealed in Tampa, 
prosecutors said the ministry's ``Double Your Money Gift Exchange 
Program'' was a Ponzi scheme in which early investors were paid 
with donations made by later investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater Ministries leaders allegedly failed to tell investors  
that ministry directors received a percentage of the investments as 
commission payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors refused to say how much they think Greater  
Ministries took in during its six years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those named in the indictment were Gerald Payne, 62, Greater  
Ministries' president; his wife, Betty, 59, the group's secretary; 
and five other officials: Patrick Talbert, 50, James Chambers, 66, 
Haywood Eudon Hall, 57, David Whitfield, 46, and Andrew Krishak, 
47. 
</P>
<P>
	At hearings in Tampa and Orlando, all the defendants but Gerald  
Payne were released on bail. Their attorneys refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater Ministries has had constant run-ins with authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	Cease-and-desist orders have been issued in Ohio, Pennsylvania  
and Florida. An appeals court overturned Florida's order, ruling 
that Greater Ministries' forms contained sufficient warnings that 
its program was faith-based and offered no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months ago, the nephew of a Greater Ministries official  
pleaded guilty to theft and securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Strawder, 26, started his own operation, Sovereign  
Ministries International, in April 1997. More than 2,100 people 
gave the organization as much as $14 million in less than a year.

<HEADLINE> DNC To Announce LA Convention Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee is expected  
to announce Monday that its 2000 presidential convention will be 
held in Los Angeles, ending weeks of rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials said Thursday the DNC and the city have  
come to terms, though they still were in the final stages of 
negotiations. Only minor details were left to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	While Denver and Boston were the two other finalists, it has  
been clear for weeks that Los Angeles would serve as convention 
host. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention is expected to bring 20,000 delegates, their  
families and media members to Los Angeles. Democrats last held 
their convention in Los Angeles when President Kennedy was 
nominated in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican convention will be held in Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> McCain: GOP Must Get Back to Basics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona, laying  
groundwork for a campaign in the state with the South's earliest 
presidential primary, urged South Carolina Republicans on Friday to 
unite behind the party basics of less government and lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans must ``remind voters that we are not simply the  
anti-Clinton party,'' McCain said. ``I believe people understand 
very well what we stand against. We need to remind them what we 
stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was the featured guest at a $120-per-plate fund-raiser  
for the state Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has not officially declared his candidacy, repeated  
his promise not to ``stoop to negative personal attacks against 
fellow Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as he talked of unity within the party on core issues, he  
spoke out against New York Gov. George Pataki's call for the 
removal of the anti-abortion plank from the GOP's national 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not agree,'' McCain said, conceding that he might  
consider an abortion-rights running mate if that person had good 
``overall qualifications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decorated Vietnam veteran faces an uphill battle in South  
Carolina, where early polls show Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the 
front-runner, followed by former American Red Cross President 
Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush enjoys the support of key party officials, including Lt.  
Gov. Bob Peeler and House Speaker David Wilkins. Republican 
Attorney General Charlie Condon is state chairman for Mrs. Dole's 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain said the race is wide open.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people of South Carolina are independent, they're  
patriotic,'' he said. ``They have a very significant veterans 
population and I intend to motivate them to support my candidacy.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Court Rejects Tax Referendum to CORRECT that schools are </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
supported by property tax.  
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire's politicians can't pass the  
buck and leave it to the voters to decide whether to enact an 
income tax, the state's highest court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire Supreme Court on Thursday blocked an effort by  
Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen to put two tax proposals to a public 
vote. The court said the state constitution does not permit such a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the bill proposes an unconstitutional  
delegation of power from the Legislature,'' the court said in a 
unanimous ruling. ``If the people are to say, by way of popular 
vote, whether or not an act shall become law, they are put in the 
place of the Legislature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire, the Live Free or Die State, is one of only two  
states with no general sales tax, no state property tax and no 
income tax. Alaska is the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is under pressure to enact an income tax or a uniform  
statewide property tax because of an April 1 deadline by the 
Supreme Court to come up with a fairer way of paying for the 
state's schools. Currently, schools are supported primarily by 
local property taxes, which vary widely from place to place. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators have said that the solution could cost the state up  
to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Republican-dominated House shocked the state by  
passing an income tax and sending the measure to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen, who while running for re-election reiterated the  
traditional ``pledge'' demanded of New Hampshire politicians to 
veto a broad-based tax, had proposed leaving the decision up to the 
voters instead, with a referendum in which they could choose 
between an income tax and a package of taxes that would include a 
uniform statewide property tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling on Thursday shifts the burden back to the  
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that a referendum has been ruled out, Shaheen said an income  
tax is ``off the table'' as a possible solution. But Senate 
President Clesson Blaisdell, also a Democrat, disagreed.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Condor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first female California condor to breed  
in captivity, heralding a controversial program to save the giant 
birds from extinction, has died. 
</P>
<P>
	The condor, which produced 15 chicks after being captured in  
1986, died Wednesday, Los Angeles Zoo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird may have had an inflammation of its abdomen, but the  
cause of death is not expected to be announced for several weeks. 
Scientists were not sure of the age of the dead condor since it is 
difficult to determine ages of birds once they have matured. 
</P>
<P>
	California condors, among the most ancient of North America's  
birds, had been shot, poisoned and electrocuted nearly into 
extinction when biologists launched a controversial recovery 
program in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	They trapped the last 22 surviving wild condors and brought them  
into zoos, setting their offspring free in California and Arizona. 
About 100 of the birds, whose wing spans reach 11 feet, remain in 
zoos and another 56 have been released to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	The birds were shot because they preyed on hunters' kills, and  
still more died from lead poisoning and high-tension electrical 
wires. Once found everywhere from Texas to British Columbia, by 
1924 there were no wild condors left outside California.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Dedicates Ark. Birthplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOPE, Ark. (AP) -- Shoulders hunched against a chilling rain,  
President Clinton thanked his hometown Friday for the ``love and 
loyalty and lessons of a lifetime'' he learned here in a plain 
woodframe home. 
</P>
<P>
	The president returned to Hope for an outdoor ceremony to  
dedicate his birthplace as a historic site. He marveled at the 
restoration of his maternal grandparents' home, 117 South Hervey 
Street, an ivory house with green trim, on a plot of land fronted 
by a white picket fence so fresh the paint was still wet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain makes this day even more poignant for me,'' Clinton  
said. ``To my family and friends I say thank you for love and 
loyalty and the lessons of a lifetime. Thank you for being there 
for me through this whole, wonderful ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house has been open to tourists since June 1997, and  
visitors have come from all 50 states and 43 countries. Its 
official notice on the National Register of Historic Places 
identified the property with ``Clinton's humble beginnings,'' his 
``inner strength'' and the ``dedication to purpose that has 
sustained him throughout his distinguished political career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few more than 100 people sat in raw, biting wind on damp  
aluminum chairs, listening patiently as Clinton reminisced about 
the place where he broke his leg trying to jump rope in cowboy 
boots; learned to count on playing cards that his grandparents 
propped in a window; first prayed; and thought his mother was 
calling from nursing school in New Orleans each time the telephone 
rang. 
</P>
<P>
	He marveled at the preservation of his mother's rose garden, and  
said she would have been proud to see it. Virginia Kelley died in 
1994, and is buried in Hope along with Clinton's grandparents and 
father. Clinton's motorcade stopped in the driving rain before he 
left Hope so that he could visit his mother's grave. 
</P>
<P>
	At the dedication, Clinton also told of an unforgettable lesson  
his elderly Uncle Buddy taught him late in life as his Aunt Olive 
struggled with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw tears in his eyes. And said to my uncle, 'This is really  
hard, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``And he said these words I will 
remember until the day I die. He said, 'Yeah, it is. But I signed 
on for the whole load, and most of it's been pretty good.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, in this town, from my family and friends, that's what I  
learned -- to sign on for the whole load,'' Clinton continued. 
``Though far from perfect, I have tried to do just that for my 
family and my friends, for our beloved state and nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyhood friend Joe Purvis, who drove the restoration effort,  
choked back tears as he spoke of Clinton and why he means so much 
to ordinary Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't come from a grand mansion. He came from a very  
simple, humble home,'' Purvis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton credited his small town upbringing with instilling in  
him the values that drove him to public service and the presidency, 
a lesson he wanted to impart to the children of Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of what I learned that was good, that I took with me for  
the rest of my life, I learned back then,'' he said. ``It doesn't 
matter were you came from in life, it matters what you did with 
your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton took with him a cadre of friends from his Arkansas days,  
including former aide Mack McLarty, White House personnel director 
Bob Nash and friend and confidant Bruce Lindsey. First lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, who has been nursing a bad back, stayed behind in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people, shivering under multicolored umbrellas, met  
Clinton at the airport. ``I always say that the people here stuck 
with me through rain and shine, and now it is literally true,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's brother, Roger, stood beside the stage as Clinton  
spoke, holding his son under a large red-and-white umbrella. The 
boy fed cookies to his father during his uncle's speech, and 
Clinton publicly thanked his brother and sister-in-law for coming 
from California to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's visit had all the trappings of a sentimental sojourn  
for the president, but the bad weather cut into his ability to 
linger and schmooze with those who supported him from the 
beginning, and stayed with him through his impeachment drama that 
unfolded after his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	On his trip, the president also was raising money for Democrats  
in Texas and Little Rock. Arriving for a fund-raising reception in 
Texarkana, Texas, the president was greeted by a dozen protesters 
holding signs that said ``sexual predator alert.''

<HEADLINE> Computers Ready for Dow 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street traders are worrying more about  
inflated stock prices than any possible Dow-10,000 computer snafus 
as the Dow Jones industrial average flirts with the five-digit 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago some consultants warned that old software could read  
10000 as 0000 and cause some computers to go haywire, or interpret 
it as a major crash and trigger automatic selling. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer and industry experts say any glitches have been  
patched, and would have been largely irrelevant, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a non-event,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist  
for Deutsche Bank, North America, on Thursday. ``It might just be 
kind of like a joke to see the Dow is at zero rather than 10000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because, while the Dow is a commonly accepted gauge of  
market activity with the public, the 10,000 milestone holds little 
interest among professional traders and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more concerned about the level of the Dow than the  
five-digit Dow. The market is as high as a kite,'' said Alan 
Davidson, president of the 130-member Independent Broker-Dealer 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industry groups were equally ambivalent.  
</P>
<P>
	The Securities Industry Association, the New York Stock Exchange  
and several major brokerages said they envisioned no problems 
resulting from the extra digit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a statement that  
it had been assured any appropriate measures have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Hall, vice president of Trigent Software Inc., a software  
services firm in Southborough, Mass., said updating software to 
recognize a fifth field is not an unusual or out of the ordinary 
task for people who maintain systems.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Dedicates Ark. Birthplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOPE, Ark. (AP) -- Shoulders hunched against a chilling rain,  
President Clinton thanked his hometown Friday for the ``love and 
loyalty and lessons of a lifetime'' he learned here in a plain 
woodframe home. 
</P>
<P>
	The president returned to Hope for an outdoor ceremony to  
dedicate his birthplace as a historic site. He marveled at the 
restoration of his maternal grandparents' home, 117 South Hervey 
Street, an ivory house with green trim, on a plot of land fronted 
by a white picket fence so fresh the paint was still wet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain makes this day even more poignant for me,'' Clinton  
said. ``To my family and friends I say thank you for love and 
loyalty and the lessons of a lifetime. Thank you for being there 
for me through this whole, wonderful ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house has been open to tourists since June 1997, and  
visitors have come from all 50 states and 43 countries. Its 
official notice on the National Register of Historic Places 
identified the property with ``Clinton's humble beginnings,'' his 
``inner strength'' and the ``dedication to purpose that has 
sustained him throughout his distinguished political career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few more than 100 people sat in raw, biting wind on damp  
aluminum chairs, listening patiently as Clinton reminisced about 
the place where he broke his leg trying to jump rope in cowboy 
boots; learned to count on playing cards that his grandparents 
propped in a window; first prayed; and thought his mother was 
calling from nursing school in New Orleans each time the telephone 
rang. 
</P>
<P>
	He marveled at the preservation of his mother's rose garden, and  
said she would have been proud to see it. Virginia Kelley died in 
1994, and is buried in Hope along with Clinton's grandparents and 
father. Clinton's motorcade stopped in the driving rain before he 
left Hope so that he could visit his mother's grave. 
</P>
<P>
	At the dedication, Clinton also told of an unforgettable lesson  
his elderly Uncle Buddy taught him late in life as his Aunt Olive 
struggled with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw tears in his eyes. And said to my uncle, 'This is really  
hard, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``And he said these words I will 
remember until the day I die. He said, 'Yeah, it is. But I signed 
on for the whole load, and most of it's been pretty good.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, in this town, from my family and friends, that's what I  
learned -- to sign on for the whole load,'' Clinton continued. 
``Though far from perfect, I have tried to do just that for my 
family and my friends, for our beloved state and nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyhood friend Joe Purvis, who drove the restoration effort,  
choked back tears as he spoke of Clinton and why he means so much 
to ordinary Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't come from a grand mansion. He came from a very  
simple, humble home,'' Purvis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton credited his small town upbringing with instilling in  
him the values that drove him to public service and the presidency, 
a lesson he wanted to impart to the children of Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of what I learned that was good, that I took with me for  
the rest of my life, I learned back then,'' he said. ``It doesn't 
matter were you came from in life, it matters what you did with 
your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton took with him a cadre of friends from his Arkansas days,  
including former aide Mack McLarty, White House personnel director 
Bob Nash and friend and confidant Bruce Lindsey. First lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, who has been nursing a bad back, stayed behind in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people, shivering under multicolored umbrellas, met  
Clinton at the airport. ``I always say that the people here stuck 
with me through rain and shine, and now it is literally true,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's brother, Roger, stood beside the stage as Clinton  
spoke, holding his son under a large red-and-white umbrella. The 
boy fed cookies to his father during his uncle's speech, and 
Clinton publicly thanked his brother and sister-in-law for coming 
from California to be with him. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nichols Challenges Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Convicted Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry  
Nichols asked Friday that a full federal appeals court panel hear 
his claims that improper guidelines were used to sentence him to 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	In his petition, Nichols said a three-judge panel at the 10th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals erred two weeks ago when it rejected 
his claim that the federal sentencing guidelines were flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols also said it was unfair to apply the Mandatory Victim  
Restitution Act, ordering him to pay $14.5 million for his role in 
the April 1995 bombing, which killed 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 43, was found guilty of conspiring to bomb the building  
and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Timothy McVeigh was convicted of first-degree  
murder, conspiracy and weapons-related charges and sentenced to 
death. His sentence was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols also said the judges made a mistake when they rejected  
his claim that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the 
jury during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch should have  
told the jury that Nichols could not be sentenced to life 
imprisonment unless he had ``a specific intent to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted Nichols of first-degree murder and using a  
weapon of mass destruction, and the defense argued that in the 
absence of guilty verdicts on those charges he should have received 
a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols said the appeals court judges used ``a tortured reading  
of the guideline provisions'' to confirm his sentence, saying there 
was no legal authority for using Nichols' conspiracy conviction to 
apply a felony-murder doctrine, either for purposes of conviction 
or sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Teen Convicted in Five Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLNEY, Ill. (AP) -- A 17-year-old boy was convicted Friday of  
killing his half-brother and four others during a drunken rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Churchill admitted in a videotaped statement that he  
killed his half-brother, his brother's girlfriend Debra Smith, and 
her three children to ``relieve stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill, who was 16 at the time of the February 1998 killings,  
faces a maximum sentence of life without parole at his sentencing, 
scheduled for April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a just verdict. He's going to suffer for the rest  
of his life for it,'' said James Shelton, father of Ms. Smith, 
whose three children were 12, 10 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill said he played cards with the family the night of the  
killings, then stayed up drinking at their home in Noble, in 
southern Illinois. He told police he had fantasized about killing 
his brother and ``acted out a little anger'' on the others because 
they teased him. 
</P>
<P>
	He attacked all five with a hammer, watched some television,  
then had sex with 12-year-old girl as she lay dying. He was 
arrested six days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill's lawyer said someone else was responsible for the  
killings and that Churchill is protecting his friends in a 
``misguided attempt at altruism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said blood found on a T-shirt that Churchill is  
believed to have worn during the killings matched Ms. Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendant knew what he did. He wasn't ashamed of it, and  
he happily told police about it,'' Assistant Attorney General Allen 
Lolie said.

<HEADLINE> Kansas Has Experience To Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There's a certain strut some teams have, not  
really cockiness, just an air of self-assurance, a notion that 
people speak of them with respect. It's something winning inspires, 
and Kansas has it. 
</P>
<P>
	Making its 28th NCAA tournament appearance and 10th straight,  
Kansas is seeded sixth this year, a drop for the Jayhawks, but not 
a comedown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the pressure that we've felt the last few years  
isn't quite as heavy,'' guard Ryan Robertson said. ``But let's face 
it, it's still the NCAA tournament and we're still Kansas. There 
are still people that expect us to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's an attitude Evansville, Miami of Ohio and Arkansas State  
aspire to. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really exciting, I still don't know what to expect,''  
Evansville's Marcus Wilson said. ``Just being here in New Orleans 
and seeing the town, first of all, was very exciting. Walking 
through the Superdome and seeing how big it was ... it's very 
exciting right now, but we know that we should have a good time and 
all, but we came here to win a basketball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Evansville, Arkansas State (18-11) can add a bit of swagger  
with a first-round victory over second-seeded Utah (27-4), which 
has won 22 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Under coach Rick Majerus, the Utes have made seven trips to the  
NCAA tournament, reaching the final 16 four times, final Eight 
twice and Final Four once. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been watching film and trying to point out any  
weaknesses on Utah, but we can't find any,'' Arkansas State coach 
Dickey Nutt said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time Arkansas State, which moved up to Division I  
in 1970, has made the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah is more experienced, bigger, taller, and on a roll. But one  
thing it isn't going to be is blase, Majerus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no difference in how we prepare or what we do,''  
Majerus said. ``But I suppose emotionally there is an adrenalin 
flow associated with a marquee name that the players may not get 
against another team. But we are fully aware that Arkansas State 
can beat us. They won't catch us not ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Kentucky (25-8), which has played in the past three  
NCAA title games (winning twice), is in its record 40th NCAA 
tournament. The defending champion Wildcats are the top seed at New 
Orleans and face New Mexico State (18-12). 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky lost four straight road games to finish with its most  
regular-season losses since 1990. It doesn't want to continue the 
trend in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a goal to be 9-0 in the postseason; we're 3-0 right  
now,'' forward Scott Padgett said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico State is back in the NCAA tournament under Lou  
Henson, who in February became the sixth active coach with 700 
career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	While 423 of Henson's victories came in 21 years at Illinois, he  
has the Aggies back in the NCAA tournament only two years after 
returning to his alma mater. Henson is in his 19th NCAA, seven of 
those during his first stay at New Mexico State. But the last one 
with the Aggies was 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kentucky is relaxed and we're not,'' Henson said. ``You never  
know how a team will react. Usually teams that have been here 
handle things better. If you win, it just gives your players a lot 
of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington (17-11) went to the round of 16 last year before  
losing 75-74 to Connecticut. The Huskies are led by 7-foot center 
Todd MacCullough, who averaged 19 points while leading the Pac-10 
in rebounding (12 a game) and field goal percentage (.662). 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, Ohio is in it's fourth NCAA tournament of the 1990s, but  
has advanced past the first round just once in the last six trips.

<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators believe a woman and two  
teen-age girls met violent deaths soon after they vanished during a 
trip to Yosemite National Park a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel almost certain the women were the victims of a violent  
crime,'' FBI agent James Maddock said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 42, her 15-year-old daughter, Julie, and Silvina  
Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend from Cordoba, Argentina, were 
last seen Feb. 15 at the Cedar Lodge, a restaurant and motel on 
Yosemite's rugged western border. 
</P>
<P>
	The group probably died the night they vanished or early the  
next morning, Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock refused to say what investigators said Wednesday that  
prompted Mrs. Sund's husband to say that evening that he was 
``devastated'' by the FBI's news. FBI officials had said it was 
likely the three were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jens Sund apologized Thursday for the remark, saying reporters  
caught him at a low moment and that he has ``been on an emotional 
roller coaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Carrington, Mrs. Sund's father, said the family still  
hopes the women will be found alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there's still a pretty good chance,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents used all-terrain vehicles Thursday to search the  
park. Volunteers said they had been told to search for shallow 
graves.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Chemical To Move to Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) -- Chevron Chemical, a division of Chevron  
Corp., said it will move its headquarters to Houston and eliminate 
300 jobs over the next year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring, which will reduce costs by $76 million, is  
part of an effort to cut company expenses by $500 million this 
year, Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are hard decisions to make but must be done if we are to  
remain competitive during this severe petrochemicals downturn and 
extended period of low energy prices,'' Chevron Chemical president 
Darry Callahan said in a memo obtained by the San Francisco 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the company memo, the headquarters move will occur  
by September, and jobs will be cut in both San Ramon and Houston. 
Human resources and finance personnel jobs will not be affected for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey said it is not clear how many people will be laid off  
because many of the cuts will be handled through retirement and 
attrition. Workers will be offered incentives to retire early, and 
some may be hired in other parts of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical division headquarters produces petrochemicals, such  
as benzene and styrene, are used to make plastics for consumer and 
industrial use. Historically they have accounted for about 10 
percent of revenues.

<HEADLINE> Israel Parties Unite for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Three Israeli parties that reject any land for  
peace compromise with the Arabs have agreed to run together for 
seats in parliament to maximize their strength in the May 17 
election, party leaders said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties oppose the interim land-for-security agreement with  
the Palestinians signed in Washington last October by Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, himself a right-winger who has been 
reluctant to concede land. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly unified bloc is led by Benny Begin, who quit  
Netanyahu's Likud Party several weeks ago to form his own party, 
New Herut. 
</P>
<P>
	Second on the list of the as yet unnamed bloc is Rehavam Zeevi,  
head of the Moledet party, which favors removing Palestinians from 
Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Third is Hanan Porat, a militant backer of Israeli settlers in  
the West Bank, who heads a new settlers party called Tekumah. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are serving in the present parliament.  
</P>
<P>
	Unifying the parties increases the chance that they will meet  
the threshold required for representation in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The unification agreement was initialed before dawn today after  
marathon negotiations, although the parties did not agree on a 
candidate to support for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls published in today's Maariv daily showed Netanyahu and  
moderate Labor challenger Ehud Barak running even, with 33 and 34 
percent each. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll gave centrist party candidate Yitzhak Mordechai 16  
percent and Begin 10 percent. The Gallup poll questioned 560 
Israeli adults with a 4.5 percent margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	If no candidate for premier gets 50 percent of the vote, the top  
two finishers would face each other in a runoff two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll in the Maariv said that in a second round Netanyahu and  
Barak remained tied with 43 percent each, and 14 percent undecided. 
If Mordechai and Netnayahu faced each other in a second round, 
Mordechai would win 46 percent to Netanyahu's 41 percent, the poll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll in the Yediot Ahronot daily produced similar results.  
</P>
<P>
	Israelis will cast two separate ballots, for prime minister and  
for parliament.

<HEADLINE>  Friends, Family Honor Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The giant electronic billboard at Bay  
Meadows race track, where Joe DiMaggio spent many of his retirement 
afternoons, summarized the feelings of a nation: ``Joe, We'll Miss 
You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was remembered Thursday by Father Armand Oliveri, who  
led the funeral Mass, as a man ``who had achieved greatness, but 
his real greatness was the way he carried himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri said the hour-long service at Sts. Peter and Paul  
Church, attended by 80 family members and close friends, was 
peaceful and dignified -- a fitting tribute to a private man who 
impressed people with his quiet class as much as his classic swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a beautiful, dignified, very calm atmosphere,'' said  
Oliveri, 79, who had known DiMaggio since the two grew up in the 
North Beach section of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig and AL president Gene Budig  
attended the funeral. DiMaggio's mahogany casket remained closed 
and there were no baseball mementos -- nothing suggesting DiMaggio's 
impact on the game and on American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very sensitive, very private,'' Selig said. ``Just a  
day I'll remember for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was eulogized by his brother, Dominic, who spoke of  
their childhood together and his elder brother's athletic talent. 
He said the only thing his brother lacked was a constant companion, 
and that led to his devotion to children. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died Monday at his Florida home at the age of 84,  
was divorced from actress Dorothy Arnold in 1943 and actress 
Marilyn Monroe in 1954. In later years, he devoted much of his time 
and money to children's hospitals and charities. 
</P>
<P>
	When DiMaggio's flower-covered casket was driven away from the  
church, about 200 people standing across the street in Washington 
Square began applauding. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio received his first communion and married his first wife  
in the church, whose twin steeples tower over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Police barricades surrounded the church, keeping the public and  
hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV crews across the 
street. But the commotion did little to disturb dozens of people 
doing their morning Tai Chi routines in Washington Square, where an 
American flag flew at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Reynolds, whose father was a teammate of DiMaggio, stood  
behind a barricade on a cool sunny day watching mourners march into 
the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, son of former Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds, flew  
from Mustang, Okla., to pay last respects to the Hall of Famer. As 
a child, Reynolds hung out in the Yankee clubhouse, where his 
father had a locker two down from DiMaggio's. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad said DiMaggio was the greatest player he had ever  
seen,'' Reynolds said. ``My dad said he had a great record because, 
when he was pitching, someone would hit one and Joe would run a 
mile to catch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six pallbearers, including DiMaggio's estranged son, Joseph Paul  
DiMaggio Jr., carried the casket into and out of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi and two celebrants sang ``Amazing  
Grace'' and Schubert's ``Ave Maria'' among five musical works 
requested by the DiMaggio family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very dignified and private, just how they wanted it,''  
Simi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession passed DiMaggio's former home on Beach  
Street, where several fans laid flowers, on its way to Holy Cross 
Cemetery in nearby Colma. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, said the  
Hall of Famer wanted a private religious service and that his 
family was determined to follow his wishes. That meant excluding 
people such as Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to DiMaggio's son, other pallbearers were Roger  
Stein and James Hamra, the husbands of DiMaggio's two 
granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of the ballplayer's late 
brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of DiMaggio's for 59 years; 
and Engelberg.

<HEADLINE> Drunk Driver Said To Crash MADD Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Donald Podzka has been convicted of  
drunken driving four times. He again faces DWI charges -- this time 
after allegedly plowing into a car operated by the state executive 
director of MADD. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka, 48, was driving with a suspended license when his car  
hit Barbara Harrington's as she headed home from a Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving meeting Tuesday night, police said. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal  
limit, the Boston Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka was immediately arrested, and police said they  
confiscated four cans of beer -- two of them open -- from an area 
near his car. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness told police he saw Podzka frantically hurling beer  
cans into the woods immediately after the crash, said state police 
Sgt. Ron Sieberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka was convicted of drunken driving four times between 1981  
and 1989, according to police records. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harrington was not in her office Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Like all crashes involving repeat offenders, the crash  
involving MADD Massachusetts' executive director is another call to 
action for cracking down on people with a record of drinking 
alcohol and then getting behind the wheel,'' MADD national 
president Karolyn Nunnallee said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Podzka pleaded not guilty Wednesday and was released without  
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Podzka, nor his lawyer, Nancy Golden, returned calls  
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bank UBS Earns $2.2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, earned  
$2.2 billion in 1998 despite investment losses and an out-of-court 
settlement of Holocaust claims in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first annual earnings report for UBS since its  
formation last June by the merger of two major Swiss banks, Union 
Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-year profit was less than the $2.3 billion profit  
reported for the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-half results reflected a loss of $726 million by its  
investment bank, Warburg Dillon Read, on investments in financial 
derivatives and hedge funds, notably the U.S. fund Long Term 
Capital Management which was the beneficiary of an unusual rescue 
plan to avoid failing last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit also was reduced by $362.6 million due to a charge for  
UBS' share of the $1.25 billion settlement in the U.S. lawsuit over 
dormant World War II-era bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS joined with Credit Suisse in New York last August in  
agreeing to a settlement of the claims against them stemming from 
dormant accounts deposited by people later killed by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly merged bank said it continues to fine-tune its  
operations and strategies. It said its worldwide staff is now 
48,011, a cut of 7,165 people during the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank announced several changes in top management, including  
the retirement of Hans de Gier, the chairman and chief executive 
officer of Warburg Dillon Read. Markus Granziol, an 11-year veteran 
of the group, will become CEO of Warburg. Fritz Hobbs will become 
chairman of Warburg, while retaining his role as head of corporate 
finance.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Tickets Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to ride the success of the 1994 men's  
World Cup and the gold-medal performance of the U.S. women's 
Olympic team three years ago, American soccer officials secured 
this year's Women's World Cup. One hundred days before kickoff, 
it's beginning to look like a smart decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-team soccer championship that opens June 19 at Giants  
Stadium, with the United States playing Denmark, already is far 
ahead of projections in ticket sales. And the media publicity blitz 
hasn't even begun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been well beyond where we expected it to be,'' Marla  
Messing, president of the U.S. organizers, said Thursday. She said 
more than 260,000 tickets have been sold, including 45,000 since 
last month's draw. ``The best benchmark is we hoped to be at 95,000 
as of December '98, and at that point we were at about 200,000 
tickets sold. We believe we will be between 400,000 and 500,000 for 
the tournament, and our earlier projections were about 380,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets prices average from $9-$75, depending on the location,  
and are sold in strips for each site. Individual game tickets are 
not yet on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1994 men's World Cup in the United States, tickets were  
priced at $25-$475 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the demand is greater than we had projected,''  
Messing said. ``It's one of two things: the people we thought would 
buy are buying a whole lot earlier, or a lot of people are 
interested in coming to the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact the tournament is being accepted so strongly by the  
American public has encouraged many of the foreign nations in the 
field. While the men's event is followed passionately throughout 
the soccer community, the previous two women's tournaments (in 
China and Norway) weren't nearly so popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a bit difficult to get specific on the legacy of  
the tournament,'' he said, ``but given the reception of the 
tournament in the USA, it has had a significant impact, with 
national teams putting lots of resources behind their teams and 
getting them ready for the World Cup and the Olympics to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``National teams are telling us because of the reception in the  
USA and the attention being given to the women's World Cup, it 
gives them ammunition to go to their federations and get them 
behind the women's team.''

<HEADLINE>  Rice Says He'll Fit in With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Glen Rice says he's ready to hit the  
floor running despite not having played in a game since last 
season, and believes he'll fit in just fine with the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, who called  
Rice ``one of the great players in the NBA today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dapper in a dark blue suit, Rice met with the media Thursday at  
the Forum following his first practice with the Lakers, who 
acquired him a day earlier from Charlotte along with J.R. Reid and 
B.J. Armstrong, who was waived shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was absent from the news conference because he missed an  
airplane flight to California. West said Reid was expected to 
arrive later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Both new players are expected to play for the Lakers on Friday  
night when the team risks a nine-game winning streak against Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets received guard Eddie Jones and forward-center Elden  
Campbell in the blockbuster deal on the eve of the NBA's trade 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I want to do is come here and fit in, help  
this team get to the next level,'' Rice said. ``Just as I expected, 
all the guys welcomed me with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to get this show on the road. We have all the  
pieces of the puzzle, now we have to go out there and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have changed their look substantially in the last two  
weeks, firing coach Del Harris and replacing him with Kurt Rambis; 
signing Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder in each of the 
last seven seasons; and now adding Rice and Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to bring us a dimension we haven't had here for a  
long, long time,'' West said of Rice. ``I've heard from a number of 
people in the NBA today who thought we did well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to play now, the elbow is 100 percent,'' he said.  
``I've been doing a lot of running, extra running as a matter of 
fact. I don't have time to get rusty, I've always been focused. 
Yeah, I haven't played in any games. (But) I don't think that will 
be a problem at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward acknowledged to be one of the NBA's most  
accurate long-range shooters, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8 
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. The three-time All-Star averaged 22.3 points last 
season to rank sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with  
Kobe Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice also figures to make life easier for center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's second-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely enough shots for everybody out there,''  
Rice said. ``I'm opening it up for Kobe and Shaq. A lot of people 
have been doubling (O'Neal). I don't know if they're going to want 
to continue doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he believes the Lakers (15-6) should now be  
considered the favorites to win their first NBA championship in 11 
years, Rice replied, ``I feel that way, yeah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it on paper, it has championship written all  
over it,'' he said of his new team. ``But you can't win on paper. 
You have to do it on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the time had come for him to leave the Hornets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had three great seasons there, I've got to thank them for  
that,'' he said. ``I'm a Laker. I've got to forget about Charlotte. 
It was something I wanted done. Things weren't going well for me in 
Charlotte. I'm glad that that's over with. I'm where I want to be. 
I'm ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why my last name's Rice, so we can get it cooking.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki to GOP: Drop Abortion Plank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Diving into the thorniest issue of  
Republican presidential politics, Gov. George Pataki said Friday 
that the anti-abortion plank should be removed from the GOP's 
national platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should just recognize ... the existence of a  
diversity of opinion, tolerate that diversity of opinion and have a 
big-tent type of philosophy,'' the New York Republican, who 
describes himself as an abortion rights supporter, told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has begun raising his national profile in recent weeks in  
what some boosters believe is a first step in an effort to win a 
spot on the national ticket next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, again refusing to rule out a run for president,  
said he wouldn't remain silent on such issues even if it might hurt 
him politically. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have stances based on what you really believe,''  
he said. ``To me, it's not all that hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pataki comments were almost certain to anger the party's  
conservative wing, which has largely controlled the nominating 
process in recent elections. 
</P>
<P>
	A top strategist for millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, an  
anti-abortion candidate making his second run for president, said 
the New York governor had likely ``hurt his chances significantly'' 
of getting on the national ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plank on life will stay in the platform,'' Bill Dal Col  
said. ``The Republican Party is clearly the party of life and will 
remain so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Pataki's move means he won't be labeled  
wishy-washy on the abortion issue, a charge front-running Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush and some others eyeing the GOP nomination have 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said this week that while he supported a constitutional  
amendment to ban abortion, there was no point in pressing the issue 
until enough voters were ready to back such a move. ``America is 
not ready to ban abortions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki noted that he had espoused his position on abortion at  
the party's 1996 national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	But because he is considered a potential national candidate this  
time around, Pataki's latest statements on the issue drew extra 
attention when first reported Friday in The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	``A plank that says we have to all believe or act one way or the  
other is inappropriate,'' Pataki told the newspaper. ``Yes, I would 
take it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plank says in part, ``The unborn child has a fundamental  
individual right to life which cannot be infringed.'' It goes on to 
call for a constitutional amendment banning abortions.

Rice ``one of the great players in the NBA today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dapper in a dark blue suit, Rice met with the media Thursday at  
the Forum following his first practice with the Lakers, who 
acquired him a day earlier from Charlotte along with J.R. Reid and 
B.J. Armstrong, who was waived shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was absent from the news conference because he missed an  
airplane flight to California. West said Reid was expected to 
arrive later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Both new players are expected to play for the Lakers on Friday  
night when the team risks a nine-game winning streak against Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets received guard Eddie Jones and forward-center Elden  
Campbell in the blockbuster deal on the eve of the NBA's trade 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I want to do is come here and fit in, help  
this team get to the next level,'' Rice said. ``Just as I expected, 
all the guys welcomed me with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to get this show on the road. We have all the  
pieces of the puzzle, now we have to go out there and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have changed their look substantially in the last two  
weeks, firing coach Del Harris and replacing him with Kurt Rambis; 
signing Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder in each of the 
last seven seasons; and now adding Rice and Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to bring us a dimension we haven't had here for a  
long, long time,'' West said of Rice. ``I've heard from a number of 
people in the NBA today who thought we did well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to play now, the elbow is 100 percent,'' he said.  
``I've been doing a lot of running, extra running as a matter of 
fact. I don't have time to get rusty, I've always been focused. 
Yeah, I haven't played in any games. (But) I don't think that will 
be a problem at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward acknowledged to be one of the NBA's most  
accurate long-range shooters, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8 
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. The three-time All-Star averaged 22.3 points last 
season to rank sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with  
Kobe Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice also figures to make life easier for center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's second-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely enough shots for everybody out there,''  
Rice said. ``I'm opening it up for Kobe and Shaq. A lot of people 
have been doubling (O'Neal). I don't know if they're going to want 
to continue doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he believes the Lakers (15-6) should now be  
considered the favorites to win their first NBA championship in 11 
years, Rice replied, ``I feel that way, yeah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it on paper, it has championship written all  
over it,'' he said of his new team. ``But you can't win on paper. 
You have to do it on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the time had come for him to leave the Hornets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had three great seasons there, I've got to thank them for  
that,'' he said. ``I'm a Laker. I've got to forget about Charlotte. 
It was something I wanted done. Things weren't going well for me in 
Charlotte. I'm glad that that's over with. I'm where I want to be. 
I'm ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why my last name's Rice, so we can get it cooking.''

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads in Gay Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man accused of murdering five gay men  
because he thought it would stop the spread of AIDS abruptly ended 
his trial by pleading guilty to the charges, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Chavez, 34, avoided a possible death sentence in the  
capital case by unexpectedly changing his plea about 1 1/2 weeks into 
trial, prosecutor Mike Duarte said Thursday. He is scheduled to be 
sentenced June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Duarte told jurors during the trial that Chavez lured the men to  
their homes supposedly for sex and then robbed and strangled them. 
He also was accused of taking the victims' cars after killing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez confessed to the murders while serving a prison sentence  
for an unrelated 1996 kidnapping, according to a probation 
department report. In September of that year, he was charged with 
strangling the five men in 1986 and 1989.

<HEADLINE> Otters Who Bit Girl Spared, For Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Fatty, Chrissy, Blinky and Big-Um can  
continue to frolic in their lagoon after being granted a stay of 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the four otters nipped 17-month-old Rachael Gold of New  
York City during a visit earlier this month to Flamingo Gardens, a 
nature park north of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	They were spared Friday when Rachael's parents decided to go  
ahead with rabies shots without having the animals killed and 
tested first. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't going anywhere without a big fight,'' activist  
Maria Lopez said of the otters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez was one of about 40 protesters who assembled at the  
entrance to the park before word of the reprieve. Protesters 
carried signs saying ``Save the Otters'' and ``Honk'' in support. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachael's parents could have demanded that the otters be tested  
for rabies -- which requires that the animals be killed -- to 
determine whether Rachael really needed to undergo the regimen of 
five rabies shots. 
</P>
<P>
	But amid protests from animal lovers, Rachael's parents decided  
to go ahead with the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The otters are still not out of danger. If Rachael has an  
allergic reaction to the shots, her parents could suspend the 
treatment and have the animals killed and tested to be sure the 
shots are necessary.

<HEADLINE> Trump, NASCAR Plan N.Y. Metro Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Traffic and speed limits in the New York area  
are about to go up dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate developer Donald Trump and Bill France, chairman and  
chief executive officer of the International Speedway Corporation, 
announced plans Friday to build a superspeedway in the region, with 
an exact site to be chosen by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big day for either New York, New Jersey or  
Connecticut,'' Trump said. ``We are looking at five sites and we'll 
probably have another five. A final decision on one will be made in 
the next couple of months. In eight to 12 weeks, we'll have a 
pretty good idea where it will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said the facility would cost between $200 and $250  
million, ``maybe more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be large, beautiful and very, very special,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	ISC would own the track, adding it to five other motorsports  
facilities under its control. That list includes Daytona 
International Speedway, home of the Daytona 500; and tracks in 
Talladega, Ala.; Phoenix; Darlington, S.C.; and Watkins Glen, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``ISC looks for growth opportunities and the New York market  
offers that,'' France said. ``We are excited about the prospects. 
We plan a track with the highest standards and new and unique 
features.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France's company is currently building a 75,000-seat track in  
Kansas City, Mo., and has plans for another in Joliet, Ill., 25 
miles from Chicago. Both facilities can accommodate expansion to 
150,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	France said the layout in the New York area would be at least a  
one-mile track to qualify for the superspeedway designation and 
would probably have a road course to maximize usage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be 750 acres, up or down a little, with a minimum of  
75,000 seats to start,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new track will be called Trump Superspeedway. Future naming  
rights, however, will be retained by ISC. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said politicians from all three states had contacted him  
about the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all want it,'' he said. ``Any good politician would want  
it in his area. It means huge economic development for the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One site on the preliminary list is in Riverhead, N.Y., on Long  
Island, about 75 miles from New York City. A town official last 
month said Trump has bid $55 million to develop a 2,900-acre site 
that once housed an aircraft test flight facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Riverhead is a little far out,'' Trump said. ``It's a  
wonderful site. It's one of our sites. But it's tough out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the developer looked around Trump Tower, one of his  
buildings in the heart of Manhattan, where the speedway 
announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key,'' he said, ``is to be as close to Fifth Avenue and  
57th Street as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Debate Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is ready next week, after two  
failed attempts, to vote on a bill aimed at ensuring construction 
of a national missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea born in the Reagan administration is being revived in  
Congress amid growing concern over an attack by terrorists or a 
rogue state. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Democrats managed twice to block debate by one vote.  
Thursday night, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
announced agreement with the Democrats to let the debate go forward 
with a vote as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, fearing the vote would hinder  
negotiations with Russia over changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile Treaty, has threatened a veto of the measure which would 
state: 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is  
technologically possible an effective national missile defense 
system capable of defending the territory of the United States 
against limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, 
unauthorized or delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., introduced the bill on the Senate  
floor late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is progress,'' said Cochran. '' We're very proud to see  
this momentum to address this issue that is so important for the 
national security interests of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, administration officials at a congressional  
hearing outlined steps being taken to defend U.S. troops and 
civilians against various types of missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that  
China and Russia have held talks on the prospects of a U.S. 
anti-missile umbrella and are united in their opposition to the 
system. China also is concerned about the possibility of U.S. 
arrangements with Japan or Taiwan on missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	A House version of the bill cleared the House Armed Service  
Committee by a 50-3 margin last month. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton included money in his fiscal 1999 budget  
request for beginning to build such a system, but Republicans want 
faster spending. Clinton also has delayed until June 2000 a 
decision on whether to go ahead with a full-scale system. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have pushed for a missile defense system since  
the early 1980s, when President Reagan proposed a space-based 
shield against incoming missiles. The issue has drawn increased 
Democratic support with the firing of a ballistic missile by North 
Korea last year and reports that Iran is developing an offensive 
missile program.

<HEADLINE> NFL Prepares To Award Franchise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Within the next few days, 31 football team  
owners meeting in Arizona plan to vote on whether to put a new NFL 
franchise in Los Angeles or Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that a decision has already been reached  
to award the league's 32nd team to Los Angeles, reports denied by 
all sides. There are strong signs that L.A. will get the nod, but a 
decision won't be final until the league's sometimes unpredictable 
owners approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion committee is set to meet Sunday in Phoenix, with  
its recommendation to be presented to all the owners early next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said recently that he expects  
the league to name a city, but not an ownership group, during the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Houston has just one ownership group bidding, it might be  
out of the running. Another indication is that Bob McNair, who 
heads the effort to bring a team back to Houston, is shopping 
around for an existing franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said he hasn't given up on the possibility of  
landing the expansion team, McNair has sent letters of inquiry to 
teams in nine other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two groups in Los Angeles competing for a team: one  
headed by Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz that wants to build a 
new stadium in suburban Carson; the other led by real estate 
developer Ed Roski and billionaire Eli Broad, seeking to return a 
team to a remodeled L.A. Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NFL does the expected and picks Los Angeles, the league  
then will be able to have those two groups -- and any others that 
might want to get into the game -- bidding against each other for 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	As a measure of the price tag, Cleveland paid $530 million for  
an expansion team, and the current bid for the Washington Redskins 
is $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, a member of the  
expansion committee, said he would be surprised if other groups 
interested in owning a team didn't surface, regardless of which 
city was picked. 
</P>
<P>
	There has even been speculation that the two present L.A. groups  
might join their efforts, although there would be obstacles to such 
a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors would seem to make Los Angeles a shoo-in. The  
area is the nation's second largest TV market (compared to Houston 
at No. 11), is highly visible as America's ``entertainment 
capital,'' and, with nearly 17 million potential customers for 
jerseys and other team paraphernalia, is an area the NFL may need 
more than it needs an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said during a visit last week to Carson that he  
didn't expect the league would expand beyond 32 teams ``in my 
lifetime, and I'm 62.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If L.A.'s not the place, that would leave the NFL without a home  
team in the No. 2 TV market for the foreseeable future, costing the 
league megabucks in TV contracts and merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he ticked off concerns about the proposed  
remodeling of the Coliseum, including parking space and the 
financial package. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson noted that the Coliseum already lost two NFL teams,  
the Rams when they moved to Anaheim, and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without a team since 1995, when  
the Rams left Anaheim for St. Louis and the Raiders returned to 
Oakland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Planes Attack Iraq Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed several air-defense  
sites in Iraq's northern ``no-fly'' zone today during routine 
patrols, the U.S. military said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force F-15s and a Marine EA-6B Prowler hit sites north and  
northwest of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, said Capt. Manning 
Brown, a spokesman for Turkey's Incirlik air base. 
</P>
<P>
	The crews were ``responding in self-defense'' to Iraqi radars  
posing a threat to the coalition aircraft, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi military confirmed the bombings in a statement carried  
by the official Iraqi News Agency in Baghdad but reported no damage 
or casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said ``nine formations of enemy planes'' violated  
Iraqi airspace and fired seven missiles at ``civilian installations 
and some weapons belonging to our ground defenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq said the formation included U.S. F-16s and British Tornado  
fighter-bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British aircraft patrol ``no-fly'' zones over the north  
and south of Iraq to protect the Kurdish minority and Shiite 
rebels. The zones were set up after the 1991 Gulf War. The mission 
is based at Incirlik. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq does not recognize the zones and has challenged the allied  
planes almost daily since mid-December, provoking retaliatory 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey, fearing retaliation from Baghdad for harboring the  
allied planes, had recently expressed unease over the repeated 
confrontations between Iraqi and U.S. forces in the northern no-fly 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Indyk, assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern  
Affairs, said after discussions with Turkish officials today that 
``the matter has been resolved.'' He did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Canada Claims Victory Over Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Canada claimed victory Friday in a long-running  
dispute with Brazil after the World Trade Organization ordered both 
countries to eliminate illegal subsidies for their aircraft 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries had filed complaints with the WTO accusing the  
other of illegally subsidizing exports of regional jets, made in 
Brazil by Embraer and in Canada by Bombardier Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ordered Canada to make changes in two programs that have  
supported the regional jet industry, but also ordered Brazil to 
eliminate its export financing program, called Proex. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said the net result of the rulings  
was ``an overwhelming victory'' for Canada, because the findings 
against its programs were much more narrow in scope than the 
findings against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Proex program, which provided interest rate rebates  
to buyers of Embraer's ERJ-145 jets, amounted to a subsidy of $2.5 
million per jet that would have to be withdrawn promptly to comply 
with the WTO order. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil contends that the rebate simply compensates for Brazil's  
high interest rates. It has indicated it would appeal parts of the 
WTO ruling that were unfavorable, though its Foreign Office 
declined specific comment Friday because it was still awaiting 
details of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombardier and Embraer dominate the global market for 50-seat  
regional jets. The trade battle goes back two years, when 
Bombardier first complained it was being hurt by Brazilian export 
subsidies for the Embraer jets.

<HEADLINE> Signals Slow D.C. Rail System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Subway train operators in the nation's capital  
were ordered Friday to slow down and use manual controls while a 
potential safety problem is investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Switches that control signals, speed and train separation have  
failed three times in the past three months. Another one failed in 
February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each instance was immediately detected and immediately  
addressed,'' said Richard White, general manager of the Washington 
Area Metropolitan Transit Authority. He said the incidents 
presented no dangers to train passengers or operators, but he 
defended his decision to slow the system, saying, ``We're not going 
to take any chances whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems included signal lights that failed to change within  
five to 10 seconds of a train's departure. Another signal allowed a 
train to travel at 45 mph when it should have slowed automatically 
to 15 mph. A subsequent relay placed 100 feet from the failed unit 
slowed the train to its proper speed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 24,000 of them (relays) located in train control rooms  
throughout the Metro system,'' said White. The faulty relays are 
being tested to determine why they failed. ``The remaining 23,997 
relays are in operation and properly functioning,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the average customer, the order to slow the trains for at  
least three to four weeks means ``their ride will take somewhere 
between five and 10 minutes longer,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 540,000 use the 96-mile system each day. It serves a  
1,500-square-mile region, including the District of Columbia and 
nearby suburbs of Maryland and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Study Link Genes, AIDS Progression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inherited genes may explain why some people  
infected with HIV quickly develop AIDS while others with the virus 
live for years in relatively good health, scientists report. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the journal Science, researchers  
at the National Cancer Institute say differences in the inherited 
pattern of what are called HLA Class I genes appear to determine 
who gets sickest soonest after an HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, based on a genetic analysis of 500 HIV patients,  
has no immediate medical application, but it increases 
understanding of how the virus attacks the body, said Mary 
Carrington, lead author of the study. That knowledge could lead to 
better drugs or vaccines against the virus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrington said there are three different HLA Class I genes,  
identified as A, B and C. People inherit two copies of each of the 
genes. This means they can have as many as six unique combinations 
or as few as three. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more different forms of this gene a person has, the more  
resistant that individual is to progression of the disease,'' said 
Carrington. 
</P>
<P>
	An HIV infection in people with non-matching HLA Class I gene  
pairs, for instance, may not progress to AIDS for six to 12 years, 
the researchers found. Those who inherited matched pairs of the 
genes tend to develop AIDS in three years or less. 
</P>
<P>
	HLA Class I genes are part of the immune system. Their job is to  
identify cells that are infected with virus and to leave a signal 
molecule on the surface of the infected cell. Another part of the 
immune system, the cytotoxic T-cell, will kill cells marked by the 
signal molecule, thereby blocking the spread of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The HIV virus is constantly changing and eventually will find a  
form that is not recognized by any of the HLA Class I genes, 
Carrington said. If an individual has a variety of HLA genes, it 
takes longer for the HIV to develop changes not recognized by the 
immune system. For this reason, she said, a person with a variety 
of gene forms will avoid AIDS longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrington said about 40 percent of the people examined in the  
study had a gene pattern that gave a slow disease progress, while 
about 45 percent had a gene combination that led to rapid 
progression. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three HLA genes has many alleles, or forms, that  
differ only slightly from each other. For instance, there are about 
200 different forms of the HLA-B gene, Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that people with paired copies of two of  
the gene forms, identified as B35 and Cw04, tended to progress to 
AIDS most rapidly.

	Carrington said 8 percent to 9 percent of the tested patients  
had the B35 form. About 10 percent of the white patients had the 
Cw04 form, she said, but it was present in about 25 percent of the 
black patients.

<HEADLINE> Caves Checked in Sightseers Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PORTAL, Calif. (AP) -- With its rich mining history, this  
rugged Sierra Nevada outpost has been a giant maze for 
investigators trying to hunt down clues to the disappearance of 
three sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the deep canyons, steep mountains, thorny hillsides  
and a labyrinth of waterways, there are caves, old railroad tunnels 
and abandoned mine shafts as deep as 2,000 feet to inspect. 
</P>
<P>
	As if the mystery wasn't already puzzling enough.  
</P>
<P>
	James M. Maddock, California's top FBI agent, on Friday said the  
bureau has ``put out the call for any kind of equipment that could 
help'' in the search for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock waved off a specific question about whether infrared  
equipment was being used. He said he would elaborate on search 
methods late next week. Agents have been venturing into the search 
area on all-terrain vehicles, in search of disturbed ground or 
evidence linked the sightseers' rental car, which also is missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 42, of Eureka, her 15-year-old daughter Julie, and  
Silvina Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend from Cordoba, 
Argentina, disappeared Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI believes they met violent deaths soon after they were  
seen leaving the restaurant next to the Cedar Lodge, where they had 
been staying during their trip to Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the areas that has been under the FBI's microscope is the  
steep mountain behind the lodge, terrain that is inaccessible by 
car and covered with thick brush and poison oak. 
</P>
<P>
	Other focuses of the search include railroad corridors and old  
mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this century, prospectors searched for gold and barium -- a  
mineral essential to drilling oil wells. Most of the mines were 
abandoned after the closure of the railroad that cut through the 
hills from Merced, hauling timber and other resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the residents of the town of 635 now work for the  
National Park Service. The last mine was closed down in the 1940s. 
Locals say some are filled with water. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 agents have probed hundreds of tips, but the only  
definitive evidence made public so far is Mrs. Sund's black leather 
billfold, found Feb. 19 on a street in Modesto, a good two-hour 
drive down winding, narrow roads from El Portal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund is a member of the prominent Carrington family, which  
made millions in Northern California real estate and now mostly 
lives in Eureka. The family has offered $300,000 for information. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of all the victims have been staying in Modesto to  
follow the latest developments, and are holding out for a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we don't know (what happened) we have to believe  
that there is a possibility that they're being held somwhere, 
somehow, and that we will get them back,'' said Carol Carrington, 
the mother of Mrs. Sund. ``I won't quit until we know what 
happened, where they are.''

<HEADLINE> Starr, McDougal in Uphill Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Juggling a criminal case and damaging  
revelations about his own office, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
is fighting an uphill battle: The prosecutor has put President 
Clinton's former business partner on trial, but it is Starr's own 
office that is getting much of the scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's trial  
here, Charles Bakaly, who became Starr's spokesman last spring 
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, abruptly resigned 
Thursday. His resignation came after Starr asked the Justice 
Department to investigate Bakaly in connection with a news leak -- a 
front-page story in The New York Times that said Starr had 
concluded the president could legally be indicted while still in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 31 article came amid a federal judge's probe -- pushed  
along by Clinton's legal team -- into possible leaks by Starr's 
office and a separate Justice Department inquiry into Starr's 
handling of the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly had gone on TV the day after the Times story appeared,  
declaring the ``information did not come from our office. ... We 
did not leak this information. ... We do not leak grand jury 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's referral to Justice came after his office conducted its  
own inquiry, according to a source familiar with the situation. The 
inquiry indicated Bakaly may have had some involvement in the leak, 
but he denied wrongdoing, said the source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., today called the situation ``really  
astounding,'' adding that it will play a part in the debate over 
whether and how to renew the independent counsel statute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's to Judge Starr's credit,'' commented Sen. Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah. ``I think it shows that he's going to do what's 
right, regardless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly has hired his own lawyer, former FBI general counsel  
Howard Shapiro, who says he is confident Bakaly will be found to 
have violated no statute, regulation or court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said Thursday he accepted Bakaly's resignation with  
``regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, Starr's prosecutors have laid out evidence  
that links a $27,600 Whitewater loan in Clinton's name to a 
fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal. The link comes through a 
series of financial transactions involving the savings and loan 
Mrs. McDougal owned with her husband, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	On trial for refusing to answer questions of Starr's office on  
whether Clinton knew about the transactions, Mrs. McDougal is 
trying to shift attention to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, sought to show that Starr had rushed  
to the aid of her ex-husband while she was allowed to ``languish'' 
in jail. Jim McDougal cooperated with Starr's probe. Mrs. McDougal 
didn't. Now she's on trial for criminal contempt and obstructing 
Starr's investigation of the 1980s Whitewater land venture formed 
by the McDougals, Clinton and his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering from more than a decade of bad health, Jim McDougal  
died last year, but it was his information that led to Mrs. 
McDougal being put on trial. Jim McDougal tipped off Starr to the 
Clinton loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Hickman Ewing said the more Geragos mentions  
prosecutors, the more likely it is Ewing will load up the witness 
list with his own prosecutors to rebut Geragos' accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	When the trial resumes Monday, former prosecutor Amy St. Eve  
will testify, Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said Starr's office had passed up numerous opportunities  
to question Mrs. Clinton and former Whitewater real estate agent 
Chris Wade about the financial dealings tying the Clinton loan to 
the $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	And Geragos tried to suggest that Starr was relying on perjured  
testimony from Jim McDougal, referring to McDougal's testimonial 
``flip-flop'' in which he denied under oath at his own trial that 
Clinton attended a meeting where the $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 
was discussed. Convicted of 18 felonies, McDougal later told 
Starr's investigators that Clinton had arrived as the meeting was 
breaking up and had asked about the $300,000 loan.

<HEADLINE> Saint Louis Wants To Talk to Bliss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Saint Louis University has asked permission to  
talk to New Mexico coach Dave Bliss about its opening for a men's 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss, in Denver for the NCAA West Regional, would not say  
whether he would oblige Saint Louis, a member of Conference USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even talk about that. We'll wait until the end of the  
season. I'm just trying to keep the job I have. We're just coaching 
basketball,'' Bliss said Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint Louis is searching for a replacement for Charlie  
Spoonhour, who announced his retirement a week ago. Spoonhour, 59, 
had a 122-90 record in seven seasons with the Billikens. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico athletic director Rudy Davalos, in New Orleans  
representing the NCAA Selection Committee at the Midwest Regional, 
said he did not think Bliss would be interested in going to Saint 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at Saint Louis like a lot of guys look at Saint  
Louis,'' Davalos said. ``It's not that good a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss said last August that he had agreed to a contract  
extension that would keep him at New Mexico through the 2004-05 
season. It was not known whether he has signed the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint Louis, under then-coach Rich Grawer, eliminated the Lobos  
from the NIT in 1989 and 1990, Bliss' first two seasons at New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss knows people in the Saint Louis administration and also is  
friendly with Spoonhour, Davalos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say Saint Louis can put money on you, but so what?''  
Davalos said. ``Texas A&AMP;M (which spoke to Bliss last season) could 
have put money on him. And you don't think there's pressure on 
Saint Louis? That's their whole deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davalos acknowledged that Bliss might be weary of the criticism  
a Lobos basketball coach gets on an almost daily basis during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	This year has been particularly difficult, what with the loss of  
point guard Dontay Hicks to a heart condition, the nationwide 
panning of the Lobos' schedule, a pair of mammoth losses to Western 
Athletic Conference rival Utah, plus the loss of star center Kenny 
Thomas to suspension early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all get to the point where you get tired of it,'' Davalos  
said. ``When it happens, you're bitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after Thursday's first-round victory over Missouri in  
Denver, no matter what happens Saturday against Connecticut, 
``we'll go home and look at it as a good year,'' Davalos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools with vacant coaching jobs include San Diego State,  
Notre Dame, Vanderbilt and Baylor. Saint Louis is the only school 
to seek his permission to speak with Bliss, Davalos said.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Bonus Up As Work Force Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- The annual wage bonus at Eastman Kodak  
Co. bounced back up to $108 million Friday after plunging last year 
to its lowest level since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The key? Big layoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	The late-winter dividend for 32,000 U.S. employees and  
ex-employees amounted to an average bonus of $3,375 a person, 
compared to $1,015 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The photography company's founder, George Eastman, launched an  
``extra pay for extra good work'' dividend in 1912. The $40.2 
million payout in March 1998, driven down by weak profits, was the 
lowest since 1934, when no bonus was awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's cutthroat rivalry with Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co.  
intensified in 1997 when Fuji slashed film prices in the United 
States. Losing market share on its home turf, Kodak launched a plan 
to cut 20 percent of its 100,500-strong payroll through the end of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the 19,900 employees being targeted  
worldwide have been laid off so far, so several thousand 
ex-employees shared in the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak had 46,300 workers in the United States at the end of  
1998, down from 54,800 a year earlier. Those who work for Kodak 
subsidiaries don't qualify for the payout. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest bonus is ``a sign that we saw some significantly  
improved financial performance in 1998,'' said spokesman Paul 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak cut out $730 million in expenses last year and boosted its  
year-end profits -- excluding one-time charges -- to $1.43 billion 
from $1.15 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Kodak guaranteed workers an annual bonus no lower  
than 5 percent of their base pay, but also no higher than 15 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no longer any guarantees. In 1996, Kodak began linking  
the bonus more closely to the company's performance -- its return on 
net assets. The formula was refigured once again this year to 
couple the bonus to a financial measure known as ``economic value 
added.''

<HEADLINE> Creighton Blends In With Big Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- It's easy to spot the outsider. Just don't  
try to tell Creighton it can't hang with schools with the 
basketball traditions of Indiana, Maryland and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bluejays are 9-1 against teams that made the NCAA tournament  
field and looking to build on that success in the South Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't know too much about us,'' leading scorer Rodney  
Buford said Friday, ``but we feel we're going to be something 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana, Maryland and St. John's are top 25 teams that have had  
nationally recognized programs for decades. But as North Carolina, 
UCLA and Louisville have already discovered, a familiar name 
doesn't guarantee victory in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure history is for everyone,'' Indiana coach Bob  
Knight said. ``I'm not sure it makes a lot of difference to the 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every year unheralded teams build reputations by knocking off  
higher seeds in the early rounds. Creighton, a 10th seed, beat 
Louisville in its first game and will face second-seeded Maryland 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The other second-round matchup at Orlando Arena features No. 3  
seed St. John's against No. 6 Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to play better than we have all season if  
we're going to have a chance,'' said Creighton coach Dana Altman, 
adding that another key will be the Bluejays' ability to refocus 
after beating Louisville 62-58. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big win for us, but that's behind us,'' he said. ``We  
need to forget about it. But that can be tough to do when you 
haven't been in this situation before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's victory was Creighton's first in the tournament since  
1991 and just the second in the last 25 years, which explains why a 
lot of people don't know who the Bluejays are. 
</P>
<P>
	Altman was growing up in Nebraska at a time when Eddie Sutton  
was leading the Omaha school to the NCAAs and knows it'll take more 
than one upset to keep the Bluejays in the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize we've had a drought and we have to make a name for  
ourselves again,'' Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland began the tournament with a 22-point blowout of  
Valparaiso. Coach Gary Williams anticipates a much tougher game 
against Creighton, which overcame a 13-point, second-half deficit 
to beat Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Louisville is a name when we go into the NCAA  
tournament that obviously gets everyone's attention, so I guess a 
lot of people are surprised that we're playing Creighton,'' 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when you look at the game (Thursday) and you watch how  
they played in terms of their intensity and in terms of their 
willingness to just hang in there when things weren't going their 
way, you can see why they're where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's 108 points in the opening round against George  
Washington were the most the Hoosiers have scored in a NCAA 
tournament game. But the number that caught Knight's attention was 
the 57 his team allowed in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing against St. John's that way will allow us to do one  
thing -- get beat,'' the Indiana coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's opened with a 26-point victory over Samford to  
advance to the second round for the first time since 1993. The Red 
Storm are excited about challenge posed by Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second meeting between the schools in the NCAA  
tournament and sixth overall. Indiana leads the series 4-1, 
including a 20-point tournament victory en route to a national 
championship in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play Indiana, you are playing against a system. And  
coach Knight is the master of that system,'' St. John's coach Mike 
Jarvis said, adding that his players won't be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing bothers these kids. They traveled with their AAU teams  
and are used to playing against the best. They are also used to 
playing in big arenas. If they don't win, it is not because they 
don't think they can.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Microsoft To Reorganize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., which is battling federal  
antitrust charges, plans to announce its long-awaited restructuring 
next week, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the company's plan to divide its operations  
into four groups is not thought to be related to its court case. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest maker of personal computer software is on  
trial in Washington, D.C., and could be ordered to make additional 
changes if it loses that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Microsoft announced late Thursday that it would  
defer about $400 million in revenue from its third to its fourth 
quarters. Microsoft said it will still meet Wall Street's 
third-quarter earnings estimate of 65 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is offering coupons to customers who purchase its  
Office 97 entitling them to a free upgrade to the new version of 
the software, Office 2000, which is expected to come to market in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, said  
Microsoft will not recognize the value of the coupons until the new 
product ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Microsoft's restructuring plan was driven by  
president Steve Ballmer's desire to organize the company around 
customer needs rather than around particular product lines and 
engineering efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer has been overseeing the Interactive Media Group, which  
includes Microsoft Network and may be renamed the consumer 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will temporarily divide responsibilities for the  
consumer unit between Jon DeVaan, who has overseen development of 
Microsoft Office, the suite of software applications that includes 
Word and Excel; and Brad Chase, a top marketing manager who 
masterminded the launch of Windows 95 and Internet Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another division will be aimed at software developers, the  
newspaper said, and will be headed by Paul Maritz, who has overseen 
nearly all software development at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said a third unit will be aimed at selling products  
to corporate chief information officers, while an applications 
group will become a new unit targeted at ``knowledge workers'' 
including analysts, administrators, writers and researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In settling on the reorganization plan, people familiar with the  
matter told the Journal that Ballmer rejected more far-reaching 
initiatives, including a proposal to spin off Microsoft Network 
into a separate company.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Coach Denies Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The woman whose allegations of academic fraud  
rocked Minnesota's basketball program says she was told her $3,000 
payment for unapproved tutoring came from coach Clem Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the university's  
academic counseling unit, initially told the Saint Paul Pioneer 
Press that Haskins gave her the money. But in interviews with the 
Pioneer Press and WCCO-TV, Gangelhoff clarified that the money came 
through an intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came from (Haskins). He didn't hand it to me, but it came  
from him,'' she told the Pioneer Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff declined to identify the person she said paid her,  
except to say it was ``another basketball program staff member that 
I trusted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has denied paying Gangelhoff for tutoring and has denied  
knowledge of any academic cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours before the start of Minnesota's first-round game in  
the NCAA tournament Thursday, university president Mark Yudof 
announced that starters Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver, along with 
reserves Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford, were ineligible 
pending the outcome of an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Gophers were eliminated when they lost 75-63 to  
Gonzaga, but Haskins said he wholeheartedly agreed with Yudof's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a second former university employee came forward  
Thursday with an allegation of academic impropriety at the school. 
Rick Marsden, a former academic counselor for the team, told the 
Pioneer Press that Haskins asked him in 1986 to do course work for 
a player. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsden, who is gay, is suing the school for sexual harassment.  
The allegation is in an affidavit filed Jan. 6 in his lawsuit, 
though it does not identify the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was him,'' Marsden said. ``He asked me to write a paper for  
(the player) and I told him I absolutely would not. He swore at me; 
I swore at him and then I told my boss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins declined comment on the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	Marsden said doctors determined he was mentally unable to work  
in men's athletics after he suffered what he called a mental 
breakdown last fall. His request to be transferred to another 
department was denied and he has been on unpaid leave since Dec. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff first told her story to the Pioneer Press in a story  
Wednesday, saying she had done course work for at least 20 players 
in the basketball program, including four on the current squad. She 
said she wrote papers, helped with take-home exams and did other 
course work for players between 1993 and 1998. Four former players 
confirmed Gangelhoff did work for them. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, she said Haskins gave her $3,000 for  
tutoring Broxsie. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff's boss, Elayne Donahue, had denied a request to allow  
Gangelhoff to tutor Broxsie last spring. Donahue, the retired head 
of the academic counseling unit, said she had warned athletic 
department administrators that Gangelhoff was tutoring players in 
violation of department policy. She said her warning was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff told WCCO her role evolved from tutor to actually  
doing the players' assignments because it was easier and faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids didn't ask me either,'' Gangelhoff said. ``That was a  
decision I made on my own. Basically because of time constraints, 
it was just easier for me to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins saw the investigation as just another test in his life.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the type of thing that just tests your courage. It  
tests you as a Christian. It tests you as a man,'' Haskins said.

<HEADLINE> States Back Hemp Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's high time for hemp, say farmers who are  
enlisting state legislatures in an effort to legalize cultivation 
of the potentially profitable non-hallucinogenic cousin of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana and Virginia have formally called for an end to a  
federal ban on ``industrial'' hemp, and the Minnesota Senate this 
week passed a bill, backed by Gov. Jesse Ventura, aimed at 
permitting experimental hemp production. The Hawaii House this week 
voted to have the state grow a 10-acre test crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp is now grown in more than 20 countries for a variety of  
products, including cosmetics, beer, plastics and paper. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire, North Dakota and Tennessee also are actively  
considering pro-hemp legislation, while lawmakers in New Mexico 
recently funded hemp research, according to Agri-Tech 
Communications Inc., which tracks the agricultural fiber business. 
</P>
<P>
	Former CIA Director James Woolsey was recently hired by the  
North American Industrial Hemp Council to lobby for repeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the federal government relents, our state efforts aren't  
going to do much,'' said David Monson, a North Dakota legislator 
who wants to grow hemp on his grain farm near the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp was perhaps the first plant farmed for fiber -- George  
Washington once grew it -- but it was a victim of the U.S. 
government's move to end marijuana production in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada started allowing hemp production last year. Farmers  
planted 6,000 acres of the weed, claiming profits of as much as 
$200 an acre, this at a time when growers struggle just to break 
even on traditional crops like wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration and Justice Department were  
petitioned a year ago to go repeal the DEA's ban on hemp. 
</P>
<P>
	But the DEA and the White House's Office of National Drug  
Control Policy have said that permitting hemp farming would send 
the wrong signal to young people. They also worry that marijuana 
farmers could hide their crops with industrial hemp plants. Police 
rely on aerial imagery to detect marijuana fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seedlings are the same and in many instances the mature  
plants look the same,'' the Office of National Drug Control Policy 
says in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all the more reason to permit industrial hemp, according  
to pro-hemp forces. Hemp's tendency to cross-pollinate would make 
it risky to cultivate marijuana nearby, because that might hurt the 
potency of the marijuana crop, agronomists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be really, really stupid to hide marijuana in an  
industrial hemp field,'' Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police counter that cross-pollination could produce hemp with a  
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Marijuana normally contains 3 percent to 15 percent or more of  
THC, the psychoactive ingredient, while hemp has 1 percent or less. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also disagreement about hemp's commercial potential.  
</P>
<P>
	USDA researchers concluded that it was a ``novelty product for a  
novelty market.'' But a University of Kentucky study last year 
estimated hemp could bring farmers anywhere from $220 to $600 an 
acre, depending on whether it was grown for its fiber or its seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota State University researchers said hemp could be a  
useful rotation crop for wheat and potato farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Industrial hemp should be considered an alternative crop,''  
said Roger Moe, the Democratic majority leader in Minnesota's state 
Senate. ``It's certainly not going to replace the mainstays of 
agriculture.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Exonerates UCLA in Bet Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An FBI probe into an alleged mobster's links  
to several UCLA football players failed to uncover any evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI has told me we have nothing to be concerned about ...  
that it has no concerns regarding the conduct of UCLA or any of its 
student athletes,'' athletic director Peter Dalis said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy McNally, FBI assistant director in Los Angeles, said  
late Thursday the investigation was complete and there was no 
evidence of wrongdoing by any members of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI expects to complete its investigation today after  
conducting one more interview, Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a player,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The agency began a sports-betting probe after the Bruins lost to  
Miami and Wisconsin in their final two games of the season. Before 
that, they were unbeaten, clinched the Pacific-10 Conference title 
and were contending for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's probe was launched after some UCLA players were seen  
with Dominic Montemarano, a 60-year-old ex-convict also known as 
``Donny Shacks'' who was sent to prison in 1987 on federal 
racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding he may have been under their regular  
surveillance,'' Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Ray Escudero told the Long Beach Press Telegram  
the players were seen ``hanging around a Mafia type.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a university involved and high profile  
players involved, you have to look into it. ... Allegations were 
made. In this particular instance, there was nothing to corroborate 
it,'' Escudero said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, based in Overland Park, Kan., said the investigation  
had nothing to do with point shaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're comfortable that that is not the issue. The issue is  
more who they have associated with. There's no point shaving,'' 
said Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of gambling and agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the key thing is there was nothing found, nothing  
illegal. Nothing has happened that is wrong here,'' UCLA football 
coach Bob Toledo said. ``They associated with a guy the FBI's 
concerned with, but they did nothing wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has photographs of four or five UCLA players socializing  
with the target of the investigation, Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding was they had attended some social events into  
his home for `Monday Night Football' on several occasions. My 
understanding is they had no understanding of this guy's 
background,'' Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	All-American quarterback Cade McNown was one of the players  
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown said in a statement that he voluntarily underwent a  
polygraph test, passed it and was told ``there would be no further 
inquiry necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, expected to be a first-round selection in next month's  
NFL draft, left the university after the Rose Bowl to focus on 
preparing for his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo said he hasn't talked to McNown since taking him to the  
FBI office on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cade McNown is a squeaky-clean kid. Cade McNown is a fierce  
competitor, as good a kid as you'd ever meet,'' the coach said. ``I 
think they probably met this guy, someone introduced them, they 
thought he was a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've hung around with some older people too.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News in New York reported Thursday that McNown was  
escorted around New York by Montemarano during the weekend of the 
Heisman Trophy presentation on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins won their first 10 games to give them a 20-game  
losing streak dating back to the previous season before losing at 
Miami 49-45 on Dec. 5. UCLA then lost to Wisconsin 38-31 in the 
Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports of a federal points shaving probe hit the UCLA  
campus like a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a farce,'' UCLA linebacker Ali Abdul-Aziz said. ``We  
would never do that to ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Records show Montemarano has a home in Century City, but there  
was no telephone listing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This person is not a representative of our interests, has  
never been left tickets,'' Dalis said.

<HEADLINE> Two Escaped Juveniles Captured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Authorities searched overnight for three  
teen-age boys who escaped from a psychiatric hospital. Two others 
were captured just outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The five fled through a door of their housing unit at the Middle  
Tennessee Mental Health Institute on Thursday afternoon, 
Superintendent Joseph Carobene said. Staff members chased them and 
caught two. 
</P>
<P>
	The three still at large, age 15, 16 and 17, ``are very  
dangerous,'' Nashville police spokesman Don Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe the escape was planned because the boys were  
wearing warm clothing. They also believe they may have gotten a 
key. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing three face charges including assault, robbery and  
handgun possession. One is charged with attempted homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital is located just off Interstate 40 on the east side  
of Nashville.

	ALCOA, Tenn. (AP) -- Some fourth-graders just complain about  
their lunchroom food. Ryan Rose got a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed up with pinto beans, cornbread and salad, 10-year-old Ryan  
hired Monte Walton to fight for better fare on the Alcoa Elementary 
School menu. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me and my friends got mad because there was not anything to  
eat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton, a lawyer in Knoxville, employs Ryan's mother as a  
paralegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him for the magnanimous sum of $1, I would represent  
him,'' Walton said. ``I had a lot of respect for him and his 
classmates to call me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton drew up a petition, and Ryan is collecting signatures.  
</P>
<P>
	Walton said his client is protesting a 50-cent price increase,  
week-old leftovers, cold food that should be hot, and a lack of 
``good stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll see if we can't resolve it amicably,'' possibly  
by adding hamburgers occasionally to the menu, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester Brown, director of the Alcoa school system, said with a  
laugh that he would ``wait and see what their complaint is about.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Denies Passing Over Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno denied a GOP  
senator's suggestion Friday that a federal prosecutor was passed 
over for promotion because he disagreed with her on the Justice 
Department's campaign fund-raising inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Arlen Specter,  
R-Pa., told Reno that her plan to replace Charles LaBella, the 
interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, 
created the ``possible inference'' that LaBella was passed over as 
a punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inference is plain wrong,'' Reno replied. ``Chuck  
LaBella's disagreement with me had nothing to do with who the U.S. 
attorney is for the Southern District of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella headed the Justice Department's campaign-finance task  
force until he left in July to become acting U.S. attorney in San 
Diego. He said he resigned last month after being told by Deputy 
Attorney General Eric Holder that the department would ask San 
Diego federal judges to replace him with Gregory Vega, a 
subordinate federal prosecutor recommended by Democratic Sen. 
Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter has said Reno's move ``has all the indications of  
retribution'' for LaBella's recommendation last July that an 
independent counsel investigate allegations of abuses, chiefly by 
Democrats, in fund raising for the 1996 elections. Reno has 
repeatedly refused to appoint an independent counsel for that 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I left I didn't even get a 'thank-you for your  
services,''' LaBella told the San Diego Union-Tribune last month. 
``I think that crystallizes just how out of favor I was with the 
Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno told Specter that LaBella served the department ``with  
distinction,'' and she pointed out that senators recommend 
nominations to the president. The attorney general does give the 
White House final approval for candidates before the president 
sends the nominations to the Senate for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody should have an expectation of being U.S. attorney,''  
Reno said. ``I don't think anybody should anticipate that they're 
going to be 'it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange came during the Senate committee's review of the  
department's budget requests, the third such congressional session 
Reno has attended this week. During the sessions, she has come 
under heavy criticism from Republicans for the department's 
problems handling immigration and border patrol issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on both the Senate panel and the House subcommittee  
that oversees the department's budget took particular issue with 
the fact that Reno has not requested money for more border patrol 
agents next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not negligence, it was not sloppiness, it was not  
malice or evilness or badness or dumbness'' that led her to hold up 
a request for more money, Reno told the House panel on Thursday. 
Rather, she said, the force is suffering from a flood of 
inexperienced border patrol agents and wants to wait until they are 
properly trained before hiring new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on both panels also criticized Reno for proposing to  
cut millions of dollars in local grants for juvenile crime and 
other initiatives while supporting ``questionable social 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One could argue that the Clinton administration is trying to  
disguise social service programs as law enforcement initiatives,'' 
said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said that since violent juvenile crime is down, the Justice  
Department wants state and local governments to take greater 
responsibility for meeting their own needs in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service, said Harold Rogers,  
R-Ky., has failed to correct caseload, detention and other problems 
despite receiving increases in federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems every year we are called upon to bail out some  
massive mistake that the INS has done, in spite of the fact that 
you have told us ... that you are going to personally oversee the 
problems at the INS,'' Rogers told Reno during a hearing Thursday 
before his House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice State and the 
Judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said officials at the INS, one of the government's fastest  
growing agencies, ``have done a job that indicates that they can 
solve problems, just not fast enough.''

<HEADLINE> Virtues of Vitamin A Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Nils Daulaire dug $200 out of his own  
pocket to buy vitamin A capsules and passed them out to 
malnourished children in villages in Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a test: He wanted to see if a groundbreaking study by  
Johns Hopkins University was correct in predicting that a little 
vitamin A could cut child mortality in developing countries by 30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later, he had his answer: It did. ``Just that one  
dose,'' Daulaire recalled. ``It just blew my socks off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daulaire is thinking a little bigger these days. Now president  
of the Global Health Council, he knows it'll take more than 
researchers, cash-strapped charities or even governments digging 
into their own pockets to make a dent in international health 
problems, like the 250 million vitamin A-deficient children. 
</P>
<P>
	His Washington-based organization of public health specialists  
is pushing for help from the deeper pockets of corporations -- and 
the private sector is listening. Next Tuesday, in a luncheon 
ceremony hosted by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, about 15 
major food companies are expected to sign onto a U.S. campaign to 
fortify foods in developing countries with vitamin A. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agency for International Development and charities like  
UNICEF already hand out vitamin capsules to malnourished children. 
But it's hard to get yearly supplements to the world's poorest or 
strife-ridden countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding vitamin A to everyday foods -- like it's added to the  
breakfast cereals Americans eat -- could have a much larger impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a win-win situation,'' said USAID Deputy Administrator  
Harriet Babbitt. ``They can feel good about the products they sell 
... and know they're doing some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massive corporate partnerships in international health care are  
a rare but growing movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck &AMP; Co. is donating a powerful drug called ivermectin to a  
World Health Organization program to fight river blindness, a 
parasite that infects about 18 million people, mostly in Africa and 
Latin America. Treatment requires a once-a-year dose for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer Inc. is donating $60 million worth of its antibiotic  
Zithromax to battle trachoma, a painful infection that has blinded 
6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont donates the water-filtering cloth that has helped greatly  
diminish Guinea worm in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daulaire thinks rather than straight donations, corporations  
can better enhance health care long-term if the program also 
enhances their profits. After all, USAID's vitamin A pilot program 
found sugar company Tate &AMP; Lyle's sales increased 15 percent after 
it fortified Zambian sugar with vitamin A -- giving people an extra 
reason to buy a product that now was better for them, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Global Health Council just hired an American Home Products  
senior executive to push more corporate programs like USAID's 
vitamin campaign, which took six years to plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Why are companies important? Businesses with a long history in a  
country can go to foreign leaders and push for changes that U.S. 
health workers can't, said Duff Gillespie, who heads USAID's 
vitamin program. ``They do open doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, introducing healthy products is more than just one-time  
aid. That was the same idea behind Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill 
Gates' $100 million immunization donation last December -- the money 
wasn't for a one-time vaccine purchase, but to set up programs that 
push immunization in developing countries over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the first beneficiaries of USAID's new program is Kosovo.  
All cooking oil shipped as part of U.S. humanitarian relief 
packages now must be fortified with vitamin A, Babbitt said. The 
first shipment, fortified by Cargill Inc., heads to Kosovo by 
month's end, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next on the list: USAID is negotiating with Uganda to add  
vitamin A to that country's sugar. A health committee in South 
Africa is investigating adding the nutrient to a grain that 
virtually all South Africans eat in either porridge or bread, 
Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines is considering wheat fortification, Babbitt  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much easier if we can get these things worked into flour  
and sugar, and used in the normal foods in the countries, rather 
than distributing supplements,'' said Dan Wright of BASF Corp., 
which will provide bulk vitamin A to the campaign.

	HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) -- Olympic champion Gianni Romme of  
the Netherlands signaled his return to the top of world 
speedskating by retaining his 5,000-meter world title Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was timed in 6 minutes, 29.39 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Catriona Lemay-Doan, the favorite, won the women's  
500-meter gold medal with times of 38.48 and 38.39 in the two-race 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann won the 3,000 at 4:04.88,  
with Tonny de Jong of the Netherlands and Claudia Pechstein of 
Germany tying for the silver at 4:07.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemay-Doan owed her win to an error by Russia's Svetlana  
Zhurova, who led after a track record 38.04 in the first run, but 
touched the ice with a hand in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhurova recovered to take the silver, ahead of Japan's Tomomi  
Okazaki and Dutchwoman Marianne Timmer, who tied for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Romme's time was a Thialf indoor ice stadium record and capped a  
comeback after a disastrous season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure was already off because I had started to skate  
well again,'' Romme said. ``It wasn't a super race but enough to 
win today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final heat in the 5,000 was a battle between Belgian Bart  
Veldkamp and Dutchman Bob de Jong. Veldkamp got the silver at 
6:29.75, with De Jong third at 6:29.88.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Sues Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Motorola filed a lawsuit against rival  
computer chipmaker Intel Corp. on Thursday, claiming Intel and a 
top manager targeted Motorola workers for employment in order to 
obtain trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., claims chip designer Mark  
McDermott and 15 other Motorola employees hired on by Intel since 
September to work at a new chip design center in Austin have 
sensitive information about Motorola's chip technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Thursday sought an injunction to prevent Intel,  
based in Santa Clara, Calif., from placing such workers in jobs 
where they could reveal that information. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became obvious that our intellectual property and knowledge  
was significantly at risk here,'' said Billy Edwards, Motorola 
corporate vice president and director of strategic management and 
planning. ``We don't want them to place these former employees in a 
position where they will disclose our trade secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, McDermott, who is also named as a  
defendant, is using his ``intimate knowledge'' of Motorola's Austin 
center to target key engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said his company had not yet seen  
the lawsuit and therefore could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola officials said its standard employee agreement requires  
workers to protect company trade secrets, even after they leave the 
company. However, the company said it did not ask McDermott or 
other employees to sign a ``noncompete'' agreement, which would 
have barred them from working for a competitor.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Town Too Nice for Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- People in western Maryland are apparently  
too nice to be telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unitel Corp., which helps businesses sell things over the  
telephone, said Friday it is moving about 100 jobs from this small 
town to Florida in hopes of finding more aggressive salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
	``The culture and the climate in western Maryland is one of  
helping your neighbor and being empathetic and those sorts of 
things,'' Unitel vice president Ken Carmichael said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frostburg, about 150 miles west of Baltimore, is a town of 8,100  
in sparsely populated Allegany County where thousands of 
manufacturing and coal mining jobs have disappeared over the years. 
Telemarketing has been a new source of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the friendly nature of the townsfolk is getting in the way.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you get someone that's busy or whatever, you have to try to  
make your sale,'' Unitel worker Gay Winterstine said. ``Sometimes 
that's hard, like if you can hear a child crying in the background 
and you still have to try to overcome and make your sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor John Bambacus is not too displeased.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would rather be nice than aggressive,'' he said.  
``Frostburg is not the Bronx. We pride ourselves on being a very 
neighborly community.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Membership Reaches 19 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) -- The first new entrants into NATO since  
the end of the Cold War have swelled the alliance's ranks to 19 -- 
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says more may be on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO enlargement is not an event but a process,'' Albright  
said Friday after the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland -- all 
members of the now-defunct Soviet-led Warsaw Pact -- joined the 
alliance at a ceremony at the Harry S. Truman Library. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when new entrants will be invited is not clear. That issue  
will be discussed at a NATO summit next month in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopefuls waiting in the wings for the next round of enlargement  
are Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia and 
Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our common purpose, over time, to do for Europe's east  
what NATO has already helped to do for Europe's west,'' Albright 
said. ``Steadily and systematically, we will continue erasing -- 
without replacing -- the line drawn in Europe by Stalin's bloody 
boot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, President Clinton welcomed the three new  
members, saying their presence in the organization ``will make 
America safer. It will make NATO stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For years they struggled with dignity and courage to regain  
their freedom. And now they will help us defend it for many years 
to come,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Albright at Friday's induction ceremony were foreign  
ministers Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic, Janos Martonyi of 
Hungary and Bronislaw Geremek of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Truman's library was chosen as the site for the event because it  
was during his presidency that the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization was founded on April 4, 1949, just under 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing the new applicants for membership, the allies  
examine criteria such as democratic development and whether they 
meet minimum military requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighed is whether American and European security interests  
would be served. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics such as Michael Mandelbaum of the Johns Hopkins School  
of Advanced International Studies contend that NATO expansion risks 
alienating Russia and could preclude closer ties with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called NATO's  
eastward push ``a movement in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin was among a number of non-NATO  
heads of state who were invited to the April summit in Washington, 
but his spokesman said Yeltsin probably will skip the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian leaders from across the political spectrum are wary of  
the idea of a powerful military alliance coming increasingly close 
to Russia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has said that even Russian membership  
in NATO should not automatically be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	But the three Eastern European foreign ministers, asked about  
that possibility while en route here aboard Albright's plane, 
remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long pause, Hungary's Martonyi said, ``Silence is your  
answer.''

<HEADLINE> Night Slalom Called Off in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY STEPHEN WADE   	
</P>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Women ski racers, complaining the  
conditions were too dangerous, threatened to go on strike, forcing 
organizers to call off Friday's World Cup Finals slalom race. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, meeting with skiing's governing body, were told the  
race would not be rescheduled, meaning Sabine Egger of Austria, who 
entered as the overall point leader, will win the season title. 
</P>
<P>
	The first leg of the race was run despite gusting winds, large  
pot holes on the course and tethered advertising balloons being 
deflated and blown to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry racers protested about the conditions with Spela Pretnar  
of Slovenia saying, ``We looked like clowns all out there, but it's 
been like that all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so sad,'' added Pretnar, who was almost three seconds off  
the lead after the first run. ``I had the impression they were 
playing with us. All year it's been bad, it's a bad commercial for 
skiing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FIS called off the race as rumors of a strike swept this Spanish  
ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Anja Paerson led after the first run in a time of 51.17  
seconds. The three other skiers with a chance to win the season's 
slalom crown also had the next best times with Egger of Austria in 
second in 51.58, followed by Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden in 51.99, 
and Trine Bakke of Norway in 52.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger entered leading the season standings with 425 points,  
followed by Wiberg (415), Paerson (374) and Bakke (335). The winner 
gets 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The women said they were told that Saturday's men's slalom --  
where Norway's Lasse Kjus could wrap up the overall World Cup 
season title -- might not be run. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a race,'' said Zali Steggall of Australia, the  
world champion in slalom and the 1998 Olympic bronze medalist in 
the discipline. She finished more than five seconds behind the 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should not have been a race,'' she added. ``Why call it a  
World Cup? You're bringing the standard down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She compared the conditions to a ``sausage race in a village,''  
an Alpine tradition where pounds of sausage are given out for 
winners of local races. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like running a 200-meter race and you ask Michael Johnson  
to sprint on the soft sand on the beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be serious,'' she added. ``The FIS doesn't care. It  
just wants to run the race at all costs. They don't care about the 
standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men slalom skiers went on strike here in a World Cup race in  
1993, complaining about the difficult conditions they were expected 
to overcome.

<HEADLINE> Asteroid Hunters Find Supernova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Astronomers canvassing the sky for  
asteroids that could threaten Earth stumbled upon a supernova in a 
galaxy 650 million light-years away, Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The supernova was photographed by NASA's Near Earth Asteroid  
Tracking system on Feb. 18. The images captured the star's 
appearance as it looked just a few weeks after the ancient 
explosion occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were fishing for salmon, and instead we caught a whale,''  
Steven Pravdo, project manager, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The star was unknown to astronomers before the accidental  
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The supernova, named 1999am, was a white dwarf star in orbit  
with a companion star before it exploded. The white dwarf captured 
so much material from the companion that it became too massive to 
support itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion had as much energy as 100 billion suns, and the  
supernova is now nearly as bright as the surrounding galaxy, the 
laboratory said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	Pravdo said the Feb. 18 data was sent to Lawrence Berkeley  
National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., where scientists with the 
Supernova Cosmology Project spotted 1999am. 
</P>
<P>
	The supernova, at a distance of 650 million light years, is  
harmless. A light year is the distance light travels in one year, 
or about 6 trillion miles.

<HEADLINE> Titanic Might Be Hotel-Casino Theme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Plans are afloat for a ship-shaped gambling  
palace to join the array of themed casinos in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials say plans have been submitted for a 1,000-room  
hotel to be built on the site of the Thunderbird Hotel, which is 
owned by Bob Stupak. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Jan Jones said Stupak was planning a presentation to the  
city in about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boat would have 1,000 rooms, or ``cabins,'' 18,000 square  
feet of retail space, 12,000 square feet of conference rooms and 
30,000 square feet for restaurants and a lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	At least $300 million would be spent on the project, the Las  
Vegas Review-Journal reported, quoting unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas resorts have increasingly moved to themed  
environments, from the pyramid-shaped Luxor to pirate battles at 
Treasure Island, canals at the new Venetian resort, surfing at the 
new Mandalay Bay, and New York-New York, which replicates the New 
York City skyline.

<HEADLINE> Multinationals Cite Harmful Tax Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If California-based computer chip giant Intel  
Corp. were founded today, a top executive told Congress he'd 
recommend its headquarters be located in the Cayman Islands to 
escape oppressive U.S. tax rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our tax code competitively disadvantages multinationals simply  
because the parent is a U.S. corporation,'' Intel vice president 
Robert H. Perlman told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlman was joined by executives from three other multinational  
companies in urging that Congress overhaul a tax code they say puts 
them at a disadvantage with many foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to maintain our philosophy of 'build it here and  
sell it there,' we need a modern tax policy that is consistent with 
our global focus,'' said Robin Beran, assistant treasurer at 
Peoria, Ill.-based heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Others testifying in favor of numerous tax code changes were  
officials with newly merged automaker DaimlerChrysler Corp. and 
Swiss-based engineering company ABB Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	One key problem, Perlman said, is that Intel's foreign  
operations in certain countries will lose 35 cents on the dollar to 
U.S. taxes -- money that could be spent on critical research -- while 
a Japanese competitor keeps the entire dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out who's going  
to win that battle,'' Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the areas targeted for improvement were the complexity of  
the U.S. code, the need to treat the 15-country European Union as 
one entity and the double income taxation triggered by many 
operations abroad despite U.S. credits for taxes paid to foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of such double taxation led DaimlerChrysler to  
place its world headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, after the 
recent merger, with an American subsidiary in Auburn Hills, Mich., 
said chief tax counsel John L. Loffredo. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it came to the choice of whether the new company should  
be a U.S. company or a German company, the U.S. tax system put 
Chrysler at a decisive disadvantage,'' Loffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the Finance Committee said they will pursue  
international tax reforms this year, both for U.S. companies 
operating overseas and for foreign firms with business in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our tax laws must encourage international businesses to come  
here and to strengthen U.S. businesses overseas,'' said Finance 
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats argued that an equal priority for Congress  
should be to ensure that foreign-controlled firms pay their fair 
share for operations in the United States. Sen. Byron Dorgan, 
D-N.D., said a forthcoming General Accounting Office study would 
likely show that 30 percent of such firms are now escaping U.S. 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us simplify. Let us reduce the complexity. But let us do  
it in a way that closes the loopholes,'' Dorgan said. ``They have 
access to the best marketplace in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 4.72 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly higher this morning, with  
the Dow Jones industrial average again approaching 10,000, but 
weakness in technology issues tempered some of the market's 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 24.98 at 9,922.42. The  
blue chips came within 42 points of 10,000 before giving up some 
ground. At 10:30 a.ml, the Dow was up 4.72 at 9,902.16. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow came within 65 points of 10,000 before  
closing at 9,897.44. Broaders market indicators were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The market moved higher today after the Labor Department  
released its Producer Price Index, which dropped a seasonally 
adjusted 0.4 percent in February, indicating that inflation remains 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil-related stocks rose after OPEC officials agreed to cut oil  
production in an attempt to boost sagging crude prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But weakness in technology stocks, most notably Microsoft and  
software maker Oracle held the market back. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index was down 17.55 at 2,394.70 . 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle fell 7 11/16 to 29 3/16 after the company's third-quarter  
sales fell short of analysts' expectations. Microsoft was down 1 
3/16 at 160 1/4 after the company said it would defer about $400 
million in revenue from its third to its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm equipment maker Caterpillar, down 4 1/4 at 46 5/8 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, said its first quarter would fall far short of 
analysts expectations because of lower machine and engine sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.16 at 1302.84.

<HEADLINE> News Mixed on Bond Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For investors in the widest-ranging type of bond  
mutual fund, diversification has brought both good news and bad 
news lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of multisector bond funds, which invest across the whole  
spectrum from ultrasafe to high-risk bonds, have avoided the worst 
of the damage suffered by junk-bond and emerging-market bond funds 
in the convulsion that hit the markets late last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also have shared in only part of the gain registered by  
top-grade Treasury and corporate bond funds in the ``flight to 
quality'' set off by those same worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the 12-month span through the end of February, figures  
calculated by CDA Investment Technologies showed an average total 
return of 1.2 percent for multisector bond funds. That put them 
about halfway between investment-grade corporate bond funds, which 
gained 4.4 percent over the same stretch, and high-yield, or junk, 
bond funds, which dropped 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The best showing by any type of bond fund over the past 12  
months was posted by U.S. Treasury funds, up 5.8 percent, and the 
worst was posted by emerging markets income funds, which took a 
minus-26.5 percent drubbing as investors fled debt securities from 
developing economies. 
</P>
<P>
	A middling performance for multisector funds is no surprise,  
given that compromise is what diversified investing is all about. 
By spreading your bets, you shave the tops off the peaks and the 
bottoms off the valleys on the charts, looking for a reasonable 
return while cushioning yourself against risk and volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent behavior of bonds provides evidence that this  
principle works as well as ever for income-conscious investors, 
many of whom want or need to manage risk with an extra measure of 
caution. They are not investing with some far-off future in mind, 
but rather seeking to meet their current needs for income to cover 
the expenses of life. 
</P>
<P>
	But what is true of the typical, or average, multisector bond  
fund doesn't always hold with every individual fund in the 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morningstar Mutual Funds research service notes a  
``startling disparity of performance'' in 1998 among multisector 
bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best and the worst were separated by 32 percentage  
points,'' writes analyst Maciej Kowara in the firm's latest report 
on the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winners had no, or very little, ermerging-markets bonds,''  
Kowara noted. ``Losers had plenty of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Multisector funds posting losses of up to 24 percent in 1998 had  
as much as half their assets committed to emerging markets. The 
funds that finished in the black had little or no exposure in these 
small or newly emerging economies around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with this degree of variation from one fund to another,  
investors need ``to pause and reflect on exactly what kind of 
multisector fund they are after,'' Kowara says. ``There really are 
two kinds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost all of them have a substantial domestic high-yield  
(junk bond) exposure, but some of them balance it out more than 
others with high-quality paper, whether domestic or foreign. Those 
that don't are more akin to rather aggressive high-yield funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it's very important, when considering a multisector bond  
fund, to look at its most recently disclosed portfolio, and check 
in its literature to see what strategies it uses and how much 
leeway its manager has to allocate money among different classes of 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't rely on recent performance numbers to make any  
projection of which funds might perform best in the future. As 
conditions change in the bond market, and they often do, funds with 
bigger commitments in emerging markets may start performing better. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far,'' concludes Kowara, ``history hasn't been kind to the  
more aggressive group. The tamer folk have been the best performers 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last good year for the aggressive funds was 1996. That  
scenario could return, of course, but so could 1998's. Only those 
who can handle such volatility should invest in this category's 
aggressive subgroup.''

<HEADLINE> Govt. Won't Block AOL-Netscape Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department said Friday it would  
not oppose America Online's proposed $4.3 billion merger with 
Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of Netscape by AOL, the world's largest online  
service provider, would create a single Internet company with 
remarkable reach across the high-tech world -- and challenge 
Microsoft Corp.'s dominance in key areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a side agreement, Sun Microsystems Inc. would distribute  
Netscape's business-level software in exchange for AOL's purchase 
of Sun's powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said in a statement that its antitrust  
division was closing its investigation of the proposed merger. 
``The division has decided that it will not challenge the 
transactions, having concluded that neither the merger nor the 
alliance violate the antitrust laws,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's shareholders are scheduled to meet Wednesday to vote  
on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Whitney, an AOL spokesman, said the company was pleased with  
Justice's announcement and was looking forward to the Netscape 
shareholders' vote Wednesday. The proposed merger faces no other 
regulatory hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance could pose dramatic new competition for Microsoft,  
whose own business tactics against Netscape are so aggressive that 
the federal government sued it for alleged antitrust violations. 
That trial, which began in October, is on a month-long recess from 
U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's ``Netcenter'' Web site is among the four most popular  
on the Internet with more than 20 million visitors each month. The 
AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo! sites are the other three most popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, AOL would acquire Netscape's pioneering  
Navigator browser software, which was introduced in 1994 and helped 
popularize the Internet. The software is now used by millions of 
people to view information on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Internet software competes directly against  
Netscape's, and its Microsoft Network online service is a rival to 
AOL although it has been far less successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Many industry observers believe the planned Netscape-AOL deal  
might hurt the Justice Department's pending antitrust case against 
Microsoft, which has argued that the deal proves that the high-tech 
industry is fast-changing and highly competitive. Microsoft has 
begun receiving documents related to the merger and subpoened last 
month.

<HEADLINE> Woman Accused of Using Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A woman settled a drug debt by loaning  
her 11-year-old daughter to dealers who outfitted the girl with 
drug-laden shoes and used her to mask their crimes, federal 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That 11-year-old was used specifically as cover to reduce the  
risk of detection in the event that the drug activity was detected 
by law enforcement,'' U.S. Attorney Don Nickerson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother, Rhonda Cochran, 34, was charged with methamphetamine  
trafficking and use of a minor in connection with the case, as were 
Luis Cautino, 31; Jodie Bowden, 24; and Kevin Lyman, 44. All live 
in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	The four, arrested Wednesday, could get life in prison if  
convicted because of enhanced penalties when children are involved 
in illegal drug activity, Nickerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents said Ms. Cochran, to settle a debt to Cautino,  
agreed to let him take her daughter to California last weekend 
where, accompanied by Ms. Bowden, he picked up drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	While in California, the girl was given new white platform shoes  
in which drugs were hidden, Nickerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``En route back to Des Moines,'' a criminal complaint alleges,  
``the child noticed that there was new glue on the shoes and that 
they were extremely heavy and hurt her feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers who searched Lyman's home Wednesday found four pounds  
of methamphetamine, three ounces of cocaine and several pairs of 
children's tennis shoes that were used to conceal the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl and a 5-year-old sister have been placed in foster  
care.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore Heads to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tipper Gore is traveling to Bosnia this  
weekend to meet with American troops and moderate a forum on the 
rebuilding of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	While in the region, the wife of the vice president ``will not  
be involved in any level of the negotiations on Kosovo,'' her 
spokeswoman, Jennifer Devlin, said on the eve of Mrs. Gore's 
Saturday departure. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-day trip, which also takes Mrs. Gore through Greece,  
was planned long before this week's breakdown in the U.S.-backed 
peace talks on Kosovo, Devlin said, dampening media speculation on 
whether Mrs. Gore would, on behalf of President Clinton, play a 
role in coaxing Kosovars and Albanians toward an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole served as  
Clinton's envoy earlier this week and left the region in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a substantive role for Mrs. Gore would not be farfetched,  
given the duties Clinton has entrusted to her recently as the White 
House has aimed to raise her profile in time for Al Gore's 2000 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore was the first U.S. dignitary that Clinton dispatched  
to Central America last fall to survey damage by Hurricane Mitch. 
More recently she has headlined budget announcements on behalf of 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	On this trip, however, the only ``diplomatic stop'' she has is a  
brief courtesy call on Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos in 
Athens, Devlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore is scheduled to visit U.S. troops in the NATO  
peacekeeping force in Sarajevo on Sunday. The following day, she 
will moderate a community discussion on efforts to resettle 
refugees and rebuild shelled streets, buildings and homes. On 
Tuesday, Mrs. Gore will go to Greece where she will speak about 
volunteerism at the American Anatolia College in Thessaloniki. The 
trip concludes with two days of education events in Athens.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Won't Discipline Iverson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers had two team meetings  
Friday and decided that Allen Iverson should not be disciplined for 
missing practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Brown said he would follow the team's  
recommendation, and Iverson prepared for Friday night's game 
against the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need him on the court,'' co-captain Harvey Grant said.  
``I'm sure he realizes we need him on the court, and we need his 
leadership on and off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, had an unexcused absence from  
the team workout Thursday. Brown didn't comment on whether Iverson 
would start or play against the Nets, but said in a radio interview 
that he'd let the team decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get this thing straightened out, and I will do what  
they tell me to do,'' Brown told WIP sports radio about an hour 
before the scheduled meeting. ``I'm going to sit down with my team, 
and they're going to tell me what is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players met Friday morning to discuss the Iverson issue, and  
Brown and the coaching staff joined them for a second meeting about 
an hour before the game against the Nets. They explained the team 
rules to Iverson and stressed that they are not to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Iverson) took care of the situation how he thought was  
best,'' rookie Larry Hughes said. ``You can look at anything after 
the fact and find a better way to do it. Maybe next time, he will 
do it a little different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No rules were changed, except one: From now on, practices will  
be closed to the media except for a few minutes at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not show at practice Thursday, the morning after the  
76ers played poorly but beat the Charlotte Hornets 85-70. He has 
since explained that he missed practice because his longtime 
girlfriend was sick after a miscarriage last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson missed practice once last week for that reason but was  
excused by the team. He apparently asked his bodyguard to tell 
Brown he wouldn't be at practice and assumed that would be the end 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen came in and addressed the situation,'' said his  
backcourt partner, Eric Snow. ``I think it was a miscommunication 
on his part, and a miscommunication on our part, because we didn't 
know the answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After attending practice Friday, Iverson said he was miffed at  
Brown for talking about his private business with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to rip me, rip me to my face in front of my  
teammates,'' Iverson said. ``Keep it in the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Iverson feuded when the coach first took the 76ers job  
last year, but had ironed out their differences -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get a handle on him when I first got here,'' Brown  
said. ``You try everything in your power to watch people grow and 
develop. You do everything you can to see that it happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes along the line you make mistakes, you make some  
mistakes personally. And I think I've made some tremendous mistakes 
not nipping this thing in the bud right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow and Grant, the two team captains, said everyone on the team  
was happy with how the controversy was handled. Sixers president 
Pat Croce agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the team wants is fine with me,'' Croce said. ``My  
whole goal is to win.''

<HEADLINE>  Violinist Yehudi Menuhin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who thrilled his first  
audience when he was 7 and went on to become one of the century's 
leading classical musicians, died today. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin, who also won recognition for his extensive writings and  
numerous benefit concerts promoting world peace, died of heart 
failure in a Berlin hospital, concert promoter Jutta Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin (pronounced men'-you-in) had been scheduled to conduct  
the Warsaw Symphony Orchestra in Berlin in a Tuesday night concert 
of Mendelssohn and Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending, but Adler said it was likely  
to be held in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yehudi Menuhin was a major figure in this century: an  
extraordinary musician, and a great humanitarian,'' the violinist 
Isaac Stern said today. ``His style of playing, particularly in his 
early years, was a stunning patrician elegance with a very natural 
musical line which fitted the style of whatever composition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born April 22, 1916, in New York of Russian Jewish parents,  
Menuhin astonished a San Francisco audience at the age of 7 with a 
debut violin performance that was by all accounts brilliant for a 
violinist at any age. 
</P>
<P>
	He often played chamber music with his two piano-playing  
sisters, Yaltah and particularly Hephzibah, who died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after his debut, he played at New York's Carnegie  
Hall with the New York Symphony Orchestra under the direction of 
the great German conductor Fritz Busch. By 13, he had already won 
accolades in Berlin, Paris and London. 
</P>
<P>
	In one famous incident, at his first concert in Berlin a few  
days short of his 13th birthday, Albert Einstein followed Menuhin 
backstage, hugged him and declared: ``Now I know there is a God in 
heaven!'' 
</P>
<P>
	So began a glittering international career in which he has  
performed with leading conductors and orchestras all over the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Fear that Menuhin's precocious brilliance would dissipate as he  
grew older proved groundless. He continued to play with a wonderful 
purity of tone and strong, clear line. 
</P>
<P>
	His brilliance as a performer and conductor was matched by his  
concern for humanity and, most impressively, his work as an 
educator. Generous with his talents and time, Menuhin founded a 
music school in his name in Britain and a foundation in Brussels, 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Christmas, Menuhin was promoting music teaching in  
British schools because he believed it could play a vital role in 
civilizing society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Art reflects the refinement of a civilization,'' he said.  
``Music goes both ways. You make yourself heard and listen to 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin lived in central London with his second wife, the  
ballerina Diana Gould, with whom he had two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	He received an honorary knighthood in 1965, but could not use  
the title until he became a British citizen in 1985. He became a 
lord in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin's first marriage, in 1938, was to Nola Nicholas, the  
19-year-old daughter of an Australian millionaire. They had one son 
and a daughter before they were divorced in Carson City, Nev., in 
1947 on grounds of ``simple incompatibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He married Miss Gould later that year, and she was credited with  
helping him through a period of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, Menuhin had come under criticism in America  
and Israel for his support for individual Germans. He defied acrid 
personal attacks to play for the Germans in Berlin in 1947, just 
two years after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He did so, he said, to further tolerance and ``the brotherhood  
of man'' -- expressions which to him were not empty phrases, but 
full of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	Elmar Weingarten, general manager at the Berlin Philharmonic,  
said Menuhin will always be remembered most in Berlin for having 
made that ``first contact with cultural Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Germany, and of course the Berlin Philharmonic, are very  
grateful for him having made this very meaningful gesture at that 
early time just after the war,'' Weingarten said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grievance was forgotten in Israel after his first few  
performances there in 1950, and he was accepted as a favorite son. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not, however, refrain from criticisms of the Israeli  
government. After the Six-Day War, he insisted on performing 
charity concerts in the Arab world and in 1975, he came out in 
favor of Israel's exclusion from UNESCO conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1950s saw Menuhin at the height of his powers. One of the  
foremost violinists of his age, he delighted audiences around the 
world with his smoothness of tone and the sheer physicality of his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	His classical works, including his beloved Beethoven Violin  
Concert, were received rapturously wherever he played. But he 
wasn't afraid to experiment with different repertoires, playing 
with artists from the Indian sitar master, Ravi Shankar, to the 
virtuoso jazz violinist, Stephane Grappelli. 
</P>
<P>
	More than once he introduced to the public works by famous  
composers. Bela Bartok, for instance, wrote ``Sonata for Violin'' 
especially for him. 
</P>
<P>
	His listening tastes, likewise, were not confined to the  
highbrow. He was an admirer of the early Beatles music, but was 
knocked off-balance by a Rolling Stones concert, which he left 
after a few numbers. ``I am no longer sure that music is a 
universal language,'' he said sadly afterward, complaining that the 
music was devoid of subtlety, variety and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
	Deeply spiritual, Menuhin was a follower of Indian mysticism,  
which influenced both the way he lived and the way he viewed death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later every birth must become a death,'' Menuhin  
wrote in a 1997 edition of his autobiography. His own wishes for 
the way this passage should be marked ``are based on the idea of a 
happy picnic on a river bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``My preference is for whatever will reunite me most quickly  
with the sources of life, accompanied by folk music and dance. ... 
Back to the earth, under a tree, or in a river, that is what I 
choose.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Chiefs Agree To Cut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Major oil-producing nations  
pledged Friday to slash production in an effort to relieve the 
worldwide glut of oil that has depressed prices for months. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC members, except Iraq, reached agreement with two non-OPEC  
exporters to reduce overall production by 2 million barrels a day. 
The news sent crude oil prices to five-month highs on commodity 
markets, before dropping back slightly on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of seeing OPEC promise cuts only to cheat on quotas,  
traders are optimistic that these cuts may stick because producing 
countries can't afford to let prices fall further. But some 
analysts remained wary that members of the dysfunctional OPEC 
family may renege on the pledge in fear of losing oil income. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll need to see it to believe it,'' said economist Peter van  
Doesberg with Dutch brokerage Stroeve. ``It's not guaranteed that 
other countries will stick to the agreement. It's a fragile 
cartel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran, Algeria and Venezuela, together  
with nonmember Mexico, thrashed out the production-cut agreement 
during two days of meetings in the Netherlands. The deal must be 
formally approved at a March 23 meeting of the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said non-OPEC members Mexico and  
Oman have also committed to the cuts, and discussions are under way 
with other non-OPEC countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts, effective April 1, amount to 2 million barrels a day  
and would be added to existing OPEC and non-OPEC cuts of 3.1 
million barrels a day agreed upon last June, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any higher than this and I think it would have got into the  
range of implausible. This is about the maximum people can 
stomach,'' said analyst Janelle Matharoo of Bankers Trust in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Algerian Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi, who is also OPEC president,  
said a more precise figure and a breakdown of the cuts would be 
given at the March 23 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Warne, an analyst with the investment firm Edward Jones in  
St. Louis, said OPEC members are still exceeding their self-imposed 
production quotas by 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day. So 
if there is no cheating on this agreement, it would make headway in 
reducing the glut, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices have been rising in recent days as traders grew  
optimistic that some cutbacks would be announced before the OPEC 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's announcement pushed up contracts for April delivery of  
light, sweet crude 18 cents to close at $14.49 a barrel on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, after hitting an intraday high of $15.11 
-- the highest since early October. The rally has pushed oil prices 
up 35 percent from December's 12-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil rose 42 cents to  
$12.60 per barrel at the International Petroleum Exchange, after 
hitting an intraday high of $13.19. Brent crude last settled above 
$13 per barrel in November 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts estimated that crude prices could rise to $16 to $20  
per barrel by year's end if oil producers adhere to the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	James Van Alen, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in  
Philadelphia, said the market is more willing to believe that the 
cuts will stick because producers have been suffering so long from 
depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're seeing is that they're a little more scared,'' Van  
Alen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also raising optimism was a pledge last month by the president  
of Venezuela -- seen as one of the largest overproducers -- to comply 
with the previously announced cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major obstacles to a new agreement had been the issue  
of Iran's production. Iran has insisted that any cuts be made from 
a base production level of 3.925 million barrels a day, while other 
oil producers claim that figure should actually be 3.623 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil ministers declined comment Friday on the issue, but  
consultations between Saudi Arabia and Iran and also between Gulf 
Cooperation Council members appear to have broken the stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,  
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and 
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Japan Economy May Have Shrunk Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Dampening hopes of a quick recovery, Japan's  
economy shrank for the fifth straight quarter in the final months 
of last year, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the 0.8 percent drop in gross domestic  
product in the October-December quarter came as a government panel 
approved a $62.5 billion bailout package for Japan's debt-plagued 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission, which oversees the  
cleanup of the banking industry, gave a green light to release the 
funds, the Dow Jones News Service reported. The money will go to 
some of the world's largest lenders, such as Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and 
the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is the cornerstone of a government plan to pull the  
country out of its worse recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today that Japan's banking  
industry is on the verge of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the injection of public funds, we are now about to  
achieve stability in the financial system,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakuo Yanagisawa, head of the commission overseeing the cleanup,  
said the top lending institutions, newly flush with taxpayer money, 
will have addressed the problem of bad loans by month's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's figures on the GDP -- the measure of all goods and  
services produced in the country -- were worse than expected. In 
July-September, the GDP shrank 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At that pace, the world's second-largest economy will shrink 3.2  
percent in the 1998-99 fiscal year -- the first time it has 
contracted for two fiscal years in a row since the end of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the 1997-98 fiscal year,  
which ended March 31, in the first full-year decline since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Landon, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in  
Tokyo, said the last quarter's steep decline could lead to more 
moves to prop up the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that these figures were so much worse than expected  
leads me to believe that the government has underestimated the 
economy's weakness up until now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at a record high of 4.4 percent and a credit  
crunch squeezing companies, the Japanese government already plans 
record spending of $682.5 billion in the budget for the next fiscal 
year starting April 1. That includes a $209 billion stimulus 
package of public works spending and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa said today that the massive financial bailout would put  
the banking industry -- hobbled by an estimated $584 billion in bad 
loans -- on the verge of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa, who had been cautious until now, also said the economy  
``may now have turned the corner,'' joined a growing group of 
Japanese officials who say the country's prospects are improving. 
</P>
<P>
	The bailout funds will be funneled to the banks through sales of  
newly issued preferred stock and subordinated bonds to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the 15 banks appeared before the commission today  
to detail restructuring efforts -- a key requirement for receiving 
the funds. All the banks predict losses for this fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Reno Denies Passing Over Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is denying a GOP  
senator's charge that federal prosecutor Charles LaBella was 
punished for disagreeing with her on how to proceed with a campaign 
fund-raising probe. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Friday, Sen. Arlen  
Specter, R-Pa., told Reno that her plan to replace LaBella, who is 
interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, with 
a subordinate, creates the ``possible inference'' that LaBella was 
passed over as a punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inference is plain wrong,'' Reno replied. ``Chuck  
LaBella's disagreement with me had nothing to do with who the U.S. 
attorney is for the Southern District of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella headed the Justice Department's campaign-finance task  
force until he left in July to become acting U.S. attorney in San 
Diego. He said he resigned last month after being told by Deputy 
Attorney General Eric Holder that the department will ask the San 
Diego federal judges to replace him with Gregory Vega, a 
subordinate federal prosecutor recommended for the job by Sen. 
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter has said Reno's move ``has all the indications of  
retribution'' for LaBella's recommendation last July that an 
independent counsel investigate allegations of abuses, chiefly by 
Democrats, in fund raising for the 1996 elections. Reno has 
repeatedly refused to appoint an independent counsel for that 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I left I didn't even get a 'Thank you for your services,'  
'' LaBella told the San Diego Union-Tribune last month, describing 
what he considered fallout from the work of his campaign-financing 
task force. ``I think that crystallizes just how out of favor I was 
with the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Reno told Specter that LaBella served the  
department ``with distinction,'' and pointed out that senators 
recommend and confirm such nominations. The attorney general, 
however, gives the White House final approval for candidates before 
the president sends nominations to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said LaBella should not have expected the nomination.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody should have an expectation of being U.S. attorney,''  
Reno said. ``I don't think anybody should anticipate that they're 
going to be 'it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange came during the Judiciary Committee's review of the  
agency's budget request, the third such congressional session Reno 
has attended this week. During the sessions, she has come under 
heavy criticism from Republicans for the department's problems 
handling immigration and border patrol issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on both the Senate panel and the House subcommittee  
that oversees the Justice Department's budget took issue with the 
fact that Reno has not requested money for more border patrol 
agents next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not negligence, it was not sloppiness, it was not  
malice or evilness or badness or dumbness'' that led her to hold up 
on a request for more money, Reno told the House panel on Thursday. 
Rather, she said, the force is suffering from a flood of 
inexperienced border patrol agents and wants to wait until they are 
properly trained before hiring new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service, said subcommittee  
Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., has failed to correct case load, 
detention and other problems despite receiving increases federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems every year we are called upon to bail out some  
massive mistake that the INS has done, in spite of the fact that 
you have told us ... that you are going to personally oversee the 
problems at the INS,'' Rogers told Reno during a hearing Thursday 
before the House subcommittee on Commerce, Justice State and the 
Judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the INS -- one of the government's fastest growing  
agencies -- has taken steps to resolve problems. ``They have done a 
job that indicates that they can solve problems, just not fast 
enough,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Guillen Finally Shows Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Guillen finally arrived in the  
Pittsburgh Pirates' spring training camp on Friday, 11 days late 
because U.S. government officials questioned the validity of his 
marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen was married in his hometown of San Cristobal sometime in  
October, and the license apparently was improperly filed at that 
point, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't realize there was a problem until he tried to pick up  
visas for himself and his wife, Ingrid, on Feb. 18 in the Dominican 
capital of Santo Domingo. Guillen had planned to fly to Bradenton 
the next day to have an injured right shoulder examined. 
</P>
<P>
	``They called me at home and said to come back to consulate  
because the paperwork was not right,'' Guillen said. ``I told them 
to look at the signatures, they were correct, but they had 
questions. I told them if they did not believe it, they should 
investigate. There was nothing wrong with the paperwork but they 
had questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did nothing wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know everything that happened, why there was a problem  
with the paperwork but I did everything I was supposed to do,'' 
Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
	His appeal was denied again Monday but approved Wednesday after  
Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy asked Sens. Rick Santorum and Arlen 
Specter to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a frustrating time for me to sit at home and wait to  
get here,'' Guillen said. ``I knew I had done nothing wrong but yet 
I couldn't do anything. I was going crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen received a physical Friday morning and checked out fine  
before taking batting practice. He said he has recovered from a 
strained right shoulder sustained during winter ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates say Guillen will need at least one week of  
conditioning work before he can play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he's in good shape,'' Pirates manager Gene  
Lamont said. ``I watched him throw and it doesn't look like his 
shoulder is bothering him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd been working out two or three hours every day in the  
Dominican,'' he said. ``I've been running, throwing, hitting in the 
batting cages. I think I'm ready to go. I don't make those 
decisions but if (manager) Gene Lamont put my name in the lineup 
today, I'd play.''

<HEADLINE> Christian Leaders Indicted on Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Seven leaders of a Christian ministry that  
promised people a double return on their donations were arrested 
Friday on federal fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged in a 20-count indictment unsealed in Tampa  
that Greater Ministries International Inc.'s ``Double Your Money 
Gift Exchange Program'' was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme in 
which early investors were paid with donations made by later 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater Ministries leaders allegedly failed to tell investors  
that ministry directors received a percentage of the investments as 
commission payments. Prosecutors refused to say how much they think 
Greater Ministries took in during its six years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those named in the indictment were Gerald Payne, 62, Greater  
Ministries' president; his wife, Betty, 59, the group's secretary; 
and five other officials: Patrick Talbert, 50, James Chambers, 66, 
Haywood Eudon Hall, 57, David Whitfield, 46, and Andrew Krishak, 
47. 
</P>
<P>
	At hearings in Tampa and Orlando, all the defendants but Gerald  
Payne were released on bail. Their attorneys refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater Ministries has had constant run-ins with authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	Cease-and-desist orders have been issued in Ohio, Pennsylvania  
and Florida. An appeals court overturned Florida's order, ruling 
that Greater Ministries' forms contained sufficient warnings that 
its program was faith-based and offered no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months ago, the nephew of a Greater Ministries official  
pleaded guilty to theft and securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Strawder, 26, started his own operation, Sovereign  
Ministries International, in April 1997. More than 2,100 devout 
Christians across the country gave the organization as much as $14 
million in less than a year.

<HEADLINE> Rolen Injury Said Not Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Rolen's foot injury isn't serious,  
with the Philadelphia Phillies saying Friday it was merely a 
bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a soft-tissue contusion, and his X-rays were  
A-OK,'' team physician Dr. Phillip Marone said. ``We're going to 
treat him with some things to combat the little amount of swelling 
he has. In three days, he should be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rolen hit a sinking pitch from Detroit's Brian Moehler off the  
outside of his back foot during a first-inning at-bat Thursday. 
Rolen wound up drawing a walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different kind of pain, and that worried me a little  
bit,'' Rolen said. ``It kind of got worse as I stayed in the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After grounding out to third during his second at-bat, Rolen  
left in the fifth.

<HEADLINE> Icahn Ugres New RJR Nabisco Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn is dissatisfied with a plan  
by RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. for breaking up the food and tobacco 
company and will lead his own slate of nominees for the RJR Nabisco 
board to push an alternate proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	It now appears the breakup of a company which was embroiled in  
one of the most dramatic and expensive takeover fights of the 1980s 
and chronicled in the book and TV movie ``Barbarians at the Gate'' 
will not be accomplished without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco said Tuesday it was selling its international  
tobacco business to Japan's largest tobacco company and proposed 
breaking off its domestic tobacco operations -- led by its Camel, 
Winston and Salem cigarettes -- into a separate company owned by RJR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn said Thursday that it would be ``infinitely better'' to  
spin off the company's controlling stake in the Nabisco Holdings 
Corp. food business -- which includes Chips Ahoy and Oreo cookies, 
Planters nuts and Life Savers candy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would give RJR shareholders the choice by pushing his  
slate of directors for election to the board in May. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR chairman and chief executive Steven F. Goldstone vowed to  
stick with his plan for the domestic tobacco spinoff, saying ``a 
Nabisco spinoff can't get done and we are going to do what actually 
can get done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn has been threatening for months to launch a proxy fight to  
force the company to spin off the food holdings and break the food 
business' link to the remaining tobacco interests. He contends the 
connection has depressed the value of the food interests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Icahn said he decided to push ahead  
with his plan after the market failed to push RJR's price sharply 
higher in the wake of the RJR breakup proposal. He said 
shareholders deserve to consider trying his plan. ``If we can't do 
it this way, we'll do it the other way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn controls 7.7 percent of the shares of RJR, but has failed  
twice in the past four years to unseat the RJR board over the food 
spinoff issue. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR's board already has endorsed a breakup plan under which it  
would sell the international tobacco business for $7.8 billion to 
Japan Tobacco Co and spin off the domestic tobacco operation, which 
is the second-largest in the nation. RJR would keep its 80.6 
percent stake in Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn said he supported the sale of the international tobacco  
business, but said a food spinoff would create more value for 
shareholders than a tobacco spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the marketplace will place a proper valuation on  
Nabisco as a free-standing company, separating it completely from 
RJR rather than having it controlled by a holding company that once 
owned a tobacco company,'' Icahn said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would notify RJR of his slate of directors on Friday,  
which is the deadline for submitting such matters for consideration 
at the RJR annual shareholders meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Goldstone said Icahn's reappearance ``virtually has  
become a rite of spring for RJR Nabisco'' after failed proxy 
efforts in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The RJR leader said if he had thought the Nabisco spinoff ``was  
practical, I would have done it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn and the RJR board have made diverging calculations about  
the legal consequences of competing scenarios for separating the 
food business from tobacco operations which face hundreds of 
lawsuits over the health effects of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR management feels a spinoff of the food business would be  
attacked by lawyers for those suing its cigarette company as a 
``fraudulent conveyance'' of assets that otherwise might be 
available to pay judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone argues that his plan for separating the food and  
tobacco businesses would not raise such objections since those 
winning judgments against the tobacco company would still be able 
to sue RJR. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn said worries about a legal challenge to the food spinoff  
are off base. He said he has been advised by a law firm that a 
Nabisco spinoff would be permitted based on ``the current status of 
the law and what RJR has disclosed in litigation papers and SEC 
filings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Burry, analyst for Brown Bros. Harriman, said RJR  
shareholders will have to make their own decision on which course 
is wiser. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said if Icahn wins election to the board and is wrong  
about the food spinoff, shareholders will be left with him as the 
company's leader. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco stock were unchanged Thursday at $30 a share on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Belle Says He Won't Talk to Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Albert Belle ended his era of good  
feeling with the Baltimore media, saying Friday he will no longer 
speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle made the decision in the wake of coverage of his tirade in  
the Orioles clubhouse Thursday. The brooding slugger threw two bats 
-- shattering one of them -- his glove and batting helmet into his 
locker after a questionable third-strike call in the middle of an 
exhibition game against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in the clubhouse Friday for comment on the incident, Belle  
said, ``I'm done. I'm done with you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter then said, ``Forever?'' and Belle nodded. When asked  
why, Belle turned around and stared at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day he signed a $65 million, five-year contract with the  
Orioles in December, Belle smiled broadly and said: ``Whereas in 
the past I have cut the media off completely, I have made great 
strides to be accessible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle did just that in his first three months with the team. In  
January he attended a two-day, fan-oriented event in Baltimore, 
signing hundreds of autographs and speaking openly with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, shortly after reporting early to spring training last  
month, Belle surprised Baltimore reporters by walking into the 
cramped press room and answering all their questions. Two days 
later, he accommodated the national media with a lengthy news 
conference in the Baltimore dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	His uncharacteristic friendly nature was the subject of a  
feature article in Sports Illustrated, and for a while it seemed as 
if playing in fan-friendly Baltimore would produce a kinder, 
gentler Albert Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	But that no longer appears to be the case, at least as far as  
beat writers covering the Orioles are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	The press on Friday also received another backlash from the  
coverage of Belle's tirade -- the Orioles clubhouse was closed 
during their exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Team 
officials instituted the new policy, which is to remain in effect 
for the remainder of the spring, because Belle lost his cool during 
the game while a handful of reporters were in the clubhouse waiting 
to speak to starting pitcher Mike Mussina.

<HEADLINE> Young Racers Making Impact in Busch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon led the way. Now, an abundance  
of promising, 20-something racers -- and even younger -- are lurking 
on the edge of Winston Cup fame. 
</P>
<P>
	With names ranging from the familiar (Earnhardt, Jarrett, Petty)  
to the obscure (Atwood, Grubb, Kenseth), they've already 
demonstrated the future of NASCAR racing is in very good hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two thumbs up,'' said Randy LaJoie, assessing the crop of  
drivers emerging in the Busch Grand National Series, one step below 
the big time. ``They're very smart. And they are very talented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Busch drivers are at Atlanta Motor Speedway for Saturday's  
Yellow Freight 300, a preliminary event for the Cracker Barrel 500 
Winston Cup race. The first round of qualifying was held Thursday 
at the 1.54-mile trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was only 22 when he debuted as a full-time driver on the  
Winston Cup circuit, but he has won three championships in his 
first six seasons. That paved the way for an influx of young 
drivers, such as 18-year-old Casey Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in young and did good,'' said Atwood, who qualified  
11th for Saturday's race. ``Now, you've got all the car owners 
going down to the local tracks looking for the young guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, the children of Winston Cup stars such as Dale Earnhardt  
are growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Dale Earnhardt Jr., 24, made his father proud by  
winning his first Busch title, beating out another would-be star, 
27-year-old Matt Kenseth. 
</P>
<P>
	The young Earnhardt, who is planning to move up to Winston Cup  
in 2000, is hardly the only famous name on the Busch circuit. 
There's a third-generation driver (Jason Jarrett, 23, son of Dale 
and grandson of Ned) and even a fourth (Adam Petty, 18, son of 
Kyle, grandson of Richard and great-grandson of Lee). 
</P>
<P>
	``You just go out and do the best you can,'' said the teen-aged  
Petty, who made the Atlanta field on the first day with the 
20th-best qualifying speed. ``It doesn't matter if your name is 
Smith or Jones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are several teen-agers Petty can hang out with in the  
garage, sharing stories about who got carded this week trying to 
get into the track. One of his best friends is Atwood, who became 
the youngest Busch driver in history last season when he took part 
in 13 races, winning two poles and more than $123,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, who won about a dozen Late Model Sportsman races before  
getting his driver's license, showed he is anxious to learn. After 
Thursday's practice session, he listened intently while 36-year-old 
Kevin Lepage gave him some pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing I've seen about these guys compared to some of  
the ones in the past is they will ask questions,'' said LaJoie, 37, 
a two-time Busch champion. ``The last couple of years, we've had 
guys coming through here who thought they were smarter than the 
rest of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Busch series is one of the most unique proving grounds in  
sports. While technically a minor league, a number of Winston Cup 
regulars take part when the series stops at major tracks like 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't like it, but I do,'' Atwood said. ``I  
want to learn all I can. The more I get behind those guys and race 
with those guys, the better off I'll be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Winston Cup regulars tend to take away  
spots from the younger guys. At the last race in Las Vegas, 17 of 
the big-time drivers earned a spot in the Busch field, which 
knocked out drivers like 22-year-old Wayne Grubb, Kevin's brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings about it,'' Wayne Grubb said. ``I like  
it in a way, but in Las Vegas we got swarmed by 'em. Half the field 
was Winston Cup, and the rest of us had to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaJoie has even stronger feelings about the commingling of the  
two series. He feels the wealthier, more-experienced teams have an 
unfair advantage over most of their Busch counterparts, plus they 
take away positions from young drivers who need the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaquille O'Neal can't go back to college for the NCAA  
tournament,'' LaJoie said. ``Let us have our series back.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Ace Reliever May Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Atlanta Braves closer Kerry Ligtenberg  
has a partially torn ligament in his right elbow and will be 
sidelined for at least one month and possibly the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	After examining the results of Thursday's MRI, Dr. Joe Chandler  
said under a best-case prognosis, Ligtenberg would be able to 
resume throwing in 4-to-6 weeks. However, he could need surgery 
that would end his season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uncertainty of whether it's going to heal or not is what's  
bothering me,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I don't like the fact that I'm 
going to be resting and trying to make it better when there's no 
way we can really tell if it gets better until I go out on the 
mound again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, diagnosed with a partially torn medial collateral  
ligament, had appeared in two games this spring, giving up five 
runs Wednesday in his first save situation, 10-7 loss to Houston. 
He said he felt pain against the first batter and it never got 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt some stiffness and was real sore right after the inning  
and the next day,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I was hoping it wasn't as 
bad as it was. I can't pinpoint exactly when it happened or if it 
was one pitch ... It was right after the inning that I noticed my 
whole forearm was in a knot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg had a breakthrough year in 1998, taking over the  
closer's role after Mark Wohlers experienced control problems and 
was sent to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The former independent league player, once traded for a bag of  
baseballs, wound up with 30 saves in 34 chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a substantial blow to our bullpen,'' said Braves general  
manager John Schuerholz, who told his scouts to be on the lookout 
for potential replacements. ``But a lot of people in our 
organization have always thought John Rocker could fill that 
role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker has appeared in two innings this spring and has not  
allowed a run. He was 1-3 in 47 games last year for Atlanta with a 
2.13 ERA in 38 innings.

<HEADLINE> NFL Prepares To Award Franchise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Within the next few days, 31 football team  
owners meeting in Arizona plan to vote on whether to put a new NFL 
franchise in Los Angeles or Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that a decision has already been reached  
to award the league's 32nd team to Los Angeles, reports denied by 
all sides. There are strong signs that L.A. will get the nod, but a 
decision won't be final until the league's sometimes unpredictable 
owners approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion committee is set to meet Sunday in Phoenix, with  
its recommendation to be presented to all the owners early next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said recently that he expects  
the league to name a city, but not an ownership group, during the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Houston has just one ownership group bidding, it might be  
out of the running. Another indication is that Bob McNair, who 
heads the effort to bring a team back to Houston, is shopping 
around for an existing franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said he hasn't given up on the possibility of  
landing the expansion team, McNair has sent letters of inquiry to 
teams in nine other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two groups in Los Angeles competing for a team: one  
headed by Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz that wants to build a 
new stadium in suburban Carson; the other led by real estate 
developer Ed Roski and billionaire Eli Broad, seeking to return a 
team to a remodeled L.A. Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NFL does the expected and picks Los Angeles, the league  
then will be able to have those two groups -- and any others that 
might want to get into the game -- bidding against each other for 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	As a measure of the price tag, Cleveland paid $530 million for  
an expansion team, and the current bid for the Washington Redskins 
is $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, a member of the  
expansion committee, said he would be surprised if other groups 
interested in owning a team didn't surface, regardless of which 
city was picked. 
</P>
<P>
	There has even been speculation that the two present L.A. groups  
might join their efforts, although there would be obstacles to such 
a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors would seem to make Los Angeles a shoo-in. The  
area is the nation's second largest TV market (compared to Houston 
at No. 11), is highly visible as America's ``entertainment 
capital,'' and, with nearly 17 million potential customers for 
jerseys and other team paraphernalia, is an area the NFL may need 
more than it needs an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said during a visit last week to Carson that he  
didn't expect the league would expand beyond 32 teams ``in my 
lifetime, and I'm 62.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If L.A.'s not the place, that would leave the NFL without a home  
team in the No. 2 TV market for the foreseeable future, costing the 
league megabucks in TV contracts and merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he ticked off concerns about the proposed  
remodeling of the Coliseum, including parking space and the 
financial package. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson noted that the Coliseum already lost two NFL teams,  
the Rams when they moved to Anaheim, and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without a team since 1995, when  
the Rams left Anaheim for St. Louis and the Raiders returned to 
Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Yen, Up Vs. euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Friday,  
recovering from the previous day's surprise resignation of 
Germany's finance minister. But the dollar fell against the yen as 
U.S. stocks declined. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0901, down  
from $1.1023 on Thursday. The dollar was quoted at 118.78 Japanese 
yen, down from 119.33 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders returned to buying dollars in favor of euros -- focusing  
on Europe's weaker growth outlook -- after the euro rallied Thursday 
on the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine as Germany's finance 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine was considered anti-business and, among other  
complaints, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder blamed him for 
underestimating problems for industry stemming from a new tax plan, 
German newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the yen, the dollar declined as the Dow Jones industrial  
average was halted on its way to a record 10,000-point level by 
profit-taking and poor corporate profit outlooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn on Wall Street offset weak Japanese economic news,  
which showed that country's worst recession since World War II is 
far from over. Japan's government reported Friday that its economy 
shrank by 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998, making that 
the fifth straight quarter of contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4633 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4541, and 1.5235 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5252. The British 
pound fell to $1.6313 from $1.6364. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7940 German 
marks, up from 1.7743; 6.0168 French francs, up from 5.9524; and 
1,776.20 Italian lire, up from 1,757.47.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. defended its participation in a  
new United Nations development effort that has drawn criticism from 
human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow is one of 16 global companies that have contributed money to  
the Global Sustainable Development Fund, which came under fire on 
Thursday for soliciting funds from companies that have bad 
environmental or human-rights records. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow, creator of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange, gave $55,000  
to join as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released late Thursday, Dow said it had joined  
the effort in order to ``eradicate poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said, ``Dow has been a strong proponent of  
sustainable development for years,'' and that a Dow executive had 
co-chaired the President's Council on Sustainable Development.

<HEADLINE> Green To Play in 1,000th Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Don't look for lots of fanfare when A.C. Green  
takes the court Saturday night in his NBA-record 1,000th 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll stop the game after the tipoff and give the ball to the  
35-year-old Dallas forward. From that point on, it'll be just 
another game between the Mavericks and the Vancouver Grizzlies, two 
teams well below the .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials say that, at Green's request, there won't be the  
hoopla that surrounded Green's record-breaking 907th straight game 
in 1997, which was attended by baseball Iron Man Cal Ripken Jr., 
Magic Johnson and other luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Green's parents will stay home in Portland, Ore., to watch  
his nephew play in the state high school basketball championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't even a question about that,'' Green said Friday.  
``It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing for the kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A deeply religious man who has made a crusade out of preaching  
sexual abstinence to teen-agers, Green said the streak, which began 
with the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 19, 1986, is the product of a 
strong work ethic ``and a blessing from God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His streak isn't as many games (2,632) as Ripken's, but it's a  
more physical game,'' coach Don Nelson said. ``For a guy to play 
through the injuries is just truly amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 power forward is doing all he can do downplay the  
milestone game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another number on the schedule,'' Green said after the  
team's workout Friday. Ever the perfectionist, Green was the last 
man to leave the court after practicing free throws for 30 minutes. 
``It's significant. I'm happy. But how I got there is taking it one 
game at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green is still counting, even after passing Randy Smith's old  
NBA consecutive-game record. He is shooting for Ron Boone's 
unofficial pro mark of 1,041 straight games -- 379 in the NBA and 
662 in the old American Basketball Association, which NBA records 
don't acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different brand of basketball back then. They banged,  
they bumped. You'd carry sprained ankles into games. It was 
expected for you to play,'' Green said. ``Young guys (today), man, 
they're so scared!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green is surrounded by young guys. Most of his teammates can't  
claim 1,000 games if they include college, high school and YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're calculating how many minutes they've played instead of  
games,'' Green laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	That youth movement also means that if Green is to continue his  
streak next season, he'll probably do it somewhere else. The 
Mavericks are trying to develop young forwards Gary Trent, Samaki 
Walker and Chris Anstey. 
</P>
<P>
	Green -- averaging 21 minutes, 5.9 points and 6 rebounds per game  
-- is making $5.125 million this year and will be a free agent after 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who is also the Mavericks' general manager, said Green  
plays as hard as anyone on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a team leader. His professionalism is the best thing that  
a young player can possibly watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nelson also indicated he wants to give more time to young  
players. He said Green's future with the team will ``depend on the 
numbers ... what the market bears,'' and whether Dallas can resign 
its young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to develop a good young team, and we're going to  
make the sacrifices we need to do that,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who said he hasn't discussed a new contract with Nelson,  
is confident he'll be playing somewhere next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to go where you're appreciated and where you're  
needed and where you have a chance to win and make a positive 
contribution,'' Green said. ``I feel all those things could be done 
here, but I don't answer those questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just know the passion for the game is still as high as  
ever.''

<HEADLINE> Flurry of NBA Trades at Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was supposed to be a quieter-than-usual NBA trading deadline  
day, although it sure didn't seem that way to Kevin McHale. 
</P>
<P>
	After deciding to trade Stephon Marbury, the Minnesota  
Timberwolves' general manager heard the names of Latrell Sprewell, 
Tim Hardaway, Sam Cassell, P.J. Brown, Chris Childs and Chris 
Gatling bandied about in trade discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Miami Heat pulled out of the talks at midafternoon,  
McHale chose the offer made by New Jersey and sent Marbury, one of 
the most talented young point guards in the league, to the Nets in 
a three-team, nine-player swap just hours before the trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other deals were made:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Philadelphia 76ers sent forwards Tim Thomas and Scott  
Williams to the Milwaukee Bucks for forwards Tyrone Hill and Jerald 
Honeycutt; 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Cleveland Cavaliers sending Vitaly Potapenko to Boston for  
Andrew DeClercq and a No. 1 pick; 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Vancouver Grizzlies traded guard Sam Mack to Houston for  
guard Rodrick Rhodes; 
</P>
<P>
	-- And the New York Knicks acquired the rights to Mirsad Turkcan  
from Philadelphia for a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	By far the biggest deal of the day sent Marbury back home to the  
New York metropolitan area to play for the Nets, the team with the 
worst record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury moved to the Nets along with guards Chris Carr and  
Elliot Perry and forward Bill Curley. The Wolves got guard Terrell 
Brandon from Milwaukee and forward Brian Evans and two draft 
choices from the Nets, including a first-rounder, and New Jersey 
sent Sam Cassell and Chris Gatling to the Bucks, who also get Paul 
Grant from the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were kind of forced into it,'' Timberwolves owner Glen  
Taylor said of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was considering trading Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown in a  
four-team deal that also included Vancouver and Milwaukee, and 
McHale turned down an offer of Sprewell and Childs from New York 
that would have been part of a three-way trade with Milwaukee, 
numerous league sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News of New York quoted Knicks personnel director  
Ernie Grunfeld as saying the Wolves turned down an offer of Allan 
Houston and Childs for Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was considering sending Hardaway to the Bucks and Brown to  
the Grizzlies. Marbury would have gone to the Heat, the Wolves 
would have gotten Brandon and a No. 1 pick and the Grizzlies would 
have acquired a No. 1 pick along with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Miami discussions were an exploratory thing,''  
said agent David Falk, who represents Marbury. ``When I spoke to 
coach Riley, I told him Stephon really wanted to go home to the New 
York area. I don't know exactly which players Miami was considering 
trading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Wolves offered Marbury the maximum deal under  
the NBA's new labor contract, six years for $71 million, and were 
told Marbury would not accept it and would leave Minnesota when he 
became a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks also were faced with the prospect of losing Brandon as  
a free agent and getting nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely appreciative of Glen Taylor and (Bucks owner)  
Herb Kohl for allowing us to assist them in getting this very 
complicated deal done,'' Falk said. ``The deadline was 6 p.m., and 
at 6:01, if they hadn't been traded, those players would no longer 
have had any long-term value to those teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury said he would sign a six-year, $71 million extension  
with the Nets on Friday when he joins the team in Philadelphia. His 
acquisition is also expected to increase the Nets' chances of 
re-signing Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn, both of whom are 
clients of Falk. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if the Wolves had some sort of agreement with  
Brandon that will keep him with the team beyond this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. I think any player, anyone who's in any type of  
business enjoys being wanted,'' Brandon said. ``I'm excited about 
being a Timberwolf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell is signed for the next four seasons, so the Bucks face  
no risk of losing him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are off to the worst start in the Eastern Conference at  
3-15, including five straight losses that have raised questions 
about coach John Calipari's job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury helped turn the Timberwolves into one of the most  
exciting teams in the West. At 12-6, they are two games behind Utah 
in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't money,'' Taylor said. ``He grew up in the East and  
wants to play back by his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury has long expressed a desire to play for the New York  
Knicks, and it's clear he saw the Nets as the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's New York, but it's not New York. It's New Jersey,'' he  
told WFAN. ``When people think about the New Jersey Nets, the first 
thing they think is that's the other New York team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell played in only two games since spraining his ankle in  
the season opener. Gatling asked to be traded, and Evans was 
showcased in heavy minutes Wednesday night in a loss to the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, Curley and Grant have seen little action this season. They  
were included in the trade to make it work under salary cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the seventh pick in the 1997 draft by New Jersey, had  
fallen into a mopup role after being tabbed as the cornerstone of a 
trade in which the Sixers parted with the draft rights to Van Horn 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who turns 31 next week, was an All-Star with Cleveland in  
1995 before he was traded to the Bucks with Brandon in the deal 
that sent Vin Baker to Seattle and Shawn Kemp to the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack was sent back to his former team when Vancouver sent him to  
Houston for second-year swingman Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	After a solid start this season in which he averaged 17.8 points  
a game through eight games, Mack's production cooled off to where 
he was relegated to coming off the bench in Vancouver's last four 
outings. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkcan, the 18th pick overall of the 1998 draft, is currently  
playing forward for Efes Pilssen of the Turkish League. He will be 
eligible to join the Knicks in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will give the 76ers a first-round draft pick that  
originally belonged to Toronto. The Knicks acquired it from the 
Raptors in the John Wallace trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Ukrainian-born Potapenko played in all 17  
Cleveland games this season, averaging 8.4 points and 5.5 rebounds. 
He was selected by Cleveland as the 12th pick overall in the 1996 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was under a deadline to sign Potapenko to a new  
contract by Saturday or face losing him to free agency after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Potapenko was used largely as a reserve forward-center until a  
season-ending injury to center Zydrunas Ilgauskas last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-10 DeClercq has averaged 5.4 points and 4.5 rebounds in 14  
games for Boston. As part of the trade, Cleveland also gets one 
first-round draft pick between now and 2001. The Cavs have the 
option of when to use the pick.

<HEADLINE> College Baseball Player Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A car driven by a man trying to outrun  
police collided with a van carrying the Bluefield State baseball 
team, killing one player and sending four team members to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia team had just arrived in Tallahassee and was  
heading to its hotel when the accident occurred at about 1 a.m., 
said Leon County Sheriff's Deputy David Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
	As the van was exiting Interstate 10, it was hit by a car driven  
by Albert Williams, 28, of Tallahassee. Williams had been stopped 
earlier on a drug charge and was fleeing police. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams may have been traveling at 80 mph when it hit the van,  
Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He started pulling away from the deputy near the interstate  
and the deputy saw the vehicle disappear in a cloud of dust,'' 
Gilmore said. ``He realized there was an accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killed in the accident was Shannon Stewart, 19.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Morgan, 22, was in stable condition Friday at Tallahassee  
Community Hospital, Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Geoff Hunter and two other students -- Ryan Mollette and  
Fred Thompson -- were treated and released, said college spokesman 
Jim Nelson in Bluefield. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was in Tallahassee to play two games Friday and two  
Saturday. Other games were scheduled for Fort Myers, Fla., and 
Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was traveling in a three-van caravan and had left  
Bluefield on Thursday. Stewart was one of nine people in the lead 
van, Gilmore said. There were 34 people making the trip, Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school chartered a bus to bring the team back to West  
Virginia Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was being held in Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, and  
details about his injuries were not immediately known. He was 
charged with second-degree murder, possession of cocaine with 
intent to sell and aggravated fleeing and eluding, Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found 28 bags of powdered cocaine in Williams' vehicle,  
Gilmore said.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Challenges Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terry Nichols has requested an appeals court to  
consider his claims that improper guidelines were used when he was 
sentenced to life in prison without parole for conspiracy in the 
Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a petition filed Friday, Nichols argued that a three-judge  
panel at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals erred two weeks ago 
when it rejected his claim that the federal sentencing guidelines 
were flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols also said it was unfair to order him to pay $14.5  
million for his role in the April 1995 bombing, which killed 168 
people. Nichols asked that a full panel of the 10th Circuit 
reconsider the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 43, was found guilty of conspiring to bomb the building  
and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Timothy McVeigh was convicted of first-degree  
murder, conspiracy and weapons-related charges and sentenced to 
death. His sentence was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols also said the judge erred in his instructions to the  
jury during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch should have  
told the jury that Nichols could not be sentenced to life 
imprisonment unless he had ``a specific intent to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted Nichols of first-degree murder and using a  
weapon of mass destruction, and the defense argued that in the 
absence of guilty verdicts on those charges he should have received 
a lighter sentence.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Shells Kosovo Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting has spread to another  
corner of Kosovo, further dimming prospects for a settlement at 
peace talks scheduled to resume next week in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian rebels suffered  
casualties Thursday in battles that raged in the north of the 
Serbian province and also erupted in the southwest for the first 
time in months. 
</P>
<P>
	International mediation efforts to end the year-old war  
continued with talks between Russia's foreign minister and top 
Yugoslav officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But a U.S.-backed peace plan was stalled, with the ethnic  
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army still balking at signing and 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, backed by Moscow, still 
refusing to allow NATO troops to enforce a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be perfectly clear that a political solution must be  
found first,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in 
Belgrade, where he met with his Yugoslav counterpart Zivadin 
Jovanovic on Thursday, ahead of a meeting today with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once a political settlement is achieved, we can talk about its  
implementation with participation of international factors,'' he 
said. ``Russia is ready to contribute, to the extent to which 
Belgrade agrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed in the war in the  
southern province of Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia, and 
over 300,000 have been driven from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	More casualties and refugees were produced in fighting before  
suspended peace talks resume Monday in Paris, with both sides 
provoking each other and jostling for position. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point in the Western-backed peace plan, which calls  
for autonomy for the Albanian-majority province, is the insistence 
by world powers that 28,000 NATO troops police an agreement in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanian rebel leaders who joined in a pledge to sign it  
remain reluctant to do so because of the requirement that the KLA, 
which is fighting for independence, disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Two negotiators, Veton Surroi and Bujar Bukoshi, blamed the head  
of their delegation on Thursday for the failure to sign the peace 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``His behavior is irresponsible,'' said Surroi, referring to  
Hashim Thaci, who has spoken positively of the agreement but 
apparently withheld final support. ``By signing it, we would allow 
the attention to be shifted to Milosevic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes against Yugoslav and Serb targets  
in the event Albanians sign the peace deal and Milosevic does not. 
But many have questioned the will of Western nations to use 
military force against the defiant Serbs during the current 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the House of Representatives on Thursday voted  
219 to 191 for a nonbinding resolution expressing general support 
for the Clinton administration's use of U.S. troops, if necessary, 
as part of a NATO peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo on Thursday, Yugoslav troops pounded ethnic Albanian  
rebel positions near Kosovo's second-largest city, Prizren, sending 
hundreds of ethnic Albanians fleeing the buildup of firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanks and mortars dug in around the village of Hoca Zagradska  
and shelled KLA guerrilla positions about a mile away. The fighting 
was the first in the area since a massive Yugoslav offensive in 
July and August. The Serb-run Media Center said three of the Serb 
forces were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes in the north near the town of Vucitrn killed a Yugoslav  
soldier, according to international monitors, and the KLA said one 
of its fighters also died. Serb authorities denied any deaths on 
their side but said three soldiers were wounded in those battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of refugees remained afraid to return to their homes at  
another recent flashpoint, along the Macedonian border.

<HEADLINE> Lillehammer Bid Deemed Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Lillehammer's bid for the Winter Olympics  
was coldly calculating -- even enlisting Norwegian diplomats to help 
-- but apparently clean. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosures by Norwegian news media Friday came a day after  
the town made available about 20,000 documents relating to its bid 
for the 1992 games, which it lost to Albertville, France, and for 
its successful bid two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehammer is proud of the success of its games, considered  
among the best Winter Olympics. It took the unusual step of 
releasing the documents in an attempt to preserve the town's image 
amid the growing Olympics bribery scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Norwegian news media sent teams of reporters to  
Lillehammer to begin sifting through the documents Thursday, and 
reported Friday that there was no evidence so far of bribery and 
vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also found evidence of behavior that offends  
Norwegians' generally high sense of propriety, notably the use of 
Norway's diplomatic corps to compile background files on 
International Olympic Committee members ahead of their visits to 
Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
	The files contain such information as the member's health,  
alcohol consumption, ethnic origins, families, hobbies and other 
preferences. One dossier included the note that a member's wife 
``was very interested in shopping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every member has a vote. These were our customers, and a  
customer has to be taken care of,'' Petter Ronningen, a Lillehammer 
games top manager, was quoted as telling the newspaper Aftenposten. 
``We had to find out what each one liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the newspaper Dagbladet characterized the files ``expose how  
the city's Olympic bosses, with help from the foreign service, 
cynically evaluated the 90 powerful men of the International 
Olympic Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Foreign Ministry could not immediately be  
reached for comment on whether Norway's diplomats had overstepped 
their bounds by helping prepare such dossiers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Aftenposten, one document gave the bid committee  
the following advice from a Norwegian ambassador: ``Africans can 
well be bribed and Norwegians are usually too honest and lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lillehammer documents gave details of IOC members' wishes to  
be pampered. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee sent a tourist class ticket to Mali's IOC  
member, Lamine Keita, so he could visit Lillehammer. Aftenposten 
said Keita, who was ousted from the IOC in January, said, ``As you 
know, IOC members travel first class. I am returning the ticket for 
rebooking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehammer lavished attention and first-class treatment on IOC  
members, but the newspapers said there was so far no evidence of 
outright corruption. Gifts to IOC members were modest, such as 
sweaters, crystal figurines, silver salt and pepper shakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian news agency NTB said 27 documents were withheld as  
confidential under national law, two files were missing and 
Ronningen had removed two boxes of files as personal property. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaci Kullmann Five, a former leader of the Conservative Party  
and member of the bid committee, said she was shocked that 
Lillehammer had released the dossiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is terrible that information that was given in the greatest  
confidence has now been made public,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Clinton Kosovo Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican led-House is supporting  
President Clinton's plan to send U.S. troops to Kosovo if a peace 
agreement is reached, with some strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects for that peace looked bleak in advance of a  
resumption of talks on Monday in Paris, with neither side in the 
dispute indicating any readiness to sign onto an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 219-191 late Thursday for a resolution  
expressing general support for the administration's proposal to use 
4,000 U.S. troops, if necessary, as part of a NATO peacekeeping 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, whose administration had begged the House not to take  
up the issue until after the next round of peace talks, declared 
himself pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in a statement the ``broad bipartisan support'' for U.S.  
efforts in Kosovo ``sends a clear message to both parties that it's 
time now to sign an agreement that stops the fighting in Kosovo and 
creates real self government for the Kosovar people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four Republicans -- including Speaker Dennis Hastert --  
joined Democrats in support. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House attached some strings -- urging Clinton to report  
to Congress on how long such a deployment would last, how much it 
would cost and whether it would affect overall military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote represented a hard-fought victory for the  
administration, following a day of contentious debate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the key vote of the day, the House turned aside, 237-178, a  
proposal by Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., to protest any American 
troop engagement in the war-torn Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not within our power to solve all the world's  
problems,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it would have been nonbinding, the administration  
warned the amendment's approval seemed certain to sink any 
prospects of reaching a peace agreement in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., voted for the overall resolution and did not  
vote on the Fowler amendment. He said he made up his mind to 
support the president only after hearing all the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a tough decision,'' he said, but ``stopping the  
violence and the barbarity of the combatants ... inspires me to 
vote yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will take up a similar measure next week.  
</P>
<P>
	One influential Democrat, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told  
Clinton that the Senate was also deeply divided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand your concerns over timing,'' Byrd said. However,  
he cautioned the president to stop ``attempting to block 
congressional debate'' and provide Congress with more detailed 
information on his goals in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ``strings'' the House attached to its support was a  
request that Clinton explain the national interest of having U.S. 
troops serve in Kosovo, certifying that the troops would be under a 
U.S. commander, giving a ``timeframe for withdrawal,'' the 
budgetary impact over five years and the overall impact on military 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in my district want to know the exit strategy,'' said  
Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., author of the reporting requirements. 
``Getting answers from the administration is part of our job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats accepted his list of conditions.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 10.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower on worries about earnings  
today, stalling the Dow Jones industrial average's climb toward 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was off 10.26 at 9,887.18 at noon on Wall Street. The  
blue-chip index came within 42 points of 10,000 in early trading 
before giving up ground. On Thursday, the Dow came within 65 points 
of 10,000 before closing at 9,897.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were also down today.  
</P>
<P>
	Disappointing news from Microsoft and software maker Oracle led  
to broad selling in technology stocks. The technology-laden Nasdaq 
composite index was down 17.55 at 2,394.70 . 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle fell 8 1/4 to 28 5/8 after the company's third-quarter sales  
fell short of analysts' expectations. Microsoft was down 2 15/16 at 
158 1/2 after the company said it would defer about $400 million in 
revenue from its third to its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm equipment maker Caterpillar, down 5 1/8 at 45 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, said its first-quarter results would fall far short 
of expectations because of lower machine and engine sales. Also, on 
the Big Board, IBM also fell 4 3/16 to 178 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest NYSE decliners was pharmacy chain Rite Aid,  
which fell 15 to 22, or 40 percent, after warning that its 
first-quarter earnings would also be disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market drop came despite another positive report on  
the U.S. economy. The Labor Department released its Producer Price 
Index, which fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in February, 
indicating that inflation remains under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting some stocks was a move by OPEC officials to cut oil  
production in an attempt to boost sagging crude prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 4.67 to 1,293.01, after  
hitting a high of 1,302.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues had a narrow margin over advancers on the NYSE,  
where volume came to 373.62 million shares, down from 410.23 
million shares at the same time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.11 at 610.56 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.02 at 718.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.09 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 5.31 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
down 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.22 percent.

<HEADLINE> Swingley Maintains Iditarod Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANVIK, Alaska (AP) -- Doug Swingley maintained his lead Friday in  
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, becoming the first musher to 
reach the frozen Yukon River. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, the 1995 winner from Lincoln, Mont., arrived at this  
riverside checkpoint at 11:42 a.m. local time, later sitting down 
to a catered, seven-course dinner after ensuring that his 14-dog 
team had been bedded down. 
</P>
<P>
	He shared the meal with three-time winner Martin Buser of Big  
Lake, who pulled into Anvik at 1:23 p.m. But Swingley declined to 
share the $3,500 in First-to-the-Yukon cash he received. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not giving me half of that dessert?'' Buser teasingly  
asked Swingley. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley also had been first to reach the race's midway point at  
the namesake community of Iditarod, where he collected $3,000 in 
gold dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley's team appeared to be moving about 1 mph faster than  
that of Buser, who has dropped six of the 16 dogs he began the race 
with Saturday in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dogs are running fine,'' Swingley said. ``I'm just having a  
good time. I've been switching some dogs around, the leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was running third, 25 miles behind in  
Shageluk. Swenson is the Iditarod's only five-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
	DeeDee Jonrowe, second last year, was a close fourth Friday  
afternoon, checking in at Shageluk at 1:15 p.m., or a scant 14 
minutes behind Swenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley has managed to hold onto his lead despite two bouts of  
sled trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke a sled runner late Wednesday between Ophir and  
Iditarod, but still was first to the official halfway point. Race 
judges ruled at the time that Swingley's sled was too badly damaged 
for him to continue using it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second broken sled of the race for Swingley.  
</P>
<P>
	He snapped a main stanchion Monday on a rough trail heading into  
the Alaska Range. Using a foot-long piece of willow and several 
hose clamps, he splinted the broken strut and kept it together 
until Takotna, where he had the spare waiting. He later used the 
first sled to replace the damaged spare. 
</P>
<P>
	From Anvik, it's an 18-mile run downriver to Grayling. Mushers  
often encounter face-numbing winds as they peer ahead looking for 
the tripods and taped lath marking that stretch of the trail on the 
Yukon River ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six mushers started the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to  
Nome. Five teams have scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will collect $54,000 from the $450,000 purse. Prize  
money is paid to the first 20 finishers.

<HEADLINE> US, Mexico To Play for Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Regional bragging rights, as well as the  
tournament title, will be at stake in the ``Battle at the Border'' 
-- the U.S. Cup '99 game Saturday between the United States and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries have played 12 times in Southern California  
through the years, but this will be the first time they've met in 
San Diego. A crowd of more than 56,000 is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both us and Mexico feel like we're the best team (in the  
region),'' midfielder Eddie Lewis said. ``They're very confident 
about playing us and we're pretty confident about playing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opened the U.S. Cup with a 3-1 win against  
Guatemala Thursday night at the Los Angeles Coliseum, and Mexico 
beat Bolivia 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we had to play a lot of guys 90 minutes (Thursday  
night), it's going to be an absolute thriller on Saturday,'' Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will be without midfielder Joe-Max Moore's  
valuable experience. He got a red card Thursday night and was 
suspended for Saturday's game. Moore scored a goal against 
Guatemala, his 18th in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to hurt us,'' American coach Bruce Arena said of  
Moore's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's victory lifted the Americans to 3-0-1 in 1999 as they  
attempt to win the U.S. Cup for the third time. They were champions 
in 1992 and '95. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 11 U.S. starters had played in five or fewer  
international matches entering Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to beat the Americans in the United States from  
1976-1996, when it went 0-4-4, Mexico is 2-0-1 against the 
Americans in the United States since then, including a 1-0 victory 
in their last meeting on Feb. 15, 1998, in LA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a pretty fast-paced game, quite a bit of up  
and down,'' forward Brian McBride said. ``It's going to be a 
physical game. We're probably going to need to play some balls out 
on the flank and get the good service and get some guys in the 
middle of the goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Cup is sponsored by Nike.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Elvis Presley Enterprises cannot stop a London  
trader from selling merchandise under the singer's name, the Court 
of Appeal ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel unanimously rejected the appeal by Elvis  
Presley Enterprises, the latest round in a 17-year battle with Sid 
Shaw, owner of a shop called Elvisly Yours. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Justice Simon Brown said in his ruling that there should be  
no ``assumption that only a celebrity or his successors may ever 
market (or license the marketing of) his own character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Monopolies should not be so readily created,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've proved that Elvis belongs to all of us -- Elvis is part of  
our history, part of our culture,'' Shaw told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to put me out of business and they haven't  
succeeded. I'm still here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Appeal refused to allow Elvis Presley Enterprises  
to appeal the decision, but the company could make a direct 
approach to the House of Lords to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw had also won in a lower court in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	That decision led Britain's Trade Mark Registry to refuse an  
application by Princess Diana's estate to copyright her name and 
image.

<HEADLINE> Report: Quebec Paid Olympic Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEBEC (AP) -- The vice president of the Canadian Olympic  
Association and an honorary member of the International Olympic 
Committee were paid to help Quebec City's unsuccessful try to get 
the 2002 Games, according to a published report today. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing documents in the Quebec City bid committee's archives,  
Quebec Le Soleil reported that former Canadian IOC member James 
Worrall received about $25,000 between 1993 and 1995 to escort 
committee members on their visits to Quebec and attend Olympic 
committee functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Worrall, who was an IOC member between 1967 and 1989, charged  
$500 per day for his services. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Sieber, the COA's vice president, was given $60,000 for  
working three years representing Quebec. He also charged $500 per 
day to bring Olympic representatives to Quebec and was paid $21,750 
for working as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Sieber is currently working as a paid consultant for the Toronto  
group seeking the 2008 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Anne Letheren, secretary general of the COA, said the  
committee was aware Sieber was working for the Quebec group and 
that the activity didn't represent a conflict of interest.

	CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico's main leftist party  
presented state authorities Friday with what it described as 
evidence of election fraud in last month's gubernatorial race in 
Guerrero state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Revolution Party lost the Feb. 7 race by a thin  
margin to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, 
which has governed Mexico and the Pacific coast state for 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Revolution accuses the ruling party of handing out  
free food and other goods in exchange for votes. On Friday, it 
presented food packages and kits with school supplies and 
toiletries emblazoned with the name and image of the ruling party's 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Revolution's national chairman, Andres Manuel Lopez  
Obrador, also has accused the PRI of exceeding spending limits and

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Trying to halt a wave of land  
invasions in Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez on Friday visited the 
most affected areas to persuade squatters to leave peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez traveled to the eastern states of Anzoategui and Monagas,  
where an airport, children's playgrounds, vacant lots and even part 
of an army base have been transformed into makeshift shanty towns 
in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, won the  
presidency in December with a platform championing the rights of 
the poor. Many poor Venezuelans see his victory as a chance to 
assert their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez' refusal to call in the National Guard to disperse  
squatters has outraged opposition party leaders and state 
governors. In response, Chavez's defense and interior ministers met 
with 15 state governors Thursday to coordinate efforts to restore 
public order.

	Edesur, a consortium of foreign investors, has indicated its  
willingness to comply but challenges the amount the government says 
it must pay. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the utility took out advertisements in Buenos Aires

	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Want to see two-time MVP Dominik Hasek?  
Forget going to a Buffalo Sabres game. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to catch the world's best goalie these days is to  
check out Marine Midland Arena or Amherst Pepsi Center before 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	All by himself, Hasek braces against an imaginary power play of  
Jaromir Jagr, Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya with some tentative 
starts and stops in the crease. Some bending, stretching, striding. 
Some playful wrist shots at his own open net from the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of sweating. A lot of frowning. A lot of waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I'll be back this week,'' said Hasek, nursing a  
strained groin that has been a much bigger pain than anticipated 
when it flared up four weeks ago. Hasek said he hopes to start 
practicing with the team by Saturday.

	In the meantime, even Hasek's solo appearances are encouraging.  
``Obviously it's a great sign to see him out there,'' coach Lindy 
Ruff said without hinting at a return date. ``There's no timetable. 
The doctor says his strength needs to be improved. That part of it 
is coming. It's improved from last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 games without Hasek, including Thursday's loss to Tampa  
Bay, Buffalo was slightly less than mediocre -- winning three, 
losing four and tying three. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are rudderless without a good goalie. They don't have  
an offense that can come from far behind, having won just one of 21 
games when trailing at the end of one period. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the Sabres don't have a single player among the NHL's  
top 25 scoring leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The most encouraging sign in Hasek's absence has been the play  
of 21-year-old rookie goalie Martin Biron. But mediocrity doesn't 
make it for a team that once stood atop the Eastern Conference and 
now scurries to stay ahead of also-rans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres won't come right out and scream it, but they are more  
than just a little anxious to have their great goalie back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys don't want to talk about it too much because they don't  
want to make it an issue in the locker room,'' Sabres captain 
Michael Peca said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has become an issue on the ice, where the team achieved  
success early this season even while struggling offensively. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Hasek was leading the league in save percentage  
(.935) and shutouts with eight when he got hurt in a 3-2 overtime 
loss to Toronto on Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's goalies this season have the third-best goals-against  
average, behind only Dallas and Ottawa. That includes the 52 games 
Hasek has played. 
</P>
<P>
	Biron, in only his third NHL start and first of the season,  
backstopped a 2-1 win over Dallas on March 5. Biron came back two 
nights later and made 30 saves to preserve a 1-1 tie with 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dwayne Roloson has floundered and gotten the hook in three  
of his last four games. In Monday's 4-1 road loss to Carolina 
Roloson and the team caved in as the Hurricanes scored four goals 
in 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he worried about Roloson's confidence, Ruff said, ``You  
have to worry about him. He didn't get a lot of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether intending to or not, the Sabres clearly have played  
better for Biron than for Roloson. ``That is hard to explain,'' 
Ruff said. ``I don't think the players didn't want to play for 
Dwayne. It's not about playing for Dwayne or playing for Marty 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's about needing Hasek. And cranking up the offense.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the No. 1 player on the team,'' Sabres defenseman Alexei  
Zhitnik said. ``But we've got to find a way to score goals. It 
doesn't matter how good a goalie you are. When you're facing 25 or 
30 shots in two periods, that's a lot of work for anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca cautioned against rushing Hasek back. ``It's the type of  
injury that can really keep you on the sidelines for awhile, so 
he's doing the right thing staying out. We're getting close to the 
playoffs. That's where we want him 100 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Zito Has 2 Chances at Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Trainer Nick Zito called an audible  
after the Fountain of Youth Stakes, and in Saturday's $750,000 
Florida Derby he'll find out if his strategy worked. 
</P>
<P>
	In his quest to get to the Kentucky Derby on May 1, Zito shelved  
his first team of The Groom Is Red and Doneraile Court in favor of 
up-and-coming 3-year-olds Wondertross and Adonis for the 1 1/8-mile 
Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, when things don't work out well you have to change  
your plan,'' Zito said. ``Things didn't work out well in the 
Fountain of Youth, so we'll go to Plan B and try these two and see 
if it works out better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Groom Is Red and Doneraile Court finished seventh and 10th,  
respectively, in the Fountain of Youth on Feb. 20. They are now 
being pointed to the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes at Turfway Park 
on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, the Fountain of Youth winner, is the 3-1 favorite for the  
Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park, while the D. Wayne Lukas trained 
Cat Thief is the 4-1 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven horses were entered, but the filly Three Ring may be  
scratched because of an unfavorable outside post position. If Three 
Ring doesn't run Saturday, she would go in the Bonnie Miss Stakes 
for fillies Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Carl Nafzger also revealed that Vicar had minor throat  
surgery for an entrapped epiglottis on Jan. 19, three days after 
his fifth-place finish in the Holy Bull Stakes. In his other four 
starts, Vicar was first three times and second once. 
</P>
<P>
	Wondertross, owned by New York Yankees boss George Steinbrenner  
and William Condren, is the more seasoned of Zito's entries. The 
son of Chief's Crown won his only start as a 3-year-old, an 
allowance race at Gulfstream last month, and he'll be ridden by 
Jerry Bailey. Wondertross is 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis, owned by Ernie Paragallo, has won his last two starts,  
both allowances, and has impressed Zito enough to earn a start 
Saturday. Adonis, a 10-1 shot, will have Jorge Chavez -- 
Gulfstream's leading rider -- aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's come on like gangbusters lately, and he's training  
well,'' Zito said. ``He has good credentials, and we'll take a 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Zito knows the Derby trail well, having won the  
race with Strike the Gold in 1991 and Go for Gin in 1994. But he's 
0-for-10 in the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough race,'' Zito said. ``The toughest horses in  
the country, at least the East coast, will be running in it. I'm 
happy that I have a couple of horses I think deserve a shot at 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito also trains Stephen Got Even, who is set for the Tampa Bay  
Derby on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby is one of several Derby prep races this  
weekend, and Zito isn't the only trainer looking to ``qualify'' for 
the Run for the Roses. He's also got Bob Baffert and D. Wayne Lukas 
to contend with, and combined, the trio has won the past five 
Kentucky Derbys. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert won the last two with Real Quiet and Silver Charm, Lukas  
won with Grindstone in '96 and Thunder Gulch in '95 and Zito's Go 
for Gin won in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Baffert's Brigade is at six as he tries for an  
unprecedented third consecutive Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a trainer have so much going for him,'' Zito  
said of Baffert, who has five of his horses running this weekend at 
Santa Anita Park and the Fair Grounds. ``It's scary. I can't 
remember anyone having so many chances, and the way his horses are 
running, he's already there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Zito isn't, which is why the Florida Derby will be a bit  
nerve-wracking. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can listen to the band playing all you want,'' Zito said,  
``but you have to qualify to be able to march.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert has the busiest weekend of all. On Saturday, he sends  
out current Derby favorite Exploit and Prime Timber in the San 
Felipe at Santa Anita and the filly Silverbulletday in the Fair 
Grounds Oaks; on Sunday, it's General Challenge in the Louisiana 
Derby and the filly Excellent Meeting in the Santa Anita Oaks.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Seeks Nuclear Shipments Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The state of New Mexico and environmentalists  
urged a federal judge today to block the Energy Department from 
shipping, perhaps within weeks, the first truck loads of nuclear 
waste to a permanent underground storage site in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, asking for a federal injunction, argued that such  
shipments would violate state law and disrupt New Mexico's 
consideration of a permit for disposal of hazardous waste at the 
federal site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has agreed to hold off shipments for 11  
days and U.S. District Judge John Harrington Penn indicated he 
would decide on whether to issue an injunction within that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government argued that the Waste Isolation Pilot  
Project near Carlsbad, N.M., where the wastes from other federal 
facilities would be stored 2,000 feet underground is safe and ready 
to accept shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department wants to ship, as soon as possible, 36  
drums of radioactive waste from its Los Alamos National Laboratory, 
also in New Mexico, and before the end of April begin shipments 
from its facility in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction request addresses only the Los Alamos waste, but  
government attorneys argued a delay there would jeopardize 
shipments from other sites as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lindsay Lovejoy, New Mexico's deputy attorney general,  
argued there's no urgency to ship the Los Alamos waste to WIPP, as 
the facility near Carlsbad commonly is called. He said the state 
probably will issue its permit by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can bring in the waste before the permit, we might as  
well not have a permitting process,'' Lovejoy told Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorneys said the wastes at Los Alamos are not  
subject to a hazardous waste permit because they are considered 
``non-mixed wastes,'' meaning while they are radioactive they do 
not contain toxic chemicals subject to the state hazardous waste 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department attorney Wendy Blake argued that the WIPP  
site is ``legally opened and determined to be safe'' and there is 
no reason to block the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	To the contrary, she maintained, delaying the shipments would  
set back the government's broader cleanup efforts at some two dozen 
sites were radioactive waste currently is held, awaiting opening of 
WIPP. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn pressed Blake on what harm she could show if waste  
shipments were delayed until the end of the year when a state 
permit was, according to the state, likely to be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake said there was no assurance the state would issue a permit  
that soon and that the wastes pose a risk to the public and 
environment because the current temporary storage sites ``do not 
offer the level of protection that WIPP does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Ward, an attorney representing four environmental groups  
that joined the state in seeking the injunction, countered that the 
Energy Department has never said the waste is not safe where it 
currently is being stored. 
</P>
<P>
	The arguments could also affect the shipments from Idaho.  
</P>
<P>
	Under a legal consent agreement with Idaho, the state has  
committed to begin moving wastes from that facility by the end of 
April. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has said if the Idaho 
wastes can't be sent to WIPP, he will have to begin moving it 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental groups joining the state of New Mexico at  
today's hearing were the Natural Resources Defense Council, the 
Environmental Defense Fund, the Concerned Citizens for Nuclear 
Safety in Santa Fe, N.M., and the Southwest Research and 
Information Center in Albuquerque, N.M.

                            *Les Barcus    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Les Barcus, inventor of an electronic  
pickup that could be used on an array of instruments from acoustic 
guitars to flutes, died March 4 at age 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barcus-Berry pickup, first produced in the 1960s, allowed  
clear amplification of traditional non-electric instruments and led 
to new possibilities in performance. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, John Berry brought him a violin, hoping Barcus could  
improve its recorded sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcus built a small transducer that picked up the energy  
reverberating from the strings as it passed to the bridge of the 
instrument. The invention led to formation of Barcus-Berry Inc., 
which began operation in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcus was the technical wizard; Berry, a classical musician,  
tested his new pickups and handled the business.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Muriel Bentley, a leading dancer with the  
American Ballet Theatre for more than 15 years, died Monday of 
heart failure. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bentley was best known for her work in choreographer Jerome  
Robbins' ``Fancy Free'' and her role as Lizzie Borden's ill-fated 
stepmother in Agnes de Mille's 1948 ``Fall River Legend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also won critical acclaim for her acting in Antony Tudor's  
``Pillar of Fire'' and ``Shadow of the Wind'' and Ms. DeMille's 
``Tally Ho.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Harry Ford, a leading poetry editor, died March  
5 of a heart attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was the senior poetry editor at Alfred A. Knopf publishing  
house and had edited the work of poets including Wallace Stevens, 
Langston Hughes, Richard Wilbur, Howard Moss and Mark Strand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford joined Knopf in 1947 as an assistant production manager and  
design director, and worked with poets on the side. He did not turn 
fully to poetry until after he joined Atheneum, a publishing house 
created by Alfred Knopf Jr., in 1959. 
</P>
<P>

	LONDON (AP) -- Violinist Yehudi Menuhin, whose astonishing  
youthful virtuosity grew into one of the great musical talents of 
the 20th century, died Friday of pneumonia and heart failure. He 
was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin was both an American citizen and a British subject, and  
was made a baron in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin was only 7 when he astonished a San Francisco audience  
with a brilliant debut violin performance. Four years later, he 
played at New York's Carnegie Hall with the New York Symphony 
Orchestra. By 13, he had already won accolades in Berlin, Paris and 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, Menuhin gave 500 concerts for U.S. and  
Allied troops and for Red Cross funds. He offended many Israelis, 
however, by performing for Germans in Berlin only two years after 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded the Yehudi Menuhin School of Music at Stoke  
d'Abernon, Surrey, in 1963 to combine scholastic and musical 
training from an early age.

	LINCOLNVILLE, Maine (AP) -- Bidu Sayao, the Brazilian-born  
soprano whose pure, silvery voice and personal charm made her one 
of the most beloved opera singers of the 1930s and '40s, died 
Friday from complications of pneumonia. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayao's crystalline voice enchanted conductor Arturo Toscanini,  
and he trained her for her U.S. debut in Carnegie Hall in 1934. She 
made a triumphant Metropolitan Opera debut during the 1936-37 
season singing the title role of Massenet's ``Manon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her Met career covered 236 performances in 12 roles and lasted  
until 1952. It included such lyric and coloratura soprano roles as 
Mimi in Puccini's ``La Boheme,'' Melisande in Debussy's ``Pelleas 
and Melisande'' and Susanna in Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was noted for her warmth and refinement and an ability to  
bring her frequently girlish characters to life without resorting 
to mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayao also made extensive concert tours, performing in 49  
states. To show her gratitude for her adopted homeland, Sayao sang 
for wounded soldiers returning from World War II. She became a U.S. 
citizen in 1959.

	MILTON, Mass. (AP) -- Dr. Eugene R. Sullivan, who established a  
system of mobile blood banks credited with saving many lives during 
World War II, died March 3. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan, a microbiologist and specialist in internal medicine,  
was awarded the Legion of Merit for establishing the blood bank 
system while he was an officer in the Army Medical Corps during the 
campaigns in North Africa and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The blood transfusion units collected more than 35 tons of blood  
and distributed it to hospitals without ``known error, mishap, or 
spoilage,'' said the citation accompanying the award. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Sullivan directed clinical laboratories and the  
blood bank at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Boston's 
Jamaica Plain section. 
</P>
<P>
	He did research in the laboratory of Nobel laureate John Enders  
at Harvard and worked on an influenza vaccine in the laboratory of 
Tom Francis at the University of Michigan.

<HEADLINE> New Web Site Offers Underseas View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- No swimsuit or oxygen tank is required  
for this underwater exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Web site being launched today by the Harbor Branch  
Oceanographic Institution allows anyone with Internet access to 
come face-to-screen with a shark or to watch when researchers 
discover a new species 3,000 feet below the ocean's surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like looking over their shoulder,'' said Mary Clark,  
director of the media lab at Harbor Branch. ``It's reality-based. 
It's not dramatized. It's what's really happening out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site, www.at-sea.org, will include daily dispatches from  
Harbor Branch marine science expeditions worldwide. Those include 
studies of all sorts of marine life, the search for new medicines 
or climate research. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cover ocean science adventures -- real frontier  
stuff,'' said Sean Kelley, Web master at Harbor Branch. ``People we 
run into in the lunch line just came back from 3,000 feet below the 
ocean. We want to get those stories out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first dispatches start today via e-mail from the research  
ship where Sam Gruber, a University of Miami scientist, is studying 
yellow sharks off the coast of Brazil. The updates will include 
video clips. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sea also is planning to broadcast dispatches from a research  
buoy in the Bahamas. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration plans to use the buoy to record the sound of rain on 
the ocean's surface and measure rainfall amounts in remote areas, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers at the facility about 150 miles north of Miami  
have long been known for cutting-edge work. A submersible sphere 
developed there was used to help search for the remains of the 
space shuttle Challenger after it exploded off Florida's coast. The 
submersibles also allow researchers to troll the depths for 
undiscovered species.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Hits Alaska Ski Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GIRDWOOD, Alaska (AP) -- Mary Ann Nickles was enjoying an  
afternoon of skiing at Alyeska Resort when snowboarders whizzed 
past, yelling ``Avalanche!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked over my shoulder and started poling faster,'' Nickles  
said. ``I thought I could outrun it, but the edge got me. It was 
very fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles, 64, of Fairbanks, was buried up to her neck Friday by a  
cornice of snow that broke loose. The snow's weight immobilized her 
body, but others on the mountain dug her out quickly and she was 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	A second woman was also buried by the avalanche, but she too was  
found quickly and treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing that others may have been trapped, more than 100  
volunteers searched the slide area for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Lined up shoulder to shoulder, they plunged long plastic poles  
down into the snow at 1-foot intervals. They halted the search 
after finding no one else. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain manager Larry Daniels said he was almost certain no one  
else was buried. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we haven't found them by now, chances are they're not  
there,'' Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyeska is about 40 miles southeast of Anchorage.

<HEADLINE> Watch Out for Credit Card Fees / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Neatly packaged with come-hither features like  
single-digit interest rates, no annual fees, and rebates galore, 
today's credit cards look mighty appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the allure often ends where the dull, tiny print begins.  
</P>
<P>
	More and more, the great deals consumers thought they were  
getting are being offset by hidden fees and penalties. Among them: 
rising late and over-limit fees, higher rates on late payments, 
shorter grace periods and changing interest computations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some households are only now learning how expensive their cards  
can be as they continue to tackle their holiday bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation proposed March 2 by Democratic lawmakers would  
require, among other things, that credit card companies spell out 
terms and conditions so that they are easier to read and 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers need to remember that issuers can change terms and  
conditions, including rates and fees, almost at will,'' said 
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of 
America, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington that 
supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Card companies are required to notify customers of any changes,  
though many do so in small-print notices, Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legislation would ... make it far more difficult for  
issuers to impose unfair charges,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders, for their part, contend that higher fees and other  
recent changes are a necessary part of doing business, as well as a 
way to offset losses from bad debt. The number of Americans filing 
personal bankruptcy last year reached a record 1.4 million, up more 
than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts say credit card issuers also are seeking to  
maximize fees because intense competition and prevailing low 
interest rates have been squeezing profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they go out for new card customers they've got to  
practically give it away to them,'' said Robert B. McKinley, 
president of CardWeb.com Inc., a credit card research firm based in 
Frederick, Md. ``So, they make it very appealing on the front end -- 
with low teaser rates and no annual fees -- where all the pressure 
is, and make up for it on the back end. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley says the higher-fee movement began about 18 months ago,  
and late fees and over-limit fees alone have soared around 60 
percent in that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the more recent changes that consumers should watch for  
include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Reducing or eliminating grace periods. In the past, issuers  
gave customers extra days to mail in a payment after the due date 
before it's considered late -- usually five to 15 days. Now, they 
may charge a late fee if it arrives even a day late. Also, no 
interest was charged if full payment was made within 30 days of 
receiving the monthly statement, but in some instances that grace 
period has been reduced to 20 or 25 days. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising late fees. Those who pay late are commonly charged a  
late fee. The average amount these days is $22.89, up from $19.30 
last year and nearly double the $11.71 average just five years ago, 
according to CardWeb. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising rates on late payments. Some customers who are late  
with a payment may have to pay a higher interest rate. The more 
often they're late, the higher the rate. The highest ``punitive 
rate'' averages 25 percent, CardWeb says. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising over-limit fees. Those who have exceeded their credit  
limit, also may be charged a fee. The current average: $22.02, up 
from $18.46 last year and $12.50 in 1994, CardWeb found. 
</P>
<P>
	--Changing interest computations. Some card issuers now compute  
interest on a daily basis instead of monthly basis. Also, some 
companies are switching to a ``two-cycle'' billing method, which 
doesn't mean anything for those who pay the balance in full and on 
time each month. But it catches those who pay in full sometimes; 
they're charged interest from the date of purchase, essentially a 
two-month interest charge. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reducing required minimums. Some companies have been reducing  
the required minimum payments. That means the issuer can earn extra 
interest over the life of the debt, but it takes much longer to pay 
off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who may have been hit with a fee, consumer groups  
suggest protesting to the issuer. In some instances, it may remove 
the penalty at least one time. Switching to another card is another 
option, but be sure to read the fine print before making any 
decisions.

<HEADLINE> Dylan Thomas Poems Set to Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three poems by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, set to  
music by an American composer, are getting their world premiere 
from the National Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-minute work by composer John Corigliano, led by orchestra  
director Leonard Slatkin, was first performed Thursday night at the 
Kennedy Center. It was to be repeated throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Corigliano, 61, has been working on the composition on and off  
since he was 22. Portions have been performed before, but now it's 
been revised and completed. Corigliano is best known for ``The 
Ghosts of Versailles,'' the first American work commissioned by the 
Metropolitan Opera of New York in a quarter century, which 
premiered in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people use the word 'accessible' (for his music),''  
Slatkin said. ``I think that's true, but they see it as a negative. 
Just because he's able to write a good tune and just because his 
music is engrossing in an emotional, dramatic way, I think that's a 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trilogy includes ``Fern Hill'' and ``Poem in October'' --  
dense, difficult and rather gloomy poems written on the poet's 30th 
and 35th birthdays. Completed by an ``Author's Prologue,'' 
Corigliano calls it ``a memory play in the form of an oratorio.'' 
Thomas died in 1953 at 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The 102-line prologue has an unusual form: Thomas rhymed the  
first line with the 102d, the second line with the 101st, the third 
with the 100th -- and so on, until the middle lines form a rhymed 
pair: 
</P>
<P>
	``Sheep white hollow farms  
</P>
<P>
	``To Wales in my arms.''  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a full-size symphony orchestra and chorus -- over  
100 performers -- the piece calls for such additional instruments as 
an anvil, whip and tom-toms.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Vows $100M for Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Philip Morris, the world's largest  
cigarette-maker, is pledging $100 million in food and financial 
assistance to battle hunger over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no problem more basic, more fundamental to human  
dignity than hunger,'' said Gil Llanas, corporate contributions 
manager with Miller Brewing Co., a subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos. 
</P>
<P>
	Llanas and other corporate, agriculture and relief agency  
officials attended the second annual North Carolina Food Recovery 
Summit here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris plans to distribute $50 million in cash to  
organizations in all 50 states. The company also will donate $50 
million worth of food -- enough for 30 million to 40 million meals -- 
to Chicago-based Second Harvest, a national network of food banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a woolly-headed dreamer,'' said Doug O'Brien, director  
of public policy and research at Second Harvest. ``Ending hunger is 
something that is reachable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World, an  
international Christian organization, said while the number of 
people suffering from hunger has declined worldwide in the past 25 
years, hunger has increased in the United States and sub-Saharan 
Africa.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs $1.3B Disaster Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring a White House veto threat, a House  
committee approved a $1.3 billion measure Thursday that offers 
hurricane relief aid for Central America. Passage came after 
Republicans included cuts in foreign aid and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill, which also contains help for Jordan and  
American farmers, was approved by the House Appropriations 
Committee by voice vote. The full House may debate the legislation 
in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew had sent committee leaders a  
letter warning of a veto by President Clinton because the bill's 
cuts ``would seriously undermine America's capacity to pursue its 
foreign policy objectives and promote our economic security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said the spending  
reductions could be made ``without causing any real, serious 
damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was little dispute over the package's contents. But the  
bitter fight over paying for it underlines how pervasive this 
year's partisan duel over Social Security has become. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts, approved by a party line 34-26 vote, were aimed at  
letting Republicans argue the bill mostly is financed without 
reducing this year's expected budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	That surplus, expected to be $111 billion, comes exclusively  
from Social Security. Both parties are vying to be seen as 
protecting the popular program. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the $1.1 billion in spending cuts by the Republicans are  
$648 million the United States has set aside to help the World Bank 
repay defaulted loans, plus $150 million for purchasing Russian 
plutonium and uranium so it will not be used for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wanted to tap the surplus to pay for most of the  
package. Republicans said their savings came from money that would 
not have been spent this year anyway, and that affected programs 
still had funds left over to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it is going to cause any heartburn anywhere,''  
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said reducing the loan reserves could help destabilize  
an already shaky world economy, while cutting money for Russian 
nuclear material could make that country less likely to turn over 
those stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``What citizens are you willing to risk'' by cutting that money,  
asked Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill contains $968 million to help Central America recover  
from a series of recent natural disasters. The chief targets are 
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica, who were battered 
last October by Hurricane Mitch, which killed 9,000 people and 
caused devastating damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee decided not to pay for $195 million in costs the  
U.S. military has incurred helping those countries rebuild after 
Mitch. By voice vote, the panel rejected an amendment by Rep. Todd 
Tiahrt, R-Kan., that would have trimmed many domestic programs to 
pay for those expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains $152 million to help U.S. farmers hurt by  
low export prices, and $100 million for Jordan in the wake of King 
Hussein's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included was $91 million for several domestic programs,  
with nearly $6 million to make repairs in the building used as a 
dormitory by Congress' high school-age pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a similar measure  
March 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has criticized its cuts in food  
stamps and welfare, as well as a provision that would prohibit the 
federal government from sharing any proceeds from a settlement 
between the states and the tobacco industry.

	NATO Adds Three New Members  
</P>
<P>
	INDEPENDENCE, MO. (AP)-- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic  
today became full-fledged members of NATO, less than a decade after	
exchanging communist rule for democracy and shedding their Cold War	
military ties to the Soviet Union. Secretary of State Madeleine	
Albright accepted admission papers from the three countries'	
foreign ministers, marking their formal entry into the 50-year-old	
alliance. ``Hungary has come home. We are back in the family,''	
Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said.

	HOPE, Ark. (AP) -- William Jefferson Clinton returned to a place

wind and persistent rain threatened to mar the outdoor ceremony in 
the small Arkansas town that candidate Clinton said he still 
believed in in 1992, and where the president buried his mother, 
Virginia Kelly, in 1994. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton remained 
in Washington.

year's budget to enhance security at embassies. Adm. William Crowe

platform. ``Where there are differences, such as on the question of 
abortion, I think we should just recognize ... the existence of a

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Names Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder named a  
low-key economics expert as Germany's new finance minister today 
and was nominated himself to head the governing Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Democrats' executive committee backed Schroeder's  
choice of outgoing Hesse state governor Hans Eichel to replace 
Oskar Lafontaine as finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves consolidate Schroeder's grip on power a day after the  
left-leaning Lafontaine's stunning resignation from both 
influential posts, and give Schroeder the chance to reshape his 
4-month-old government after a shaky start. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder also was chosen to head the party, concentrating  
critical decision-making in one post. He must be confirmed by a 
vote of the full party at a congress. No date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	How quickly Schroeder could assert authority over a party whose  
left-wing views him with suspicion was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not represent the breadth of the party,'' Andrea  
Nahles, head of the Social Democrats' youth wing, said on ZDF 
television today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine, on the other hand, enjoyed strong party loyalty,  
which he used to quash infighting after taking over the Social 
Democrats in 1995. He was credited with a large share of their 
victory over conservative Helmut Kohl in elections last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine's exit came amid reports of a power struggle with  
Schroeder over the finance minister's controversial tax reform. But 
SPD officials said the plan probably won't be amended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we got rid of the tax reform now, one could declare a state  
of ruin for the country,'' said Joachim Poss, the finance spokesman 
for SPD lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation also served as a warning to the environmentalist  
Greens, who have strained the coalition by pushing for immediate 
closure of nuclear power plants and other projects that reflect 
their ideology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greens had some sympathies for Lafontaine, and leaders of  
the party appeared shaken Thursday night. But they said they were 
confident the coalition would hold. 
</P>
<P>
	To back that up, coalition leaders announced agreement late  
Thursday on a proposed new citizenship law after weeks of 
squabbling between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine did not give a reason for his resignation, but he  
unsettled financial markets with persistent calls for Europe's 
central bank to lower interest rates to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists blamed his attempt to exert political influence  
over monetary policy for the weak start of the new European single 
currency, the euro, which lost 7 percent of its value since its 
Jan. 1 launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders welcomed Lafontaine's exit. Dieter Hundt, head  
of the German Employers' Association, said it ``cleared the way for 
a new beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathias Joerrs, an analyst at BHF Bank, said Schroeder now had  
the chance to put his stamp on economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One approach has been tried now, and that has failed,'' he  
said on n-tv television. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichel, 57, was coordinator for finance policy for Germany's  
SPD-dominated states. He adheres to Social Democratic values of 
relieving the burden on the average taxpayer and providing a strong 
safety social net, but is considered less radically leftist than 
Lafontaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Popular as governor of Hesse state, Eichel lost the post last  
month in an election that turned on opposition to the government's 
plan to grant dual citizenship to many foreigners. He is to 
formally step down April 7.

<HEADLINE> Zito Has 2 Chances at Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Trainer Nick Zito called an audible  
after the Fountain of Youth Stakes, and in Saturday's $750,000 
Florida Derby he'll find out if his strategy worked. 
</P>
<P>
	In his quest to get to the Kentucky Derby on May 1, Zito shelved  
his first team of The Groom Is Red and Doneraile Court in favor of 
up-and-coming 3-year-olds Wondertross and Adonis for the 1 1/8-mile 
Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, when things don't work out well you have to change  
your plan,'' Zito said. ``Things didn't work out well in the 
Fountain of Youth, so we'll go to Plan B and try these two and see 
if it works out better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Groom Is Red and Doneraile Court finished seventh and 10th,  
respectively, in the Fountain of Youth on Feb. 20. They are now 
being pointed to the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes at Turfway Park 
on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, the Fountain of Youth winner, is the 3-1 favorite for the  
Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park, while the D. Wayne Lukas trained 
Cat Thief is the 4-1 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven horses were entered, but the filly Three Ring may be  
scratched because of an unfavorable outside post position. If Three 
Ring doesn't run Saturday, she would go in the Bonnie Miss Stakes 
for fillies Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Carl Nafzger also revealed that Vicar had minor throat  
surgery for an entrapped epiglottis on Jan. 19, three days after 
his fifth-place finish in the Holy Bull Stakes. In his other four 
starts, Vicar was first three times and second once. 
</P>
<P>
	Wondertross, owned by New York Yankees boss George Steinbrenner  
and William Condren, is the more seasoned of Zito's entries. The 
son of Chief's Crown won his only start as a 3-year-old, an 
allowance race at Gulfstream last month, and he'll be ridden by 
Jerry Bailey. Wondertross is 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis, owned by Ernie Paragallo, has won his last two starts,  
both allowances, and has impressed Zito enough to earn a start 
Saturday. Adonis, a 10-1 shot, will have Jorge Chavez -- 
Gulfstream's leading rider -- aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's come on like gangbusters lately, and he's training  
well,'' Zito said. ``He has good credentials, and we'll take a 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Zito knows the Derby trail well, having won the  
race with Strike the Gold in 1991 and Go for Gin in 1994. But he's 
0-for-10 in the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough race,'' Zito said. ``The toughest horses in  
the country, at least the East coast, will be running in it. I'm 
happy that I have a couple of horses I think deserve a shot at 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito also trains Stephen Got Even, who is set for the Tampa Bay  
Derby on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby is one of several Derby prep races this  
weekend, and Zito isn't the only trainer looking to ``qualify'' for 
the Run for the Roses. He's also got Bob Baffert and D. Wayne Lukas 
to contend with, and combined, the trio has won the past five 
Kentucky Derbys. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert won the last two with Real Quiet and Silver Charm, Lukas  
won with Grindstone in '96 and Thunder Gulch in '95 and Zito's Go 
for Gin won in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Baffert's Brigade is at six as he tries for an  
unprecedented third consecutive Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a trainer have so much going for him,'' Zito  
said of Baffert, who has five of his horses running this weekend at 
Santa Anita Park and the Fair Grounds. ``It's scary. I can't 
remember anyone having so many chances, and the way his horses are 
running, he's already there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Zito isn't, which is why the Florida Derby will be a bit  
nerve-wracking. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can listen to the band playing all you want,'' Zito said,  
``but you have to qualify to be able to march.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert has the busiest weekend of all. On Saturday, he sends  
out current Derby favorite Exploit and Prime Timber in the San 
Felipe at Santa Anita and the filly Silverbulletday in the Fair 
Grounds Oaks; on Sunday, it's General Challenge in the Louisiana 
Derby and the filly Excellent Meeting in the Santa Anita Oaks.

<HEADLINE> Film Reel Running Out of Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The curtain appears to be lowering on a  
longtime Hollywood symbol -- the film reel. 
</P>
<P>
	With the advent of the digital theaters and projectors, the  
movie industry is embarking on the biggest technological change 
since sound and color became part of motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the revolution is director George Lucas, whose eagerly  
anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
Phantom Menace,'' will be shown this May in four digitally equipped 
theaters. In two to five years, increasing numbers of movie houses 
could go digital as exhibitors work out technical and business 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very dedicated and very enthusiastic about the digital  
cinema,'' Lucas told thousands of theater operators at the ShoWest 
convention late Wednesday. He cited the ``quality, the savings in 
cost and the ability to do things that just aren't possible 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In digital cinema, the movies are shot on film and then  
converted to a digital format, though soon the work may also be 
shot on digital cameras. The completed movies are distributed from 
studio to theaters by satellite, over fiber-optic cable or on 
special discs. 
</P>
<P>
	The movies are shown on a digital projector, a significant  
upgrade from the standard film projector whose basic technology has 
barely changed since Edison's Kinetoscope in 1891. It used George 
Eastman's celluloid film on 35 mm stock -- the same as today. 
</P>
<P>
	One digital projector, developed by Texas Instruments, creates a  
screen image by bouncing light off 1.3 million microscopic mirrors 
squeezed onto a square-inch chip. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the digital tools will be a pricey investment for  
theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
	A digital projector runs about $100,000, compared to about  
$30,000 for a standard projector. But digital technology allows 
theaters more flexibility in show times and the number of screens 
showing a particular movie, since theaters aren't limited by a 
finite number of film prints. 
</P>
<P>
	While the technology will be a boost to convenience, audiences  
are likely to see only minor differences in quality. 
</P>
<P>
	A demonstration at ShoWest on Wednesday, with film and digital  
scenes projected side-by-side on a big screen, revealed digital 
movie quality is now as good -- and in some respects better -- than 
film, with a cleaner, sharper image that won't show wear and tear 
with repeated showings. 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem with digital appeared to be color, with white  
tones taking on a yellow tint, the blues becoming purplish and skin 
tones giving actresses in the demonstration an artificial, almost 
mannequin-like complexion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed with the quality. It's almost to the  
point where it's ready,'' said Mike Goakey, director of 
construction for Signature Theaters, with 145 screens in California 
and Hawaii. ``I think the big issue is going to be the money end of 
it.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal Trial Targets Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In the opening hours of Susan  
McDougal's trial, prosecutor Kenneth Starr's message to the jury 
has seemed to be that he wants President Clinton to be the 
defendant as much as Clinton's former Whitewater business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors brandished their prize exhibit in the case --  
a $27,600 check from James and Susan McDougal's savings and loan 
made payable to ``Bill Clinton'' -- and juxtaposed it with the 
president's testimony that he'd never taken out a loan from the 
S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial features James McDougal speaking from the grave. The  
medium is one of Starr's investigators, FBI agent and accountant 
Mike Patkus, who has spent five years investigating Clinton. Patkus 
testified that McDougal tipped him in 1996 that there had been a 
loan to Clinton, contrary to what the president had said under 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus spent many days rummaging through the failed financial  
institution's records before he found the 1982 check to Clinton on 
microfilm. A garage mechanic later pulled the original from the 
trunk of a tornado-damaged car abandoned 10 years ago by a McDougal 
S&AMP;L employee who had brought the vehicle in for transmission 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be his last effort against the president, Starr is  
putting Mrs. McDougal on trial for criminal contempt and 
obstruction because she won't say what she knows about the Clinton 
loan. She endorsed a separate check that helped pay it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's overall investigation appears to be in its waning days,  
and departures are depleting his staff: The latest, spokesman 
Charles Bakaly, was knocked out this week in an investigation of a 
leak of information to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Robert Bittman has left for a law firm. Another  
deputy, Solomon Weisenberg, is doing likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors have even admitted in court that their  
investigation of the Clintons is at an impasse, possibly 
permanently, which is why they are putting Mrs. McDougal on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people with detailed information about the matters  
under investigation in Whitewater stands at three -- Susan McDougal 
and the Clintons, prosecutor Mark Barrett told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Casting Clinton as the invisible defendant is ``embarrassing and  
unfortunate'' for ``a sitting president, but this is the crime Mrs. 
McDougal is charged with and this is the government's proof,'' said 
St. John's University law professor John Barrett, a former 
Iran-Contra prosecutor and no relation to the prosecutor in the 
McDougal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the case is demonstrating that ``she was and is a  
relevant witness in this investigation of Clinton,'' said the law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	So far at the trial the prosecutors have said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Starr's FBI agents found a handwritten sheet among the S&AMP;L's  
records that calculated down to the penny the amount of money that 
Mrs. McDougal included in a check to help pay off the Clinton loan. 
A separate sheet in different handwriting and also buried in the 
institution's records listed the S&AMP;L's borrowers as including ``B 
Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- James McDougal told Starr's office that he had gotten Clinton  
to sign papers for the loan but McDougal destroyed the records 
after the loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There is a link between the Clinton loan and a fraudulent  
$300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 3 1/2 years later. The Clinton loan was 
paid off with another loan from the McDougals' S&AMP;L that listed 
Whitewater real estate salesman Chris Wade as the borrower. 
Whitewater's checking account provided funds to pay off the Wade 
loan. The Whitewater payment was covered with a bank loan, which in 
turn was paid off with the fraudulent loan to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Susan McDougal ever talk?  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, promises that she will, by taking the  
stand in her defense. If Geragos doesn't ask her about the Clinton 
loan, Starr's deputies promise that they will. 
</P>
<P>
	``She smiled ... like maybe she knows the answers,'' said Starr  
prosecutor Hickman Ewing, who has been watching Mrs. McDougal as 
she listens to Patkus testify.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Dedicates Ark. Birthplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOPE, Ark. (AP) -- One month to the day after he was acquitted in  
the Senate impeachment trial, William Jefferson Clinton returned to 
a place called Hope to dedicate his birthplace as a historical 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold wind and persistent rain threatened to mar the outdoor  
ceremony in the small Arkansas town that candidate Clinton said he 
still believed in in 1992, and where the president buried his 
mother, Virginia Kelly, in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But the weather didn't dampen the enthusiasm of the president or  
the throng of school children who greeted him at the airport. He 
reminded them that, like them, he hailed from a small town. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of what I learned that was good, that I took with me for  
the rest of my life, I learned back then,'' he said. ``It doesn't 
matter were you came from in life, it matters what you did with 
your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton has employed subtle symbols as he seeks to move  
beyond the impeachment drama, the White House cast this visit as 
more of a sentimental journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is certainly looking forward to going back home  
to Hope to dedicate his boyhood home so others can visit it as 
well,'' said White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss. ``It certainly will 
be an emotional and touching day for the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton remained in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
	A week after Clinton won acquittal on March 12 he returned to  
New Hampshire, whose primary voters gave his campaign a new lease 
on life in 1992 when he was dogged by charges of infidelity and 
avoiding the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout that campaign, Clinton reminded voters of his  
small-town roots and promised a better way for America. ``I still 
believe in a place called Hope,'' was one of his most memorable 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	The house on South Hervey Street where he was born 52 years ago  
has been open to tourists since June 1997, and visitors have come 
from all 50 states and 43 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places  
in 1994, the official notice identified the property with 
``Clinton's humble beginnings,'' his ``inner strength'' and the 
``dedication to purpose that has sustained him throughout his 
distinguished political career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was raising money for Democrats in Texarkana,  
Texas, and Little Rock, Ark., during his visit. Weary from his 
four-day tour through Central America, which ended on Thursday, 
Clinton decided today to return to Washington late Saturday rather 
than linger with friends on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though Clinton left Hope when he was 5 and spent much  
of his boyhood in Hot Springs, Ark., longtime Arkansas friend Skip 
Rutherford said the dedication ceremony would make it a ``very 
special'' homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hope is particularly significant in his life, because of his  
roots there and it is the place where his mother is buried,'' 
Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics is very personal here,'' Rutherford said. ``The vast  
majority of people that President Clinton will see on his visits to 
Hope, Texarkana and Little Rock will be people that he knows both 
personally and professionally. The large majority he'll be able to 
call by their first name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will include Mack MacLarty, a Hope native who served as a  
top presidential adviser and is returning to welcome Clinton. An 
absence will be felt, too: Hope was the home of Vincent Foster, the 
White House lawyer who committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The site includes a garden dedicated to Clinton's mother and is  
designed to evoke a Southern neighborhood in the 1940s. Visitors 
first pass through a neighboring dwelling, as if they're stepping 
off the porch to visit the Clinton home, a two and one-half story 
American Foursquare next to the railroad tracks and near a 
commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
	State funds to help convert the site into a museum hit a snag  
earlier this week when lawmakers rejected a $500,000 spending 
request. But state officials attributed that to a procedural 
misstep and questions about the source of the money and said it 
didn't represent opposition to Clinton.

<HEADLINE> China Not Optimistic About Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's exports face a ``very tough, very  
difficult'' year, China's foreign trade minister said Friday, 
painting a gloomy forecast for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Shi Guangsheng said China ``will leave no stone unturned'' in  
efforts to expand exports, and he outlined a series of 
export-boosting measures, including offering credit support for 
exporters, increasing export tax rebates, and possibly offering 
export insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	China's exports of cheap products have been a motor of its  
remarkable economic growth over the past two decades. But the Asian 
economic crisis has bitten into crucial markets. Chinese leaders 
have responded by upping spending to boost slowing economic growth 
and by trying to boost domestic demand to counter weakening 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports dropped 10 percent in January and February, compared  
with the same two-month period in 1998, Shi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation facing China's export sector remains very tough,  
very difficult. That is reality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a news conference, Shi criticized the United States  
for canceling the sale of a $450 million commercial satellite to a 
Chinese-controlled consortium. He urged Washington to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of China's strongest reactions so far against the  
canceled sale, Shi said U.S. restrictions on high-tech sales to 
China were preventing American enterprises from tapping the Chinese 
market, and said other countries could fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason and no need to use security as an excuse  
to stop the sale,'' Shi said. ``I believe the United States should 
profoundly reconsider correcting this wrong decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said the decision to reject the sale  
was made after Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications, the 
Singapore-based consortium that was to purchase the satellite, took 
on more Chinese investors with direct links to the Chinese 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	While piqued at the decision, Shi said U.S.-Chinese talks last  
week on China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization made 
``important progress'' in market access, trade in agricultural 
products, and ``accession protocol.'' He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cautioned that important differences remained and  
indicated that China still regards U.S. demands as excessive. ``The 
differences and the gaps are merely the result of the fact that the 
demands put forward by the other party on China overwhelmed China's 
capabilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides were now making ``concerted efforts in seeking a  
solution,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other steps Shi outlined to boost China's exports are  
plans to export more high- and new technology products, machinery 
and electronic products. 
</P>
<P>
	Shi also said China would introduce ``a lot of important policy  
measures'' to encourage Chinese companies to invest in and set up 
factories and assembly and processing plants in other countries in 
a bid to boost exports to those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	China will also seek emerging or potential markets, he said. He  
predicted that the global economy would grow moderately this year, 
``so there are still international markets and international space 
for China to increase its exports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shi also said China would step up a crackdown on smuggling,  
fraudulent foreign exchange transactions and tax evasion to 
``create an environment that will allow fair competition to take 
place.''

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles Marathon Comes of Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For 13 years the Los Angeles Marathon has  
been the relative who's never been invited to the family gathering 
when mentioned with other elite marathons such as New York and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the invitation seems to have arrived.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're finally getting invited,'' LA Marathon president Bill  
Burke said when talking about the shrinking discrepancy of the 
level of the races. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's 14th LA Marathon features five male runners whose  
personal best times are faster than the course record. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading the elite men's field are Kenyans Simon Bor (2:08:46),  
John Kipkosgei (2:09:54) and Simon Kirwa (2:10:17), Taye Moges 
(2:09:21) of Ethiopia and Russia's Leonid Shvestov (2:09:16). Each 
is looking to break the mark of 2:10:19 set by Mexico's Martin 
Mondragon in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what to expect since this is my first race in the  
United States,'' said Bor, who ran 5k and 10k races before making 
the leap to marathons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's division, two-time champion Lornah Kiplagat of  
Kenya (2:33:50) will try to win her third in a row. She'll be 
challenged by Kenyan Hellen Kimaiyo-Kipkosgei (2:29:45) and Alena 
Peterkova (2:25:19) of the Czech Republic. Madina Bitktagirova of 
Belarus holds the course record of 2:26:23 set in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I like to run here is that the weather is warmer  
and that is better for me,'' said Kiplagat, who was declared the 
winner in 1997 after the first finisher was disqualified for 
cutting the course. ``My muscles stay warmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always pressure to win, but it was worse last year  
because I had to show that it wasn't a coincidence that I won in 
1997.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a growing elite field of runners, $5,000 has been  
added to the first-place finisher's prize, with the male and female 
winners each getting $35,000 and a new Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be an interesting race,'' said John Tope, the  
marathon's lead athlete coordinator. ``The field is deep and better 
than in the past so we should have some fast times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the improvements, Tope also believes the margin is closing  
between the LA Marathon and the three others often mentioned ahead 
of it -- New York, Boston and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gap's definitely closed,'' Tope said. ``We've been fourth,  
but it was a distant fourth. Now, it's a lot closer than it has 
been. It's very tough to displace Boston and New York.''

<HEADLINE> GIs Face Dismissal Over Shot Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A small rebellion among U.S. troops is growing  
against mandatory anthrax vaccinations, with some 200 facing 
dismissal for refusing them, including 23 sailors who had been 
preparing to ship out toward the Persian Gulf this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Pentagon officials are offering fresh assurances  
the vaccinations are safe, noting they've been received by some 
members of the military, especially the Army's special forces, 
since the 1970s to protect against the deadly threat that could 
come during biological warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are individuals who are still employed by the services,  
particularly the Army, who have actually been receiving this 
vaccine for 25 years without any ill effects,'' Navy Capt. Michael 
Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday at a regular 
briefing with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday blamed the scattered resistance to inoculations partly  
on ``misinformation'' about the anthrax vaccine that has shown up 
on Internet sites, apparently causing health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, who has been inoculated against  
anthrax to set an example, launched the militarywide program last 
year after being assured it wouldn't harm troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, ``less than one-tenth of 1 percent'' of troops have  
refused to receive the series of six shots, Doubleday estimated. 
Some 218,000 personnel have been vaccinated so far against anthrax. 
That would mean roughly 200 men and women in the armed forces have 
balked. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military personnel who refuse the vaccinations face  
dismissal, usually through an administrative process, for refusing 
to follow an order, Doubleday said. Their service records will 
determine whether they're honorably or dishonorably discharged, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department, which began the anthrax inoculation  
program in late August, is seeking to vaccinate all 2.4 million 
active duty and reserve military members by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen ordered all troops sent to the Persian Gulf vaccinated  
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a Pentagon anthrax education program and assurances from  
U.S. military leaders about the safety of the vaccine, which is 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a growing number of 
troops are refusing shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines Corps has been particularly hard hit, with more than  
two dozen Marines in Okinawa refusing the vaccine, The New York 
Times reported in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, 11 California Air Force Reserve pilots quit rather  
than take the anthrax vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest group rebellion, 23 sailors on the USS Theodore  
Roosevelt aircraft carrier were demoted, fined and given extra duty 
after refusing anthrax vaccinations, the Navy said. They face 
possible administrative discharges once the ship returns, the Navy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, 38 Roosevelt sailors balked at the vaccinations,  
which began two weeks ago as the Norfolk, Va.-based carrier 
prepared for a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean and Gulf 
starting March 26. Some later changed their minds, Navy officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy confirmed the Roosevelt refusals Wednesday after an  
inquiry by The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, which received an 
anonymous e-mail message from a sailor concerned about potential 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was given nothing to explain what I was taking, so I did my  
own research and found disturbing reports,'' the sailor said. ``We 
are scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cmdr. Garry Rudolph, a Navy doctor who directs the occupational  
health and preventive medicine program at the Portsmouth Naval 
Medical Center in Virginia, said he told sailors the anthrax 
vaccine is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a sailor on the destroyer USS John S. McCain -- named  
for the Arizona senator's father, an admiral -- developed a 
temporary paralysis after being vaccinated, although he fully 
recovered, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusals to accept inoculation may stem from a reluctance  
generated by the use of experimental vaccines during the 1991 Gulf 
War. Some troops blamed subsequent illnesses on drugs administered 
to counter biological and chemical exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax, a disease normally associated with animals such as  
sheep or goats, can be used as a weapon when spores are released 
into the air and people inhale them.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Bomb Artifacts Are Sorted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Deep in a cold, musty warehouse lies a  
mangled clock with hands pointing to 9:02 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Time stopped for the clock when the Alfred P. Murrah Federal  
Building was bombed at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The clock is among thousands of artifacts that are being sorted  
and preserved by a team of archivists and volunteers for the 
Oklahoma City National Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our forever job,'' volunteer Arleane Todd said  
Thursday. ``I don't know if we'll ever get caught up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd stood among rows of soiled plastic flowers, stuffed animals  
crammed in plastic bags and signed posters from well-wishers around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The archivists have divided the collection into groups that  
detail the history of the damaged buildings, rescue efforts, the 
public response to the bombing, legislation passed since the 
tragedy, the investigations, the trials and the memorials held for 
the 168 people killed in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters' notebooks, sketches by courtroom artists and letters  
from President Clinton line the shelves, along with children's 
shoes, hats and ornaments left by those who peered through the 
chain-link fence erected around the bombing site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Items taken from the fence alone probably take up half of the  
space,'' said archivist Brad Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the documents are examples of passages that were  
found in bomber Timothy McVeigh's car when he was arrested. McVeigh 
was sentenced to death for the bombing. Terry Nichols was sentenced 
to life in prison as a conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the items from the archives are traveling across the  
country to be part of exhibits in museums and presidential 
libraries. Many will be shown to the public on the fourth 
anniversary of the bombing on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Work already is under way on the memorial where the Murrah  
building once stood. The $24.1 million project will include a 
reflecting pool, an interactive museum and 168 stone chairs built 
atop glass bases. And it will include part of the fence.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 10.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower on worries about earnings  
today, stalling the Dow Jones industrial average's climb toward 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was off 10.26 at 9,887.18 at noon on Wall Street. The  
blue-chip index came within 42 points of 10,000 in early trading 
before giving up ground. On Thursday, the Dow came within 65 points 
of 10,000 before closing at 9,897.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were also down today.  
</P>
<P>
	Disappointing news from Microsoft and software maker Oracle led  
to broad selling in technology stocks. The technology-laden Nasdaq 
composite index was down 17.55 at 2,394.70 . 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle fell 8 1/4 to 28 5/8 after the company's third-quarter sales  
fell short of analysts' expectations. Microsoft was down 2 15/16 at 
158 1/2 after the company said it would defer about $400 million in 
revenue from its third to its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm equipment maker Caterpillar, down 5 1/8 at 45 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, said its first-quarter results would fall far short 
of expectations because of lower machine and engine sales. Also, on 
the Big Board, IBM also fell 4 3/16 to 178 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest NYSE decliners was pharmacy chain Rite Aid,  
which fell 15 to 22, or 40 percent, after warning that its 
first-quarter earnings would also be disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market drop came despite another positive report on  
the U.S. economy. The Labor Department released its Producer Price 
Index, which fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in February, 
indicating that inflation remains under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting some stocks was a move by OPEC officials to cut oil  
production in an attempt to boost sagging crude prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 4.67 to 1,293.01, after  
hitting a high of 1,302.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues had a narrow margin over advancers on the NYSE,  
where volume came to 373.62 million shares, down from 410.23 
million shares at the same time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.11 at 610.56 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.02 at 718.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.09 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 5.31 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
down 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.22 percent.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Injuries keep on hitting the Atlanta Braves.  
</P>
<P>
	After losing Andres Galarraga for the eason because of a  
cancerous tumor in his back, the Braves found out Friday that 
closer Kerry Ligtenberg has a partially torn ligament in his right 
elbow and will be sidelined for at least one month and possibly the 
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joe Chandler said, under a best-case prognosis, Ligtenberg  
would be able to resume throwing in 4-6 weeks. However, he could 
need surgery that would end his season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uncertainty of whether it's going to heal or not is what's  
bothering me,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I don't like the fact that I'm 
going to be resting and trying to make it better when there's no 
way we can really tell if it gets better until I go out on the 
mound again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg, diagnosed with a partially torn medial collateral  
ligament, had appeared in two games this spring, giving up five 
runs Wednesday in his first save situation, a 10-7 loss to Houston. 
He said he felt pain while throwing to the first hitter he faced 
and it didn't get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt some stiffness and was real sore right after the inning  
and the next day,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I was hoping it wasn't as 
bad as it was. I can't pinpoint exactly when it happened or if it 
was one pitch. ... It was right after the inning that I noticed my 
whole forearm was in a knot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg had a breakthrough year in 1998, taking over the  
closer's role after Mark Wohlers experienced control problems and 
was sent to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers has shown some signs of regaining command. He relieved  
Tom Glavine with the bases loaded Friday, then struck out Gary 
Sheffield and retired Rick Wilkins on a flyout in a 6-4 split-squad 
loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Albert Belle ended his era of good  
feeling with the Baltimore media, saying he will no longer speak to 
reporters. Belle made the decision in the wake of coverage of his 
tirade in the Orioles clubhouse Thursday. The brooding slugger 
threw two bats -- shattering one -- his glove and batting helmet into 
his locker after a questionable third-strike call in the middle of 
an exhibition game against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in the clubhouse Friday for comment on the incident, Belle  
said, ``I'm done. I'm done with you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter then said, ``Forever?'' and Belle nodded. Asked why,  
Belle turned around and stared at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	At Bradenton, Fla., Jose Guillen finally arrived in the  
Pittsburgh Pirates' spring training camp, 11 days late because U.S. 
government officials questioned the validity of his marriage 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know everything that happened, why there was a problem  
with the paperwork but I did everything I was supposed to do,'' 
Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Port Charlotte, Fla., Texas closer John Wetteland made his  
first appearance of the spring, throwing a scoreless inning in the 
Texas Rangers' 6-1 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidelined until now by a strain in the back of his right ankle,  
Wetteland allowed a leadoff single to Darrin Fletcher. Wetteland 
struck out Alex Gonzalez with a changeup to end his outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ankle didn't hurt, and I wasn't thinking about it,''  
Wetteland said. ``The hardest part is freeing yourself up to do 
what you are supposed to do, and that's your job. That was 
achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                      *Marlins (ss) 20, Astros 14    	
</P>

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Work To Avert Trade War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Canada reported progress  
Friday in talks aimed at averting a trade battle over restrictions 
Canada is seeking to impose on U.S. magazine operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher said he was  
encouraged by the discussions with Canada's Deputy Heritage 
Minister Suzanne Hurtubise and Deputy Trade Minister Robert Wright. 
Both sides agreed to meet again next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working closely with our Canadian colleagues to try to  
achieve a suitable outcome rather than hurtle down the track 
towards a train wreck,'' Fisher told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian embassy spokesman Rodney Moore said Friday's  
discussions were the fourth time the two sides have meet since 
December. He characterized Friday's talks as ``very constructive 
and positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions were held in advance of a possible vote next  
week in Canada's Parliament on legislation that would penalize 
foreign publishers who sell space to Canadian advertisers in 
special Canadian editions of their magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian publishers complain that these so-called split-run  
magazines take away advertising from Canadian magazines by offering 
much cheaper rates since the U.S. publishers are able to cover 
their production costs in the much bigger American market. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation Parliament is considering would replace previous  
high taxes on split-runs that the World Trade Organization has 
ruled are in violation of WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States contends the new legislation would be just  
as objectionable. While the United States has raised the prospect 
of punitive tariffs on Canadian products if Canada passes the new 
law, Fisher said no penalties would be contemplated as long as 
negotiators appear to be making progress toward a suitable 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration would continue those discussions even  
if Canada's lower house approves the bill next week. It would also 
have to win approval from Canada's Senate to become law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing to exercise a modicum of patience in this  
matter,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, referring to U.S. sanctions threats, Canadian  
Heritage Minister Sheila Copps vowed that ``we will not bend to 
bullies'' in the dispute that has dragged on for years.

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Escape With Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two leading IOC members, including the  
highest-ranking official implicated so far, escaped with severe 
warnings Friday as investigators wrapped up their inquiry of the 
Olympics' worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal commission recommended that Kim Un-yong, an  
executive board member from South Korea, and Phil Coles, a key 
player in bringing the 2000 Games to Sydney, Australia, be strongly 
censured for actions displaying serious conflicts of interest or 
lapses in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	It warned that they could be expelled if misconduct recurred.  
And the chief investigator said he suspected that there was 
evidence, yet uncovered, that would call for Kim's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel expelled one member, Samoa's Seiuli Paul Wallwork, and  
handed out lesser warnings to seven others linked to a 
million-dollar scheme of gifts and favors by Salt Lake bidders to 
win the 2002 Winter Games. Among them was Vitaly Smirnov, a former 
IOC vice president from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Others warned were Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, Anani Matthia  
of Togo. Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Mohamed Zerguini 
of Algeria, Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala and Austin Sealy of 
Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also exonerated three other members -- Henry Edmund  
Olufemi Adefope of Nigeria, Ashwini Kumar of India and Ram Ruhee of 
Mauritius. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members resigned or were expelled in the initial phase of  
the investigation headed by vice president Dick Pound, all of them 
reaffirmed in the latest report, which focused on evidence 
developed by ethics panels of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
and the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's recommendations must be approved by the IOC's ruling  
executive board, and all the actions must be approved at a special 
general assembly of the 105-member committee in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, on Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders had said for several weeks that the latest batch of  
alleged infractions were minor compared with the earlier ones. But 
big money -- and big names -- were still involved, and Pound 
sometimes sounded like an umpire explaining his strike zone as he 
repeatedly said the panel's findings were ``evenhanded'' and not a 
whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a judgment call,'' the Montreal lawyer said. The panel,  
he said, tried to distinguish between members who tried to enrich 
themselves and those ``who were careless about what they should do 
and not attentive to what people might think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest judgment involved Kim, president of both the  
international Taekwondo federation and the confederation of Olympic 
sports bodies who has been considered a possible successor to Juan 
Antonio Samaranch as IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	His case was one of three left open under the initial phase of  
the inquiry, and he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He also 
has promised to use ``lots of ammunition'' to fight any action 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	A floor fight over his expulsion could have wrecked the special  
session, called just to deal with the Salt Lake case and resulting 
reforms in the IOC's structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report alleged Kim used his Olympic position to  
help land lucrative jobs in telecommunications and music for his 
two children -- daughter Kim Hae-jung, a concert pianist, and son 
Kim Jung-hoon, a satellite TV executive also known as John Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC commission concluded its work on allegations involving  
concert dates and recording contracts for Kim Hae-jung, which it 
said ``created at least a very serious appearance of conflict of 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the investigation remained open on allegations that Kim  
Un-yong knew that Salt Lake bidders helped pay for a job for his 
son at Keystone Communications in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it was ``highly unlikely'' that Kim Un-yong did not know  
of the arrangement, although ``evidence available as of this day is 
not entirely conclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the allegations be fully established, which is not the  
case, the commission would consider that such behavior by an IOC 
member would justify expulsion from the IOC,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, in a conference call with reporters, said the panel  
believed ``there is additional evidence still out there,'' but that 
the commission had to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been a work in progress,'' he said. ``There  
are times when you have to take a photograph and make a report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, in a statement released by his New York-based publicist,  
said he was ``carefully reviewing the report, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with my colleagues in the IOC and the Olympic 
family toward advancing the goals of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of the best-liked members of the clubby IOC, was  
accused of accepting some $60,000 in travel benefits from Salt Lake 
bidders, including trips to ski resorts and the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission considers that Mr. Coles did not, in these  
circumstances, exercise his best judgment and that his repeated 
acceptance of benefits from representatives of the (Salt Lake bid 
committee) should have been avoided,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	His case was similar to that of Agustin Arroyo, the IOC member  
from Ecuador who has been ousted, but Pound said there were 
differences that made Coles' case less severe, most notably the 
fact that the Australian was legitimately in the United States when 
the Salt Lake-paid travel began. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pound said, ``alarm bells'' should have sounded for Coles  
when offers of trips kept coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least a warning light should have gone off in his head,''  
the investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork, an IOC member since 1987 but never in a leadership  
position, came under investigation after it was revealed his wife, 
Julia, had borrowed $30,000 from Tom Welch, the former head of Salt 
Lake's Olympic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake ethics report said Welch had to withdraw the money  
from his children's trust funds, and the loan was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork told the IOC that he knew nothing about the loan and  
that he and his wife were separated at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pound commission said faxes about the loan were sent  
from Welch to Wallwork's office, and that the Wallwork family 
received $67,585 in travel benefits from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his commission had found nothing to call for more  
expulsions in the responses from 37 cities that bid for the games 
from 1996 onward. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said all of that information should be turned over to a  
standing ethics panel, part of the reform package due for adoption 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that panel might also consider the case of Anita  
DeFrantz, a vice president from the United States. While DeFrantz 
has repeatedly denied any knowledge of wrongdoing, reports this 
week quoted Welch and former Salt Lake Olympic vice president Dave 
Johnson as saying they discussed ``everything'' about the gift 
program with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always said that if there are facts to back up the  
allegations, we will look at it,'' Pound said. ``But so far she 
says she did not know. We'll give the benefit of the doubt to Anita 
at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Pound said the IOC would accept its share of ``the  
allocation of blame'' for the scandal, his report took a shot at 
the USOC for a lack of oversight on the Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that many of the excesses which occurred on  
this occasion might have been avoided had the USOC been more active 
in discharging its responsibilities, including the bringing of any 
violations of the rules to the attention of the IOC,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC president Bill Hybl said his committee ``has fully accepted  
its share of the responsibility'' for the Salt Lake scandal and 
hoped that ``the IOC will match our commitment and action when it 
votes on its reforms next week in Lausanne.''

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Down by Seven / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States slipped by seven this week to 534, 
three shy of the record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 116 were exploring for  
oil and 418 for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported. 
During the same week last year, 942 rigs were operating in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom. It reached a record low of 531 on Feb. 19, 1999, after four 
straight weeks of plunging counts blamed on weak oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes says there probably are fewer domestic rigs looking  
for oil and gas now than at any time since industry's emerging days 
of the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, New Mexico gained  
two rigs while the count increased by one in California and 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas lost four rigs and Oklahoma lost three. The totals in  
Alaska and Louisiana remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Sign Steelers Safety Perry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Free safety Darren Perry, a starter since he  
came into the NFL in 1992, agreed Friday to terms of a two-year 
contract with the San Diego Chargers worth approximately $3.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers have now lost both of their starting safeties.  
Carnell Lake signed with Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry said San Diego was the only team he visited after the free  
agency period began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm coming to a great situation,'' he said. ``I'm just  
looking forward to helping out an already tremendous defense and 
make it even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's defense was one of the few bright spots during a  
5-11 season. The Chargers ranked No. 1 overall, allowing just 263 
yards per game, and was also tops against the run, giving up just 
71.3 yards. It ranked just 17th, though, in points allowed, giving 
up an average of three touchdowns per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this business there's a fine line between winning and  
losing,'' Perry said. ``We have the potential to be just as good as 
any team out there. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm looking forward to help get us back to the playoffs and help  
with a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry has started all 110 games he has played in since the  
Steelers made him an eighth-round draft pick out of Penn State in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 77 tackles, two interceptions, one-half sack and forced a  
fumble while starting 14 games last year. For his career, he has 
523 tackles, 32 interceptions, four forced fumbles, six fumble 
recoveries and 2 1/2 sacks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Fishing Subsidies Curb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upcoming global trade negotiations should seek  
to eliminate harmful government fishing subsidies, the Clinton 
administration said Friday, arguing that they encourage 
over-fishing of the world's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, joined by Australia, Iceland, New Zealand and  
the Philippines, will propose a curb on fishing subsidies at an 
environmental meeting next week in Geneva sponsored by the 
134-nation World Trade Organization, the administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hopes those talks on Monday and Tuesday will  
lead to landmark environmental protections as part of a new round 
of global trade negotiations, scheduled to be launched later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. environmental groups and labor unions say that unless  
future trade agreements include protections for the environment and 
worker rights, U.S. jobs will continue to be lost to nations with 
lax enforcement and cheaper production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But developing countries strongly oppose the U.S. drive, viewing  
demands for environmental and labor safeguards as efforts to 
protect American industries by driving up foreign costs of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last May raised the idea of having the WTO  
environmental conference. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the fish subsidy ban was just one of a  
number of initiatives the administration hopes to advance during 
the environmental talks, which will include representatives of 
environmental groups and business organizations as well as 
government trade and environmental officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing about this meeting is that at the table  
will be both environmental and trade officials from these various 
countries,'' said Frank Loy, undersecretary of state for global 
affairs. ``We hope that will change the tenor of the 
conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent World Bank study estimated government subsidies to  
promote fishing totaled $11 billion to $20 billion annually. 
Opponents say such subsidies distort trade by reducing fishing 
costs and placing downward pressure on world seafood prices at a 
time of growing shortages of some types of fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fisheries stocks are in decline worldwide,'' said Terry  
Garcia, assistant commerce secretary for oceans and atmosphere. 
``Put simply, too many boats are chasing too few fish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eliminating government subsidies would help reduce the problem  
of overfishing worldwide, he said.

<HEADLINE> The Truth Will Set Holyfield Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The undisputed heavyweight championship fight  
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis could be billed ``Truth 
or Consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is calling for a third-round knockout Saturday night  
in Madison Square Garden. He says that it isn't a prediction, it's 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	If, however, Lewis is still upright after three rounds, what  
will be the consequences? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a Plan B, so Plan A has to work,'' Holyfield  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So, if this turns out not to be the ``truth,'' will it give a  
psychological lift to Lewis, the WBC champion from Britain, and be 
a downer for Holyfield, the WBA-IBF champion? 
</P>
<P>
	After all, boxing is more than gloved fists hitting flesh and  
bone, it is also a battle of wills. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Holyfield is just playing a mind game with Lewis, who has  
had trouble in early rounds. In his only loss, he was knocked out 
in the second round by Oliver McCall in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, maybe Holyfield is reacting to some gamesmanship by  
Lewis, although he says he is not bothered by Lewis' charge that he 
does not practice what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, who calls himself a born again Christian, admitted in  
September that five of his nine children were born out of wedlock. 
He said he financially supports all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Holyfield's prediction for third-round knockout, Lewis said,  
``It will be something he's said again that's he's not living up 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's prediction was first made during a conference call  
Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something in my spirit jumped out and said, `Go ahead and tell  
them you're going to knock him out in the third round,'' the 
36-year-old Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a lot more confident that I've ever been,'' Holyfield  
added. ``It don't have anything to do with Lennox. It has to do 
with the place and the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a fight between the two best heavyweights in the world and  
it will happen before a sellout crowd, including 7,000 British fans 
and a worldwide television audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout is being carried on pay-per-view in the United States.  
The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EST, and the fight is expected to 
start about 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory over the 33-year-old Lewis would enable Holyfield to  
join Muhammad Ali as the only fighters to be undisputed heavyweight 
champion three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield took the first step toward that goal by winning the  
WBA title on an 11th-round technical knockout in 1996 over Mike 
Tyson. He won the rematch when Tyson was disqualified for biting 
Holyfield's ears. Holyfield took the second step when he won the 
IBF title by stopping Michael Moorer in the eighth round in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time I fought Tyson I was at my lowest; I didn't know  
if I had it anymore,'' Holyfield said. In four previous fights he 
had lost the WBA-IBF title on points to Moorer, won a 10-round 
decision in a hard fight against Ray Mercer, was stopped by Riddick 
Bowe in the eighth round of a non-title bout and looked 
unimpressive in stopping Bobby Czyz in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Tyson the first time, Holyfield said, ``I realized  
I had something special. I said I would never lose again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Lewis is no Tyson, Tyson never was the fighter everyone  
thought he was,'' said Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer. ``Evander 
exposed Tyson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 1/2 Holyfield was bigger than Tyson. But the 6-5 Lewis  
is the same height and about the same weight as Bowe, who won two 
of three fights against Holyfield. For Saturday's bout, Lewis is 
246 pounds, 31 more than Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward trained Holyfield when he outpointed Alex Stewart and  
Bowe in 1993, and he trained Oliver McCall went he knocked out 
Lewis for the WBC title. Steward has been with Lewis for his last 
nine fights, including the one in which he regained the WBC title 
when the fight was stopped in the fifth because McCall refused to 
fight. The title was vacant at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Lewis fights the fight of his life, it's still not as tough  
as the Tyson fight (for Holyfield),'' said Don Turner, Holyfield's 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield (36-3, 25 knockouts) is guaranteed $20 million. Lewis  
(34-1, 27 knockouts) is getting $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two other fights on the card.  
</P>
<P>
	James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of Pittsburg, Calif., will  
defend the WBA welterweight title against Sam Garr (25-2, 23 
knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.; and Fernando Vargas (15-0, 15 
knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will defend the IBF junior 
middleweight title against Howard Clarke (26-10-2, 8 knockouts) of 
England.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Collectibles Nearly Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio's death was bound to create  
a seller's market for memorabilia of the Yankee Clipper. Finding 
people willing to part with their mementos has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Bookston, owner of Florida Rare Coins &AMP; Collectibles, had  
11 DiMaggio items in his New York store when the Hall of Famer died 
Monday. By late Thursday afternoon, there were three. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are interested in his stuff, but it's hard to  
get hold of it,'' said Bookston, whose small South Florida shop 
operates on the ground floor of the same office building where 
DiMaggio used to do his banking. 
</P>
<P>
	From DiMaggio's adopted hometown to the World Wide Web, interest  
in the baseball great's autograph has soared in the days following 
his death. As a result, the price for many items has just about 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten a lot of calls, but I don't have much,'' said  
Steve Ryan, president of North Shore Sports, a Chicago auction 
house that specializes in game-used memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said he had been thinking about putting together a special  
auction of DiMaggio items until he took stock of what was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just not enough material,'' said Ryan, who soon will  
conduct an auction featuring only Michael Jordan items in the wake 
of the NBA great's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Michael Jordan, we've got jerseys for 75 percent of the  
years he played in the NBA. Shoes, a large assortment of stuff. I 
thought this would be a great opportunity to jump on for DiMaggio. 
But I can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bookston showed off a display case featuring a black-and-white  
shot of DiMaggio kneeling in his Yankees uniform, accompanied by a 
signed baseball. An item like that sold for $300 two weeks ago, but 
now it's up to $550. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's been getting five to 10 inquiries a day about  
DiMaggio items this week. And before that? ``Maybe one or two a 
week. Maybe one a month,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Glaskin, whose Sports Collectors Warehouse sits a couple of  
punts from the Miami Dolphins' complex in Davie, said he had about 
a dozen DiMaggio items in stock when the Yankees great was 
hospitalized in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had four baseballs and five or six 8-by-10s on plaques,'' he  
said. ``I sold them all right in that time. Usually I only sold one 
or two a year. But no matter what I had at that time, I could have 
sold it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was one of the first to discover the power of the  
memorabilia market, but he was a finicky signer. He spurned many 
requests to sign bats and jerseys, often limiting his autographs to 
balls and photos. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a deal to sell limited edition bats six years ago,  
DiMaggio agreed not to sign any more bats for five years. That 
agreement expired shortly before he took ill. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the website for B&AMP;J Collectibles in Lakewood, N.J.,  
listed one of those limited edition bats for $3,495. It also had a 
DiMaggio autographed ball for $399 and an autographed 16x20 photo 
for $349. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe's prices always have been high to start with,'' B&AMP;J owner  
Bill Rodman said. ``He just brings a different kind of collector, 
more of a fan than a collector. It's what's going to keep interest 
in his stuff a lot longer.''

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driver Gets 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- A drunken driver got 10 years in prison  
Friday in the case of a Jehovah's Witness who died of her injuries 
after she refused blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Cook, 32, was convicted of manslaughter in the death of  
Jadine Russell, who religious beliefs prevented her from accepting 
blood following the 1998 accident. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cook could have been found guilty of murder, the defense  
argued at his December trial that he was innocent of all charges 
because Mrs. Russell caused her own death. 
</P>
<P>
	But medical testimony indicated it was unlikely she would have  
survived even if she had gotten blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``You took the thing we loved most about my mom, her faith in  
God, and used it as an excuse,'' said Mrs. Russell's son, Jeff, as 
he faced Cook across the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook apologized to the family, but his sister insisted that Mrs.  
Russell was partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was responsible for getting in his car and driving,'' Dodie  
Cook O'Keeffe said after the sentencing. ``But she made the 
decision she was going to die that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell, 55, was standing on the side of the road after a  
minor car accident when Cook slammed his pickup truck into a parked 
car, pushing the vehicle into her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell suffered broken bones and severe bleeding but told  
emergency workers and doctors ``No blood!'' at least 10 times, and 
even tried to pull out an intravenous line. 
</P>
<P>
	Jehovah's Witnesses believe there is a biblical basis for  
refusing other people's blood.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, GTE Merger Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators' decision on Bell  
Atlantic's planned takeover of GTE could be delayed until a thorny 
issue is resolved involving GTE's Internet and long-distance 
services, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in January, Chairman Bill Kennard said he expected the FCC  
to decide the fate of the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger as well as 
another planned merger between SBC Communications and Ameritech by 
midyear. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Kennard told reporters that it's still unclear  
how the merged company intends to comply with a 1996 law that 
forbids Bell Atlantic from offering Internet services across local 
calling boundaries and long-distance service to local phone 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it's not on track, but we have to get past this  
particular issue,'' Kennard said. ``But because of that particular 
issue I can't give you a definitive timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Tauke, a senior vice president at Bell Atlantic, said the  
companies never expected the FCC to act on the merger by June. 
``Everything is very much on track,'' he said. Tauke added that the 
companies still plan to close the merger in December and will 
continue to work with the FCC on the Internet and long-distance 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of GTE's long-distance customers might eventually have to  
switch to another long-distance carrier if the company completes 
the planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic isn't allowed to provide long-distance service to  
customers living in its local phone region until it receives 
permission from the FCC. Neither Bell Atlantic nor any other local 
Bell telephone company has gotten such approval. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Bell Atlantic and GTE have asked the FCC to give  
the merged company two years to move GTE's long-distance customers 
off its network to other carriers, in any of the states where Bell 
Atlantic doesn't have approval to provide long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic provides local phone service in 13 states and the  
District of Columbia and hasn't received approval to provide 
long-distance service to those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE and Bell Atlantic also have asked the FCC to give them a  
two-year break from rules that prevent Bell Atlantic and other Bell 
companies from carrying Internet traffic across local calling 
boundaries, which for regulatory purposes constitute long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	That would permit Bell Atlantic to continue operating GTE's  
Internet ``backbone'' business, while it seeks to obtain authority 
to provide long-distance service. Internet backbones are high 
capacity networks that carry data traffic for third parties.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh Poster Taken Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A Vietnamese video store owner who  
angered neighbors by displaying a poster of the late communist 
leader Ho Chi Minh in his shop has given up his fight against 
eviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers took down the shop sign from the store run by Truong Van  
Tran. A lawyer for his landlord said Tran has also given up the 
battle to display the poster and the flag of communist Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge upheld Tran's constitutional right to display the flag  
and poster, but landlord Terra-Bushard Ltd. last month filed 
eviction notices citing overdue rent and insurance deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The landlord on Wednesday dropped a lawsuit against Tran, giving  
him 18 days to remove the rest of his property. 
</P>
<P>
	``My suggestion was to get the sign down right away,'' Jonathan  
Slipp, a lawyer for Terra-Bushard, said Thursday. ``It will serve 
as encouragement to the protesters to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran still believes the community should try to foster better  
relations with Vietnam, and feels he was forcibly evicted, said his 
attorney, Nancy Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen demonstrators, standing in a drizzle, watched  
Thursday as workers unbolted letters spelling ``Hi Tek'' from above 
Tran's door. Up to 15,000 people picketed the store last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests started in mid-January after Tran boasted of his  
display in faxes to his neighbors. He was roughed up at least twice 
and once hit with an egg thrown by a demonstrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 200,000 people who live, shop or work in the Little  
Saigon neighborhood are former South Vietnamese soldiers, former 
political prisoners or their relatives. Many were persecuted after 
the communist victory in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, police seized 2,000 videotapes -- most of Tran's  
stock -- and a stack of copying equipment from his shop in a piracy 
investigation. Tran wasn't arrested and his attorney said he had 
done nothing wrong.

<HEADLINE> IOC Vice President Coles Resignes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee Vice President Dick Pound of  
Canada and embattled IOC member Phil Coles of Australia have 
announced their resignations from key Olympic committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles cited health reasons today in announcing he was quitting  
his position with the Australian Olympic Committee. He will, 
however, remain as a member of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he quit his post on Toronto's 2008 Olympic Bid  
Committee in December, but did not disclose it until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he alerted 2008 bid co-chair Steve Hudson of his  
decision around the same time the IOC bribery scandal in Salt Lake 
City became public. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started when all the, shall we say, troubles began,'' Pound  
said. ``I thought maybe the smart thing was to be off the 
committee, at least at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As head of a committee looking into wrongdoing in Salt Lake's  
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, Pound said he thought it 
would be best for him not to be associated with a group bidding for 
the 2008 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult because it's almost impossible not to have an  
IOC member from your country on your bid committee. If you don't, 
it looks like you don't support the bid,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, as an IOC member your duty is to give advice  
to all bid cities and to try to get the best bid you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound angered bid supporters in December when he suggested  
Toronto take a long look before challenging Beijing for the right 
to stage the 2008 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He met privately with Hudson a couple days later, and Hudson  
said he was satisfied with the meeting. But now it's apparent that 
Pound resigned from the group soon after. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Pound's departure comes at a time when concerns have  
been raised about the IOC's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was implicated in the scandal surrounding the 2002 Salt  
Lake City Winter Olympics when an ethics committee said he and his 
family accepted four free trips to the United States as guests of 
the city's bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has denied acting outside IOC guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released today, Coles said he would resign as  
director of international relations with the AOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful the IOC report will clear me of any breach of the  
bid guidelines and put an end to this matter,'' said Coles, adding 
that the controversy has had a significant impact on his health. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rostropovich To Boycott Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Infuriated by a review, Mstislav Rostropovich has  
declared he will never play in Russia again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it is over,'' the cellist said in an interview in the  
weekly Vek, published Friday. ``I will give concerts only where 
people want to hear me and find pleasure in this, not where they 
say that I am a `has-been.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The 71-year-old musician -- who performs frequently, generally to  
adoring audiences -- said he was stunned by a critic's review of a 
concert he gave in Moscow in December in honor of author Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostropovich left the Soviet Union in 1974 and was stripped of  
his citizenship four years later. He returned to support reforms in 
1991 and has spent much of his time in Russia since then.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs More Airport Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Transportation Committee is trying  
to double spending for airport improvements by using a legislative 
maneuver that could take billions of dollars away from future 
budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's measure to reauthorize the Federal Aviation  
Administration for the next five years also seeks to boost air 
traffic to smaller airports, in part by adding flights out of major 
airports in Chicago, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA bill was approved by voice vote Thursday. The  
administration has its version and the Senate Commerce Committee 
has already acted on its bill, setting the stage for tough 
negotiations on what could be one of the more important bills 
Congress takes up this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, offered by committee Chairman Bud Shuster,  
R-Pa., would increase annual FAA funding for airport improvement, 
research and safety programs from $10 billion this year to $20 
billion in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster would come up with the extra money by removing from the  
general federal budget the airport trust fund, the revenues from 
airport user taxes. Shuster, who successfully walled off a similar 
highway trust fund last year, argued that all the money should go 
to airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the fund is expected to take in about $10 billion,  
but Congress only approved about $6 billion in airport spending, 
with the rest going into the general budget and counting toward the 
budget surplus. Shuster said the trust fund balance, now $10 
billion, will grow to $91 billion in 2009 if the money isn't freed 
up to be used for needed airport projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Protecting the fund, said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn.,  
``assures that small airports at the end of the spokes will be able 
to get their fair share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration strongly opposes taking the fund off-budget,  
and the Senate bill, offered by Commerce Committee Chairman John 
McCain, R-Ariz., sides with the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster would triple funding for air traffic control equipment  
to $3 billion annually and nearly triple the Airport Improvement 
Program, which builds new runways and other facilities, to $5 
billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	His measure would seek to help smaller markets hurt by industry  
deregulation through financial aid and by increasing flights out of 
Chicago's O'Hare, New York's La Guardia and Kennedy and 
Washington's Reagan National. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceilings on flights out of the Chicago and New York airports  
would be lifted and Washington would get up to six new slots, equal 
to three round-trip flights daily, for smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain goes even further in increasing flights, giving  
Washington 48 new slots, and the administration also would lift 
caps on slots to the other three. They argue that the airports have 
the capacity, that new planes have significantly reduced the noise 
pollution problem and that something must be done to help smaller 
cities that get no or only highly priced air service. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers from the three cities generally oppose the move,  
and protests over increased flights helped block passage of an FAA 
bill last year. ``The cost in safety and pollution is more than the 
business is worth,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of 
Columbia's delegate to the House. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Shuster were in closer synch on competing legislation  
to strengthen the rights of air passengers who experience delays, 
bumping and other inconveniences. Shuster held a hearing on 
Wednesday and McCain on Thursday, listening to stories from people 
who were kept sitting on runways for hours without food and water, 
were not told of strikes or had their luggage disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that the domestic airline industry has an  
outstanding safety record, McCain said. ``The bad news is that the 
airlines simultaneously reached the low-water mark on customer 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill would require airlines to offer passengers the  
lowest possible fare, give notice of delays and provide refunds 
within 48 hours of ticket purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association of  
America, said that airlines are taking the initiative in improving 
service and that legislation was not necessary. ``The last thing 
that is needed is the intrusion of government bureaucracy and the 
consequential increase of costs to the traveling public.''

<HEADLINE> Customs Retrain Drug Searchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the Customs Service was confronting  
lawsuits from innocent travelers who were strip-searched, the 
number of heroin and cocaine smugglers it caught in airports 
dropped by one-fourth last year. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Customs with a double problem: reversing the decline  
in drug seizures while tempering public anger over the way 
international air travelers are searched. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials are worried that the lawsuits, generally filed  
against individual officers, may have caused some inspectors to 
search passengers less aggressively, Customs spokesman Dennis 
Murphy said. They don't believe the number of smugglers decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	``This search authority is crucial for us,'' Customs  
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. ``We're trying to show movement in the right direction so 
that we keep the authority but make it a less onerous process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To address complaints about body searches, Kelly has begun  
instituting a host of changes: retraining inspectors, updating 
guidelines in the agency's search handbook, providing more 
information about the process for travelers, and trying new 
technology to reduce the need for invasive body searches. 
</P>
<P>
	In pursuit of smugglers who swallow packets of drugs, officers  
have subjected passengers to strip searches, taken them in 
handcuffs to hospitals for X-rays, and detained some for hours or 
even days. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 100 black women in Chicago are pursuing a joint lawsuit  
claiming they were singled out unfairly because of their race. It 
is one of 12 lawsuits nationally over Customs searches of airline 
passengers, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A traveler won a $450,000 judgment against Customs officers in  
San Francisco last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is concern that these lawsuits have caused people to  
back off a little bit,'' contrary to agency policy, Murphy said. 
The spokesman said there is no proof of that, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of travelers caught carrying cocaine or heroin under  
their clothes or inside their bodies fell from 916 seizures in 1997 
to 677 in fiscal 1998. The number had been rising every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said other reasons for the decline might be a temporary  
shift of some resources away from personal searches for a crackdown 
on cargo smuggling last year and inventive new tactics used by drug 
suppliers. For example, some now send a decoy passenger to distract 
inspectors while four or five drug couriers on the same flight slip 
by undetected. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small fraction of the 69 million passengers who pass  
through Customs each year are questioned. About 50,000 were 
subjected to some level of body search in 1997. Searches usually 
begin with a frisk or pat-down and, with reasonable suspicion, can 
proceed to a strip search, X-ray or monitored bowel movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs were found on about one-fourth of passengers subjected to  
partial or full strip searches, the agency says. The rate was close 
to 100 percent a decade ago, Kelly said, but smugglers have become 
more sophisticated and difficult to recognize. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly acknowledged body searches can be traumatic and have  
become a ``significant problem'' for Customs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee, the General Accounting Office and  
the Treasury Department are all investigating Customs' airport 
searches. Illinois senators raised the issue last year after 
WMAQ-TV reported on complaints from black women searched at 
Chicago's O'Hare airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the AP reported that travelers across the country  
were complaining of abusive searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Customs has taken several steps to defuse the issue:  
</P>
<P>
	--An extensive new training program began last month for  
inspectors at airports. ``It involves both what to look for but 
also how to handle people, cultural diversity training, that sort 
of thing,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Since Feb. 1, inspectors at Miami International and New York's  
Kennedy airport have given travelers chosen for a pat-down the 
option of standing in front of a body-imaging machine instead. 
Twenty-three people have agreed to the low-radiation imaging, which 
looks through clothing. In Miami on Tuesday, one of the machines 
revealed 3 1/2 pounds of marijuana in a bicycle tire strapped around a 
man's waist, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Body imaging may be added to other airports if it proves  
effective and less objectionable to passengers, a spokesman said. 
In some cases, travelers also have been given the option of 
submitting to an X-ray in lieu of a strip search. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Customs Service plans to install X-ray machines and  
technicians at major airports to check suspects without 
transporting them to a hospital. The agency is looking for a 
contractor and has requested $9 million for the program in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Customs is also researching whether breathalyzer technology  
could be used to detect latex condoms and balloons, which smugglers 
fill with drugs and swallow. 
</P>
<P>
	--Signs and brochures were being installed in airports this week  
to explain why travelers might be subjected to a body search, and 
new comment cards make it easier to complain about mistreatment.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bank UBS Earns $2.2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, earned  
$2.2 billion in 1998 despite investment losses and an out-of-court 
settlement of Holocaust claims in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first annual earnings report for UBS since its  
formation last June by the merger of two major Swiss banks, Union 
Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-year profit was less than the $2.3 billion profit  
reported for the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-half results reflected a loss of $726 million by its  
investment bank, Warburg Dillon Read, on investments in financial 
derivatives and hedge funds, notably the U.S. fund Long Term 
Capital Management which was the beneficiary of an unusual rescue 
plan to avoid failing last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit also was reduced by $362.6 million due to a charge for  
UBS' share of the $1.25 billion settlement in the U.S. lawsuit over 
dormant World War II-era bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS joined with Credit Suisse in New York last August in  
agreeing to a settlement of the claims against them stemming from 
dormant accounts deposited by people later killed by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly merged bank said it continues to fine-tune its  
operations and strategies. It said its worldwide staff is now 
48,011, a cut of 7,165 people during the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank announced several changes in top management, including  
the retirement of Hans de Gier, the chairman and chief executive 
officer of Warburg Dillon Read. Markus Granziol, an 11-year veteran 
of the group, will become CEO of Warburg. Fritz Hobbs will become 
chairman of Warburg, while retaining his role as head of corporate 
finance.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Out of NCAA Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The University of Minnesota basketball team  
arrived at the NCAA tournament hoping for a long run to the 
national championship. They are instead headed home to a longer 
investigation of academic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials ordered four players to sit out the  
first-round game in the tournament Thursday after a former school 
employee claimed she wrote term papers and did other course work 
for them and other athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Minnesota lost 75-63 to Gonzaga University and was  
eliminated from the tournament as the four athletes sat glumly at 
the end of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Mark Yudof said he suspended starting  
players Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver, along with Antoine Broxsie 
and Jason Stanford, because ``there's obviously a great deal at 
stake here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Minneapolis, Yudof said the school's  
investigation turned up evidence to support at least some of the 
allegations. He said he envisioned ``fairly Draconian sanctions 
coming out if this proves to be true. The seriousness cannot be 
overstated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspensions came one day after a story in the Saint Paul  
Pioneer Press quoted Jan Gangelhoff as saying she had done course 
work over the years for at least 20 players in coach Clem Haskins' 
program, including the four on the current squad. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Haskins, Minnesota's coach for 13 seasons, said  
he knew nothing of any academic wrongdoing but accepted 
responsibility for the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't put winning and losing ahead of what's right,''  
Haskins said. ``Some people sell their souls to win. I don't do 
that. Never have, never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspended players were not in the locker room after the game  
and did not speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the university's  
academic counseling unit, said she was paid $3,000 in cash to tutor 
a player. 
</P>
<P>
	She told WCCO-TV in Minneapolis on Thursday that the person who  
gave her the money said it was from coach Haskins. Yudof said 
Haskins denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gangelhoff declined to identify the person who actually gave  
her the money except to say it was ``another basketball program 
staff member that I trusted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gangelhoff told WCCO her role evolved from tutor to actually  
doing the players' assignments because it was easier and faster to 
do the work herself. She said she never was asked by coaches to do 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids didn't ask me, either,'' she said. ``That was a  
decision I made on my own. Basically because of time constraints, 
it was just easier for me to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also told the station she wasn't sure when or if she might  
become willing to answer questions from university officials. She 
wants to consult an attorney first.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Hopes for Second Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Forget that they lost five of their last six  
games. Don't worry that their first-round opponent ended the 
regular season on a roll. The Purdue Boilermakers are in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	And that gives them an opportunity to keep their Jekyll-and-Hyde  
season alive when they face seventh-seeded Texas tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every player should look at it as a new life, a new chance to  
do something special,'' says guard Alan Eldridge of 10th-seeded 
Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers were ranked as high as eighth on Dec. 14, when  
they were 10-1. Since then, they are 9-11 and ended the season with 
the 32nd most votes in the national poll. 
</P>
<P>
	They're the only team in the 64-school field with a losing  
conference record, but the quality of the Big Ten helped them get 
one of the league's seven bids, even though they lost in the first 
round of the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tournament is still about habits'' and that could hurt  
Purdue, said Texas' first-year coach, Rick Barnes. ``But if you 
look at Purdue, they came out of a great, great league. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new start for them. It's a new start for us.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns began the season 3-8, but recovered to win 16 of  
their last 20 games and finish with the same 19-12 record as 
Purdue. Defense sparked the turnaround as Texas allowed an average 
of 9.3 fewer points in its last 20 games than it did in the first 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	The revival began at the Rainbow Classic in Honolulu.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hawaii's when we decided enough's enough. When are we going to  
stop losing?'' Texas center Chris Mihm said. ``Let's start this 
conference season off as a new season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did that by winning their next five games, all against Big  
12 opponents. The 7-foot Mihm and 6-7 Gabe Muoneke led the 
Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have great inside players,'' Purdue forward Brian  
Cardinal said. ``That's our main goal, to try to shut those guys 
down, because the way they go, Texas goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Texas is in the tournament for the ninth time in 11 years  
and Purdue made it for the seventh straight season, tonight's other 
game matches two strangers to the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-seeded Miami was chosen last year for the first time  
since 1960 and lost in the first round to UCLA. Lafayette, which 
last made the tournament in 1957, ends the second-longest drought. 
Harvard hasn't been in since 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette began the season 8-4, but was 14-3 after that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we'd be strong by the end of the year,'' said coach  
Fran O'Hanlon, who still admits, ``We have to play probably our 
best game all year'' against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	While Miami (22-6) is ranked 10th, coach Leonard Hamilton has  
endured lean years since becoming coach in 1990-91. In fact, the 
Hurricanes lost at home that year to Lafayette by 16 points and 
have never won an NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	So Hamilton isn't worried his players will take the Leopards  
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had enough success to get the big head. We haven't  
earned the right to look past anybody,'' he said. ``We're trying to 
build basketball tradition, so we can't let this opportunity 
pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leopards have a goal of their own as regular-season and  
tournament champions of the Patriot League. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is a chance for us to show everyone where  
Lafayette is and put us on the map,'' said Brian Ehlers, the 
leading scorer for the Pennsylvania school. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon games featured two other teams with little NCAA  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteenth-seeded George Mason (19-10) was making its second  
tournament appearance ever when it faced third-seeded Cincinnati 
(26-5), which made the tournament for the eighth consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	And 11th-seeded Kent (23-6), the surprise winner of the  
Mid-American Conference tournament, was chosen for the NCAAs for 
the first time and had to play sixth-seeded Temple (21-10), which 
is in the tournament for the 10th straight season.

<HEADLINE> Icahn Leads Bid To Oust RJR Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn nominated himself and eight  
others on Friday for election to the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. 
board, saying his slate would break up the food and tobacco company 
by spinning off its food holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn had signaled his intentions on Thursday when he said he  
was dissatisfied with RJR Nabisco's plan to spin off its U.S. 
tobacco operations as a separate company owned by RJR shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	His filing of a competing slate of candidates for the RJR board  
sets up a showdown at the May 12 annual meeting, when shareholders 
can decide which breakup plan they prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for RJR, said the company had no  
comment on Icahn's filing. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco, which was the target in the biggest and most  
dramatic takeover battle of the 1980s, owns the nation's 
second-biggest tobacco company that is led by the Winston, Salem 
and Camel cigarette brands. 
</P>
<P>
	It also owns an 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp.,  
which is traded separately and is the nation's biggest cookie and 
cracker maker with brands such as Oreos, Chips Ahoy, Snackwells and 
Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Icahn and RJR management feel the food company would fare  
better in the stock market if its ties were severed to the tobacco 
business which faces hundreds of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But they disagree over how to make the split.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Icahn, his nominees include Jerome Becker, Harold  
First, Seymour Fliegal, Russell Glass, Martin Hirsch, Robert 
Mitchell, Felix Pardo and Jack Wasserman. None appear to have any 
experience in the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Glass and Mitchell work for companies Icahn heads and they sit  
with First and Wasserman on another company chaired by Icahn. 
Hirsch works for a real estate investment partnership with an 
address that matches where another Icahn firm is based. Becker is a 
lawyer, Fliegal is an educational consultant and Pardo is a 
business executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn had said earlier his slate consists of people whose main  
ambition would be to spin off the food business and, if that were 
blocked, try the tobacco spinoff that RJR had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, he said it wasn't necessary for him to recruit  
people with tobacco experience as he had in two earlier 
unsuccessful attempts to unseat the RJR board. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR management has said a spinoff of the Nabisco holdings is  
impractical because it would be challenged as an improper effort to 
shield RJR's food holdings from damage claims that might result 
from tobacco suits. 
</P>
<P>
	But Icahn said the fears that a food spinoff would be blocked on  
those grounds are overblown and said a spinoff of the food holdings 
would create a company free from the taint of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn said investors' muted reaction to the company's planned  
tobacco spinoff indicates that approach won't create as much value 
in the stock market as his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR shares rose 6 1/4 cents a share to $30.06 1/4 in trading Friday on  
the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had closed at $28.62 1/2 a 
share the day before RJR proposed the tobacco spinoff.

	Kosovo Albanians May Accept Deal  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Albanian foreign minister Paskal  
Milo said today there were ``positive indications'' that Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanian rebel leaders would accept a U.S.-backed peace 
plan. But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic again rejected a 
key element of the plan -- the 28,000 NATO troops to enforce it. 
Milosevic said the U.S.-backed deal ``would not be the end'' of the 
Kosovo Albanians' campaign for independence ``but is a step toward 
further developments.'' The plan would grant autonomy but not 
independence to the province for three years and provide for 
NATO-led troops to enforce it.

<P>
	INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) -- NATO welcomed Hungary, Poland and the  
Czech Republic as new members today, ratifying the transformation 
of three former Soviet bloc nations. Many Russians are wary about 
the eastward expansion of NATO. Russian Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov calls it ``a movement in the wrong direction.'' Some critics 
contend that NATO expansion risks alienating Russia and could 
preclude closer ties with Moscow. The Clinton administration has 
said that even Russian membership in NATO should not automatically 
be ruled out.

	Caterpillar Stock Falls 12 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A grim first-quarter forecast from  
Caterpillar, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, sent 
the company's stock tumbling by about 12 percent today and stalled 
the Dow's race to the 10,000 mark. A prolonged slide in sales of 
engines and heavy machinery to commodity-based industries like oil, 
mining and agriculture, significantly cut revenue, Caterpillar 
officials said. Investors responded by sending Caterpillar's stock 
down $6.18 3/4 to close at $44.68 3/4.

</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft stock slipped today after the company  
said it would defer about $400 million in revenue because of a 
delay in introducing Office 2000. On the Nasdaq, Microsoft fell 1 1/4 
to 160 3/16. Reports of a pending corporate reorganization helped 
keep the shares actively switching between positive and negative 
territory throughout the trading session. Microsoft said it still 
expects to meet Wall Street's third-quarter earnings estimate. The 
company expects sales of about $4.2 billion.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department said today it would not

The purchase of Netscape by AOL, the world's largest online service

reach across the high-tech world -- and challenge Microsoft's 
dominance in key areas. Netscape's shareholders are scheduled to 
meet Wednesday to vote on the deal.

	LONDON (AP) -- Violinist Yehudi Menuhin, whose astonishing  
youthful virtuosity grew into one of the great musical talents of 
the 20th century, died today. He was 82 and had been sharing his 
love of music with audiences around the world for 75 years. His 
London office said he had pneumonia and died of heart failure in 
Berlin's Martin Luther Hospital. Menuhin was only 13 when Albert 
Einstein followed him backstage after a concert in Berlin and

<HEADLINE>  Friends, Family Honor Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The giant electronic billboard at Bay  
Meadows race track, where Joe DiMaggio spent many of his retirement 
afternoons, summarized the feelings of a nation: ``Joe, We'll Miss 
You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was remembered Thursday by Father Armand Oliveri, who  
led the funeral Mass, as a man ``who had achieved greatness, but 
his real greatness was the way he carried himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri said the hour-long service at Sts. Peter and Paul  
Church, attended by 80 family members and close friends, was 
peaceful and dignified -- a fitting tribute to a private man who 
impressed people with his quiet class as much as his classic swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a beautiful, dignified, very calm atmosphere,'' said  
Oliveri, 79, who had known DiMaggio since the two grew up in the 
North Beach section of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig and AL president Gene Budig  
attended the funeral. DiMaggio's mahogany casket remained closed 
and there were no baseball mementos -- nothing suggesting DiMaggio's 
impact on the game and on American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very sensitive, very private,'' Selig said. ``Just a  
day I'll remember for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was eulogized by his brother, Dominic, who spoke of  
their childhood together and his elder brother's athletic talent. 
He said the only thing his brother lacked was a constant companion, 
and that led to his devotion to children. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died Monday at his Florida home at the age of 84,  
was divorced from actress Dorothy Arnold in 1943 and actress 
Marilyn Monroe in 1954. In later years, he devoted much of his time 
and money to children's hospitals and charities. 
</P>
<P>
	When DiMaggio's flower-covered casket was driven away from the  
church, about 200 people standing across the street in Washington 
Square began applauding. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio received his first communion and married his first wife  
in the church, whose twin steeples tower over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Police barricades surrounded the church, keeping the public and  
hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV crews across the 
street. But the commotion did little to disturb dozens of people 
doing their morning Tai Chi routines in Washington Square, where an 
American flag flew at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Reynolds, whose father was a teammate of DiMaggio, stood  
behind a barricade on a cool sunny day watching mourners march into 
the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, son of former Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds, flew  
from Mustang, Okla., to pay last respects to the Hall of Famer. As 
a child, Reynolds hung out in the Yankee clubhouse, where his 
father had a locker two down from DiMaggio's. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad said DiMaggio was the greatest player he had ever  
seen,'' Reynolds said. ``My dad said he had a great record because, 
when he was pitching, someone would hit one and Joe would run a 
mile to catch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six pallbearers, including DiMaggio's estranged son, Joseph Paul  
DiMaggio Jr., carried the casket into and out of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi and two celebrants sang ``Amazing  
Grace'' and Schubert's ``Ave Maria'' among five musical works 
requested by the DiMaggio family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very dignified and private, just how they wanted it,''  
Simi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession passed DiMaggio's former home on Beach  
Street, where several fans laid flowers, on its way to Holy Cross 
Cemetery in nearby Colma. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, said the  
Hall of Famer wanted a private religious service and that his 
family was determined to follow his wishes. That meant excluding 
people such as Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to DiMaggio's son, other pallbearers were Roger  
Stein and James Hamra, the husbands of DiMaggio's two 
granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of the ballplayer's late 
brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of DiMaggio's for 59 years; 
and Engelberg.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Trial Targets Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In the opening hours of Susan  
McDougal's trial, prosecutor Kenneth Starr's message to the jury 
has seemed to be that he wants President Clinton to be the 
defendant as much as Clinton's former Whitewater business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors brandished their prize exhibit in the case --  
a $27,600 check from James and Susan McDougal's savings and loan 
made payable to ``Bill Clinton'' -- and juxtaposed it with the 
president's testimony that he'd never taken out a loan from the 
S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial features James McDougal speaking from the grave. The  
medium is one of Starr's investigators, FBI agent and accountant 
Mike Patkus, who has spent five years investigating Clinton. Patkus 
testified that McDougal tipped him in 1996 that there had been a 
loan to Clinton, contrary to what the president had said under 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus spent many days rummaging through the failed financial  
institution's records before he found the 1982 check to Clinton on 
microfilm. A garage mechanic later pulled the original from the 
trunk of a tornado-damaged car abandoned 10 years ago by a McDougal 
S&AMP;L employee who had brought the vehicle in for transmission 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be his last effort against the president, Starr is  
putting Mrs. McDougal on trial for criminal contempt and 
obstruction because she won't say what she knows about the Clinton 
loan. She endorsed a separate check that helped pay it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's overall investigation appears to be in its waning days,  
and departures are depleting his staff: The latest, spokesman 
Charles Bakaly, was knocked out this week in an investigation of a 
leak of information to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Robert Bittman has left for a law firm. Another  
deputy, Solomon Weisenberg, is doing likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors have even admitted in court that their  
investigation of the Clintons is at an impasse, possibly 
permanently, which is why they are putting Mrs. McDougal on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people with detailed information about the matters  
under investigation in Whitewater stands at three -- Susan McDougal 
and the Clintons, prosecutor Mark Barrett told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Casting Clinton as the invisible defendant is ``embarrassing and  
unfortunate'' for ``a sitting president, but this is the crime Mrs. 
McDougal is charged with and this is the government's proof,'' said 
St. John's University law professor John Barrett, a former 
Iran-Contra prosecutor and no relation to the prosecutor in the 
McDougal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the case is demonstrating that ``she was and is a  
relevant witness in this investigation of Clinton,'' said the law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	So far at the trial the prosecutors have said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Starr's FBI agents found a handwritten sheet among the S&AMP;L's  
records that calculated down to the penny the amount of money that 
Mrs. McDougal included in a check to help pay off the Clinton loan. 
A separate sheet in different handwriting and also buried in the 
institution's records listed the S&AMP;L's borrowers as including ``B 
Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- James McDougal told Starr's office that he had gotten Clinton  
to sign papers for the loan but McDougal destroyed the records 
after the loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There is a link between the Clinton loan and a fraudulent  
$300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 3 1/2 years later. The Clinton loan was 
paid off with another loan from the McDougals' S&AMP;L that listed 
Whitewater real estate salesman Chris Wade as the borrower. 
Whitewater's checking account provided funds to pay off the Wade 
loan. The Whitewater payment was covered with a bank loan, which in 
turn was paid off with the fraudulent loan to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Susan McDougal ever talk?  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, promises that she will, by taking the  
stand in her defense. If Geragos doesn't ask her about the Clinton 
loan, Starr's deputies promise that they will. 
</P>
<P>
	``She smiled ... like maybe she knows the answers,'' said Starr  
prosecutor Hickman Ewing, who has been watching Mrs. McDougal as 
she listens to Patkus testify.

<HEADLINE> Oracle Stock Tumbles 22.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Disappointed investors sent Oracle  
Corp.'s stock tumbling 22.5 percent Friday after the nation's top 
database software maker reported lower than expected third-quarter 
revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In a selling frenzy of more than 100 million shares, Oracle  
plunged $8.31 1/4 Friday to close at $28.56 1/4 a share as the most 
active issue on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff was a major factor in broad declines among  
technology shares, which in turn was one of the reasons the Dow 
Jones industrial average pulled back Friday from an assault on 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, Oracle reported earnings of 20 cents a share for  
the period ending Feb. 28. The results were above the 19 cents a 
share predicted by analysts polled by First Call Corp. and the 14 
cents of a year earlier, adjusted for a stock split. Revenue rose 
19 percent to $2.08 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the growth rate for the company, based in Redwood City,  
Calif., was well below the 27 percent increases posted in the 
year-ago period and the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at a number of investment banks immediately downgraded  
the stocks. Warburg Dillon Read, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, 
Dain Rauscher Wessels and Piper Jaffray all assigned lower ratings 
to Oracle shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to the quarter being reported, we'd expressed some  
concerns about them meeting license revenue estimates,'' said 
Warburg analyst Andrew Roskill. ``We thought the stock was priced 
for perfection and had perhaps gotten ahead of itself on a 
valuation basis. The quarterly results reported last night 
basically confirmed our fears that the company was going to see a 
slowdown in software revenue growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle executives attributed the revenue shortfall to difficult  
year-to-year comparisons. In addition, the company didn't close as 
many deals during the period as it had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had 33 percent license growth in the Americas in last  
year's third quarter, which makes our year-to-year same-quarter 
growth comparison a tough one,'' said chief financial officer 
Jeffrey Henley. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1977, Oracle Corp. is the world's leading supplier of  
software for information management and the world's second largest 
software company. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle's officers cautioned analysts to be conservative, but  
said they hope to see more license revenue growth during the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	CEO Lawrence Ellison said prospects for Oracle remain strong.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today just about every major Internet site in the world uses  
Oracle,'' he said. ``The growth of our database business will 
continue to be driven by the growth of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock  
Letter, said Wall Street's reaction was unwarranted, but he was 
happy to seize on the stock drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting to buy this stock and we bought it this  
morning,'' he said. ``Their pipeline of new business is growing in 
the 30 to 40 percent range. All they have to do is convert that 
into new revenues.''

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Post Big Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Falling prices for vegetables, heating oil and  
new cars in February helped produce the sharpest decline in more 
than a year in prices charged by factories, refineries and food 
processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods  
fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent last month, the most in 13 
months, mostly reversing an unusually large 0.5 percent increase 
the month before, the department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had attributed the January gain, and a 0.4 percent  
increase in December, to a variety of special factors and 
February's bigger-than-expected drop reinforced their view that 
inflation pressures in the production process can scarcely be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation's tameness is behind Wall Street's belief that the  
Federal Reserve isn't in a hurry to increase interest rates, 
despite unexpectedly strong economic growth so far this year. And 
that, in part, is what's driving the Dow Jones Industrial average 
to new records. In early trading today, it rose 5 points to 9,902. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two months of disturbingly high (producer price)  
numbers, the February decline is reassuring,'' said economist David 
Orr of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. ``It is far too early 
for the Fed to decide there are any significant inflation pressures 
developing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February's decline reflected drops of 1.4 percent for food -- the  
most since July 1982 -- and 1 percent for energy. Prices excluding 
the volatile food and energy components were unchanged after edging 
down 0.1 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Vegetable prices, down 23.5 percent, led the food decrease. That  
included drops of 54 percent in prices paid by wholesalers for 
tomatoes, 47 percent for broccoli, 40 percent for corn and 39 
percent for radishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork prices also fell, 6.3 percent, as did beef and veal, 2.4  
percent. Fruit, however, rose 2.6 percent, including a 19.5 percent 
jump for Granny Smith apples and 13 percent for strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall decline in energy prices came despite a small 0.2  
percent gain for gasoline. Heating oil fell 4.1 percent; 
residential electric power, 0.6 percent, and residential natural 
gas, 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside food and energy, car prices fell 0.3 percent, though  
light trucks rose 0.4 percent. Clothing prices fell overall, too. 
And computers fell 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescription drug prices, however, jumped 0.8 percent and have  
risen 20.6 percent over the past year. Prices in one often 
troublesome area, tobacco, were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices earlier in the production process also were well behaved.  
They fell 0.5 percent for intermediate goods and 3.4 percent for 
crude goods. An example of the three processing stages if cotton 
for crude, cloth for intermediate and clothing for finished. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said businesses'  
inventories rose a slight 0.1 percent in January at the same time 
that sales dropped 0.3 percent, the first decline since August.

<HEADLINE> McCain: GOP Must Get Back to Basics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona, trying to  
build support in a state where the Republican Party establishment 
has thrown its weight behind Texas Gov. George Bush and Elizabeth 
Dole, urged the party to unite once again behind the basics of less 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of South Carolina are independent, they're  
patriotic,'' he said Friday at a fundraiser. ``They have a very 
significant veterans population and I intend to motivate them to 
support my candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran, must topple Bush and former  
American Red Cross President Dole to win the South's earliest 
presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Though McCain has not officially declared his candidacy, he  
repeated his promise not to ``stoop to negative personal attacks 
against fellow Republicans.'' He also urged South Carolina 
Republicans to unite behind the party basics of less government and 
lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans must ``remind voters that we are not simply the  
anti-Clinton party,'' McCain said. ``I believe people understand 
very well what we stand against. We need to remind them what we 
stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as he talked of unity within the party on core issues, he  
spoke out against New York Gov. George Pataki's call for the 
removal of the anti-abortion plank from the GOP's national 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not agree,'' McCain said, conceding that he might  
consider an abortion-rights running mate if that person had good 
``overall qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain faces an uphill battle in South Carolina, where Bush  
enjoys the support of key party officials, including Lt. Gov. Bob 
Peeler and House Speaker David Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Attorney General Charlie Condon is state chairman for  
Dole's presidential bid.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Arkansas Legislator Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A former Arkansas state legislator  
was sentenced Friday to 30 months in federal prison for trying to 
sell 35 Canadian military helicopters to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert S. Fairchild, 55, of Little Rock and his partner Donn  
Proven, a former police commissioner from Glenview, Ill., were 
found guilty in December of trying to sell the choppers to Iraq. 
Proven was sentenced last week to 46 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were attempting to get a fledgling military training  
company off the ground when they were arrested at the Jupiter Beach 
Resort in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities say the two men planned to sell the  
helicopters to Iraq for $12 million. The government learned of 
their plans when a Florida helicopter broker contacted U.S. Customs 
agents and told them he had been approached by the pair to buy the 
helicopters for them.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Regulators Seize Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a first for California, state regulators  
have taken over an ailing health care network, vowing that service 
to the company's 1.3 million patients statewide will not be 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Corporations on Thursday placed  
MedPartners Provider Network into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times, citing unnamed sources, reported today  
that the takeover was to ensure the company wouldn't close without 
making arrangements to care for patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came as a shock to company officials.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the actions are unwarranted and we believe we've  
met our obligations to support the plan,'' said Robert Mead, 
spokesman for MedPartners Inc., the parent company of the Long 
Beach-based provider network. MedPartners Inc. runs a total of 117 
clinics and employs 1,000 doctors in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's conservator, Eugene Froelich, said in a letter to  
insurers and employees that the clinics would remain open and no 
employees would lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's action marks the first time California officials have  
taken control of a health care company. Earlier this year, New 
Jersey and Mississippi seized health care companies that were 
near-bankrupt.

<HEADLINE> Interior Officials End Indian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Department officials upset by  
congressional criticism have broken off talks with Indian leaders 
on settling claims on billions in Indian trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Ben Nighthorse  
Campbell, R-Colo., said Thursday the department's action ``sends a 
dangerous message to witnesses that exercising their right to free 
speech could result in reprisals from the federal government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin were found in contempt of court last month in connection with 
a lawsuit over the government's handling of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 3, Interior officials canceled a meeting with tribal  
leaders a few hours after the hearing by two Senate committees, 
including Campbell's. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior's assistant secretary for Indian affairs, Kevin Gover,  
said he did not like the tone of the tribal representatives' 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't call me a liar in the morning and that afternoon ask  
me to trust you,'' said Gover, himself an Indian. ``We're not sure 
there is enough trust between the two parties to continue to 
negotiate without some kind of congressional involvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders say his response was childish.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came 1,400 miles to give the testimony and meet with the  
Bureau of Indian Affairs. They told us their feelings were hurt and 
they didn't want to meet,'' said Charles Tillman, chief of 
Oklahoma's Osage Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Babbitt said he had nothing to do with  
canceling the negotiations. ``We're hopeful that a process can be 
set up for productive meetings in the future,'' Stephanie Hanna 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior manages $2.5 billion belonging to tribes and another  
$500 million owned by individual Indians. The money includes lease 
revenue, royalties and court settlements. The funds were mismanaged 
for decades, and lawyers for the Indians say the government could 
be liable for billions of dollars in claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillman is on the board of a group that has been negotiating  
with the department on a way to settle claims on the tribal 
accounts. The accounts belonging to individual Indians are the 
subject of a class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest single account, worth $500 million, is the proceeds  
of a court judgment won by the Sioux tribes as compensation for 
their loss of the Black Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal judge handling that litigation said he was tired of  
lies and bureaucratic foot-dragging and found Babbitt and Rubin in 
contempt of court over their delay in turning over account records.

<HEADLINE> Michigan State Readies for Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- From the time they were small, Michigan State's  
Mateen Cleaves, Antonio Smith, Charlie Bell and Morris Peterson 
were either playing on the same team or against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere on those basketball courts of Flint, Mich., the four  
developed a strong bond that, one by one, drew them to Michigan 
State. And it's that bond, in part, that's taken the Spartans to 
back-to-back Big Ten titles, their highest ranking -- No. 2 -- since 
Magic Johnson, and the Midwest Regional's No. 1 seed in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State played No. 16 seed Mount St. Mary's in  
first-round action today at the Bradley Center. No. 8 seed 
Villanova plays ninth-seeded Mississippi tonight. In earlier games, 
fifth-seeded University of North Carolina-Charlotte played Rhode 
Island, the 12th seed, and No. 4 seed Arizona took on 13th-seeded 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Flint connection, it's something kind of special,''  
Cleaves said. ``Four guys who grew up playing together, playing 
against each other, being on the same team college team. We've got 
a nice, close-knit bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``But here, it's the whole team,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	But it begins with ``The Flintstones.'' Cleaves, Bell and Smith  
are all starters, and Peterson leads the Spartans in scoring 
despite playing off the bench. Cleaves is the heart and soul of the 
team, an All-American and two-time Big Ten MVP who runs the offense 
like a drill sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson would be a starter anywhere else, but coach Tom Izzo  
told him the Spartans needed him in reserve. He's averaging 13.7 
points per game, and his 5.2 rebounds are second best on the team. 
Bell is the do-everything guy. He's averaging 8.1 points and 4.1 
rebounds a game, and was Michigan State's leading rebounder in five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	And Smith is the guy who started it all. A year ahead of Cleaves  
at Northern High School in Flint, Smith was the first to become a 
Spartan. Then came Peterson, Cleaves and, finally, Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio was the main reason I think all the Flint guys came  
here,'' Cleaves said. ``Antonio made the first step. I had a good 
relationship with him, we played with each other, grew up in the 
same neighborhood, so Antonio took that first step and I think he's 
the main reason the other guys came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Cleaves and Smith who started the tattoos, too. The two  
went out one day and had ``Flint'' tattooed on their right 
shoulders to show their pride for their hometown. It wasn't long 
before they were badgering Peterson and Bell to get inked, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of made them go get them,'' Cleaves admitted. ``People  
across the country think Flint is just violence and plants closing. 
It's a lot of down-to-earth, hard-working people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud of Flint,'' he added. ``That's why we want to let  
everyone know we're from Flint, because we're proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ``The Flintstones'' have become a cute, catchy trademark  
for the Spartans -- the band plays the theme song at games, and two 
fans dressed up as Fred and Barney at last weekend's Big Ten 
tournament -- the team doesn't have cliques, Jason Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're sitting in a group, it's not the group and the  
Flint group,'' said Klein, another starter. ``The media makes more 
out of that than our whole team does, to be honest with you. Like 
Mateen said, four individuals that came from Flint, it's great, 
it's unbelievable that that's happened, but within the team group, 
it's meshed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flintstones or no Flintstones, the Spartans do have unique  
chemistry. Izzo said he's never been around a team that gets along 
as well as his does. The coaches like spending time with each 
other. The players hang out together. The coaches and players even 
enjoy doing things together. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a rare thing, and Izzo knows he's lucky.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in it long enough to know it's not the norm,'' he  
said. ``Yeah, the kids from Flint help. We also have a lot of kids 
from the state of Michigan. But they're still all from different 
families, they all come from different cultures in their own way. 
The melting pot is because we like one another.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force To Keep Current Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force's bomber fleet, which includes  
B-52s that have been flying since before the Vietnam War, will have 
to last another 40 years, the Air Force's top officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, said $3.6  
billion is being invested over then next 10 years to upgrade the 
fleet -- giving it more advanced communications links and newer 
precision-guided weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Air Force does not intend to even begin planning for a  
next-generation bomber until about 2013, Air Force Secretary F. 
Whitten Peters said. Peters, Ryan and other Air Force officials 
briefed reporters at the Pentagon today on a new Air Force ``white 
paper'' on the future of the bomber fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force timeline indicates that the current bomber fleet,  
which totals 190 aircraft -- 93 B-1 Lancers, 76 B-52 
Stratofortresses and 21 B-2 Spirits -- will be worn out by about 
2037. The B-52s, which were built in 1960 and 1961, might last 
until 2044, by which time they would be 84 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters said the intention is to keep 130 of the planes in  
combat-ready condition. The others are backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Air Force would like to bring on a new generation  
of bombers earlier, it cannot afford to move faster. The main 
priority in aircraft development over the next two decades will be 
new fighter planes -- the F-22 stealth plane and the so-called Joint 
Strike Fighter, to replace today's F-15s and F-16s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Forces estimates it spent $30 billion building the B-1  
fleet and $45 billion on the B-2s. The B-52 is so old and has 
undergone so many changes that the Air Force has no estimate of its 
total cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said there are a wide range of possibilities for a new  
generation of bombers, including the development of orbiting space 
vehicles from which futuristic weapons would be fired at targets on 
Earth.

<HEADLINE> Envoy Indyk Pushes Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Traveling quietly but with an ambitious  
agenda, American diplomat Martin Indyk is trying to plan beyond the 
Israeli election in May for a resumption of negotiations with Syria 
and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	On a four-stop trip that does not include Jerusalem, Indyk, the  
assistant secretary of state for the Near East, is also trying to 
rally Arab support for U.S. pressure on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	If he can nudge the stalled Israeli-Palestinian process along  
that would be an unexpected dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	A former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Indyk may go there later on.  
But for the time being, his focus is on Syria, whose negotiations 
with Israel have been sidetracked for years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Indyk will meet in Damascus with President Hafez  
Assad, who has made no secret of his primary goal: recovery of the 
Golan Heights strategic outpost that Syria lost to Israel in the 
1967 Six-Day War. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials say it is not realistic to expect a  
resumption of negotiations before Israel holds its national 
elections on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's struggle to  
remain in power could hold the key to U.S. diplomacy in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	While Netanyahu wants to retain the Golan Heights as a barrier  
to Syrian attack, the opposition Labor Party is willing to run the 
risk of swapping the land for a peace accord -- a policy heartily 
endorsed by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Labor ousts Netanyahu, working out an agreement would be  
no cinch. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher made 27 trips to  
Damascus in the first Clinton administration, backed by a Labor 
government in Jerusalem willing to yield the border plateau. Even 
so, Christopher failed to persuade Assad to strike a deal with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria also holds the key to the tense situation on the  
Israeli-Lebanese border. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has offered to negotiate a withdrawal of Israeli  
forces from an enclave in southern Lebanon, but Syria is insisting 
the dispute must be addressed as part of an overall settlement that 
includes return of the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	A published report that Syria has agreed to provide Iraq with  
$100 million worth of military equipment, including spares for 
antiaircraft facilities hit in U.S. and British bombings, was on 
Indyk's agenda, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times of London, quoting unidentified intelligence sources,  
said the parts would include engines for Russian-made tanks and 
tracks for armored fighting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Zionist Organization of America, Morton A.  
Klein, said the report ``should be of grave concern to every 
American citizen'' because U.S. military forces could be 
endangered, 
</P>
<P>
	Indyk began his travels in Morocco and stopped Friday in Turkey,  
where he talked to government officials about Iraq and Iran but 
focused on the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	He intends to go on to Jordan, where King Abdullah has  
reaffirmed the commitment his father, the late King Hussein, made 
to maintaining peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the new monarch urged Palestinian leader Yasser  
Arafat not to declare statehood in May if negotiations with Israel 
are unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is eager to put the Wye accord back  
on track. Negotiated last October, it committed Israel to 
relinquishing more of the West Bank to the Palestinians and Arafat 
to moving more aggressively against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	After an initial Israel pullback, the process stalled, with the  
two sides swapping accusations of unkept promises.

<HEADLINE> Oil Chiefs Agree To Cut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Oil ministry representatives from  
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Mexico today agreed to cut 
production by more than 2 million barrels a day in an attempt to 
bolster depressed oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On commodity markets, prices jumped to five-month highs.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is effective April 1, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi  
said. The pact was reached after two days of meetings ahead of a 
March 23 meeting of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	After hovering near 12-year lows this winter, oil prices have  
rebounded in recent days as traders grew optimistic that some 
production cutbacks would be announced before the OPEC meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement pushed up contracts for April delivery of  
light, sweet crude 59 cents to $14.90 per barrel this morning on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange -- the highest level since early 
October. The rally has pushed oil prices up 39 percent from 
December's 12-year low of $10.72. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil was up 75 cents at  
$12.95 per barrel in afternoon dealings at the International 
Petroleum Exchange, after hitting an intraday high of $13.19. Brent 
crude last settled above $13 per barrel in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Janelle Matharoo, an analyst with Bankers Trust in London, said  
the production cutbacks were at the high end of what analysts had 
been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any higher than this and I think it would have got into the  
range of implausible. This is about the maximum people can 
stomach,'' Matharoo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Further details of the cuts were expected to be released later  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of Iran's production had been one of the major  
obstacles to a new agreement on further output cuts by both the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran has insisted that any cuts be made from a base production  
level of 3.925 million barrels a day, while other oil producers 
claim that figure should actually be 3.623 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, consultations between Saudi Arabia and Iran  
and also between Gulf Cooperation Council members appear to have 
broken the stalemate.

<HEADLINE> Largest Swiss Bank Reports Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, earned  
$2.2 billion in 1998 despite investment losses and an out-of-court 
settlement of Holocaust claims in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first annual earnings report for UBS since its  
formation last June by the merger of two major Swiss banks, Union 
Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-year profit was less than the $2.3 billion profit  
reported for the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-half results reflected a loss of $726 million by its  
investment bank, Warburg Dillon Read, on investments in financial 
derivatives and hedge funds, notably the U.S. fund Long Term 
Capital Management which was the beneficiary of an unusual rescue 
plan to avoid failing last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit also was reduced by $362.6 million due to a charge for  
UBS' share of the $1.25 billion settlement in the U.S. lawsuit over 
dormant World War II-era bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS joined with Credit Suisse in New York last August in  
agreeing to a settlement of the claims against them stemming from 
dormant accounts deposited by people later killed by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly merged bank said it continues to fine-tune its  
operations and strategies. It said its worldwide staff is now 
48,011, a cut of 7,165 people during the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank announced several changes in top management, including  
the retirement of Hans de Gier, the chairman and chief executive 
officer of Warburg Dillon Read. Markus Granziol, an 11-year veteran 
of the group, will become CEO of Warburg. Fritz Hobbs will become 
chairman of Warburg, while retaining his role as head of corporate 
finance.

<HEADLINE> School Desegregation Deal Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A federal judge approved a settlement Friday in  
the St. Louis school desegregation case that allows busing to 
continue but frees the district from court supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr. said the settlement  
between the state and other parties in the case represents ``a 
fair, reasonable and adequate resolution to this historic case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said the agreement is not a panacea to achieve  
extraordinary education for St. Louis-area school children. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing 21 parties have been quarreling since 1972,  
when the original lawsuit was filed by Minnie Liddell, a black 
mother who alleged that St. Louis Public Schools and the state of 
Missouri were responsible for a segregated school system. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon apologized again Friday to  
past generations for once supporting a system that allowed skin 
color to determine where children went to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my opinion that the state of Missouri has learned its  
lesson,'' Nixon said. ``We must all work to ensure that all 
children, regardless of their ethnicity get a quality education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement ends St. Louis' court-ordered school  
desegregation program. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $1.6 billion dollars have been spent on the program,  
which currently sends 13,000 black inner-city students to 
predominantly white schools in St. Louis County. In addition, about 
1,300 county students attend city magnet schools, which offer 
special programs such as technology and the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement scales back busing between the city and county  
school districts, maintains the city's magnet school program, 
provides about $180 million for new schools and sets student 
achievement goals for city schools.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Bank Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breaking a daylong stalemate over consumer  
privacy, the House Banking Committee overwhelmingly approved 
legislation to lift Depression-era barriers between banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel voted 51-8 Thursday to adopt the complex measure and  
send it to the full House. The Clinton administration has expressed 
strong support for the bipartisan House bill but has threatened to 
veto financial overhaul legislation pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have an excellent bill that will be signed into  
law,'' Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the committee's senior 
Democrat, said after the evening vote. ``We have a bill that brings 
us into the 21st century (and) protects and promotes consumer 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress tries again to overhaul the financial services laws  
and allow the three industries to get more deeply into each other's 
businesses, fears have arisen about how customer information will 
be shared among affiliates of the big new companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Banking Committee spent three days laboring on a draft of  
the bill. As the drafting proceeded Thursday, several lawmakers and 
aides worked feverishly behind the scenes on a consumer privacy 
measure to be attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the privacy measures proposed, authored by Reps. Jay  
Inslee, D-Wash., and Robert Weygand, D-R.I., would have required 
new financial conglomerates to give consumers the right to opt out 
of arrangements for sharing all of their personal data with 
affiliated companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an ``opt-out'' is considered less stringent than an  
``opt-in,'' which requires a consumer's express written consent 
before personal data can be used by a financial institution or 
disclosed to others. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers eventually voted, 52-6, to adopt a milder  
proposal by committee Chairman James Leach, R-Iowa. It would 
restrict the sharing of customers' health information among 
affiliated companies but would allow their transaction data, such 
as checking account history, to be shared even if they made an 
opt-out request. Under current law, opt-out requests apply to a 
consumer's credit history but not to his or her transaction data. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal banking regulators have pointed to consumers' growing  
fears about companies' enhanced ability to track, use and sell 
personal financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the legislation would create serious privacy risks for Americans as 
banks, brokerages and insurers compiled profiles of customers' 
buying habits, hobbies -- even health information. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible scenario: A woman's husband has died, and she has  
received a check from his life insurance policy. The insurance 
company tips off an affiliated securities firm, and she starts 
getting phone calls from a broker trying to sell her the latest hot 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Or: A bank customer applies for a loan. The loan officer checks  
with the bank's affiliated health insurance company and discovers 
that the customer has cancer. The loan is denied for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists for the banking, securities and insurance industries  
indicated earlier Thursday that adoption of Inslee's tougher 
privacy measure could kill their support for the overall 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, one of the key reasons the industries have been pushing  
financial overhaul legislation is that it would open numerous 
opportunities for them to market their services by using shared 
customer data. 
</P>
<P>
	A current example is the big effort by financial giant Citigroup  
to sell Citibank customers the investments and insurance offered by 
the bank's merger partner, Travelers Group. Over the next six 
months, New York-based Citibank plans to train and license up to 
3,000 of its branch employees in financial analysis and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup, created by one of the biggest mergers in U.S.  
corporate history, got permission from the Federal Reserve to 
operate for several years, so the company didn't have to wait for 
enactment of financial overhaul legislation before it combined.

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Stock Falls 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A grim first-quarter forecast from  
Caterpillar Inc., a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, 
sent the company's stock tumbling by about 12 percent Friday and 
stalled the Dow's race to the 10,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged slide in sales of engines and heavy machinery to  
commodity-based industries like oil, mining and agriculture, 
significantly cut revenue, Caterpillar officials said. Caterpillar, 
based in Peoria, Ill., said it expects first-quarter earnings of 42 
cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had estimated 
the company would earn 84 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors responded by sending Caterpillar's stock down $6.18 3/4  
to close at $44.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Blanton, an analyst with brokerage house Ingalls &AMP; Snyder  
LLC of New York City, said Caterpillar's fall knocked about 24 
points off the Dow. The index of 30 blue-chip stocks came within 42 
points of 10,000 before giving up ground and closing at 9,876.35, 
down 21.09 on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar will make a series of steps to cut costs, including  
a one-week shutdown at an East Peoria plant to temporarily lay off 
1,200 people. The plant will also temporarily close a plant in 
Brazil. The company may also shut down of other plants in Latin 
America, Europe and elsewhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the poor expectations for the first quarter of 1999,  
Blanton expects a turnaround for Caterpillar later in the year. 
Caterpillar has already seen an increase in orders for equipment 
from Asia, and expects increased sales when federal highway 
spending kicks in later in 1999, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher volume in those areas should overcome losses from the  
commodity-dependent markets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing here is a mid-cycle weakness due to weak  
commodity prices,'' Blanton said. ``But those weak commodity prices 
are one of the reasons why this economy keeps growing, because it 
means low inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall for the year, the company expects to earn $3.60 a  
diluted share, near Wall Street's consensus estimate. That would 
still be 10 to 15 percent lower than profits in 1998 because of 
price-cutting and lower sales volume.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Mad Over Strike Zone, Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires, once again angry at owners,  
filed grievances Friday to block the new interpretation of the 
strike zone and to prevent the American League from sending them to 
Cuba for Baltimore's historic exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	The more serious grievance, one that could create confusion on  
the field, deals with the strike zone memorandum issued Feb. 19 by 
Sandy Alderson, the new executive vice president of baseball 
operations in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to complaints that umpires have lowered and widened  
the strike zone, Alderson told them to raise the top of the strike 
zone to two inches above the top of the uniform pants. That's still 
below the definition called for in the official playing rules -- the 
midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the 
uniform pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a misguided edict attempting to raise the strike zone, the  
commissioner's office in fact substantially lowered the zone and 
has done so in direct violation ... of the Major League Agreement, 
which requires a two-thirds vote of the rules committee in order to 
effect any rules changes,'' said a statement issued by the office 
of umpires union head Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips also complained the interpretation was made  
unilaterally by baseball, saying the umpires' labor agreement 
requires they be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the umpires comply with the new strike zone rule, they  
will violate the Major League Agreement and their contractual 
obligations to enforce the official playing rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson was in Cuba working on preparations for the March 28  
exhibition game and could not be contacted, and commissioner Bud 
Selig's staff was unable to reach him. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires at first demanded that the AL and NL offices -- their  
legal employers -- tell them to enforce Alderson's memo. So far this 
spring, they have been calling higher strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the players need to know is: `What is the strike zone?'''  
said Gene Orza, the No. 2 official of the players' association. 
``My understanding was that the commissioner's office memorandum 
did not suggest or want strict enforcement of the rule, just that 
they wanted the rule to be more strictly enforced. It was premised 
on the belief that to strictly enforce the rule as written would 
require the umpires to make too radical a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conclusion of the grievance is that umpires would be happy  
with a new edict: strictly enforce the strike zone. No fair-minded 
person can claim the strike zone as written in the rule book is the 
one the umpires have been calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other grievance is probably over money. As part of the  
agreement with Cuban sports officials for the Orioles' exhibition 
games, half of the umpiring crew was to come from the American 
League, the other half from Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ANTIGUA, Guatemala (AP) -- Leaders of hurricane-battered Central  
America called on President Clinton Thursday for wider access to 
U.S. markets, fairer immigration rules and timely reconstruction 
aid. ``We are determined to see this area emerge from adversity,'' 
Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people  
and caused up to $10 billion in damage in this impoverished region, 
the leaders expressed hope that the rebuilding will strengthen 
economies and establish prosperous societies with equal opportunity 
after decades of civil wars, coups and dictatorships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Central America, for all of its economic difficulties,  
basically is being well managed,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day of his four-day visit to the region, Clinton  
met with the leaders of Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Belize. 
</P>
<P>
	They conferred at a hotel built amid the ruins of a 17th-century  
Dominican monastery in this old Spanish capital in the Guatemalan 
highlands. Three forested volcanoes tower over the city, which is 
lined with cobblestone streets and whitewashed buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one winding road leads into Antigua from Guatemala City. It  
was blocked for a while during the summit by about 100 
demonstrators angry about layoffs in the banana industry because of 
Hurricane Mitch's damage. Police in riot gear reopened the route, 
which Clinton had to take to get to the airport for his flight 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used a summit-ending news conference to express concern  
about a House debate over whether U.S. troops should be sent to 
Kosovo as peacekeepers. ``It's premature,'' he said. Clinton said 
Congress should not do anything that would ``preempt the peace 
process or encourage either side to say no to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, after the House voted bipartisan support for his  
Kosovo policy, Clinton said in a statement that the action sent ``a 
clear message to both parties that it's time now to sign an 
agreement that stops the fighting in Kosovo and creates real self 
government for the Kosovar people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also defended his administration's handling of suspected  
security breaches at federal nuclear weapons labs and concerns that 
China may have obtained top-secret nuclear warhead information in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not ignore evidence,'' the president said. ``Quite the  
contrary, we acted on it.'' He said congressional committees 
received at least 16 briefings on the problem and that he tightened 
security safeguards. He said he would not fire National Security 
Adviser Sandy Berger or ask him to resign, as some Republicans have 
urged. 
</P>
<P>
	Summarizing a day of talks, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman  
said that greater access to the U.S. market is the key for 
sustained development to fight poverty and unemployment, ``the 
social evils that affect our countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders muted their disappointment at Clinton's failure to  
get swift congressional approval for $956 million in reconstruction 
aid, freer access to U.S. markets and a suspension of the 
deportation of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reaffirmed my intention to support our immigration laws  
fairly and justly, but to work strongly for the elimination of any 
disparities in our law so that they treat Central Americans 
equitably, whatever their country of origin,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the law provides more favorable treatment to  
immigrants from Nicaragua and Honduras than from El Salvador and 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States supports greater debt relief for  
Central America. In their final communique, the leaders said debt 
relief was critical -- particularly for Nicaragua and Honduras -- to 
sustain development. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted he also has asked Congress to expand trade  
opportunities for Central America and the Caribbean by lowering 
tariffs and quotas -- a move that Capitol Hill has ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising the spread of democracy, Clinton said, ``Something  
great has happened here in Central America in the last decade. ... 
We are determined to see this area emerge from adversity, in a way 
that places all of us on higher ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The joint communique, broadly pledging intra-American  
cooperation to improve human rights, tackle crime and drugs, and 
clean up the environment, went through some 37 drafts as it was 
shuffled among the eight nations on their way to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Antigua was the last stop on a trip that also included a tour of  
hurricane devastation in Nicaragua, a visit with U.S. troops in 
Honduras and a speech to the El Salvador legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Antigua is known for its craftsmen and artisans. Clinton bought  
two jade necklaces, three pieces of ceramics and Guatemalan coffee 
during a long shopping excursion on his arrival here late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spent two of the four nights on this trip  
schmoozing with reporters at off-the-record dinners. White House 
officials said the sessions were intended to improve relations with 
the press after a scandal-strained year.

<HEADLINE> French Banks Reject BNP Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Banque Nationale de Paris's bid to form a European  
banking giant by merging with two of France's leading financial 
institutions hit another potential stumbling block Friday when one 
of its prospective partners branded the idea ``unworkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale's board of directors said the takeover bid was  
not feasible, and that it wanted to press ahead with previous plans 
to join solely with Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Paribas -- the other player in the possible  
three-way deal -- rejected BNP's $37 billion bid, setting the stage 
for a lengthy battle over the future of France's financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale said in a statement that it would take legal  
action if regulatory authorities approve BNP's merger proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau on Friday defended his  
plan to create a European banking powerhouse, saying he believes 
his counterparts at Paribas and Societe Generale will eventually 
see the merits of BNP's takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced that, sooner or later, we will talk and we will  
arrive at an agreement,'' BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau said on 
French radio. 
</P>
<P>
	In a one-page statement offered Thursday after a lengthy board  
meeting, Paribas said BNP's offer ``can't be considered friendly.'' 
In another sign that Paribas expects a struggle, it has retained 
Rothschild and Cie. Banque to help in its defense. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP stunned the European financial world Tuesday by launching an  
unsolicited $37 billion double-barreled takeover bid for Paribas 
and Societe Generale. If the acquisition is successful, it would 
thwart the planned $17.2 billion friendly merger that Paribas and 
Societe Generale were in the process of completing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau also said he's convinced that Societe Generale and  
Paribas won't enlist a foreign ally to fend off his unsolicited 
takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them to go seek a white knight abroad, we would have to be  
against them,'' he said. ``Well, we're not against them. We're 
proposing to create with them a large French banking center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau added that French banks must unite before looking for  
alliances with other European banks, in order to avoid becoming 
mere minority shareholders in foreign banking giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing recent banking mergers in Spain, the Netherlands and  
Belgium, Pebereau said France must follow the same consolidation 
logic. ``In all the countries of Europe, you see national marriages 
first. The same had to happen in France,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau repeated his pledge that, if the three-way merger is  
ratified by shareholders, there will be no massive job cuts and 
that BNP and Societe Generale's three retail networks would be kept 
separate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed to the rally in Societe Generale, Paribas and  
Banque Nationale de Paris shares as proof that investors approved 
of the merger proposal. On Thursday, Paribas shares climbed 18 
percent, Societe Generale shares rose 13.3 percent and BNP shares 
gained 7.2 percent on the Paris bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, shares in all three banks fell, which analysts  
attributed to profit-taking. BNP fell 3.6 percent, SocGen shares 
fell 0.7 percent, and Paribas fell 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service struck a positive note, saying Friday  
that the proposed merger could, if successful, be good for the 
merged group's credit ratings.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Stephon Marbury agreed to a $70.9 million,  
six-year contract with the New Jersey Nets today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, acquired Thursday in a nine-player trade involving  
Minnesota and Milwaukee, was introduced at a news conference hours 
before New Jersey's game against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known whether Marbury would play because the league  
must approve his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I can say to pretty much sum this up is that this is  
the day I've been waiting to come since I was a child,'' Marbury 
said. ``Through all we want to accomplish in life it's all coming 
true. It's a dream.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Women Seek To Defend Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Lady Vols don't even have  
to be on the court to intimidate other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The aura around the three-time defending national champions is  
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols (28-2) are hosting first- and second-round games  
in the NCAA East Regional on their home court -- where six national 
championship banners hang from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	And 18,000 of the 24,535 seats are colored Tennessee orange.  
That same shade rings the court where the Lady Vols have never lost 
an NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	Just practicing there Friday was enough to impress Boston  
College guard Brianne Stepherson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been so many memories here that you step on the court  
and you want to work hard as soon as you get there,'' Stepherson 
said. ``It was nice. There's a lot of orange out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is Appalachian State (14-14), the only team in the  
tournament without a winning record, that meets Tennessee on 
Saturday night in the first game of the Lady Vols' quest to become 
the only team to win four consecutive national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a bit like David and Goliath,'' said Appalachian State  
coach Barbi Breedlove. 
</P>
<P>
	To combat the Lady Vols' mystique, Breedlove blasted Tennessee's  
``Rocky Top'' anthem from speakers and tried to simulate noise for 
an average crowd of 17,568 during practices. She also had her 
players practice breaking the press against eight defenders instead 
of five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's not enough,'' Breedlove said. ``You can't  
simulate Thompson-Boling Arena. You have to experience it. Our 
young women are here, and I think they look forward to the chance 
to experience that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Pat Summitt knows playing at home is a big  
advantage, and she favors switching opening games to neutral sites 
like the men's tournament once the women's game is popular enough 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still at a position in women's basketball where we have  
to have the format,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Lady Vols plan to take their home court for  
granted. Guard Semeka Randall spent Thursday watching several of 
the upsets in the men's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just know that won't happen to us because we're coming in  
with the mindset to take one game at a time. Take our first game 
slowly but surely and try to put them away early,'' she said. ``You 
should be self-motivated in March anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State and Boston College play each other Saturday night,  
yet still faced questions about potential second-round opponent 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Beth Burns said her Buckeyes (17-11) are not looking  
beyond the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited to see we've got an opportunity not only to play  
a good Boston College team but in an environment that is unequaled 
anywhere in the history of the game,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College coach Cathy Inglese already has her strategy  
ready on how to prepare her Eagles (21-7) for Tennessee if they 
beat Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speak to them on Saturday night and Sunday on the fact that  
let's look back to our positives,'' Inglese said of upsetting Notre 
Dame and Connecticut earlier this season.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Wetteland Says He's Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- When John Wetteland finished his  
first outing of the spring Friday, he wanted to talk about results: 
a line-drive single, two lineouts and a called strike three. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't want to talk about how he felt.  
</P>
<P>
	After experiencing serious arm trouble last season then hurting  
his right ankle last month, Wetteland wanted to focus only on his 
12-pitch performance in Texas' 6-1 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw the ball well, I threw strikes,'' Wetteland said. ``I  
had decent velocity and no one pulled it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland was proud that he threw strikes with his three main  
pitches -- fastball, curve and slider -- and he impressed himself 
with a changeup he threw Alex Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gonzalez was pretty baffled by it,'' Wetteland said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
	Rangers manager Johnny Oates said he was so impressed with  
Wetteland's outing, ``that if we were playing (the season opener) 
tomorrow, he'd be closing the ninth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not?'' Wetteland said. ``I threw an inning on the 12th and  
threw decent. It's obviously not where I would like to be for 
opening day, but I can get most people out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland has been doing that for 10 seasons. Over the last  
seven, he's saved 252 games, the second-best total in the majors. 
His 42 saves last year set a team record and tied for second most 
in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	But last May, while in Baltimore, Wetteland faced a serious  
problem. A fragment had chipped off a bone in his right arm and 
floated into his elbow. He couldn't even straighten the arm. 
Surgery was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland waited a few days before flying back to Texas and it  
was a good thing he did. One morning, the piece dislodged itself 
while he was pulling a fork to his mouth during breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	The fragment bothered Wetteland all year and he had to be  
haunted by the fear that it could get stuck once again just as 
easily as it had popped out. Outsiders, however, didn't know the 
severity of the problem until this spring.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Hits Alaska Ski Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GIRDWOOD, Alaska (AP) -- An avalanche at a ski resort Friday  
trapped a skier who was buried up to her neck and immobilized by 
the weight of the snow. Fellow skiers dug her out quickly and she 
was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers feared that others may be trapped. But after four hours  
of searching, they halted the search after finding no one else. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Ann Nickles, 64, said she was at the edge of the slide area  
when several snowboarders passed her by, yelling about the 
avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked over my shoulder and started poling faster. I thought  
I could outrun it, but the edge got me,'' said Nickles, who was 
buried up to her neck. ``It was very fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 volunteers using long poles searched in a grid  
pattern at the Alyeska Ski Resort after the avalanche swept through 
a bowl popular with skiers and snowboarders at about 2:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	By 6 p.m., mountain manager Larry Daniels said he was almost  
certain no one else was buried. ``If we haven't found them by now, 
chances are they're not there,'' Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Gabrielson was riding a chairlift and said he watched the  
snow catch a woman, apparently Nickles. 
</P>
<P>
	``She tried to outrun it but it caught up with her and carried  
her down about 300 yards,'' he said. A cornice of snow at the top 
of the bowl broke away, he said, leaving nothing but bare rock. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornice that fell had been shot three times Friday morning  
by a 105 mm howitzer during avalanche mitigation efforts, but 
hadn't fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you shoot it and it doesn't come down, you figure it's  
stable. This is a definite surprise,'' Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy snow caused closures Thursday in the area where the  
avalanche happened, but the area was open to skiers and 
snowboarders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The resort is about 40 miles southeast of Anchorage.

<HEADLINE> A&AMP;W To Buy Seafood Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A&AMP;W Restaurants Inc. has agreed to buy  
Long John Silver's Restaurants once the seafood chain emerges from 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, expected this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan-based A&AMP;W has 1,000 restaurants selling root beer and  
burgers. Long John Silver's has more than 1,300 restaurants in 37 
states, Singapore and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price was not disclosed. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for  
the District of Delaware will have to approve the agreement and 
establish procedures to allow other would-be buyers to bid on Long 
John Silver's. 
</P>
<P>
	A&AMP;W spokesman Ron Hingst said Thursday the deal would enable A&AMP;W  
to double its size by adding a non-competing segment while offering 
``a great opportunity for co-branding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to run the chains separately.  
</P>
<P>
	Long John Silver's executives will continue to manage that  
chain's day-to-day operations, and the headquarters will remain in 
Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	It filed for bankruptcy protection last June, weighed down by  
heavy debt that limited its ability to update restaurants and 
expand sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this deal we have the basis for a reorganization plan  
that will get us out of Chapter 11 and give us the opportunity to 
grow our restaurant company,'' said John Cranor, chairman and CEO 
of Long John Silver's. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville restaurant developer James A. Patterson founded Long  
John Silver's in 1969 and sold it to Jerrico Inc. in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Long John Silver's had been struggling with substantial debts  
since 1989, when it was made private in a $626 million leveraged 
buyout, financed almost entirely by high-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
	A&AMP;W was founded in 1919 in Lodi, Calif., by entrepreneur Roy  
Allen, who took on partner Frank Wright in 1922.

<HEADLINE> Women's NCAA Basketball Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Leon Barmore looked at the bracket for his four-team NCAA  
subregional, then he looked at The Associated Press women's 
basketball poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana Tech coach wasn't happy about what he saw.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a tougher subregional, I would like to see it,''  
Barmore said. ``I looked at the final AP poll ... and I started 
counting the teams in the Top 20 who made it and doggone, if two 
besides us are showing up at our place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those two others are No. 18 Penn State and No. 20 Virginia,  
neither of which No. 3 Tech plays in its first-round game in 
Ruston, La., tonight. The Lady Techsters, the No. 1 seed in the 
West Regional, open against 16th-seeded Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That should be no problem for Barmore's quick, explosive team,  
which is second nationally in scoring at 89.1 points a game. But he 
knows that if there is a second game, it would be a tough one. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams seeded eighth and ninth, like Penn State and Virginia,  
usually aren't ranked in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get out of here, a team will really have to be at the top  
of their game,'' Penn State coach Rene Portland said. ``I've been 
here once and got whipped pretty good by Tech. So I know what it 
takes to win in such a great place for women's basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut is the other No. 1 seed playing tonight as the  
tournament gets under way with 16 games at eight sites. The 
remaining first-round games, also at eight sites, are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn, the top seed in the Mideast, plays Northeastern at home.  
And no one is more eager to play that game than Shea Ralph, the 
Huskies' fiery guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph, averaging 17.4 points, missed all last season while  
rehabilitating a knee injury. The year before, she tore the 
anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee three minutes into her 
first NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really ready. I've been waiting two years,'' Ralph said.  
``This is a huge tournament. If you make it and play well, then you 
go to the national championship. That was my goal coming here. This 
is why I play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eighth-seeded Xavier plays ninth-seeded Florida International in  
the other game at Storrs. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 seed in the East, Old Dominion, has been limping  
through the postseason. Point guard Sharron Francis had knee 
surgery Feb. 25 and did not play in the Colonial Athletic 
Association tournament last week. Center Lucienne Berthieu, the 
co-CAA player of the year, saw only limited action in the 
tournament because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Both practiced this week, however, as the Lady Monarchs prepared  
for tonight's game against Tennessee Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to stop me from doing anything,'' Francis said  
of her knee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West Regional at Fort Collins, Colo., second-seeded  
Colorado State and seventh-seeded Southwest Missouri State hope to 
bounce back after having long winning streaks broken, while 
10th-seeded Cal Santa Barbara looks to continue a streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Santa Barabara takes a 21-game winning streak against  
Southwest Missouri, which had a 15-game string broken by a loss to 
Evansville in the semifinals of the Missouri Valley Conference 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very disappointed, to say the least,'' said coach  
Cheryl Burnett, whose team was the regular-season MVC champion. 
``It was unexpected. But at the same time, our team this year has 
really rebounded extremely well from losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State had won 19 straight before losing to SMU in the  
finals of the Western Athletic Conference tournament. The Rams' 
only other loss was to California on Dec 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we lost, it was a good thing for us,'' said  
Becky Hammon, Colorado State's first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State's opponent, Cal State Northridge, had its  
resiliency tested early. The Matadors' coach, Michael Abraham, 
resigned a week before the season after being charged with selling 
cocaine. But they've posted a 21-7 record in earning the school's 
first NCAA bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Cinderella story,'' said Frozena Jerro, the former  
assistant who is now the head coach. ``We started off kind of 
rocky, but to end up here is a blessing.''

<HEADLINE> States Back Hemp Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's high time for hemp, say farmers who are  
enlisting state legislatures in an effort to legalize cultivation 
of the potentially profitable non-hallucinogenic cousin of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana and Virginia have formally called for an end to a  
federal ban on ``industrial'' hemp, and the Minnesota Senate this 
week passed a bill, backed by Gov. Jesse Ventura, aimed at 
permitting experimental hemp production. The Hawaii House this week 
voted to have the state grow a 10-acre test crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp is now grown in more than 20 countries for a variety of  
products, including cosmetics, beer, plastics and paper. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire, North Dakota and Tennessee also are actively  
considering pro-hemp legislation, while lawmakers in New Mexico 
recently funded hemp research, according to Agri-Tech 
Communications Inc., which tracks the agricultural fiber business. 
</P>
<P>
	Former CIA Director James Woolsey was recently hired by the  
North American Industrial Hemp Council to lobby for repeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the federal government relents, our state efforts aren't  
going to do much,'' said David Monson, a North Dakota legislator 
who wants to grow hemp on his grain farm near the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp was perhaps the first plant farmed for fiber -- George  
Washington once grew it -- but it was a victim of the U.S. 
government's move to end marijuana production in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada started allowing hemp production last year. Farmers  
planted 6,000 acres of the weed, claiming profits of as much as 
$200 an acre, this at a time when growers struggle just to break 
even on traditional crops like wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration and Justice Department were  
petitioned a year ago to go repeal the DEA's ban on hemp. 
</P>
<P>
	But the DEA and the White House's Office of National Drug  
Control Policy have said that permitting hemp farming would send 
the wrong signal to young people. They also worry that marijuana 
farmers could hide their crops with industrial hemp plants. Police 
rely on aerial imagery to detect marijuana fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seedlings are the same and in many instances the mature  
plants look the same,'' the Office of National Drug Control Policy 
says in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all the more reason to permit industrial hemp, according  
to pro-hemp forces. Hemp's tendency to cross-pollinate would make 
it risky to cultivate marijuana nearby, because that might hurt the 
potency of the marijuana crop, agronomists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be really, really stupid to hide marijuana in an  
industrial hemp field,'' Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police counter that cross-pollination could produce hemp with a  
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Marijuana normally contains 3 percent to 15 percent or more of  
THC, the psychoactive ingredient, while hemp has 1 percent or less. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also disagreement about hemp's commercial potential.  
</P>
<P>
	USDA researchers concluded that it was a ``novelty product for a  
novelty market.'' But a University of Kentucky study last year 
estimated hemp could bring farmers anywhere from $220 to $600 an 
acre, depending on whether it was grown for its fiber or its seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota State University researchers said hemp could be a  
useful rotation crop for wheat and potato farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Industrial hemp should be considered an alternative crop,''  
said Roger Moe, the Democratic majority leader in Minnesota's state 
Senate. ``It's certainly not going to replace the mainstays of 
agriculture.''

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driver Gets 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- With sobs echoing in the courtroom, a  
drunken driver convicted of manslaughter was sentenced today to 10 
years in prison for the death of a Jehovah's Witness who refused a 
blood transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Cook, 32, must also pay $5,000 in restitution to the  
family of victim Jadine Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury in December convicted Cook of manslaughter instead of  
second-degree murder, rejecting the prosecution's claim that his 
drunken driving was solely responsible for the death of Mrs. 
Russell after the March 7, 1998, accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Jehovah's Witnesses believe there is a biblical basis to  
refusing other people's blood. The defense claimed the 55-year-old 
woman would have lived if she accepted a transfusion, but medical 
testimony indicated survival was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell's relatives said today that Cook and his attorney  
should be ashamed of blaming her death on her faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she had survived this accident, she would've been one of  
the people visiting you in jail,'' her son, Jeff Russell, told 
Cook. ``She would've said, 'The man made a mistake.' She would've 
told us not to hate you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly, you've not affected our faith,'' he added.  
``We, as Jehovah's Witnesses, will not give you that power. You've 
bruised us but you haven't crushed us.'' Other relatives sobbed as 
he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Reginald Yates said he imposed the maximum  
possible sentence. He rejected prosecution arguments that Cook 
could be sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for the 
manslaughter count because he had a prior conviction for drunken 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell was standing on the side of the road with police  
after a minor accident when Cook slammed his pickup truck into a 
stationary car, pushing the vehicle into the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell suffered broken bones and severe bleeding, but she  
told emergency workers and doctors ``No blood!'' at least 10 times, 
and even tried to pull out an intravenous line, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sentencing, Cook's sister Dodie O'Keffe told reporters  
the sentence was too harsh and blamed Mrs. Russell for refusing 
potentially life-saving blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was responsible for getting in his car and driving,'' Mrs.  
O'Keffe said. ``But she made the decision she was going to die that 
night.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Wins One for the Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Maurice Taylor was smiling. The words,  
however, did not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure how to describe how this feels, mostly because we  
haven't felt this way all year,'' the second-year forward from 
Michigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it had been nearly 11 months since Taylor and the Los  
Angeles Clippers had won a game. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to a 15-4 closing run, the Clippers beat the  
Sacramento Kings 106-92 on Thursday night to snap their 
season-opening 17-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clippers got what they deserved tonight, and we got what  
we deserved,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another loss, and the Clippers would have set the record for  
most losses to start a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they share the record with the 1988-89 Miami Heat team.  
The Clippers tied the record Wednesday night, losing 94-75 to the 
Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting for a win for so long,'' said Lorenzen  
Wright, who had 25 rebounds -- most in an NBA game this season and 
three more than his previous career high -- to go with 12 points. 
``Everybody in here is so happy and pleased to get a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he might have added, relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, definitely relief,'' said Darrick Martin, who had 18  
points and 11 assists. ``Anytime you can avoid going into the 
record book in negative fashion, there's got to be relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright was limited to 27 minutes because of foul trouble, just  
eight in the second half. But he led his team to a 58-35 rebounding 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys have faced a lot of adversity, but the streak is over  
and hopefully it's the beginning of something new for us,'' 
first-year Clippers coach Chris Ford said. ``There are still a lot 
of games to play, and we still have a lot to prove. But I'm hoping 
that we will build on this effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing their third game in as many nights, the Clippers  
never trailed, taking the lead for good in the opening 2 1/2 minutes 
and leading 66-52 at halftime behind Wright's 20 rebounds -- one 
more than the entire Sacramento team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers, who lost their first 16 games of the 1994-95  
season, extended their lead to 18 points in the opening 2 1/2 minutes 
of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Kings then went on a 15-2 run and trailed by three  
points midway through the final period when Martin and Eric 
Piatkowski made back-to-back 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what? I wasn't worried,'' Martin said after his  
team's first win since an 83-77 victory over the Kings in 
Sacramento last April 18 on the final day of last season. ``In this 
league, teams make runs. They're a good team, but I wasn't 
worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Martin: ``We're not an 0-17 team, period. I'll go on record  
saying that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, they're not. Not anymore.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Sign Bears Safety Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons rounded out their secondary  
Friday by signing free agent strong safety Marty Carter, who led 
the Chicago Bears in tackles three of the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Carter, an eight-year veteran, apparently means  
William White will not return to the NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Atlanta re-signed cornerback Ronnie Bradford to go  
along with two Pro Bowlers, cornerback Ray Buchanan and free safety 
Eugene Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	White started 32 consecutive games at strong safety the last two  
seasons, but the 33-year-old didn't fit in as the Falcons rebuild 
their aging defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, 29, is a native of LaGrange, Ga., who played at Middle  
Tennessee State. He started 63 of 64 games for the Bears the last 
four seasons, leading the team in tackles every season but 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter had 159 tackles last year, including a career-high 18 in  
a 20-13 loss to the Falcons at the Georgia Dome. He also had two 
fumble recoveries and broke up five passes, but didn't have an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, White had 84 tackles and two interceptions.  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Bears in 1995, the 6-foot-1, 214-pound  
Carter played four seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Belle Shows Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- So much for the new Albert Belle.  
</P>
<P>
	Belle, surprisingly civil since joining the Baltimore Orioles in  
December, finally lost his temper Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After capping an 0-for-3 day against the New York Mets with a  
questionable strikeout, the controversial slugger angrily threw his 
glove, two bats and his helmet into his locker. He then scattered 
several letters that were sitting on his chair, showered and 
stormed out of Fort Lauderdale Stadium without exchanging a word 
with any of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The tirade occurred after the sixth inning, so the clubhouse was  
virtually empty with the exception of a handful of players and a 
few reporters waiting to speak with Orioles starter Mike Mussina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just mad at himself, just like when he gets mad at  
people when they ask him questions,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller 
said. ``It shows me he wants to hit and that he demands excellence 
from himself. There's nothing wrong with that; I just told 
(clubhouse attendant) Jimmy Tyler to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eruption occurred after Belle was called out on a checked  
swing against Mets reliever Greg McMichael. The strikeout ended an 
0-for-3 day that left Belle at 3-for-13 (.231) this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to the clubhouse, Belle muttered to himself as he  
stomped through the dugout. He then shattered one of his bats 
during the brief but extremely animated tantrum. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a five-year contract with the Orioles on Dec.  
1, had been quite pleasant this spring training despite his 
well-documented history of confronting fans, umpires and opposing 
ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle has been suspended for destroying part of a bathroom,  
hitting a taunting fan in the chest with a thrown baseball, twice 
charging the mound, using a corked bat and hitting an infielder 
with his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	But he appeared to be a changed man since joining the Orioles,  
attending a fan-oriented event in Baltimore in January and 
addressing the media twice in three days after reporting to camp in 
February. He also signed dozens of autographs before and after the 
Orioles' exhibition games, often spending up to an hour outside the 
players' parking lot as dusk approached. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed autographs before Thursday's game, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Orioles reliever Jesse Orosco, in the clubhouse during the  
incident, wrote off the tirade as a mere demonstration of Belle's 
competitive nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took an oh-fer. As long as he doesn't hurt anybody, no  
problem,'' Orosco said. ``He wants to perform well in every game, 
even in the spring. That's just the type of intensity he takes the 
ballpark. I think he figures the only way he can get tuned up for 
the regular season is by playing every game as if it means 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the Orioles announced they no longer will open  
the clubhouse to reporters while exhibition games are in progress.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Fix Restores AP Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A GE satellite spun out of control today,  
causing widespread disruption of service to news organizations 
before engineers were able to regain communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The GE-3 satellite provides communications service for North  
America for The Associated Press, Dow Jones, CNN and Fox Network. 
In addition, the AP uses the satellite to relay some services to 
Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem began at 4 a.m., said Monica Morgan, spokeswoman for  
GE Americom Communications in Princeton, N.J., where the satellite 
is based. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost one of the gyros on the satellite, and it started  
rolling and failed,'' said Fred Cain of GE Americom. ``We were able 
to re-acquire the satellite and are bringing it back on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AP services were fully restored shortly before 9 a.m. Cain said  
engineers were working to fully restore other customers and were 
trying to determine what caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP turned to its Web sites to provide its customers with  
Internet access to their AP services. AP has a backup satellite and 
was ready to switch its services had it been necessary, said John 
Reid, AP vice president for technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was put in service in September 1997 and has an  
expected life of 12 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	AP uses several other satellites to deliver its services, and  
they were not affected by the outage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones was not directly affected because it had already used  
the satellite to transmit pages of today's Wall Street Journal to 
printing plants around the country, and transmissions of its 
Barron's magazine pages weren't scheduled to be transmitted until 
this evening, spokesman Richard Tofel said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks Funds From Global Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new U.N. third-world economic development  
effort with multinational corporations is raising questions among 
organizations who wonder whether alleged human-rights and 
environmental abuses by some of the companies are being overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 16 corporations have already paid $50,000 as seed money  
for the initiative, which critics claim will allow companies an 
easy opportunity to use the highly valuable U.N. name to help build 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is considering creating a logo incorporating  
its name that corporate sponsors could use. That's a powerful tool 
in many underdeveloped countries, where the United Nations provides 
food, shelter and other basics of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the companies involved ``are so deeply mired in these  
human-rights and environmental problems that it's a bad choice to 
start with, if they're looking to set examples,'' said Joshua 
Karliner, executive director of the Transnational Resource &AMP; Action 
Center, one of the human-rights organizations that circulated an 
internal United Nations memo describing the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes Dow Chemical Corp., creator of the toxic  
defoliant Agent Orange. Dow failed to return phone calls Thursday 
for comment on the U.N. initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which is among the oil  
companies that a U.N. human rights envoy wants to investigate for 
alleged widespread environmental damage in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies involved have records in foreign countries that  
haven't come into question, such as the telecommunications giant 
AT&AMP;T, the Swedish cellular phone maker Ericsson, and the furniture 
maker Ikea of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Transnational charged that sponsoring companies could use the  
United Nations connection to forge critical local and government 
relationships that will make it easier for them to do future 
projects that won't be under the watchful eye of the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the United Nations Development Programme, the  
development arm of the United Nations, did not deny that the list 
includes some corporations with negative profiles. But they 
fiercely defended the program as a way for corporate bad-actors to 
redeem themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we like it or not, the global corporations are having  
a great impact on the development of poor countries,'' said Eimi 
Watanabe, a U.N. development policy official. ``Quite often, there 
have been negative consequences of those projects, and we are 
trying to turn it around into a positive impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new project was originally set to launch this June. It has  
been postponed until at least next spring, but could shape up to be 
much different from other U.N. endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	It will focus less on traditional, large-scale development, like  
dams, and more on education, health-care, helping people get access 
to telephones and computers, and making tiny loans to nascent 
businesses. Watanabe said plans are to start in Central and South 
America and parts of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan being considered, the projects will be at minimum  
jointly run by corporations and United Nations, and it is possible 
that the companies will be allowed to run the projects themselves, 
largely without U.N. interference. 
</P>
<P>
	Watanabe said corporate sponsors will have to comply with U.N.  
human-rights and environmental guidelines. ``It would be totally 
contradictory to our mandate... if we sell the U.N. name to 
projects that don't meet our standards,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations gets most of its money from governments,  
although U.N. Secretary General Khofi Annan has been engaged in a 
campaign to get corporations more involved with U.N. relief and 
development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign comes as the United Nations struggles to pay its  
debt while the United States, its biggest contributor, has refused 
to pay back dues because of political disagreements between the 
Congress and the Clinton Administration. The United States is $1.3 
billion in arrears, a sum that represents two-thirds of the United 
Nation's entire debt.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Giants Go Head-to-Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. filed a  
federal lawsuit Friday against Philip Morris Inc., accusing the 
world's largest cigarette maker of attempting to monopolize the 
retail arena by shutting out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims a new Philip Morris program scheduled to  
begin April 1 effectively prevents other cigarette brands from 
competing at participating retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Filed in U.S. District Court in Greensboro, N.C., the lawsuit  
seeks a preliminary injunction barring Philip Morris from signing 
up any more retailers for its ``Retail Leaders'' program. The 
program violates federal and state antitrust laws, the lawsuit 
claims. It also seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said the Retail Leaders program promises lucrative  
discounts to retailers that give Philip Morris 100 percent of the 
store's visible retail space three months out of the year. It 
offers a more modest incentive as well, giving smaller discounts to 
retailers that make a commitment of 75 percent of their visible 
space, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Participating retailers then pass along the discounts to  
customers during the promotion period, but cannot discount any 
other cigarette brands during that time, the lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeking out of this ultimately is just to get a  
level playing field where all can compete on a fair basis,'' said 
Seth Moskowitz, a Reynolds spokesman at company headquarters in 
Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Philip Morris officials at New York corporate  
headquarters seeking comment on the lawsuit were not immediately 
returned late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real issue is they are using their market power effort to  
prevent adult smokers from being able to see and buy competitive 
cigarette brands,'' Moskowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris, with its dominant Marlboro brands, has an  
approximately 53 percent share of the retail cigarette market, 
while Reynolds, whose brands include Salem and Winston, claims 25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Moskowitz also said the Retail Leaders program harms  
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't want to sign up for one of those two most  
lucrative display allowance plans, then they receive virtually no 
promotional allowances from Philip Morris,'' Moskowitz said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Adds Three New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDEPENDENCE, MO. (AP)-- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic  
today became full-fledged members of NATO, less than a decade after 
exchanging communist rule for democracy and shedding their Cold War 
military ties to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accepted admission papers  
from the three countries' foreign ministers, marking their formal 
entry into the 50-year-old alliance. ``Hallelujah,'' Albright 
exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hungary has come home. We are back in the family,'' said  
Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi. 
</P>
<P>
	In a touch of symbolism, the ceremony took place at the Harry S.  
Truman Library. It was during the Truman presidency that the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded to halt the westward 
spread of Soviet-led communism. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, NATO's three newest members just a decade ago were  
still under the Soviet umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan said he was in nearby Kansas  
City working with the anti-Soviet undergound in 1968 when Russian 
troops swept through Praque in the occupation of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is for me very symbolic that it is precisely here that we  
today accept the guarantee that my country never again will become 
the powerless victim of foreign invasion,'' Kavan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In looking ahead to even greater expansion of NATO, Polish  
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said, ``We should keep the door 
of the alliance open for those who have fought for freedom ... 
Another curtain should never descend on Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were 12 original members of NATO at the time of its  
founding. Since 1949, it has been expanded to include Greece and 
Turkey in 1952, Germany in 1955 and Spain in 1982. The new 
additions bring the total to 19 and many other hopefuls are waiting 
in the wings: Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania, 
Estonia and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	Just what NATO will do with these eager applicants is not clear.  
The issue is expected to dominate a NATO summit set for Washington 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's mission has changed dramatically since its founding in  
1949, a time when the West was intent on halting the westward 
spread of Soviet-led communism -- a threat Winston Churchill warned 
about in his famous ``Iron Curtain'' speech delivered on March 5, 
1946, at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., 130 miles east of 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the alliance's mission is more ill-defined. NATO warplanes  
helped end the war in Bosnia almost four years ago and now are 
poised to intervene in Yugoslavia should peace efforts in the 
province of Kosovo fail. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago, the military planning of Poland, Hungary and the  
Czech Republic was built around the possibility of a ground assault 
toward the west. As NATO allies, the goal is much smaller armies 
capable of meeting a variety of contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says the three new members ``enhance NATO's  
ability to fulfill its core mission of collective defense, respond 
to a range of security challenges and reduce the possibility of 
another major conflict in Europe of the kind that has claimed so 
many American lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary General Javier Solana says, ``The accession of  
the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland ... is perhaps the clearest 
demonstration of the fact that Europe is growing closer together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Extending membership to these three democracies helps to  
stabilize a region that historically has been the staging ground 
for many of the disasters of this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many Russians -- and some Americans -- are wary about the  
eastward encroachment of NATO. Former Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev says the push east signifies a rejection of the common 
European security system that was discussed at the end of the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov calls extending NATO  
membership into Eastern Europe ``a movement in the wrong 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All European states must cooperate in creating a joint  
security system,'' he was quoted as saying. ``All European states 
must work together in the interests of all countries rather than of 
separate groups.''

<HEADLINE> Vicar Favored in Derby Prep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Carl Nafzger is taking the  
everybody-back-in-the-pool approach to the $750,000 Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer sends his 3-1 favorite Vicar against nine other  
3-year-olds in Saturday's race, one of the major preps for the May 
1 Kentucky Derby. And don't think Nafzger doesn't have Derby dreams 
swimming in his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vicar has done well in the shallow end of the pool,'' Nafzger  
said. ``Now it's time to jump into the deep end. With the way this 
horse has been training, I'd be surprised if he didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until this week, the only question regarding Vicar's status as  
the East's leading Kentucky Derby contender was his dull 
fifth-place finish in the Holy Bull Stakes Jan. 16. Nafzger, 
though, said that Vicar had an entrapped epiglottis at the time and 
underwent minor throat surgery a few days later to correct the 
breathing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar came back strong and beat Cat Thief by a neck in the  
Fountain of Youth, improving his career record to three wins and a 
second in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, is back to challenge  
Vicar, along with four others from the Fountain of Youth -- Certain, 
Grits'n Hard Toast, Aly's Alley and Casanova Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Also trying to run down Vicar in the Florida Derby will be Valid  
Trefaire, Adonis, Wondertross and First American. Adonis and 
Wondertross are trained by Nick Zito. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, the impressive filly who was entered Wednesday but  
drew an unfavorable outside post position, will be scratched 
Saturday, trainer Eddie Plesa Jr., said. Three Ring will run 
instead in the $200,000 Bonnie Miss Stakes for fillies Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger has traveled this Derby trail before. In 1990, Unbridled  
won the Florida Derby, then went on to win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Sellers, who will be aboard Vicar for the third straight  
race, has learned a lot about the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than anything, he doesn't want to be fought,'' Sellers  
said. ``He has tactical speed and you have to let him use it. That 
doesn't mean he has to be on the lead, but he is a horse that will 
be forwardly placed.. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Florida Derby, the main thing is to get him relaxed and  
comfortable. I'd like to be sitting off a couple of horses with me 
in control rather than someone else telling me how fast to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar isn't alone in needing a big day at Gulfstream Park.  
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief has been improving steadily, with a third-place finish  
in the Hutcheson Stakes followed by his runner-up effort in the 
Fountain of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has moved forward since the Fountain of Youth,''  
Lukas said Friday of his main Kentucky Derby prospect. ``You'll 
hear some trainers say that horses never lie. Well, I'm here to 
tell you that they do lie, but he has given me every indication 
that he is moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Azpurua Jr., who trains Certain, is hoping for an  
improvement on his colt's third-place finish in the Fountain of 
Youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's as ready as he can be,'' Azpurua said after Certain  
galloped at Calder Friday. Certain, to be ridden by Kent 
Desormeaux, entered the Fountain of Youth undefeated in four starts 
around two turns. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the Florida Derby card is the $100,000 Swale Stakes,  
with Texas Glitter the 6-5 favorite in a field of six 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Derby preps will be held this weekend in California and  
Louisiana, with trainer Bob Baffert sending out most of his top 
3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Baffert saddles Derby favorite Exploit and Prime  
Timber in the San Felipe at Santa Anita and the filly 
Silverbulletday in the Fair Grounds Oaks; on Sunday, he's got 
General Challenge in the Louisiana Derby and the filly Excellent 
Meeting in the Santa Anita Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert nearly captured the Triple Crown the past two years,  
winning the Derby and Preakness with Silver Charm in 1997 and with 
Real Quiet in the 1998.

<P>
	A storm system over Colorado and the southern Plains brought  
severe thunderstorms to Oklahoma and Texas Friday and snow to 
Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest thunderstorms were across central Texas and into  
central Louisiana. Numerous severe thunderstorm warnings were 
issued for the region. Damaging winds to 60 mph, large hail and 
heavy rainfall were in the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth, Texas picked up 1.68 inches of rain in the 24 hours  
ending at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	On the northern side of the developing storm system, snow was  
widespread. The heaviest snow was falling along the foothills of 
the Rockies in Colorado. Areas from western Kansas into the Texas 
panhandle were expected to see snow increase in the afternoon 
hours, with winds picking up to 20 mph to 40 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, 9 people died in traffic accidents on slippery  
highways Friday afternoon. Authorities blamed the weather and 
excessive speed. 
</P>
<P>
	In south-central Colorado, more than more than 10 inches of snow  
was reported in Del Norte, 7 inches in the San Luis Valley and 5 
inches in Cuchara. Schools in Great Bend, Kan., in the southwest 
part of the state, were closed at noon as the snow began falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Light snow fell from Vermont and New Hampshire, south into New  
York, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Farther north, the temperature 
was warmer as a result of brisk southeasterly winds, causing the 
precipitation to fall in the form of rain and freezing rain across 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure over the Southeast brought a fair and quiet  
morning from areas of the Carolinas and Florida into the Tennessee 
and Ohio valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	Light snow fell in South Dakota and skies in the areas of the  
Dakotas and the northern Mississippi Valley were expected to become 
increasingly cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure was in control in the West. Fair to partly cloudy  
skies were seen from Idaho and Montana south into Nevada, 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system pushing into the Pacific Northwest brought rain  
to western areas of Washington and Oregon. Snow fell across the 
Cascades and Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon, temperatures ranged from 78 in Miami and Fort  
Lauderdale, Fla., to minus 8 in Silver Bay, Minn. The lowest wind 
chill was minus 25 in Hot Springs Va., and the highest wind gust

<HEADLINE> T'Wolves Blame Changes on Marbury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- After losing in the playoffs to Seattle last  
season, the Minnesota Timberwolves could take heart in a future 
that looked brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months and one collective bargaining agreement later, the  
picture is very different, and for that the Wolves blame Stephon 
Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The complexion of our team has changed drastically in the last  
three months because of Steph,'' coach Flip Saunders said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves believe Marbury's unwillingness to play in Minnesota  
not only cost them him, but also former All-Star Tom Gugliotta and 
veteran guard Terry Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Front office boss Kevin McHale said the Wolves were forced to  
trade Marbury when he said he couldn't play on the same team as 
Kevin Garnett, who last year signed a $126 million contract, the 
richest long-term deal in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stephon Marbury expressed some real concern that he wouldn't  
be able to make the kind of money that Kevin Garnett makes, and 
that was kind of bothersome to him,'' McHale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said he tried to explain that the NBA's new collective  
bargaining agreement, ratified in January after a six-month 
lockout, strictly limits how much a player can earn. Marbury was 
unwilling to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to explain to (Marbury) about the importance of  
winning and being in a good situation,'' Saunders said. ``He said, 
`Hey Flip, it's business. Right now, whether it is right or wrong, 
I have a tough time playing with (Garnett) and having to play where 
(Garnett) makes the amount of money he makes, and I'm only going to 
make $71 million.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract extension with  
the New Jersey Nets Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves also believe they lost Gugliotta to Phoenix because  
he didn't want to play with Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``His agent made it very clear to me, if we would have agreed to  
trade Stephon, Tommy would agree to come back to Minnesota,'' 
Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves were unwilling to trade Marbury because they thought  
there was a chance they could re-sign him, either during the season 
or in July, after his three-year rookie contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for Gugliotta to make up his mind, the Wolves lost  
Porter, who signed with Miami because the Wolves couldn't address 
his contract situation until Gugliotta's was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	After Gugliotta signed with Phoenix, Joe Smith took his place at  
power forward. Malik Sealy, Bobby Jackson and Dean Garrett all were 
added before the start of the season, and now Terrell Brandon 
inherits Marbury's job at point guard after coming over from 
Milwaukee in Thursday's nine-player trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves also have two first-round draft picks from the Nets,  
one this year and one in the future, with which to continue 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said it will take time for everyone to adjust, but he  
thinks they will. ``We have a core group that we'll keep together 
for six years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Saunders' confidence comes from what he expects from  
Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, who is averaging 13.5 points and 6.9 assists per game  
this season -- compared to Marbury's 17.7 points and 9.3 assists -- 
was an All-Star in 1996 and '97 when he played for the Cleveland 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to the Bucks in a three-team deal before last  
season. When approached by Bucks management to re-sign, Brandon 
made it clear he had little interest in staying in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know that he ever had a good feel there for  
whatever reason,'' said his agent, Bill Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-year veteran, Brandon will be a free agent after the  
season, but indications are he will re-sign with the Wolves. Duffy, 
who was a teammate of McHale's at the University of Minnesota for 
two seasons in the late 1970s, said Brandon is excited about 
joining the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had no reservations whatsoever,'' Duffy said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Dedicates Ark. Birthplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOPE, Ark. (AP) -- Shoulders hunched against a chilling rain,  
President Clinton thanked his hometown Friday for the ``love and 
loyalty and lessons of a lifetime'' he learned here in a plain 
woodframe home. 
</P>
<P>
	The president returned to Hope for an outdoor ceremony to  
dedicate his birthplace as a historic site. He marveled at the 
restoration of his maternal grandparents' home, 117 South Hervey 
Street, an ivory house with green trim, on a plot of land fronted 
by a white picket fence so fresh the paint was still wet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain makes this day even more poignant for me,'' Clinton  
said. ``To my family and friends I say thank you for love and 
loyalty and the lessons of a lifetime. Thank you for being there 
for me through this whole, wonderful ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house has been open to tourists since June 1997, and  
visitors have come from all 50 states and 43 countries. Its 
official notice on the National Register of Historic Places 
identified the property with ``Clinton's humble beginnings,'' his 
``inner strength'' and the ``dedication to purpose that has 
sustained him throughout his distinguished political career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few more than 100 people sat in raw, biting wind on damp  
aluminum chairs, listening patiently as Clinton reminisced about 
the place where he broke his leg trying to jump rope in cowboy 
boots; learned to count on playing cards that his grandparents 
propped in a window; first prayed; and thought his mother was 
calling from nursing school in New Orleans each time the telephone 
rang. 
</P>
<P>
	He marveled at the preservation of his mother's rose garden, and  
said she would have been proud to see it. Virginia Kelley died in 
1994, and is buried in Hope along with Clinton's grandparents and 
father. Clinton's motorcade stopped in the driving rain before he 
left Hope so that he could visit his mother's grave. 
</P>
<P>
	At the dedication, Clinton also told of an unforgettable lesson  
his elderly Uncle Buddy taught him late in life as his Aunt Olive 
struggled with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw tears in his eyes. And said to my uncle, 'This is really  
hard, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``And he said these words I will 
remember until the day I die. He said, 'Yeah, it is. But I signed 
on for the whole load, and most of it's been pretty good.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, in this town, from my family and friends, that's what I  
learned -- to sign on for the whole load,'' Clinton continued. 
``Though far from perfect, I have tried to do just that for my 
family and my friends, for our beloved state and nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyhood friend Joe Purvis, who drove the restoration effort,  
choked back tears as he spoke of Clinton and why he means so much 
to ordinary Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't come from a grand mansion. He came from a very  
simple, humble home,'' Purvis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton credited his small town upbringing with instilling in  
him the values that drove him to public service and the presidency, 
a lesson he wanted to impart to the children of Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of what I learned that was good, that I took with me for  
the rest of my life, I learned back then,'' he said. ``It doesn't 
matter were you came from in life, it matters what you did with 
your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton took with him a cadre of friends from his Arkansas days,  
including former aide Mack McLarty, White House personnel director 
Bob Nash and friend and confidant Bruce Lindsey. First lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, who has been nursing a bad back, stayed behind in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people, shivering under multicolored umbrellas, met  
Clinton at the airport. ``I always say that the people here stuck 
with me through rain and shine, and now it is literally true,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's brother, Roger, stood beside the stage as Clinton  
spoke, holding his son under a large red-and-white umbrella. The 
boy fed cookies to his father during his uncle's speech, and 
Clinton publicly thanked his brother and sister-in-law for coming 
from California to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's visit had all the trappings of a sentimental sojourn  
for the president, but the bad weather cut into his ability to 
linger and schmooze with those who supported him from the 
beginning, and stayed with him through his impeachment drama that 
unfolded after his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	On his trip, the president also was raising money for Democrats  
in Texas and Little Rock. Arriving for a fund-raising reception in 
Texarkana, Texas, the president was greeted by a dozen protesters 
holding signs that said ``sexual predator alert.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jayhawk Williams Exposes Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON, Kan. (AP) -- Former University of Kansas basketball  
player Billy ``B.J.'' Williams was given a six-month suspended 
prison sentence for exposing himself to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also was placed on a year's probation.  
</P>
<P>
	Reno County District Judge William Lyle followed the  
recommendations of both the prosecutor and defense attorney in 
pronouncing the sentence Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played for the Jayhawks from 1994 through 1997 and  
graduated with a bachelor's degree. He moved in 1998 to Hutchinson, 
where he lived with his wife and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police that Williams stood in front of the  
picture window at his apartment with a towel around his waist. 
Williams waited until someone looked in the window and then dropped 
the towel, exposing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Williams pleaded guilty in January to one count  
of lewd and lascivious behavior. As part of a plea agreement, an 
additional felony and three misdemeanor charges were dropped.

	HENLEY-ON-THAMES, England (AP) -- Tom Jones, Rod Stewart and  
Elton John sent flowers and Elvis Costello, Kiki Dee and Lulu were 
among the mourners Friday at Dusty Springfield's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	The soulful pop singer died of breast cancer on March 3 at 59.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was the very essence of fabness,'' said Neil Tennant of  
the Pet Shop Boys, who recorded ``What Have I Done to Deserve 
This?'' with Ms. Springfield in 1987.

	Costello told the congregation at St. Mary-the-Virgin Church  
that Ms. Springfield's voice communicated a ``sense of longing that 
demanded your attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costello also read a tribute from American composer Burt  
Bacharach who said: ``You could hear just three notes and you knew 
it was Dusty. It was such a rare and beautiful voice. I just want 
to add my thanks for every beautiful note Dusty sang.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Prisons Overhaul Force Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GALT, Calif. (AP) -- Beginning next month, guards in the nation's  
largest prison system will no longer be allowed to fire 
high-powered rifles to break up fights among inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	California had been the only state to allow gunfire as a means  
of halting hand-to-hand clashes. But after April 1, ``we don't 
shoot for fistfights,'' said Richard Ehle, the Corrections 
Department's new internal affairs chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehle proposed the change and presented it this week. Wardens  
will, in turn, oversee training of 45,000 employees at the state's 
33 prisons, with some 160,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy allows guards to use deadly force only to defend  
an employee or inmate from the immediate threat of death, to 
prevent an escape or to stop a riot or arson. 
</P>
<P>
	California prison guards have used lethal violence at a much  
higher rate than guards in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1998, 12 inmates in California's  
maximum-security prisons were fatally shot and 32 were wounded by 
guards firing high-powered rifles to stop fights. In all other 
states combined, six prisoners were shot and killed while 
attempting to escape during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards' shootings of inmates and alleged abuse of prisoners have  
prompted state and federal civil rights probes. 
</P>
<P>
	At Corcoran State Prison, eight officers were indicted for  
allegedly staging gladiator-style fights between inmates. An 
independent panel found last fall that deadly force was not 
justified in 24 of 31 inmate shootings at Corcoran from 1989 to 
1995; guards shot some inmates engaged in fistfights, killing seven 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier that month, the Corrections Department agreed to pay  
$825,000 to settle a civil rights suit over a shooting at Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy, announced late last year, is more specific than  
the previous guidelines. The change has been praised by inmate 
rights' groups, but has raised concerns among guards who must 
maintain order in overcrowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Jimenez of the California Correctional Peace Officers  
Association said the union is ``trying to be supportive'' but 
believes the policy is ``overly restrictive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It assumes officers will have possession of information that  
they will never have until after a shooting,'' Jimenez said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Rise on Cutback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
Friday, briefly surpassing $15 a barrel for the first time in five 
months, after oil producers agreed to cut production by more than 2 
million barrels a day in an attempt to bolster prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain futures dropped sharply and hogs also  
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil pact was reached after two days of meetings in Amsterdam  
among oil ministry representatives from Saudi Arabia, Iran, 
Venezuela and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	All members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries except Iraq have committed to the cutbacks, said Saudi 
Oil Minister Ali Naimi, as did non-OPEC members Mexico and Oman. 
Discussions are under way with other non-OPEC countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is effective April 1, Naimi said. It still must be  
formally approved at the OPEC meeting March 23 in Vienna, Austria. 
Crude oil for April delivery rose above $15 a barrel before falling 
back in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Morris, an oil analyst for Paine Webber, said market  
participants realized the proposed cutbacks still had hurdles to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the market got pretty excited about it early on, but  
then people said, 'Hey, how hard will it be to get that production 
cut?','' Morris said. ``I think they realized there are still a lot 
of factors that need to come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks would be on top of existing OPEC and non-OPEC cuts  
of 3.1 million barrels a day agreed upon last June, exceeding 5 
million barrels a day in total. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude futures rallied earlier in the week amid speculation over  
the cuts, but fell back slightly Thursday as anxious market 
participants awaited word from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for April delivery rose 18 cents to $14.49 a barrel; April  
heating oil rose .84 cents to 38.73 cents a gallon; April unleaded 
gasoline rose .88 cents to 45.18 cents a gallon; April natural gas 
fell .61 cents to $1.759 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<P>
	Grain futures retreated in trading Friday on the Chicago Board

</P>
<P>
	Grains were pressured by bearish planting estimates and  
forecasts for favorable weather in growing regions across the 
central United States. 
</P>

	Wheat fell sharply on word of a storm system bringing moisture  
to the U.S. hard red winter wheat belt. Buying momentum in wheat 
from earlier in the week also fizzled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was pressured by sagging wheat and soybean prices, failing  
to post gains despite lower-than-expected acreage estimates. Corn 
rallied most of the week before falling Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was down 4 3/4 cents to $2.72 1/2 a bushel; May  
corn was off 1 3/4 cent to 2.22 3/4 per bushel; May oats were off 1/2 cent 
at $1.11 per bushel; May soybeans were down 3 1/2 cents to $4.74 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean hogs and pork bellies retreated Friday on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. Despite the winter weather that swept across 
the upper Midwest this week, producers were able to deliver hogs to 
the packing plants. Hog slaughter also kept pace despite the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	April lean hogs were off .60 cents to 71.70 cents per pound; May  
pork bellies were off .53 cents to 50.22 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE>  Schroeder Names Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder named a  
low-key economics expert as Germany's new finance minister today 
and was nominated himself to head the governing Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Democrats' executive committee backed Schroeder's  
choice of outgoing Hesse state governor Hans Eichel to replace 
Oskar Lafontaine as finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves consolidate Schroeder's grip on power a day after the  
left-leaning Lafontaine's stunning resignation from both 
influential posts, and give Schroeder the chance to reshape his 
4-month-old government after a shaky start. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder also was chosen to head the party, concentrating  
critical decision-making in one post. He must be confirmed by a 
vote of the full party at a congress. No date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	How quickly Schroeder could assert authority over a party whose  
left-wing views him with suspicion was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not represent the breadth of the party,'' Andrea  
Nahles, head of the Social Democrats' youth wing, said on ZDF 
television today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine, on the other hand, enjoyed strong party loyalty,  
which he used to quash infighting after taking over the Social 
Democrats in 1995. He was credited with a large share of their 
victory over conservative Helmut Kohl in elections last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine's exit came amid reports of a power struggle with  
Schroeder over the finance minister's controversial tax reform. But 
SPD officials said the plan probably won't be amended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we got rid of the tax reform now, one could declare a state  
of ruin for the country,'' said Joachim Poss, the finance spokesman 
for SPD lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation also served as a warning to the environmentalist  
Greens, who have strained the coalition by pushing for immediate 
closure of nuclear power plants and other projects that reflect 
their ideology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greens had some sympathies for Lafontaine, and leaders of  
the party appeared shaken Thursday night. But they said they were 
confident the coalition would hold. 
</P>
<P>
	To back that up, coalition leaders announced agreement late  
Thursday on a proposed new citizenship law after weeks of 
squabbling between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine did not give a reason for his resignation, but he  
unsettled financial markets with persistent calls for Europe's 
central bank to lower interest rates to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists blamed his attempt to exert political influence  
over monetary policy for the weak start of the new European single 
currency, the euro, which lost 7 percent of its value since its 
Jan. 1 launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders welcomed Lafontaine's exit. Dieter Hundt, head  
of the German Employers' Association, said it ``cleared the way for 
a new beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathias Joerrs, an analyst at BHF Bank, said Schroeder now had  
the chance to put his stamp on economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One approach has been tried now, and that has failed,'' he  
said on n-tv television. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichel, 57, was coordinator for finance policy for Germany's  
SPD-dominated states. He adheres to Social Democratic values of 
relieving the burden on the average taxpayer and providing a strong 
safety social net, but is considered less radically leftist than 
Lafontaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Popular as governor of Hesse state, Eichel lost the post last  
month in an election that turned on opposition to the government's 
plan to grant dual citizenship to many foreigners. He is to 
formally step down April 7.

<HEADLINE> Pearl Harbor Re-Enactment Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- City officials dropped their opposition  
Friday to a re-enactment of the bombing of Pearl Harbor during a 
fireworks and air show in the Kentucky Derby Festival next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Festival organizers had said they would cancel the six-hour  
Thunder over Louisville extravaganza if they were not allowed to 
include the 15-minute Pearl Harbor segment, called ``Tora! Tora! 
Tora!'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement Friday, Board of Aldermen President Steve  
Magre said the city had no interest in stopping the performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby Festival is held each year in the weeks leading up to  
the Kentucky Derby, and includes a parade, fireworks and dozens of 
other events. The fireworks show, scheduled for April 17, annually 
draws more than a half-million people to the Ohio River shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter this week to festival President Michael Berry, all  
12 of the city's aldermen said the re-enactment of the Japanese 
attack that drew the United States into World War II ``hardly 
represents what the Kentucky Derby Festival stands for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The topic also was sensitive because about 33,000 people in  
Kentucky are employed at Japanese-owned plants, such as the Toyota 
factory near Lexington, where sedans and minivans are made. 
</P>
<P>
	One alderwoman said the city could deny permission to stage the  
air show. 
</P>
<P>
	Festival officials responded by asking people to call in and  
express their feelings about the re-enactment. They said Friday 
that 85 percent of the calls they received were in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Wiseman, a spokesman for Toyota's North American  
headquarters in Erlanger, said the company understood that the 
re-enactment had a positive intent -- to honor those who served in 
World War II.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Tickets Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to ride the success of the 1994 men's  
World Cup and the gold-medal performance of the U.S. women's 
Olympic team three years ago, American soccer officials secured 
this year's Women's World Cup. One hundred days before kickoff, 
it's beginning to look like a smart decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-team soccer championship that opens June 19 at Giants  
Stadium, with the United States playing Denmark, already is far 
ahead of projections in ticket sales. And the media publicity blitz 
hasn't even begun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been well beyond where we expected it to be,'' Marla  
Messing, president of the U.S. organizers, said Thursday. She said 
more than 260,000 tickets have been sold, including 45,000 since 
last month's draw. ``The best benchmark is we hoped to be at 95,000 
as of December '98, and at that point we were at about 200,000 
tickets sold. We believe we will be between 400,000 and 500,000 for 
the tournament, and our earlier projections were about 380,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets prices average from $9-$75, depending on the location,  
and are sold in strips for each site. Individual game tickets are 
not yet on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1994 men's World Cup in the United States, tickets were  
priced at $25-$475 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the demand is greater than we had projected,''  
Messing said. ``It's one of two things: the people we thought would 
buy are buying a whole lot earlier, or a lot of people are 
interested in coming to the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact the tournament is being accepted so strongly by the  
American public has encouraged many of the foreign nations in the 
field. While the men's event is followed passionately throughout 
the soccer community, the previous two women's tournaments (in 
China and Norway) weren't nearly so popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a bit difficult to get specific on the legacy of  
the tournament,'' he said, ``but given the reception of the 
tournament in the USA, it has had a significant impact, with 
national teams putting lots of resources behind their teams and 
getting them ready for the World Cup and the Olympics to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``National teams are telling us because of the reception in the  
USA and the attention being given to the women's World Cup, it 
gives them ammunition to go to their federations and get them 
behind the women's team.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs More Airport Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Transportation Committee is trying  
to double spending for airport improvements by using a legislative 
maneuver that could take billions of dollars away from future 
budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's measure to reauthorize the Federal Aviation  
Administration for the next five years also seeks to boost air 
traffic to smaller airports, in part by adding flights out of major 
airports in Chicago, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA bill was approved by voice vote Thursday. The  
administration has its version and the Senate Commerce Committee 
has already acted on its bill, setting the stage for tough 
negotiations on what could be one of the more important bills 
Congress takes up this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, offered by committee Chairman Bud Shuster,  
R-Pa., would increase annual FAA funding for airport improvement, 
research and safety programs from $10 billion this year to $20 
billion in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster would come up with the extra money by removing from the  
general federal budget the airport trust fund, the revenues from 
airport user taxes. Shuster, who successfully walled off a similar 
highway trust fund last year, argued that all the money should go 
to airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the fund is expected to take in about $10 billion,  
but Congress only approved about $6 billion in airport spending, 
with the rest going into the general budget and counting toward the 
budget surplus. Shuster said the trust fund balance, now $10 
billion, will grow to $91 billion in 2009 if the money isn't freed 
up to be used for needed airport projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Protecting the fund, said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn.,  
``assures that small airports at the end of the spokes will be able 
to get their fair share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration strongly opposes taking the fund off-budget,  
and the Senate bill, offered by Commerce Committee Chairman John 
McCain, R-Ariz., sides with the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster would triple funding for air traffic control equipment  
to $3 billion annually and nearly triple the Airport Improvement 
Program, which builds new runways and other facilities, to $5 
billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	His measure would seek to help smaller markets hurt by industry  
deregulation through financial aid and by increasing flights out of 
Chicago's O'Hare, New York's La Guardia and Kennedy and 
Washington's Reagan National. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceilings on flights out of the Chicago and New York airports  
would be lifted and Washington would get up to six new slots, equal 
to three round-trip flights daily, for smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain goes even further in increasing flights, giving  
Washington 48 new slots, and the administration also would lift 
caps on slots to the other three. They argue that the airports have 
the capacity, that new planes have significantly reduced the noise 
pollution problem and that something must be done to help smaller 
cities that get no or only highly priced air service. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers from the three cities generally oppose the move,  
and protests over increased flights helped block passage of an FAA 
bill last year. ``The cost in safety and pollution is more than the 
business is worth,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of 
Columbia's delegate to the House. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Shuster were in closer synch on competing legislation  
to strengthen the rights of air passengers who experience delays, 
bumping and other inconveniences. Shuster held a hearing on 
Wednesday and McCain on Thursday, listening to stories from people 
who were kept sitting on runways for hours without food and water, 
were not told of strikes or had their luggage disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that the domestic airline industry has an  
outstanding safety record, McCain said. ``The bad news is that the 
airlines simultaneously reached the low-water mark on customer 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill would require airlines to offer passengers the  
lowest possible fare, give notice of delays and provide refunds 
within 48 hours of ticket purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association of  
America, said that airlines are taking the initiative in improving 
service and that legislation was not necessary. ``The last thing 
that is needed is the intrusion of government bureaucracy and the 
consequential increase of costs to the traveling public.''

<HEADLINE> Starr, McDougal in Uphill Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Juggling a criminal case and damaging  
revelations about his own office, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
is fighting an uphill battle: The prosecutor has put President 
Clinton's former business partner on trial, but it is Starr's own 
office that is getting much of the scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's trial  
here, Charles Bakaly, who became Starr's spokesman last spring 
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, abruptly resigned 
Thursday. His resignation came after Starr asked the Justice 
Department to investigate Bakaly in connection with a news leak -- a 
front-page story in The New York Times that said Starr had 
concluded the president could legally be indicted while still in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 31 article came amid a federal judge's probe -- pushed  
along by Clinton's legal team -- into possible leaks by Starr's 
office and a separate Justice Department inquiry into Starr's 
handling of the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly had gone on TV the day after the Times story appeared,  
declaring the ``information did not come from our office. ... We 
did not leak this information. ... We do not leak grand jury 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's referral to Justice came after his office conducted its  
own inquiry, according to a source familiar with the situation. The 
inquiry indicated Bakaly may have had some involvement in the leak, 
but he denied wrongdoing, said the source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., today called the situation ``really  
astounding,'' adding that it will play a part in the debate over 
whether and how to renew the independent counsel statute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's to Judge Starr's credit,'' commented Sen. Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah. ``I think it shows that he's going to do what's 
right, regardless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly has hired his own lawyer, former FBI general counsel  
Howard Shapiro, who says he is confident Bakaly will be found to 
have violated no statute, regulation or court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said Thursday he accepted Bakaly's resignation with  
``regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, Starr's prosecutors have laid out evidence  
that links a $27,600 Whitewater loan in Clinton's name to a 
fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal. The link comes through a 
series of financial transactions involving the savings and loan 
Mrs. McDougal owned with her husband, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	On trial for refusing to answer questions of Starr's office on  
whether Clinton knew about the transactions, Mrs. McDougal is 
trying to shift attention to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, sought to show that Starr had rushed  
to the aid of her ex-husband while she was allowed to ``languish'' 
in jail. Jim McDougal cooperated with Starr's probe. Mrs. McDougal 
didn't. Now she's on trial for criminal contempt and obstructing 
Starr's investigation of the 1980s Whitewater land venture formed 
by the McDougals, Clinton and his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering from more than a decade of bad health, Jim McDougal  
died last year, but it was his information that led to Mrs. 
McDougal being put on trial. Jim McDougal tipped off Starr to the 
Clinton loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Hickman Ewing said the more Geragos mentions  
prosecutors, the more likely it is Ewing will load up the witness 
list with his own prosecutors to rebut Geragos' accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	When the trial resumes Monday, former prosecutor Amy St. Eve  
will testify, Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said Starr's office had passed up numerous opportunities  
to question Mrs. Clinton and former Whitewater real estate agent 
Chris Wade about the financial dealings tying the Clinton loan to 
the $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	And Geragos tried to suggest that Starr was relying on perjured  
testimony from Jim McDougal, referring to McDougal's testimonial 
``flip-flop'' in which he denied under oath at his own trial that 
Clinton attended a meeting where the $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 
was discussed. Convicted of 18 felonies, McDougal later told 
Starr's investigators that Clinton had arrived as the meeting was 
breaking up and had asked about the $300,000 loan.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Makes League Scheduling Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter said  
Friday all professional soccer leagues should adopt a common 
calendar by 2005, one that has them start in February and end in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a meeting of FIFA's executive committee, Blatter  
called on leagues to cut the number of their teams to 16, and said 
44 weeks would be set aside for clubs to play two games a week, 
with specified dates for national league and cup matches, 
continental club championships and national team games. 
</P>
<P>
	Those moves, if adopted, would clear the way for Blatter's  
proposal to play the World Cup, soccer's top event, every two years 
instead of quadrennially. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear if leagues, especially in Europe,  
would accept the idea. Among the major European nations, which pay 
the highest salaries and generate the most revenue, France starts 
in July, Germany and England start in August, and Italy and Spain 
begin in November. Nearly all European leagues currently end their 
seasons in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting the number of teams would be another big change. The top  
divisions in England and Spain have 20 teams, and the top ones in 
Italy, Germany and France have 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Clubs and national teams have fought in recent years as the  
number of games increased, with clubs reluctant to release their 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen said teams that  
refuse to allow their players to participate in next month's World 
Youth Championship could be suspended. Leeds and Everton in England 
and Benfica in Portugal have said they won't release their players 
for the under-20 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA put off a decision on the Asian Football Confederation  
demand for five spots in the 2002 World Cup instead of four and its 
threat to boycott qualifying for the tournament. Japan and South 
Korea are the co-hosts, and the AFC wants more than two nations in 
qualifying to be able to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision will be made at the FIFA congress in July at Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA rejected Mexico's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup, saying  
it was submitted one month after the Dec. 31 deadline. South 
Africa, England and Germany are considered the favorites, with 
Brazil, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco and Nigeria also submitting bids. The 
executive committee will decide next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter said the executive committee also decided to recommend  
to ban virtual advertising from the field during games on 
television broadcasts, limiting the technology to signboards. 
Virtual advertising can be seen only by TV viewers.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Fix Restores AP Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A General Electric communications  
satellite spun out of control early Friday, briefly disrupting the 
transmission of material by The Associated Press and other news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	A gyroscope failure caused the satellite to start rolling, said  
Fred Cain of GE Americom Communications, a Princeton, N.J., 
subsidiary of Fairfield-based General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem began about 4 a.m. Engineers gained control of the  
satellite several hours later, GE spokeswoman Mary Horne said. 
Satellite service to the AP was restored shortly before 9 a.m. and 
service to all customers was back by 9:49 a.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
	AP service to member newspapers and radio and TV stations was  
provided via the Internet while the satellite was out of 
commission. The news service has a backup satellite and could have 
switched over had it been necessary, said John Reid, AP vice 
president for technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite that failed is in orbit above North America and  
primarily serves U.S. operations. But the AP also uses the 
satellite to move data to other points for transmission to its Asia 
and Latin America customers, and service in those regions was also 
briefly affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Network, Dow Jones and CNN also use the satellite. Fox uses  
the satellite to send scripts and advisories to its affiliate 
stations, but was able to use the Internet and an audio system 
called ``Fox Box'' to maintain communications during the outage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones was not directly affected because it had already used  
the satellite to transmit pages of Thursday's Wall Street Journal 
to printing plants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN officials in Atlanta did not immediately return a call for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was put in service in 1997 and has an expected  
life of 12 to 15 years.

a decade after the three countries exchanged communist rule for 
democracy and shed their Cold War military ties to the Soviet

Serbs remained opposed to the deal. Western diplomats have worked 
for the past week to get the Kosovo Liberation Army to accept the

companies issued disappointing earnings forecasts. Just before the 
close, the Dow was up 8.05 at 9,905.49. NYSE decliners led 
advancers 1,343-1,565. The Nasdaq index was down 17.40 at 2,394.85.

	HOPE, Ark. (AP) -- One month to the day after he was acquitted in  
the Senate impeachment trial, President Clinton returned to Hope to 
dedicate his birthplace as a historical site. Clinton credited his 
small town upbringing with instilling in him the values that drove 
him to public service and the presidency. First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton remained in Washington. The house on South Hervey Street 
where he was born 52 years ago has been open to tourists since June

year's budget to enhance security at embassies. Adm. William Crowe

international operations that $650 million would be a good starting 
figure to begin addressing a new range of terrorist threats to U.S. 
missions overseas.

<HEADLINE> Treasury To Close Tax Loophole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department moved Thursday to  
close a tax loophole that it contended has allowed dozens of big 
banks and corporations to improperly claim millions of dollars of 
write-offs by signing complex leases with foreign municipalities 
and other tax-exempt organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's ruling on so-called lease-in, lease-out (LILO)  
deals ``is another important step in our efforts to curb the use of 
tax shelters and restore fairness and rationality to the tax 
system,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The transactions, he said, ``are deliberately designed to  
exploit a tax rule that mischaracterizes prepaid rent to produce 
significant tax benefits with little or no real business risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a typical deal, a U.S. corporation agrees to lease a property  
owned by a tax-exempt entity, such as a city hall in Switzerland or 
a railroad in New Zealand, and then leases the property back to the 
municipality. The municipality gets a significant up-front fee and 
the corporation gets a tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The revenue ruling states that these transactions lack  
economic substance and therefore do not generate the tax benefits 
as promised by its promoters,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior department official, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said the ruling was retroactive and, in effect, 
represented the department's position in court should corporate 
taxpayers persist in trying to claim the deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has uncovered at least a dozen such deals since  
1996 and they typically involve properties valued at $100 million 
or more, the official said.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ryan Humphrey's tip-in with 21 seconds left  
Friday gave Oklahoma a stunning 61-60 victory over fourth-seeded 
Arizona at the NCAA Midwest Regional -- the Wildcats' fourth 
opening-round loss this decade to a big underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey's winning basket came after Eric Martin missed a  
3-point shot and Eduardo Najera missed a followup layup for the 
Sooners (21-10). Humphrey then grabbed the ball and put it back in 
to put Oklahoma up 61-60. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (22-7) had a final chance, but Jason Terry missed a  
fallaway 10-footer with three seconds left. Richard Jefferson then 
missed a one-handed tip-in, got the rebound and missed another shot 
as he fell in the lane at the buzzer.

	LOUISA, Ky. (AP) -- Monsignor Ralph Beiting didn't have much  
sympathy when a fellow Catholic priest told him he was getting 
burned out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him you have to be fired up before you can get burned  
out,'' Beiting recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Beiting, 75, has never had problems getting fired up. This year

	The founder of the ecumenical Christian Appalachian Project said  
he plans to celebrate the anniversary this summer with 17 nights of

	Itinerant preaching is not new to Beiting. He's been doing it  
for the last 49 years in front of courthouses, gas stations and 
general stores.

had police come and chase us off and so forth,'' Beiting says. 
``Now when I go, it's like, `We didn't think you were coming. What 
took you so long?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	His acceptance has come partly because the Christian Appalachian  
Project embraces people of all faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep yelling, `We're the family of God!''' Beiting says.  
``We're not Catholic or Protestant, Democrat or RepublicanWe're not 
old or young or rich or poor. ... We're the family of God, and why 
can't we act like it? Why can't we really take his leadership and 
his love and start loving one another?'' 
</P>
<P>
	CAP, based in Lancaster, began in the early 1960s and now has an  
annual budget of more than $55 million. Its 75 programs range from 
adult education to housing repairs throughout Appalachia. The group 
also works to recruit industry to the job-scarce mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Kendrick Williams of the Lexington diocese, which  
includes eastern Kentucky, said Beiting has raised the awareness of 
Appalachia's problems to a national level. 
</P>
<P>
	``People always come up who've been affected by Father, and they  
always remember his talks he's given at retreats and the sermons 
he's given, challenging them to share their resources great or 
small with the poor,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beiting, however, is not without critics. Some charge that he  
and his organization are too paternalistic, handing out goods 
instead of teaching people in the perennially poor, undereducated 
region how to move out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Fritsch, a Jesuit priest, is one of them. Fritsch,  
director of Appalachia-Science in the Public Interest, an 
environmental advocacy group based in Mount Vernon, acknowledges 
that CAP has some self-help programs. But he adds, ``I think a lot 
of their money could have been better spent on changing the 
structures of our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An example he offers of how this might be done: By forcing coal  
companies to be more accountable for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides doing priestly duties and overseeing CAP as its board  
chairman, Beiting serves on civic boards such as the Kentucky 
Appalachian Commission and the governor's task force on education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get mad at God about the whole thing,'' Beiting says,  
joking, ``because I said, `Why didn't you give me all this work to 
do in my 40s and 50s?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Beiting said folks living in the coalfields are now facing the  
greatest problem of the century as coal resources dwindle, jobs 
associated with coal end and the government's welfare programs 
decrease. Many Appalachian natives will have to find jobs in other 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Beiting is optimistic. CAP has retraining and child-care  
programs, and Beiting has said he's seen an increased willingness 
among people from political, religious and charitable groups to 
work together for change in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Beiting, who has written 12 books, including two about Daniel  
Boone, is now working on his autobiography. He says if the church 
will let him stay on, he has no plans to retire or leave eastern 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Appalachia. I love the church. I love the priesthood,''  
he says. ``Why in the world would I want to sit down some place?''

<HEADLINE> Pearl Harbor Re-Enactment Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Despite criticism from city leaders,  
organizers of the Kentucky Derby Festival are going ahead with a 
fireworks and air show that will include a re-enactment of the 
bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned April 17 simulation, called ``Tora! Tora! Tora!,''  
will feature dozens of firework ``bombs'' and replicas of Japanese 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville officials criticized the idea in a letter this week  
to festival President Michael Berry. All 12 city aldermen said 
re-enacting the attack that drew the United States into World War 
II ``hardly represents what the Kentucky Derby Festival stands 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One alderwoman said the city might consider denying permission  
to stage the air show. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement Friday, Board of Aldermen President Steve  
Magre withdrew the opposition, saying the city ``will maintain its 
support and commitment to the event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the controversy, Berry claimed the re-enactment  
was never intended to glorify war, ``but to honor those who have 
sacrificed so much for freedom and to educate everyone to the 
consequences of war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Festival officials said Friday that 85 percent of the calls they  
received about the re-enactment were in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we say 'overblown issue?''' said festival spokeswoman  
Stacey Yates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby Festival is held each year in the weeks leading up to  
the Kentucky Derby, and includes a parade, fireworks and dozens of 
other events. The fireworks show, called Thunder Over Louisville, 
typically draws more than a half-million people to the Ohio River 
shoreline.

<HEADLINE> Blue Devils Begin NCAA Title Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- No. 1 Duke has been a well-oiled machine  
this season. Florida A&AMP;M's year can best be described as a train 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The two collide today in the first round of the NCAA East  
Regional, with the top-seeded Blue Devils (32-1) a 45-point 
favorite to extend the nation's longest winning streak to 28 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16th-seeded Rattlers (12-18) started the season with 10  
straight losses before winning five in a row down the stretch and 
the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	There were injuries, car wrecks, more injuries and just plain  
bad luck for the Rattlers most of the year. Off the court, the 
team's sports information director even injured his knee slipping 
on some ice. 
</P>
<P>
	And when coach Mickey Clayton arrived at the airport for his  
trip this week to Charlotte, everyone on the team had a ticket 
except, you guessed it, Clayton, who had to dig into his pocket and 
fork over the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the bad hands of fate,'' Clayton said. ``You couldn't  
get too close to us without something happening to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A No. 16 seed has ever beaten a top seed in the NCAAs, and  
there's no reason to believe the Rattlers can pull this one out. 
After all, Duke leads the nation in scoring and margin of victory, 
and looks invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids understand it's the time for them to be at their  
best,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton said he'll have no pregame speech for his team on what  
will be the biggest basketball day of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I have to give them a motivational speech. It's a  
dream for every basketball player who lives and bounces a 
basketball to play in the NCAA tournament. If they are not ready to 
play, there is nothing I'll be able to tell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils might make things more interesting by holding  
out Trajan Langdon, who is nursing a sprained foot that sidelined 
him for the final two games of the ACC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	What about the formidable odds?  
</P>
<P>
	``They bleed just like us,'' Florida A&AMP;M's Jamaal Rhodes said.  
``Anything is possible. There have always been upsets in the field 
of 64.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round games today at the Charlotte Coliseum,  
Tennessee (20-8) plays Delaware (25-5), Wisconsin (22-9) meets 
Southwest Missouri State (20-10) and the College of Charleston 
(28-2) takes on Tulsa (22-9). 
</P>
<P>
	The 13th-seeded Blue Hens have won 13 straight, but realize the  
competition will get stiffer against SEC Eastern Division champion 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't simulate SEC competition,'' Delaware coach Mike Brey  
said of his America East Conference champions. ``You just try and 
get your kids ready to step it up a notch physically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Bennett posted his first 20-win season at Wisconsin in his  
fourth season. The Badgers (22-9) are one of the lowest scoring 
teams in the nation, averaging only 63.1 points. In fact, Wisconsin 
hasn't cracked the 60-point barrier in six of its last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our February elements was that we lost the ability to  
make shots and rebounds,'' Bennett said. ``We've been through a 
rock and a hard place when we're not scoring, but we've lived 
through them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The College of Charleston has the second longest winning streak  
in the nation (25) behind Duke, and the Cougars have knocked off 
some big-time opponents in recent tourneys. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cougars won't sneak up on Tulsa as a No. 8 seed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the word Cinderella anyway, it's a feminine name  
to me,'' Charleston senior Sedric Webber said. ``We've been winning 
big games year in and year out, but I don't want to be called 
`Giant Killer.' I just want to be called the College of Charleston, 
who is doing its things in the NCAA tournament.''

<HEADLINE> News Mixed on Bond Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For investors in the widest-ranging type of bond  
mutual fund, diversification has brought both good news and bad 
news lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of multisector bond funds, which invest across the whole  
spectrum from ultrasafe to high-risk bonds, have avoided the worst 
of the damage suffered by junk-bond and emerging-market bond funds 
in the convulsion that hit the markets late last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also have shared in only part of the gain registered by  
top-grade Treasury and corporate bond funds in the ``flight to 
quality'' set off by those same worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the 12-month span through the end of February, figures  
calculated by CDA Investment Technologies showed an average total 
return of 1.2 percent for multisector bond funds. That put them 
about halfway between investment-grade corporate bond funds, which 
gained 4.4 percent over the same stretch, and high-yield, or junk, 
bond funds, which dropped 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The best showing by any type of bond fund over the past 12  
months was posted by U.S. Treasury funds, up 5.8 percent, and the 
worst was posted by emerging markets income funds, which took a 
minus-26.5 percent drubbing as investors fled debt securities from 
developing economies. 
</P>
<P>
	A middling performance for multisector funds is no surprise,  
given that compromise is what diversified investing is all about. 
By spreading your bets, you shave the tops off the peaks and the 
bottoms off the valleys on the charts, looking for a reasonable 
return while cushioning yourself against risk and volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent behavior of bonds provides evidence that this  
principle works as well as ever for income-conscious investors, 
many of whom want or need to manage risk with an extra measure of 
caution. They are not investing with some far-off future in mind, 
but rather seeking to meet their current needs for income to cover 
the expenses of life. 
</P>
<P>
	But what is true of the typical, or average, multisector bond  
fund doesn't always hold with every individual fund in the 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morningstar Mutual Funds research service notes a  
``startling disparity of performance'' in 1998 among multisector 
bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best and the worst were separated by 32 percentage  
points,'' writes analyst Maciej Kowara in the firm's latest report 
on the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winners had no, or very little, ermerging-markets bonds,''  
Kowara noted. ``Losers had plenty of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Multisector funds posting losses of up to 24 percent in 1998 had  
as much as half their assets committed to emerging markets. The 
funds that finished in the black had little or no exposure in these 
small or newly emerging economies around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with this degree of variation from one fund to another,  
investors need ``to pause and reflect on exactly what kind of 
multisector fund they are after,'' Kowara says. ``There really are 
two kinds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost all of them have a substantial domestic high-yield  
(junk bond) exposure, but some of them balance it out more than 
others with high-quality paper, whether domestic or foreign. Those 
that don't are more akin to rather aggressive high-yield funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it's very important, when considering a multisector bond  
fund, to look at its most recently disclosed portfolio, and check 
in its literature to see what strategies it uses and how much 
leeway its manager has to allocate money among different classes of 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't rely on recent performance numbers to make any  
projection of which funds might perform best in the future. As 
conditions change in the bond market, and they often do, funds with 
bigger commitments in emerging markets may start performing better. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far,'' concludes Kowara, ``history hasn't been kind to the  
more aggressive group. The tamer folk have been the best performers 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last good year for the aggressive funds was 1996. That  
scenario could return, of course, but so could 1998's. Only those 
who can handle such volatility should invest in this category's 
aggressive subgroup.''

<HEADLINE> Torre Contemplates Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Yankees went about their  
business quietly Friday as manager Joe Torre contemplated what 
course of treatment to take for his prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Zimmer, the likely interim manager as soon as he recovers  
from knee surgery, playfully teased with Derek Jeter about taking 
two weekend road trips. Torre's brother Frank came by to visit the 
team for the second straight day. And the Yankees continued 
preparations for their World Series defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a veteran club that knows the routine because these guys  
have all been together for a couple of years now,'' general manager 
Brian Cashman said. `In the short term, we will go on with our 
business at hand, get in shape and put the guys in good position so 
that when Joe does come back we'll be ready to take off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cashman nor Frank Torre had any update on what Joe  
Torre's next step would be. Torre might have already left Florida 
to meet with doctors at Washington University in St. Louis. 
Depending on the course of treatment, Torre could miss anywhere 
from three weeks to three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just waiting for more information,'' Cashman said. ``We  
are letting Joe deal with this situation the way he wants to. He's 
dealing with the issue at hand privately. We will follow his 
lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman talked briefly to Torre on Friday morning, with the  
conversation focusing completely on baseball -- ranging from Roger 
Clemens' performance Thursday night to Chili Davis and Chad Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice distraction for him,'' Cashman said of the  
baseball conversations. ``He has so many friends calling, and they 
are all asking how he's doing. It's nice for him to be able to talk 
about lineups and pitchers. It gets him back to what he loves to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Torre comes back remains a question that the Yankees won't  
answer. But Cashman did acknowledged that Zimmer, Torre's bench 
coach the last three years, would run the team in Torre's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who managed four teams over 13 seasons, still is  
recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery, and the Yankees want to 
wait until he is completely healthy to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
	``Informally we have all acknowledged that when Zimmer is  
healthy he will be the guy to keep us together and make the 
decisions that need to be made,'' Cashman said. ``He has more 
experience than most active managers in the game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who served as Stump Merrill's bench coach on Thursday,  
managed the team Friday night against Kansas City. But he 
emphasized this is an interim position and he won't move into 
Torre's office, which has remained closed since he left the team 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would feel very uncomfortable in it,'' he said. ``When we  
get on an airplane or on a bus, I won't be in a manager's seat. No 
way. I'll be sitting one seat behind and hopefully Joe will be back 
in his seat soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Zimmer's first moves was deciding which players would  
make the one-hour road trip Saturday to Lakeland to face Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	To Jeter's dismay, his name was on that list. Before batting  
practice began, he playfully yelled at Zimmer, ``I guess you'll 
make me go to Orlando on Sunday too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer's face shriveled up and he began laughing uncontrollably:  
``Yep. I think you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter just shook his head and walked toward the batting cage as  
the new man in charge kept giggling.

<HEADLINE> Congress Renews Hate Crime Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are renewing their campaign for an  
expanded federal hate crimes statute, hoping public outrage over 
recent killings will spur passage. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one says hate crimes are overblown now, not after this year  
of savage crimes,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a cosponsor 
of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, a replica of last year's 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Texas, John William King, a white supremacist, was  
sentenced to death for chaining a black man, James Byrd Jr., behind 
a pickup truck and dragging him to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been charged in the October slaying of gay college  
student Matthew Shepard, who was pistol-whipped and lashed to a 
fence in Wyoming. Two men also have been charged with beating to 
death a gay textile worker, Billy Jack Gaither, in Alabama last 
month and burning his body on a pile of tires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe it to the families of Byrd and Shepard and Gaither and  
perhaps others we don't know,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., 
who is sponsoring the bill in the House with Reps. Connie Morella, 
R-Md., Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the first 
openly gay woman elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a positive sign for supporters, Senate Judiciary Chairman  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has scheduled hearings on the legislation for 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But it still faces a difficult road.  
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional Republicans have suggested the legislation is  
unnecessary because dozens of states have laws protecting the 
groups identified in the bill. As well, backers are concerned that 
social conservatives may construe the legislation as extending 
special protections to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a bill that will, in one way, advantage one group  
over another,'' said Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, who is 
sponsoring the bill in the Senate with Massachusetts Democrat 
Edward Kennedy and Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter. ``I can't 
believe any members of the United States Senate want to be soft on 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he wasn't as optimistic as some of his colleagues.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of opponents ... pick out hate crimes legislation for a  
great deal of criticism,'' he said. ``This is a tough bill to get 
very much support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, current law would be expanded so the Justice  
Department could prosecute crimes based on a person's sex, sexual 
orientation or disability. Now, the statute only covers crimes 
based on race, color, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the bill would make federal prosecution of hate crimes  
easier. Current law limits prosecution to situations where the 
victim is targeted for engaging in certain federally protected 
activities, such as serving on a jury, voting or attending public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability, 
according to the White House, which supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the bill wouldn't undermine states in prosecuting  
hate crimes, just bring investigative and other resources of the 
federal government to bear where necessary.

<HEADLINE> DirecTV, Broadcasters Settle Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Customers of America's largest satellite TV  
company who aren't entitled to receive CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox 
programs by satellite will keep getting them that way for awhile 
under a deal announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV and the National Association of Broadcasters, whose  
members include the four major broadcast networks, have agreed to 
settle a lawsuit over which viewers can watch network programs sent 
to them by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Miami who has been hearing the copyright  
dispute would have to approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law lets DirecTV and other satellite companies provide  
customers with ``distant'' network signals -- which come from other 
broadcast areas -- only if those customers cannot receive their 
local stations using rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds  
for years over how to interpret the arcane legal test that 
determines when a satellite customer can't get a local signal and 
thus is eligible to receive network programming by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, many viewers who now get their network shows  
from satellite TV will still have to make the switch and obtain 
local affiliates' network programs by antennas. But the timetables 
for those transitions are pushed back, both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, DirecTV and the networks will check viewers'  
eligibility to determine who can get network programs via 
satellite. DirecTV has agreed to give a discount on antennas to 
give consumers who must switch. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for some viewers -- those living closest to their  
local TV stations as determined by a technical test involving the 
stations' coverage areas -- to lose their current satellite signals 
for CBS, Fox, ABC and NBC programs on June 30, no matter how good 
or bad their reception of their local TV signal is. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers living on the edges of the stations' coverage areas  
will lose that network programming on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who will lose their service will get advance notice in  
writing, the two sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV spokesman Bob Marsocci wouldn't specify how many people  
the settlement would affect, but others close to the matter 
estimated it would be hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry satellite customers have prompted Congress to get  
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was hailed by House Commerce Committee Chairman  
Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who had urged the parties to work out a deal. 
He said it clears the way for the House to advance a broader bill 
that would, among other things, let satellite customers, for the 
first time, receive their local TV signals via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV still will push for such legislation, Marsocci said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who chairs the Commerce Committee's  
telecommunications panel, said the settlement could ease the need 
for the House to provide temporary relief to satellite customers 
losing Fox and CBS programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., also  
welcomed the settlement, but said he'll still pursue his 
legislation that would let illegally hooked-up satellite TV 
customers continue to receive network programs through the end of 
this year, and provide all customers with local signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who helped write McCain's bill,  
worried that the settlement ``cuts off too many satellite 
subscribers too soon'' and said it underscores the need for 
Congress to act. 
</P>
<P>
	The copyright lawsuit in a Miami federal court concerns the  
conditions under which viewers who get their TV from satellite can 
watch network programs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700,000 satellite TV customers already have lost Fox and  
CBS signals under an order from that federal court. Another order 
by the same court would have cut off 1.5 million more customers 
from CBS and Fox signals by April 30. All four networks had sought 
to extend that cutoff order to ABC and NBC programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of DirecTV's customers who have lost Fox and CBS programs  
may qualify under the settlement to receive those signals via 
satellite again. People close to the dispute say it would only be a 
small number. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement doesn't involve two other big satellite TV  
companies: EchoStar and PrimeTime 24. PrimeTime 24, under a 
separate court order, is required to cut off customers from CBS and 
Fox programs by April 30. The networks have sued EchoStar to try to 
force it to cut off illegal customers. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as many as 500,000 customers who own big backyard satellite  
dishes aren't covered by the agreement and could still lose network 
signals on April 30, said Tauzin's spokesman Ken Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Bluefield St. Baseball Player Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A Bluefield State baseball player in  
Florida for a spring baseball trip was killed today when a school 
van was hit a vehicle driven by a man trying to escape arrest, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon Stewart was killed in the 1 a.m. crash, said Leon County  
Sheriff's Deputy David Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
	Another student, Mark Morgan was being treated at a Tallahassee  
hospital. The team's head coach, Geoff Hunter, and two other 
students -- Ryan Mollette and Fred Thompson -- were treated and 
released, said college spokesman Jim Nelson in Bluefield. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred as the college's van was pulling off  
Interstate 10 in Tallahassee. The team had just arrived in the 
state for a week of spring baseball games. Tallahassee was the 
first stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was going through an intersection when it was hit by a  
car driven by Albert Williams, 28, of Tallahassee, Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was being pursued by a Leon County Sheriff's deputy.  
Minutes earlier, Williams had fled from police after being stopped 
on a drug charge, Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Williams may have been traveling at 80 mph when  
it hit the Bluefield State College van. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was traveling in a three-van caravan and had left  
Bluefield on Thursday. Stewart was one of nine people in the lead 
van, Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was to be charged with second-degree murder, possession  
of cocaine with intent to sell and aggravated fleeing and eluding, 
Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they found 28 baggies of cocaine in Williams'  
vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Computers Ready for Dow 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street traders are worrying more about  
inflated stock prices than any possible Dow-10,000 computer snafus 
as the Dow Jones industrial average flirts with the five-digit 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago some consultants warned that old software could read  
10000 as 0000 and cause some computers to go haywire, or interpret 
it as a major crash and trigger automatic selling. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer and industry experts say any glitches have been  
patched, and would have been largely irrelevant, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a non-event,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist  
for Deutsche Bank, North America, on Thursday. ``It might just be 
kind of like a joke to see the Dow is at zero rather than 10000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because, while the Dow is a commonly accepted gauge of  
market activity with the public, the 10,000 milestone holds little 
interest among professional traders and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more concerned about the level of the Dow than the  
five-digit Dow. The market is as high as a kite,'' said Alan 
Davidson, president of the 130-member Independent Broker-Dealer 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industry groups were equally ambivalent.  
</P>
<P>
	The Securities Industry Association, the New York Stock Exchange  
and several major brokerages said they envisioned no problems 
resulting from the extra digit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a statement that  
it had been assured any appropriate measures have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Hall, vice president of Trigent Software Inc., a software  
services firm in Southborough, Mass., said updating software to 
recognize a fifth field is not an unusual or out of the ordinary 
task for people who maintain systems.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Trust Agrees To Pay $63.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. settlement with federal and  
New York state authorities will not affect its planned merger with 
Deutsche Bank AG, both companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust on Thursday agreed to pay a total of $63.5 million  
in fines to settle charges that it boosted its financial 
performance by unlawfully diverting millions of dollars from 
unclaimed customer accounts into its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea, entered by a bank lawyer before a federal judge,  
brought a speedy resolution to accusations that the bank made false 
entries in its books to conceal the true source of $19.1 million 
its employees diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust will pay a $60 million fine to federal authorities  
as well as a $3.5 million fine to the state of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``In certain instances, these individuals acted contrary to the  
express legal advice of the bank's outside counsel,'' Bankers Trust 
lawyer David Daniel Brown IV told U.S. District Judge John G. 
Koeltl, reading from a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this group of employees included the senior manager  
and the controller of the business unit, the bank believes that a 
small number of ... employees were involved in the knowing 
falsification of the bank's records,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement that the bank  
initially minimized the extent of its officers' and employees' 
culpability. She said an investigation is still ongoing; Bankers 
Trust said it would continue to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that, because of pressure to meet revenue  
and expense targets, the bank's officers and employees stole the 
money and used it to pad Bankers Trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's employees then allegedly doctored the books to cover  
up the theft. Most of the wrongdoing allegedly occurred in the 
bank's Client Processing Services division. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea agreement, the bank agreed to fully restore to  
customers and various states all the money that was improperly 
recorded as income or reserves from 1986 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the bank reported the false record-keeping in March  
1996, as soon as workers not involved in the wrongdoing discovered 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank then substantially changed the management of  
the departments involved in the scheme and overhauled policies and 
procedures so unclaimed property could no longer be put in the 
bank's own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Newman, chairman and CEO of Bankers Trust, said separately  
that the settlement should not have a significant affect on the 
bank's future business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it is appropriate to put this three-year-old matter  
behind us as we near our merger with Deutsche Bank,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolf E. Breuer, a spokesman for the board of managing directors  
for Deutsche Bank, said Bankers Trust has already informed the 
German bank about the issue. ``We commend Bankers Trust for its 
actions to address this problem, and we welcome their decision to 
settle this matter now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breuer said the merger should be approved by the second quarter  
of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Child Care Tax Credit Plan Revived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans, like their Democratic  
colleagues, have proposed a package of expanded tax credits to help 
both working and stay-at-home parents with child care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two sides disagree on whether to make the credits  
available to lower income families who don't earn enough money to 
pay federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find a balance that is fair for all families,''  
said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., who with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
proposed a child care bill Thursday that is virtually identical to 
one advanced last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, backed by Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan  
Collins of Maine, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania and Thad Cochran of Mississippi, would change the tax 
code to provide a $900 credit to families where one parent stays at 
home to care for children under 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a credit is now available only to parents who work outside  
the home and pay others to care for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators also want to expand the tax credit for parents with  
outside jobs by raising the income limit from $10,000 to $30,000 
for the maximum credit. That maximum would be $1,200 per child, up 
to two children. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republicans' $21 billion, five-year plan would not make  
the credits refundable, meaning they would only help families that 
earn enough money to pay federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have also proposed expanding the tax credit for  
working families, and have suggested a $540 credit for stay-at-home 
parents with children under 1. Both credits would be refundable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a lot more working families'' with refundable credits,  
said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the chief sponsor of the 
Democrats' $30 billion, five-year child care bill. 
</P>
<P>
	To help lower-income families, Chafee proposed doubling the  
child care and development block grants to states, to $10 billion 
over five years. That money would be used for child care subsidies 
for the poor, and to enforce quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats say that won't go far enough, especially given the  
influx of poor families into the work force from welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, they say, many states restrict subsidies to families  
earning as little as $15,000 to $20,000 a year. So families earning 
more than that, but not enough to pay any federal income tax, 
wouldn't get any child care assistance without a refundable credit. 
</P>
<P>
	To increase the availability of child care, Chafee proposed a  
new tax credit for employers who build, renovate or run child care 
facilities, on site or nearby, for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the bill would provide $60 million over three years for a  
state grant program to encourage small businesses to provide child 
care, and $50 million a year to the Department of Health and Human 
Services to disseminate updated information on child care health 
and safety and provide grants for better training and education of 
child care workers.

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield, Lewis Rhetoric Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield thought all the questions  
about him were answered with his two wins over Mike Tyson and a 
bruising knockout of Michael Moorer. Then along came Vaughn Bean, 
and both the years and wars inside the ring became apparent once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennox Lewis has yet to answer any questions despite his  
imposing physical abilities. And when he finally does, it will 
define what so far has been a career of underachievement. 
</P>
<P>
	Size and age. Ring warrior versus reluctant warrior. Bad blood  
between two fighters. The elements could come together Saturday 
night before a sellout crowd of 20,000 at Madison Square Garden for 
a classic heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	And when it's over, boxing will have an undisputed heavyweight  
champion for the first time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say I'm getting better with age,'' Holyfield said. ``I'm  
going to blow him out in the third round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield brings a 36-year-old body and the IBF and WBA versions  
of the heavyweight title into the scheduled 12-round fight with 
Lewis, who first picked up his WBC heavyweight title when Riddick 
Bowe refused to defend against him and threw it into a trash can in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield also brings the confidence born of two huge wins over  
Tyson -- wins that revitalized a career that appeared over after 
Bowe gave him a beating and a heart problem was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a confidence that led Holyfield -- who never before has  
picked a round -- to make the bold prediction that he would stop 
Lewis in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a `what if,''' Holyfield said. ``He's going down in  
the third round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, Holyfield will have to solve the problem of size --  
something he didn't do well in losing two fights to Bowe. He's also 
coming off a lackluster decision win over Bean in his last fight in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel he's definitely beatable,'' Lewis said. ``He's there  
for the taking. He shows a lot of good things, but I think his chin 
is definitely questionable in the sense that he hasn't been hit by 
a big heavyweight like myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is big, standing 6-foot-5 and weighing in Thursday at 246  
pounds, 31 more than Holyfield's 215. Holyfield began his pro 
career as a light heavyweight and has always been on the small side 
for a heavyweight boxer, something that didn't matter against 
Tyson, but could be a factor against Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to run from Evander, he is a smaller man than  
me,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a big target and when a person is a big target a person  
can be hit,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas oddsmakers make Holyfield (36-3, 25 knockouts) a  
slight 7-5 favorite, although bettors can get 22-1 on his chances 
of actually knocking Lewis (34-1, 27 knockouts) out in the third 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Holyfield fought for the undisputed heavyweight  
title he did just that -- stopping James ``Buster'' Douglas with a 
big right hand Oct. 25, 1990. He also won his second fight with 
Tyson in the third round -- but only after Tyson was disqualified 
for his infamous biting. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Holyfield can have his way with Lewis may have more to  
do with the condition of the head of the WBC champion rather than 
the effectiveness of his stiff left jab. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has made a career of fighting on the fringes of the  
heavyweight title, with no real big fights to his credit. When he 
has gone up against formidable opponents, it has been with limited 
success, as seen when Oliver McCall stopped him in the second round 
to take his WBC title in September 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis came back to stop McCall in February 1997 when McCall  
began crying and had an apparent mental breakdown in the ring. He 
followed it with four WBC title defenses, the last on being an 
unimpressive decision over Zelijko Mavroic last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never know mentally which Lennox will show up,'' trainer  
Emanuel Steward admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's potential problems against Lewis certainly won't be  
mental. He showed against Tyson how to bully a bully in the ring, 
and there has never been any question about him deserving the 
``Warrior'' he wears on the front of his ring trunks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holyfield has been in some wars over his long 14-year pro  
career, taking so much punishment in his three fights with Bowe 
that most wrote him off as washed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been a great warrior, but there is a price he has paid  
for that,'' said Steward, who trained Holyfield for two fights, 
including his first fight to Michael Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, naturally, disagrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can say that I'm getting better with age,'' he said.  
``(Before) I would just flail away, because I was impatient to wait 
on the shots as necessary to get the guy out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's propensity for getting into brawls hurt him against  
Bowe, who is similar in size to Lewis, but he was a smarter fighter 
against Tyson, never allowing him to put a series of blows 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's good enough to hit me, so be it,'' Holyfield said.  
``I've been hit a lot of times and all of them hurt. Nothing's 
changed. I'm just a lot more confident now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters went out of character to try and get a  
psychological boost in the days before the fight, with Holyfield 
repeating his third-round knockout pledge and Lewis calling 
Holyfield a hypocrite for being a born-again Christian while at the 
same time having five of his nine children born out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one of those people who will suck up to him and say,  
`You're a nice guy,''' Lewis said. ``I speak reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main event, scheduled to start sometime around 11:30 p.m.  
EST, tops a card that includes two other title fights. Fernando 
Vargas (15-0, 15 knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will defend the IBF 
junior middleweight title against Howard Clarke (26-10-2, eight 
knockouts) of England, while James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of 
Pittsburg, Calif., will defend the WBA welterweight title against 
Sam Garr (25-2, three knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.

<HEADLINE> Nike Offers To Identify Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *IBy WILLIAM McCALL    	
</P>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike Inc. is being praised by critics for  
its pledge to reveal the locations of its overseas factories and 
allow independent monitors to inspect them if the shoe giant's 
competitors agree to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very big deal, a big breakthrough,'' says Medea  
Benjamin, spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based labor rights 
group Global Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released today, the group praised Nike for improving  
conditions at one of its factories in Vietnam, although it said 
some concerns remain. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers at the Tae Kwang Vina factory ``have significantly  
reduced worker exposures to toxic solvents, adhesives, and other 
chemicals'' and ``trained key personnel on occupational health and 
safety issues,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory, called ``VT'' by Nike, had been the focus of  
international attention since November 1997 when The New York Times 
reported poor working conditions and dangerous levels of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was based on research conducted by Dara O'Rourke and a  
leaked Ernst &AMP; Young audit of the factory, Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Rourke visited the factory extensively between April and  
October 1997 while working on an unrelated project for a United 
Nations group and completing a doctorate at the University of 
California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	He and fellow occupational safety expert Garrett Brown were  
co-authors of the Global Exchange report, based on six months of 
research and meetings with Nike managers, and a follow-up visit to 
the factory last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nike's cooperation with this particular team is all the more  
remarkable given that it was Mr. O'Rourke who issued a scathing 
critique of this very factory in November 1997,'' Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Nike has been the target of university students  
around the nation who have demanded their schools put pressure on 
the shoe giant to make the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike had resisted, along with its chief competitors, such as  
Adidas and Reebok, saying it could lead to worker defections or 
loss of trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	In letters to the presidents of various universities with Nike  
contracts, Nike chairman Phil Knight called on them to join the 
effort to ``ensure that licensed products bearing the names and 
logos of schools are manufactured under fair conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already six universities -- Brown, Cornell, Duke, Georgetown,  
Harvard and Wisconsin -- have agreed to force their licensees to 
reveal factory locations. But critics of Nike say the 
Beaverton-based company's appeal will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``At other universities where students were trying to get action  
on this, their administrations have been saying that's unrealistic, 
we're going to lose our contracts,'' Benjamin said Thursday. ``I 
think it's going to put tremendous pressure on other companies to 
do the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Germany-based Adidas-Salomon AG, which has its  
U.S. headquarters in Beaverton, and Reebok International, based in 
Stoughton, Mass., did not immediately return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Wednesday to Georgetown University President Leo  
O'Donovan, Knight said that Nike has been urging schools to join 
the Fair Labor Association, formed by the Apparel Industry 
Partnership, a coalition of industry, labor, consumer and human 
rights groups organized by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike also plans to join the Fair Labor Association, and will  
accept independent monitors disclose factory locations ``provided 
the institution requires the same level of disclosure from all 
licensees,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the catch,'' Benjamin said. ``They say they'll do it  
when the others do. But even with that caveat, it lifts the bar and 
challenges other companies to be open as well.''

<HEADLINE> Embassy Plan Derided As Inadequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lead investigator in last fall's twin  
bombings in Africa and a Clinton administration official told a 
Congressional panel today that $650 million should be allocated in 
next year's budget to enhance security at embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. William Crowe said at a House International Relations  
Committee panel on international operations that $650 million would 
be a good starting figure to begin addressing a new range of 
terrorist threats to U.S. missions overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowe criticized the Office of Management and Budget for  
rejecting pleas from the State Department for an additional $1.4 
billion for fiscal 2000 for embassy security, saying he was ``not 
sure it had received the wake up call'' that the embassy bombings 
prompted. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Patrick Kennedy  
told the House panel the administration would ``feel comfortable if 
it had $650 million in fiscal 2000'' to begin making U.S. embassies 
more secure. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned against removing this amount from other  
allocations for the department as part of the budgeting process. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioning by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., the subcommittee  
chairman, drew out the reference to $650 million by both officials. 
Smith said the present administration ``embassy security budget 
essentially skips fiscal year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing in the Senate Thursday, several senators complained  
about the administration's current request for $3 billion over five 
years, saying the bulk of the money would not be allocated until 
after 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also received a warning from Crowe, who  
headed a State Department investigation into the August 1998 
bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, that the 
United States would have to devote greater resources than it has in 
the past to reduce threats abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a firm decision by the U.S. government that this  
vulnerability should be eradicated,'' said Crowe, a chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Reagan administration, who also served 
as U.S. ambassador to Britain under President Clinton. He testified 
Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The August attacks killed 220 people, including 12 U.S.  
government employees and family members. They injured more than 
4,000 others, mostly Kenyans and Tanzanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said the administration should locate money to  
address the problem more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``If embassy security is a priority for the president, as it  
should be, funds for construction should be identified and made 
available now,'' said committee Chairman Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., also called the request insufficient  
but said the congressional record on the issue is flawed as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am alarmed that last week the Senate Appropriations  
Committee decided to cut $70 million from last year's embassy 
security funding to offset other spending priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., said the administration was ``playing  
budget games at the expense of security concerns, and we are not 
going to let that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Crowe's report,  
issued in January, came out after the fiscal year 2000 budget was 
put together. He said the administration is seeking changes in the 
request so that money could be made available in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin said appropriations for security enhancement should  
not be made at the expense of other aspects of the foreign affairs 
budget. Any such approach, he said, would be ``ironic in the 
extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators also said they were concerned about a repeat of  
the situation in the previous decade when there was little 
follow-through after an official report recommended security 
upgrades at embassies worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Paris, London Stocks Off; German Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials were giving ground in their  
assault on 10,000 today, held back from the five-digit milestone as 
investors began to take profits on the stock market's 
record-shattering surge. 
</P>
<P>
	Also pulling the Dow lower was a 10 percent plunge in  
Caterpillar, one of its components, on an earnings outlook that 
fell far short of analysts' expectations because of lower machine 
and engine sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.99 at 9,887.29 this  
afternoon after reaching new highs Wednesday and Thursday. The 
average of 30 blue-chip stocks was up as much as 61 points in the 
opening minutes, coming within 42 points of hitting 10,000. But 
those gains were quickly lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading volume was heavy but below Thursday's pace.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd call it Dow 10,000 angst,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a  
market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``The Dow and the rest of 
the market have some hurdles and some roadblocks that we must push 
through before we can move onward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is `You get to Dow 10,000, what is the encore?'  
'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which set records in the  
past two days, was also lower by midmorning after again flirting 
with its first close above 1,300. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was falling, undercut by disappointing news from 
software makers Microsoft and Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 1, the Dow has gained 6 percent and almost 600  
points, and today, investors began to cash in on those gains that 
have been fueled by optimism about a strong U.S. economy and a 
sharp rebound in oil prices from a deep slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's charge lifted world markets overnight, as had a  
change in finance ministers in Germany, where a key stock market 
indicator surged today. But global markets turned mixed as the 
Dow's advance was interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's losses on Wall Street came despite more evidence that  
the economy continues to grow without a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, a gauge of prices  
charged by factories, refineries and food processing plants, fell a 
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent last month, the most in 13 months, 
all but reversing an unusually large 0.5 percent increase in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Tame inflation is behind Wall Street's belief that the Federal  
Reserve isn't in a hurry to increase interest rates, despite 
unexpectedly strong economic growth so far this year. Higher 
interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for consumers and 
corporations and can cool economic growth. Higher rates also make 
stocks less attractive investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Also factoring into the market today was news that oil ministry  
representatives from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Mexico today 
agreed to cut production by more than 2 million barrels a day in an 
attempt to bolster oil prices, which reached 12-year lows late last 
year. The prospect of higher prices bolstered oil stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains on Wall Street today follow a surge in several key  
financial markets around the world overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, Germany, the Dax index rose 5.1 percent today, a  
day after Oskar Lafontaine's surprise resignation as German finance 
minister. Today, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder named a low-key 
economics expert, Hans Eichel, to replace Lafontaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine's departure also helped the euro, which rose from  
$1.0841 late Thursday to $1.0920. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed down 0.2 percent today, while  
London'sFinancial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 0.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's top stock markets opened sharply higher today, but  
Japan's key index ended the day slightly lower, due in part to more 
bad news about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	During the day, Japan's Economic Planning Agency announced that  
a new gross domestic product statistic would probably show that the 
economy shrank in the final three months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government later confirmed that real GDP fell 0.8 percent,  
the fifth straight quarter of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index finished up 1.3 percent, or 138.95  
points, at 10,801.76, the highest level since Nov. 24. Earlier in 
the day, it was even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders credited the gains on Wall Street and rumors of a  
possible local interest rate cut.

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield, Lewis Rhetoric Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield thought all the questions  
about him were answered with his two wins over Mike Tyson and a 
bruising knockout of Michael Moorer. Then along came Vaughn Bean, 
and both the years and wars inside the ring became apparent once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennox Lewis has yet to answer any questions despite his  
imposing physical abilities. And when he finally does, it will 
define what so far has been a career of underachievement. 
</P>
<P>
	Size and age. Ring warrior versus reluctant warrior. Bad blood  
between two fighters. The elements could come together Saturday 
night before a sellout crowd of 20,000 at Madison Square Garden for 
a classic heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	And when it's over, boxing will have an undisputed heavyweight  
champion for the first time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say I'm getting better with age,'' Holyfield said. ``I'm  
going to blow him out in the third round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield brings a 36-year-old body and the IBF and WBA versions  
of the heavyweight title into the scheduled 12-round fight with 
Lewis, who first picked up his WBC heavyweight title when Riddick 
Bowe refused to defend against him and threw it into a trash can in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield also brings the confidence born of two huge wins over  
Tyson -- wins that revitalized a career that appeared over after 
Bowe gave him a beating and a heart problem was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a confidence that led Holyfield -- who never before has  
picked a round -- to make the bold prediction that he would stop 
Lewis in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a `what if,''' Holyfield said. ``He's going down in  
the third round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, Holyfield will have to solve the problem of size --  
something he didn't do well in losing two fights to Bowe. He's also 
coming off a lackluster decision win over Bean in his last fight in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel he's definitely beatable,'' Lewis said. ``He's there  
for the taking. He shows a lot of good things, but I think his chin 
is definitely questionable in the sense that he hasn't been hit by 
a big heavyweight like myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is big, standing 6-foot-5 and weighing in Thursday at 246  
pounds, 31 more than Holyfield's 215. Holyfield began his pro 
career as a light heavyweight and has always been on the small side 
for a heavyweight boxer, something that didn't matter against 
Tyson, but could be a factor against Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to run from Evander, he is a smaller man than  
me,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a big target and when a person is a big target a person  
can be hit,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas oddsmakers make Holyfield (36-3, 25 knockouts) a  
slight 7-5 favorite, although bettors can get 22-1 on his chances 
of actually knocking Lewis (34-1, 27 knockouts) out in the third 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Holyfield fought for the undisputed heavyweight  
title he did just that -- stopping James ``Buster'' Douglas with a 
big right hand Oct. 25, 1990. He also won his second fight with 
Tyson in the third round -- but only after Tyson was disqualified 
for his infamous biting. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Holyfield can have his way with Lewis may have more to  
do with the condition of the head of the WBC champion rather than 
the effectiveness of his stiff left jab. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has made a career of fighting on the fringes of the  
heavyweight title, with no real big fights to his credit. When he 
has gone up against formidable opponents, it has been with limited 
success, as seen when Oliver McCall stopped him in the second round 
to take his WBC title in September 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis came back to stop McCall in February 1997 when McCall  
began crying and had an apparent mental breakdown in the ring. He 
followed it with four WBC title defenses, the last on being an 
unimpressive decision over Zelijko Mavroic last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never know mentally which Lennox will show up,'' trainer  
Emanuel Steward admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's potential problems against Lewis certainly won't be  
mental. He showed against Tyson how to bully a bully in the ring, 
and there has never been any question about him deserving the 
``Warrior'' he wears on the front of his ring trunks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holyfield has been in some wars over his long 14-year pro  
career, taking so much punishment in his three fights with Bowe 
that most wrote him off as washed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been a great warrior, but there is a price he has paid  
for that,'' said Steward, who trained Holyfield for two fights, 
including his first fight to Michael Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, naturally, disagrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can say that I'm getting better with age,'' he said.  
``(Before) I would just flail away, because I was impatient to wait 
on the shots as necessary to get the guy out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's propensity for getting into brawls hurt him against  
Bowe, who is similar in size to Lewis, but he was a smarter fighter 
against Tyson, never allowing him to put a series of blows 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's good enough to hit me, so be it,'' Holyfield said.  
``I've been hit a lot of times and all of them hurt. Nothing's 
changed. I'm just a lot more confident now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters went out of character to try and get a  
psychological boost in the days before the fight, with Holyfield 
repeating his third-round knockout pledge and Lewis calling 
Holyfield a hypocrite for being a born-again Christian while at the 
same time having five of his nine children born out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one of those people who will suck up to him and say,  
`You're a nice guy,''' Lewis said. ``I speak reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main event, scheduled to start sometime around 11:30 p.m.  
EST, tops a card that includes two other title fights. Fernando 
Vargas (15-0, 15 knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will defend the IBF 
junior middleweight title against Howard Clarke (26-10-2, eight 
knockouts) of England, while James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of 
Pittsburg, Calif., will defend the WBA welterweight title against 
Sam Garr (25-2, three knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.

<HEADLINE> Tutor Speaks Out on Gophers Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The woman at the center of a scandal in  
the Minnesota basketball program said an athletic culture that 
values physical talent over education is partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just use these kids up and then they throw them away,''  
said Jan Gangelhoff, the former university secretary who says she 
prepared course work for at least 20 players over a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Saint Paul Pioneer Press Thursday  
night, Gangelhoff said she began tutoring players because she hoped 
her own love of learning ``might rub off on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This all started because I thought maybe I could teach these  
kids something,'' said the 50-year-old Gangelhoff, a former 
executive secretary in the university's academic counseling unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she maintains that over the course of five years she  
wrote nearly 400 papers for at least 20 students, she said the 
informal arrangement started out as extracurricular tutoring. At 
some point it turned into something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while with the ones who got really lazy, you know it  
was just easier for me to go ahead and do it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that as an American Indian, she connected with many of  
the black athletes. ``I understand what it means to be a person of 
color,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Reorganize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., which is battling federal  
antitrust charges, plans to announce its long-awaited restructuring 
next week, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the company's plan to divide its operations  
into four groups is not thought to be related to its court case. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest maker of personal computer software is on  
trial in Washington, D.C., and could be ordered to make additional 
changes if it loses that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Microsoft announced late Thursday that it would  
defer about $400 million in revenue from its third to its fourth 
quarters. Microsoft said it will still meet Wall Street's 
third-quarter earnings estimate of 65 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is offering coupons to customers who purchase its  
Office 97 entitling them to a free upgrade to the new version of 
the software, Office 2000, which is expected to come to market in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, said  
Microsoft will not recognize the value of the coupons until the new 
product ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Microsoft's restructuring plan was driven by  
president Steve Ballmer's desire to organize the company around 
customer needs rather than around particular product lines and 
engineering efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer has been overseeing the Interactive Media Group, which  
includes Microsoft Network and may be renamed the consumer 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will temporarily divide responsibilities for the  
consumer unit between Jon DeVaan, who has overseen development of 
Microsoft Office, the suite of software applications that includes 
Word and Excel; and Brad Chase, a top marketing manager who 
masterminded the launch of Windows 95 and Internet Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another division will be aimed at software developers, the  
newspaper said, and will be headed by Paul Maritz, who has overseen 
nearly all software development at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said a third unit will be aimed at selling products  
to corporate chief information officers, while an applications 
group will become a new unit targeted at ``knowledge workers'' 
including analysts, administrators, writers and researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In settling on the reorganization plan, people familiar with the  
matter told the Journal that Ballmer rejected more far-reaching 
initiatives, including a proposal to spin off Microsoft Network 
into a separate company.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated in trading  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains were pressured by bearish planting estimates and  
forecasts for favorable weather in growing regions across the 
central United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell on word of a storm system bringing moisture to the  
U.S. hard red winter wheat belt. Buying momentum in wheat from 
earlier in the week also fizzled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were lower with pressure from planting forecasts that  
were more than 1 million acres higher than the most recent U.S. 
Agriculture Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also word of expected favorable weather in South  
America over the weekend that should allow for harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was pressured by sagging wheat and soybean prices, failing  
to post gains despite lower-than-expected acreage estimates. Corn 
rallied most of the week before falling Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was down 4 3/4 cents to $2.72 1/2 a bushel; May  
corn was off 1 3/4 cent to 2.22 3/4 per bushel; May oats were off 1/2 cent 
at $1.11 per bushel; May soybeans were down 3 1/2 cents to $4.74 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle, lean hogs and pork bellies all 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures were off .25 cent to 67.15 cents per  
pound; March feeder cattle was off .20 cent to 71.80 cents per 
pound; April lean hogs were off .60 cents to 71.70 cents per pound; 
May pork bellies were off .53 cents to 50.22 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Hot Boilermakers Ready for NCAA Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- To say things are going good for  
Purdue would be a horrible understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers have won 26 in a row, guard Stephanie  
White-McCarty was a unanimous All-American, and they're 
entertaining 16th-seeded Oral Roberts Saturday in the opening round 
of the Midwest Regional after going undefeated at Mackey Arena this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	They're feeling very relaxed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we feel any pressure,'' White-McCarty said. ``We  
live for the tournament. The main thing is to stay focused because 
every game could be your last ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers (28-1) begin their quest for a national  
championship against Oral Roberts (17-12) after Marquette (21-7) 
plays Kansas (22-9). 
</P>
<P>
	Oral Roberts and Purdue couldn't be any farther apart. The  
Golden Eagles started the youngest lineup in the Mid Continent 
Conference, including third-year freshman Krista Ragan, who sat out 
two years because of injuries but now is leading the team with a 
16.8 scoring average. They were 2-7 at one point but secured an 
automatic bid by winning the MCC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers haven't lost since Stanford beat them in the  
third game of the season. They were ranked No. 1 in the final 
Associated Press poll for the first time in history, and they beat 
defending national champion Tennessee to open the season. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty leads the team with a 21.0 scoring average, with  
Ukari Figgs (15.9) and Katie Douglas (14.0) also averaging in 
double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	While Oral Roberts coach Jerry Finkbeiner promises the Golden  
Eagles will play hard, he also knows Saturday more than likely will 
turn into a learning experience for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're enjoying the moment at hand, but I'm anticipating what's  
going to happen maybe 365 days from now,'' Finkheiner said. ``We're 
going to be better. We're going to be more experienced. I look 
forward to this experience to help us next November. We're not 
going to be a 2-7 team next year.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Inflation Data / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Friday after a report revealing  
the sharpest drop in more than a year in prices charged by 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/16  
point, or $5.53 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.52 percent from 5.56 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were heartened by a report showing that prices for  
finished goods fell 0.4 percent last month, nearly reversing an 
unusually large 0.5 percent jump in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent signs of economic strength, including a report Thursday  
showing vigorous retail sales, have fueled worries the Federal 
Reserve might raise interest rates to slow the pace of borrowing 
and ease inflationary forces. Rising prices make fixed-income 
investments such as bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Friday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities rose 3/32 to 9/32 point, and intermediate maturities 
rose 11/32 to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.12 
points from late Thursday to 1,286.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills eased to 4.59 percent,  
while the discount fell 0.01 percentage point from late Thursday to 
4.47 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.66 percent, as the 
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.49 percent. One-year 
yields fell to 4.72 percent as the discount fell 0.03 percentage 
point to 5.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.75 percent from 4.88 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/4 point to 124 9/32. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.21 percent from late Thursday's 5.23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Close Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today after the  
release of weak data on the Japanese economy. Tokyo share prices 
closed lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.04 yen in late trading, up 0.30 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 119.33 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 13.28  
points, or 0.09 percent, to close the day's trading at 15,488.86 
points. On Thursday, the average closed up 22.14 points, or 0.14 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar surged after the government  
announced that Japan's real gross domestic product shrank 0.8 
percent in the October-December period, a larger contraction than 
had been expected, analysts said.

	That marks the fifth straight quarter -- the first time ever --  
that Japan's GDP contracted.

<P>
	``We expected bad numbers, but these were even worse,'' said  
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also got a boost after the Bank of Japan's  
policy-setting board voted today to leave its current easy monetary 
policy unchanged.

<P>
	The Band of Japan is steering its target for a key interest rate  
-- the overnight call rate, which banks charge each other for 
overnight loans -- to around 0.15 percent from an average of 0.25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to weaken a currency by increasing the

	During the day, the dollar ranged from 119.00 yen to 120.45 yen.  
In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.35 yen, down from 
131.77 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices closed lower as concern spread  
among investors that the market could take a turn for the worse, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, improved sentiment and gains on Wall Street  
fueled a strong rally in Japanese shares, but players worried that 
the market's surge might have reached its limit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 124.60  
points to close Thursday at 9,897.44 -- a new high. The rally was 
buoyed by higher oil stocks and more evidence that the U.S. economy 
is growing at a non-inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1.191 billion shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 1.049 billion shares 
Thursday. Advances outnumbered declines 607 to 580, with 142 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 0.57 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,195.61 
points. The TOPIX closed up 8.71 points, or 0.73 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.715 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.755 percent, 
pushing its price up to 100.67 yen from 100.35 yen.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Lewis: Toughen Stalking Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Recounting ``the horror, the terror''  
his family endured for years, Jerry Lewis appealed to Nevada's 
lawmakers to toughen the state's anti-stalking law. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a stalker pleaded guilty after allegedly threatening to  
kill the comic and his 7-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stalking is not unlike Alzheimer's or cancer,'' Lewis told the  
state Assembly on Thursday. ``You never know how long you've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Assembly convened a special session just to hear Lewis'  
testimony on a bill to increase the maximum penalty for aggravated 
stalking from six to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said 15 years is not enough and asked that it be increased  
to 25, adding: ``If you do this, I'll find out where you live, I'll 
come over, I'll do 20 minutes. I'll do anything you want.''

<HEADLINE> Balloonists Near Halfway Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A Swiss-English team hoping to be the first  
balloonists to circle the world nonstop opened their hatch today 
over the Pacific for a bit of fresh air, with nearly one-half the 
distance behind them, their control center said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two balloonists passed the 12,500-mile mark today, said  
project manager Stefano Albinati, almost half of the total 26,000 
miles they will log if they reach North African again. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, who  
set out from the Swiss Alps March 1, brought their balloon down to 
6,000 feet over the Pacific just before dawn today, the control 
center said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two pilots said they are very impressed by the immense  
expanse of water, which is their only scenery,'' the center said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Albinati told The Associated Press he was concerned about the  
Breitling Orbiter 3's speed. At just 48 miles an hour, they will be 
over the Pacific for another five days. ``But what can you do,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much depends on the weather. Storms have forced rivals in the  
round-the-world bid to give up, and the Breitling Orbiter's 
meteorologists have to try to avoid bad weather as well as try to 
keep the team in good winds. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the Pacific also is a concern because it would  
complicate rescue operations if they were to go down in a remote 
location. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving China the team had to maneuver to get winds  
heading in a favorable easterly course rather than move to a 
different altitude that would put them in faster winds heading in a 
different direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard and Jones opened the hatch on top of their high-tech  
gondola today for the first time since they were over North Africa 
a week ago, the center said. They aired out the cabin and did some 
housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloonists' weather experts have been studying which jet  
stream to maneuver them toward -- the Polar, which would send them 
over California, or the Subtropical aiming for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks now like it will be Mexico,'' Albinati said, but  
added that plans could change depending on winds and weather.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Friday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* The overflow crowds that jammed the early  
Padres workouts to see the country singer were missing. With the 
Seattle Mariners playing the Arizona Diamondbacks before a sellout 
crowd at Peoria Stadium, just 200 yards from where Brooks was 
working out, he went virtually unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* In his second day back in camp after tending to his  
ill mother, Brooks took batting practice, hitting several balls 
hard, shagged balls in the field, then boarded the bus for a night 
game with the Chicago Cubs in Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``I'm enjoying this so much, they're going to  
have to throw me out of here,'' Brooks said. ``I've ridden a lot of 
buses in my life, but riding with ballplayers instead of musicians 
should be an entirely different experience.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: Flu-Related Deaths Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The nation's slow-starting flu season has gotten  
worse, with 43 states reporting widespread or regional flu 
activity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last three weeks of February, pneumonia- and  
influenza-related deaths were slightly higher than expected, the 
CDC reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week ending Feb. 27, such deaths accounted for 8.1  
percent of the total deaths reported in 122 U.S. cities. The agency 
had expected a rate of 7.5 percent or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have not yet seen the peak of influenza- or  
pneumonia-related deaths,'' said Dr. Carolyn Bridges of the CDC's 
Center for Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	An outbreak at a long-term care facility in Santa Clara County,  
Calif., sickened 60 workers and 37 residents, two of whom died, the 
CDC said, emphasizing the need for health care workers to get flu 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu contributes to the deaths of about 20,000 people in the  
United States each year. The CDC does not release the total number 
of flu deaths until the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The peak of flu season usually extends from December to early  
March. The CDC keeps track of flu cases through the middle of May.

<HEADLINE> Patient Found Dead Outside Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- The family of a man hospitalized for  
surgery who died just outside the hospital after walking out is 
demanding to know how he could have left unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife called Monday night to see how dinner was, and he said  
it was great. Then we get a call at 3:45 a.m., saying he was found 
outside,'' said the man's son, Robert Ryan. ``Why was he outside?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Robert Ryan, 67, of Watsonville was found on the  
sidewalk in his hospital gown, just outside the main entrance to 
the Watsonville Community Hospital early Tuesday, spokeswoman 
Barbara Shingai said. 
</P>
<P>
	He died of peritonitis -- an inflammation of a membrane lining  
the abdomen -- and a blood infection due to recent colon cancer 
surgery. The cold weather also contributed to Ryan's death, 
sheriff's Detective Alan Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of foul play or that anyone helped Ryan leave  
the hospital, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This happens,'' Burt said Thursday. ``He was probably confused  
with whatever medications they had him on. It looks like he pulled 
out his own IV catheter and took a walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shingai refused to say whether the hospital monitors patients'  
comings and goings or explain any security measures there. She said 
the hospital was cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, who had surgery March 4, was discovered missing Tuesday  
morning when a nurse went to change his IV at about 2 a.m. It was 
unclear how long he was outside before hospital officials found 
him, Burt said.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Names Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder named a  
low-key economics expert as Germany's new finance minister today 
and was nominated to head the governing Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves consolidated Schroeder's grip on power a day after  
Oskar Lafontaine's stunning resignation from both influential 
posts, and gave the German leader the chance for a fresh start in 
his 4-month-old administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Democrats' executive committee backed Schroeder's  
choice of outgoing Hesse state governor Hans Eichel to replace 
Lafontaine as finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder also was chosen to head the party, concentrating  
critical decision-making in one post. He must be confirmed at a 
party convention scheduled for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	At his first news conference since the resignation, Schroeder  
said he would not amend tax reforms by Lafontaine, which outraged 
the business world and prompted threats by some industries to shift 
investment out of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	But he indicated he remained open to pro-business adjustments in  
the future. Parliament is expected to give final approval to the 
reform March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	How quickly Schroeder could assert authority over a party, whose  
left wing views him with suspicion, was unclear. In today's secret 
vote for a new chairman, six of 33 party executive members opposed 
Schroeder and three abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not represent the breadth of the party,'' Andrea  
Nahles, head of the Social Democrats' youth wing, said on ZDF 
television today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine, on the other hand, enjoyed strong party loyalty,  
which he used to quash infighting after taking over the Social 
Democrats, or SPD, in 1995. He was credited with a large share of 
their victory over conservative Helmut Kohl in elections last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	His exit came amid reports of a power struggle with Schroeder  
over the tax changes, but speculation still was rife about his 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said Lafontaine had not told him why he quit, but  
government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye denied that the reason was 
personal animosity. There was no immediate comment from Lafontaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichel, 57, is considered more at ease with business than his  
predecessor, less strident and a team player. One of his party's 
tax experts, he is to take office April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Before being narrowly voted out last month, he had been popular  
as governor of Hesse state, which includes Frankfurt, Germany's 
financial center and seat of the new European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	With Germany currently chairing the 15-nation European Union,  
the upheaval came at a time of heightened international 
responsibility for Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	A tour of European capitals he has scheduled for next week as  
part of efforts to agree on a reform of EU finances will go ahead 
as planned, Heye said today. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, Lafontaine's exit also served as a warning to the  
environmentalist Greens, who have strained the coalition by pushing 
for immediate closure of nuclear power plants and other projects 
that reflect their ideology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greens were sympathetic toward Lafontaine, and leaders of  
the party appeared shaken Thursday night. But they said they were 
confident the coalition would hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said today ``the survival of the government -- and that  
includes the coalition -- has not been threatened at any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine was the new government's most controversial figure  
from the start. He unsettled financial markets with persistent 
calls for Europe's central bank to lower interest rates to create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists blamed his attempt to exert political influence  
over monetary policy for the weak start of the new European single 
currency, the euro, which lost 7 percent of its value since its 
Jan. 1 launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro surged Thursday on news of Lafontaine's resignation,  
above $1.10, and the Frankfurt stock market soared 4.7 percent, to 
5007.20, after opening today. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders welcomed Lafontaine's exit. Dieter Hundt, head  
of the German Employers' Association, said it ``cleared the way for 
a new beginning.''

<HEADLINE> Chicagoans Upset Over Candy Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For generations of Chicagoans, a trip to Marshall  
Field's wasn't complete without a stop at the candy counter to buy 
a box of Frango Mints. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan retired, the Bears turned into a bad joke, the  
Sears Tower was declared the world's second-tallest building. But 
for 70 years, the chocolates -- made right there on the 13th floor 
of the department store -- have been gobbled up by shoppers 
downstairs, mailed to ex-Chicagoans and carried along on trips out 
of town as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	So the company's announcement last week that it is moving candy  
production to a confectioner in Pennsylvania has outraged many 
Chicagoans. 
</P>
<P>
	They can't imagine the sweet treats being made anywhere else.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a part of Chicago, part of our tradition,'' said Alice  
Kamenjarin, who has been buying the mints for her family every 
holiday since she was a newlywed in 1946. ``I'll be devastated if 
they take it away. How dare they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out the popularity of Frangos -- called Francos until  
Spanish dictator Francisco Franco seized power in 1934 -- might have 
been the undoing of the sweet shop in Marshall Field's flagship 
store on State Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials told more than 100 employees last week that  
they no longer had jobs because the facility could not meet the 
growing demand for the small, square chocolates, which sell for $14 
a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Gertrude Hawk Chocolates in Dunmore, Pa., was chosen to make the  
candy after a nationwide search, said Marshall Field's spokeswoman 
Lynne Galia. And the company promises the candy recipe will stay 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
	But former Frango employees, customers and city officials say  
that's not the point -- and they aren't letting the move happen 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	Laid-off Frango employees have gathered more than 1,000  
signatures on petitions to try to persuade the company to change 
its mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Passionate letters to the editor have appeared in the  
newspapers. A Chicago Tribune columnist said Frango Mints are 
``half chocolate, half Chicago'' and said she remembered her first 
Frango as vividly as her First Communion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If enough people care about Frango being made here in Chicago  
instead of Pennsylvania, maybe they'll change their mind,'' said 
James Hooker, Frango's head candy maker, who worked there 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even city officials have joined the fray.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Chicago Plan Commission tabled a request to  
expand a Target store because it's owned by Minneapolis-based 
Dayton Hudson Corp., which bought Marshall Field's in 1990. And 
Mayor Richard M. Daley said he will try to talk company officials 
into staying in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are plenty of candy companies in Chicago that would love  
to get the contract to make Frango Mints,'' said John Camper, a 
Daley spokesman. ``Chicago is the candy capital of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galia said the company recognizes people's concern, but the  
decision has been made. Production has not yet started in 
Pennsylvania, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly are looking forward to explaining the rationale  
for our decision with the mayor,'' she said. ``We definitely 
recognize how important traditions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Dayton Hudson has riled Marshall Field's  
shoppers. The company briefly tried to do away with Field's 
traditional green shopping bags but brought them back after a 
flurry of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Frango recipe was imported from a West Coast  
department store chain that Field's bought in 1929, and the mints 
remain a tradition in the Northwest, too. Some are still made in 
Kent, Wash., near Seattle, by Frederick's Fine Chocolates and sold 
in Bon Marche department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Vesely of Cicero, a Chicago suburb, made a special trip  
downtown Friday because she wanted to buy mints made at the State 
Street store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've probably been buying them for 40 years,'' she said.  
``When I started working as a teen-ager, I came to Marshall Field's 
every week to spend my paycheck and buy Frango Mints. And I always 
envisioned the people making them upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it is the same recipe, it won't be the same.''

<HEADLINE> INS Shifts Enforcement Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service is  
shifting focus as it acknowledges the current enforcement strategy 
in the U.S. interior is not reducing the number of illegal 
immigrants living here. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing undocumented immigrants is not one of the top  
priorities in the new strategy, which will be phased in over five 
years. The INS also will put less emphasis on raiding workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, such raids caught nearly 14,000 illegal aliens last  
year, a small share of the 171,510 people removed from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will concentrate on removing criminal aliens,  
cracking down on alien smuggling rings, document counterfeiters and 
employers who hire undocumented workers. The INS also will work 
with communities to solve local immigration complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials believe their new interior enforcement strategy  
will prove more effective. But some critics complain the agency is 
granting a de facto amnesty to the estimated 5.5 million people 
living here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't come up with any good reason why they would  
unilaterally disarm,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House 
Judiciary immigration subcommittee. He contends the Clinton 
administration is taking a ``step backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The INS, by their actions, is telling would-be illegal aliens  
that if you don't get caught entering the U.S., we'll look the 
other way so you can stay,'' said Smith, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But a co-author of the plan, INS Denver district director Joe  
Green, said that concern is misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The removal of aliens in the United States will remain a  
strategy of the INS, but not the exclusive strategy of the INS,'' 
he said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift in interior enforcement priorities resulted from  
enforcement successes along the Southwest border, Green said. As it 
has become harder to cross illegally into the United States, 
migrants increasingly are turning to smugglers and counterfeiters 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the results of this strategy will be a more effective  
agency ... and an agency that is able to bring to bear a much more 
credible and a stronger deterrent than the current means used by 
the INS will ever do,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the plan, which was a year in the making, were first  
reported by Scripps Howard News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	A former high-ranking INS official, Georgetown University  
professor T. Alexander Aleinikoff, said the strategy appears to be 
a ``sensible list of law enforcement priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aleinikoff, who has not seen the plan but has read about it in  
news reports, said: ``It's wrong to call this an amnesty because as 
you target smugglers and employers who violate immigration laws, 
labor laws and tax laws, you will be deterring illegal entry and 
you will be arresting the illegal immigrants who are being smuggled 
or working in those industries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, however, views the strategy as another failure by an  
administration already under fire for not seeking 1,000 new Border 
Patrol agents next year, as ordered by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they are doing is disarming in the battle to stop illegal  
drugs and illegal aliens,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS has seen its budget more than double in recent years as  
Congress and the administration have paid new attention to a 
long-neglected agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But amid a huge buildup along the Southwest border and a  
doubling of the Border Patrol, some INS officials complain 
privately that Congress has given short shrift to interior 
enforcement, in part because of pressure from employers eager for 
cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Border Patrol's nearly 9,000-person force is  
assigned to the borders, not the interior. INS has some 1,750 
immigration agents responsible for interior enforcement.

<HEADLINE> IOC Set for `Painful' Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- International Olympic Committee president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch is warning members that they need to make 
``structural changes'' to restore the organization's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing next week's IOC meeting as the most important of his  
presidency, Samaranch said in a letter sent to all members that 
``painful'' decisions are needed to clean up after the Olympic 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called an extraordinary general assembly next  
Wednesday and Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to deal with the 
worst crisis in the IOC's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The session will vote on the expulsions of at least five members  
in connection with the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake 
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members have already resigned.  
</P>
<P>
	The assembly will also vote on a series of reform measures,  
including an overhaul of the bidding and site-selection process for 
the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Samaranch's letter, dated March 9, was obtained by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must confess that I consider the coming extraordinary  
session one of the most important in our history, and the most 
important of my presidency,'' said Samaranch, who has been in power 
since 1980. ``Our duty requires that we take concrete decisions, in 
some cases painful ones, for the whole world will be observing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and Samaranch have come under severe attack from outside  
critics following revelations of cash payments and other improper 
inducements received by IOC members from Salt Lake and other bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must defend our organization, and the Olympic Games,  
through our future actions,'' Samaranch said. ``We must also defend 
the honor and integrity of our members ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the support of international federations and national  
Olympic committees, Samaranch said, ``I am convinced that ... we 
will succeed in bringing about the structural changes that are 
necessary for us to be able to move toward the third millennium 
with confidence and determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am counting on you all to contribute ... to defining a new  
policy for the IOC, in a spirit of renewed unity,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also told members the conclusion of the IOC's  
investigation into the Salt Lake scandal has been delayed and won't 
go before the executive board until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the best efforts and sacrifices of the commission  
members, the report has not yet been finalized,'' he said. ``It 
appears that it will take longer to conclude than was originally 
planned. As soon as it is complete, it will be submitted to the 
executive board for its meeting on 15th March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members resigned or were ousted in the first phase of the  
inquiry that concluded in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the IOC inquiry panel has been looking into 19 other  
cases -- three holdovers from the first phase, plus 16 additional 
names cited in a Salt Lake ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one more member is expected to be expelled in the  
latest phase, while the bulk of the others are expected to be 
exonerated or receive warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, an IOC member since 1987,  
will be ousted under the recommendation of the six-man panel, 
Olympic sources familiar with the case have told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork was named in a Utah ethics report last month that said  
his wife, Julia, borrowed $30,000 from Salt Lake City bid chief Tom 
Welch ``to help a friend in a serious situation.'' The report said 
the money, withdrawn by Welch from his children's' trust fund, was 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those still under investigation from the first phase is  
South Korean executive board member Kim Un-yong, the highest 
ranking IOC delegate implicated so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim faces allegations that he used Olympic connections to help  
secure lucrative jobs for his children in broadcasting and 
entertainment. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--SLOC leader Mitt Romney announced a hiring freeze, reductions  
in staff travel and other cuts to save $14 million. He also 
highlighted $84 million worth of expenses -- including extra 
furniture, decorations, and a planned memorial plaza -- that are not 
crucial to the games and should be contingent on revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	--A former organizer at the heart of the Salt Lake Olympic  
bribery scandal says the senior U.S. official of the games knew 
about the vote-buying scheme. Dave Johnson, who was senior vice 
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and long involved 
in the city's Olympic campaign, told The New York Times that he 
discussed ``everything'' about the program with IOC member Anita 
DeFrantz. DeFrantz, now an IOC vice president, denied Johnson's 
statements.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Court Rules on Spousal Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Supreme Court has ruled  
that abused spouses may be justified in killing their mates, even 
if they fail to leave the home to avoid the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We join the majority of jurisdictions that do not impose a  
duty to retreat from the residence when a defendant uses deadly 
force in self-defense, if that force is necessary to prevent death 
or great bodily harm from a co-occupant,'' Justice Barbara Pariente 
wrote for the court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the same rule applies to all members of a  
household, including children. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is an important ruling for survivors of family  
violence,'' said Peter Margulies, a law professor at St. Thomas 
University in Miami. ``The court has recognized that survivors of 
violence need the right to protect themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue arose from the second-degree murder conviction of  
Kathleen Weiand in the 1994 shooting of her husband, Todd. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Weiand was freed from prison before her appeal reached the  
high court when former Gov. Buddy MacKay granted clemency to her 
and five other women who killed husbands or boyfriends. All were 
diagnosed as suffering from battered women's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling reverses a 1982 decision by the same court. The court  
had then held that a spouse could not use lethal force if 
retreating would eliminate the need for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1982 decision appeared to be grounded on the ``common myth  
that the victims of domestic violence are free to leave the 
battering relationship any time,'' Pariente wrote, citing studies 
that found women who retreat may actually increase the danger of 
harm from an attacking spouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in its 5-2 ruling, ordered judges to instruct juries  
that defendants attacked in their own homes have the right to 
``meet force with force'' regardless of their relationship to the 
attacker.

<HEADLINE> Source: IOC To Warn Kim, Coles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IOC investigators will recommend severe censure  
for the highest-ranking member implicated in the corruption scandal 
and a high-profile delegate from the next Olympic host country, 
Olympic sources told The Associated Press today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, an executive board member from South Korea and a  
powerful leader of international sports, and Phil Coles, a longtime 
IOC member from Australia, barely escaped a recommendation that 
they be expelled, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third leading member, former vice president Vitaly Smirnov of  
Russia, also will be recommended for a severe warning, said the 
sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said Kim's case remained open on one front and raised  
the possibility of the recommendation being upgraded from censure 
to expulsion ``if what's alleged turns out to be true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one new member, Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, will  
be recommended for expulsion by the six-man panel, according to the 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Less severe warnings were proposed for Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye  
of the Ivory Coast, Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, Shagdarjav 
Magvan of Mongolia, Anani Matthia of Togo, Austin Sealy of Barbados 
and Mohamed Zerguini of Algeria, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others, they said, would be exonerated -- Henry Edmund  
Olufemi Adefope of Nigeria, Ashwini Kumar of India and Ram Ruhee of 
Mauritius. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC was scheduled to announce the recommendations today.  
They must be acted upon by the ruling executive board before final 
action by a special general assembly next week.

<HEADLINE>  Chanel Slick, but Little Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Clean and modern, Karl Lagerfeld's Chanel winter  
collection was slick and professional, if not packing much punch. 
</P>
<P>
	Chanel for 1999-2000 was shown Friday to an eager audience of  
2,000 and the runway in the double Carrousel-Louvre space was 
marked with the big date. There was no silver lining, but plenty of 
silver or ``stainless steel'' leather came out in the young-looking 
short skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a big change from recent ankle-brushing retro styles by  
Lagerfeld for the venerable house. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading off with tweed or stitched suede pants worn with short  
boleros and flat boots, the clothes soon glowed with the look of 
the silvery leather. 
</P>
<P>
	And beautifully cut jackets were a big plus for Chanel-lovers,  
who have missed the classics lately. 
</P>
<P>
	A handsome outfit was the silver skirt to the knee topped by an  
ample beige tweed jacket, worn with soft buff-colored flat boots. 
</P>
<P>
	A flounced pale blue knit topper with its silver skirt made  
another remarkable entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Leather was very big in brown or pale beige for the skirts or in  
suede-stitched patchwork outfits with big wool coats. Fans of 
Chanel will be happy to see the return of the nicely fitted 
jackets, in raspberry, khaki, black and white or beige tweeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiny and matte mixed nicely in things like lame shell tops with  
brown suede or wool pants. The new belt is an outsized chain link 
worn around the hip or even thrown across a shoulder at times. 
</P>
<P>
	A few quilted full skirts in iridescent taffeta looked fine for  
Chanel evenings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really glad to see the return of the Chanel jacket,'' said  
Joan Kaner, vice president and fashion director of Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lagerfeld has also been working a fashion bash, and  
superproduction for Monaco celebrating ``50 years of images of 
Monaco,'' at the annual Rose Ball there March 20. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime Monaco resident and friend of the royal family,  
Lagerfeld will pay tribute to the 50-year reign of Prince Rainier 
by organizing a show featuring models like Helena Christensen, 
Carla Bruni and Naomi Campbell wearing fashions from 50s to 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Singers like Shirley Bassey and Grace Jones will perform in a  
musical tribute, wearing Chanel outfits by Lagerfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Lacroix's collection was an ode to a party girl, to  
sensuous fabrics and color. As at Chanel, skirt lengths for day or 
cocktail were flippy and to the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Things started well with a fur-edged copper-tone leather coat  
over a bright vermilion silk jagged-edged skirt plus a 
lavender-gold knit sweater. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix loves playing with textures, and fox-edged tweed coats  
were paired up with bright giant-print silk dresses underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	A favorite jacket for this ready-to-wear collection came out  
with silky pastilles in gold and pink with black -- it could dress 
up all kinds of skirts or pants. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chinese-style print on silk and taffeta should be popular  
here, and those who want to hark back to the '60s can look to the 
many mirror-sequined disco outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiered bubble dresses, sequined details like cyber-patterns on  
computers looked modern, but the old Southern French ``Arlesienne'' 
woman of Lacroix's roots was there as well -- in a satin sheath with 
a sequined big head scarf. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the aegis of the LVMH group (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy),  
the luxury giant controlling Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, Celine and 
more, Lacroix has made the grade for creativity, but perhaps not 
for money, only recently balancing into the black since opening in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Veronique Leroy is a serious younger designer in her mid-30s who  
turns out very wearable clothes. Her white or black voluminous 
culotte pants with pleating between the legs looked almost like 
skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The black coats, whether slim or fuller, were clean and  
contemporary.

<HEADLINE> Key Inflation Gauge Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key underlying inflation gauge -- prices  
charged by factories and other producers -- dropped by the biggest 
amount in more than a year, offering reassurance the Federal 
Reserve won't raise interest rates soon despite the nation's 
booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Producer Price Index for finished goods fell a seasonally  
adjusted 0.4 percent last month, the most in 13 months, nearly 
reversing an unusually large 0.5 percent increase the month before, 
the Labor Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came a day after the Commerce Department reported  
surging retail sales in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fits with the pattern of strong growth and low inflation  
that we've seen,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston 
&AMP; Co. in New York. ``It almost seems too good to be true, in the 
ninth year of an economic expansion, to see growth as strong as it 
is and inflation as benign as it appears to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had attributed the January producer price gain, and a  
0.4 percent increase in December, to a variety of special factors. 
February's bigger-than-expected drop reinforced their view that 
inflation pressures are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	That view is behind Wall Street's assumption that the  
inflation-wary Federal Reserve isn't in a hurry to dampen price 
pressures by slowing economic growth with higher interest rates. 
And that, in part, is what's driving the Dow Jones Industrial 
average to new records. 
</P>
<P>
	It came within 42 points of 10,000 in early trading Friday but  
disappointing earnings forecasts from several high-tech companies 
derailed the momentum and it edged down 21 points to close at 
9,876. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two months of disturbingly high (producer price)  
numbers, the February decline is reassuring,'' said economist David 
Orr of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. ``It is far too early 
for the Fed to decide there are any significant inflation pressures 
developing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Fed policy-makers almost certainly would not increase  
interest rates at their March 30 or May 18 meetings. But, one of 
those policy-makers, William Poole, president of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis, warned investors against assuming the 
Fed will wait until inflation becomes noticeably worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole, in Biloxi, Miss., speaking to reporters before addressing  
a conference, agreed that Friday's price report was good news but 
said, ``The market shouldn't expect or desire the Fed to act after 
we see inflation, but to take action before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February's decline in producer prices reflected drops of 1.4  
percent for food -- the most since July 1982 -- and 1 percent for 
energy. Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components 
were unchanged after edging down 0.1 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Vegetable prices, down 23.5 percent, led the food decrease. Pork  
prices also fell, as did beef and veal. Fruit, however, rose 2.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall decline in energy prices came despite a small 0.2  
percent gain for gasoline. Heating oil fell 4.1 percent; 
residential electric power, 0.6 percent, and residential natural 
gas, 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts cautioned that as the year progresses, energy will no  
longer brake inflation. In fact, oil prices jumped to five-month 
highs on commodity markets Friday after major oil producers agreed 
to cut production by more than 2 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside food and energy, car prices fell 0.3 percent in  
February, though light trucks rose 0.4 percent. Clothing prices 
fell overall, too. And computers declined 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescription drug prices, however, increased 0.8 percent and  
have risen 20.6 percent over the past year. Prices in one often 
troublesome area, tobacco, were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices earlier in the production process also were well behaved.  
They fell 0.5 percent for intermediate goods and 3.4 percent for 
crude goods. An example of the three processing stages: cotton for 
crude, cloth for intermediate and clothing for finished. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said businesses'  
inventories rose a slight 0.1 percent in January at the same time 
that sales dropped 0.3 percent, the first decline since August.

<HEADLINE> Women's NCAA Basketball Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Leon Barmore looked at the bracket for his four-team NCAA  
subregional, then he looked at The Associated Press women's 
basketball poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana Tech coach wasn't happy about what he saw.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a tougher subregional, I would like to see it,''  
Barmore said. ``I looked at the final AP poll ... and I started 
counting the teams in the Top 20 who made it and doggone, if two 
besides us are showing up at our place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those two others are No. 18 Penn State and No. 20 Virginia,  
neither of which No. 3 Tech plays in its first-round game in 
Ruston, La., tonight. The Lady Techsters, the No. 1 seed in the 
West Regional, open against 16th-seeded Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That should be no problem for Barmore's quick, explosive team,  
which is second nationally in scoring at 89.1 points a game. But he 
knows that if there is a second game, it would be a tough one. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams seeded eighth and ninth, like Penn State and Virginia,  
usually aren't ranked in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get out of here, a team will really have to be at the top  
of their game,'' Penn State coach Rene Portland said. ``I've been 
here once and got whipped pretty good by Tech. So I know what it 
takes to win in such a great place for women's basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut is the other No. 1 seed playing tonight as the  
tournament gets under way with 16 games at eight sites. The 
remaining first-round games, also at eight sites, are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn, the top seed in the Mideast, plays Northeastern at home.  
And no one is more eager to play that game than Shea Ralph, the 
Huskies' fiery guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph, averaging 17.4 points, missed all last season while  
rehabilitating a knee injury. The year before, she tore the 
anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee three minutes into her 
first NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really ready. I've been waiting two years,'' Ralph said.  
``This is a huge tournament. If you make it and play well, then you 
go to the national championship. That was my goal coming here. This 
is why I play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eighth-seeded Xavier plays ninth-seeded Florida International in  
the other game at Storrs. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 seed in the East, Old Dominion, has been limping  
through the postseason. Point guard Sharron Francis had knee 
surgery Feb. 25 and did not play in the Colonial Athletic 
Association tournament last week. Center Lucienne Berthieu, the 
co-CAA player of the year, saw only limited action in the 
tournament because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Both practiced this week, however, as the Lady Monarchs prepared  
for tonight's game against Tennessee Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to stop me from doing anything,'' Francis said  
of her knee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West Regional at Fort Collins, Colo., second-seeded  
Colorado State and seventh-seeded Southwest Missouri State hope to 
bounce back after having long winning streaks broken, while 
10th-seeded Cal Santa Barbara looks to continue a streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Santa Barabara takes a 21-game winning streak against  
Southwest Missouri, which had a 15-game string broken by a loss to 
Evansville in the semifinals of the Missouri Valley Conference 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very disappointed, to say the least,'' said coach  
Cheryl Burnett, whose team was the regular-season MVC champion. 
``It was unexpected. But at the same time, our team this year has 
really rebounded extremely well from losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State had won 19 straight before losing to SMU in the  
finals of the Western Athletic Conference tournament. The Rams' 
only other loss was to California on Dec 21.

	``The last time we lost, it was a good thing for us,'' said  
Becky Hammon, Colorado State's first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State's opponent, Cal State Northridge, had its  
resiliency tested early. The Matadors' coach, Michael Abraham, 
resigned a week before the season after being charged with selling 
cocaine. But they've posted a 21-7 record in earning the school's 
first NCAA bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Cinderella story,'' said Frozena Jerro, the former  
assistant who is now the head coach. ``We started off kind of 
rocky, but to end up here is a blessing.''

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Stock Tumbles 39 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. stock plunged 39 percent  
Friday after the drug store chain warned that its quarterly 
earnings will be substantially below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camp Hill, Pa.-based company said its earnings for its  
fourth fiscal quarter would be 30 cents to 32 cents per share, 
compared to Wall Street projections of 52 cents a share. The 
earnings will be reported on March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid stock was plunged $14.43 3/4 to close at $22.56 1/4 a share  
as the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with 
almost 46.9 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed the largest portion of the expected shortfall  
-- 11 cents per share -- on costs associated with the opening of 206 
new stores in the last 45 days of the quarter, and losses from 
liquidating the inventory in 208 stores that were have closed in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor was an 11-week delay in closing the company's  
distribution center in Shiremanstown, Pa., even as it opened a new 
one in Perryman, Md., this week. The extra cost of running both 
centers accounted for 3 cents a share of the shortfall, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said its earlier-than-expected acquisition of PCS  
Health Systems and a new marketing strategy that involved markdowns 
of certain products to reduce inventory in eastern and southern 
stores also contributed to the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin L. Grass, Rite Aid's chairman and chief executive, said  
the company is disappointed with the fourth-quarter results but 
optimistic that shareholders would reap the benefits of Rite Aid's 
ongoing expansion in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain committed to repositioning our store base to larger,  
free-standing units. We have concluded that for the current year, a 
program of 300 new and relocated stores should produce enhanced 
results,'' Grass said.

<HEADLINE> Two Sets of Twins Face Off in NCAAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Those uniform numbers will sure come in handy  
when Georgia meets Liberty in the NCAA women's tournament Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Bulldogs, led by twins Kelly and Coco Miller, face a  
set of Liberty lookalikes, Sarah and Sharon Wilkerson, in a 
first-round game at the Mideast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little different, going twin on twin,''  
Coco Miller said. ``But I think it will be fun. It's always neat to 
see how other teams play me and Kelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 Millers are carbon copies of each other, right  
down to their matching hair styles and a penchant for wearing their 
Nike wrist bands just below the left elbow. To the casual observer, 
they are distinguishable only by their uniform numbers -- Kelly 
wears 23, Coco is 35. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may confuse them a little,'' Coco said grinning, looking  
for any advantage over the Wilkersons. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty's identical twins are four inches shorter and easier to  
tell apart. Sharon revealed her penchant for individualism last 
summer by picking a different coiffure than her sister, adding 
blonde highlights to her dark brown hair, allowing it to grow 
longer and dropping the bangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom used to dress us alike and I hated it so much,'' Sharon  
said. ``When we were freshmen and sophomores, we had the same hair, 
the same bangs. It was hard to tell us apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, both sets of twins possess a unique bond that  
cannot be defined in earthly terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can look at Sarah, whether she's passing or shooting, and  
tell exactly what she's going to do,'' Sharon said. ``It takes a 
long time for other players to develop that kind of relationship. I 
guess it's like John Stockton and Karl Malone. We just feed off 
each other. It's hard to guard because we don't have to talk to 
communicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coco Miller led Georgia in scoring with an average of 19.4  
points per game, Kelly was second at 18.0. Kelly was the team 
leader in steals and assists, Coco ranked second and third in those 
categories, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Wilkerson was Liberty's second-leading scorer at 16.0  
points per game, Sarah ranked third with an average of 12.2. Sarah 
led in assists, Sharon was second. Sharon shot 42.1 percent from 
the field, Sarah connected at 41.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sets of twins could wind up guarding each other, but  
neither coach expects the dual matchups to overshadow the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no different than the other eight kids on the team  
playing against kids who aren't twins,'' said Andy Landers, coach 
of third-seeded Georgia (21-7). ``It's not about who may or may not 
guard each other. This is about Georgia and Liberty. If we lose 
sight of that, I'll be upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've been reading, both sets of twins are a lot  
alike,'' said coach Rick Reeves of 14th-seeded Liberty (21-7), 
making its third straight NCAA appearance. ``They are the type of 
kids who will play hard for 40 minutes, then shake hands at the end 
and appreciate the opportunity they got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Millers have been virtually inseparable their entire lives --  
rooming together, going to class together, playing sports together. 
Still just sophomores, the Minnesota natives refuse to look ahead 
to the inevitable moment when they must go their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a tough subject,'' Coco said. ``We never talk about  
that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilkersons, who are juniors, began to make the break last  
summer by living apart for the first time. Sarah went home to 
Princeton, W.Va., and left behind Sharon, who had a job and wanted 
to stay close to campus so she could work out in her spare time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't like I expected,'' Sharon said. ``I expected to miss  
her more than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The break will be complete May 1, when Sarah marries her high  
school sweetheart and changes her last name from Wilkerson to 
Farley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time they learned not to be together,'' Reeves  
said. ``That might be an uncomfortable situation when Sarah gets 
married.''
