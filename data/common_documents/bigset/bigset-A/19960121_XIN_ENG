<HEADLINE> Ferry Carrying Freed Hostages Leaves Turkey for Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A Black Sea ferry with around
100 freed hostages left Turkey today for the Russian port of
Sochi.
</P>
<P>
The 3,838-ton "Avrasya" ferry, which docked at the Turkish
port of Eregli after a four-day hijack ordeal ended Friday,
headed for its original destination of Sochi this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zonguldak governor Sami Seckin said that all necessary
measures, including supply of fuel, water and food, had been
taken for a safe navigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kayhan Ozdemir, chairman of the Duzce Branch of the
Abkhazian Culture Association, claimed over the weekend that those
involved in the hijacking had no links with any terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
The ferry was hijacked Tuesday in the Black Sea port of Trabzon
in northeastern Turkey by nine pro-Chechen gunmen, who are now
under police custody.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers were questioned at a naval base near Istanbul
and then handed over to police.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had at first threatened to blow up the ferry in
Bosphorus Strait near Istanbul in protest against Russia's attacks
on Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller insinuated an
link of the hijack with the Chechen situation, saying that "it is
clear that it (the hijacking incident) would not have been taken
place if the Chechen question had been brought to a peaceful and
satisfactory end."
</P>
<P>
Russia has viewed with increased suspicion Turkey's
attempts to develop close political and economic ties with
Turkish republics in Asia, which gained their independence after
the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Turkish officials have
been dismissing Russian complaints that volunteers from Turkey
were fighting in Chechnya and Chechen rebels were receiving
military training in Turkey.

</P>
<P>
Commissioning a water project at Ngong Town near Nairobi

<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Passenger train services
between Kenya and Tanzania, which were suspended in 1977
following the breakup of the East African Community (EAC), have
resumed.
</P>
<P>
The services were officially launched on Saturday in Taveta on
the Kenyan-Tanzanian border, which was attended by Kenyan
Minister for Energy Darius Mbela and Tanzania's Deputy Minister
for Communication Maua Daftari, the Kenya News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Passengers traveling from Kenya to Tanzania will be able to
connect the trains from Voi in Kenya via Moshi in northern
Tanzania to the country's capital, Dar es Salaam, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Mbela said resumption of the
services resulted from a series of bilateral discussions.
</P>
<P>
The train services will greatly benefit the business community
in the two countries as they are more effective than road
transport, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbela pointed out that the move is a great step forward toward
the revival of east African cooperation, and will go a long way
in strengthening regional socio-economic cooperation.
</P>

Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were member states of the defunct
EAC. Passengers train serves between Kenya and Uganda resumed

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Living standards in Britain fell
last year for the first time since 1982, as a result of price and
tax rises.
</P>
<P>
The Observer newspaper today quoted shadow finance minister
Gordon Brown as saying that there was an average 0.4 percent
reduction in real earnings during 1995, the first fall since 1982
when earings dropped by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Brown said price and tax rises exceeded earnings growth last
year. The fact will make uncomfortable reading for the government.
</P>
<P>
During the mid-eighties real earnings in Britain rose by up to
six percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Britain's economic recovery since the recession in early 1990s
has reached the fourth year. But consumers still lack the
feel-good factor, which has become one of the main concerns for
the government.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the fourth quarter growth figures, to be
published on Monday, should confirm that the economy was growing
in a slowest pace in three years.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke cut the key basing lending rate
by a quarter point last week, citing slow growth in Europe as one
reason.

<HEADLINE> hke-- News Analysis: Summit Brings Closer CIS Economic Integration (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The summit of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) over the weekend has brought the 12
member states closer in the direction of economic integration, but
Russia's goal of a military-political union remains unattained.
</P>
<P>
The presidents signed a total of 27 accords during their
three-hour meeting in the Kremlin Friday in the hope of boosting
all-round cooperation between these former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Kirghizstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan plan to join the Customs
Union, nowing grouping Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, later this
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a CIS Payments Union will be established with the
aim of a Currency Union that would change the current scenario
where most of the CIS countries have issued their own currencies.
</P>
<P>
Despite the headways made in economic integration, Russia's
call for a military-political union among the CIS member states
has largely fallen on deaf ears, winning support only from Belarus.
</P>
<P>
To counter what it regards as the new containment policy
practised by the U.S.-led West toward Russia and the eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Moscow has
readjusted its foreign policy in the past two years, with more
emphasis on the "near abroad" and, particularly, on strengthening
relations with CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that Russia has to some extent succeeded in
expanding its sphere of influence within the CIS by such moves as
peacekeeping operations in Tajikistan and mediation efforts in
Georgia over the breakaway republic of Abkhazia and in the
Azeri-Armenian dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
</P>
<P>
However, its ambition of a military-political union among the
CIS members will face a long way ahead, with its sour relations
with Ukraine remaining a curb on the development of the
integration process.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which jointly account for three-quarters of
the CIS population and the bulk of economic resources, together
with Belarus, set out to form the core of the CIS early in
December 1991.
</P>
<P>
But by 1992, Moscow and Kiev were drifting apart politically,
divided over such issues as the future of the Black Sea Fleet and
the status of the Crimean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Friday's summit did bring a brighter tone, though, when
Yeltsin, who has several times postponed his visit to Kiev,
announced that he would go to Kiev in March "to sign a major
political agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The integration of Russia and Ukraine is the salvation for
both states from the problems that we are facing today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another step endorsed at the summit was the formation of a CIS
Council of Interior Ministers, which will coordinate the fight
against organized crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a majority of the member-states agreed to further
develop the system of CIS peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
There are now 25,000 CIS peacekeepers under Russian command in
war-torn Tajikistan, and the summit decided to extend their
mandate for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of CIS heads of state will take place in
Moscow on May 17.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Greek Government Faces Hard Tasks  (By Chen Dechang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece's new government, led by
Costas Simitis and will be sworn in Monday, is facing pressing
challenges to resolve the country's hard issues both at home and
across the border.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, a 59-year-old veteran party official and former
minister of industry and commerce, was elected new prime minister
by the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) parliamentary
group Thursday to replace the bed-ridden Andreas Papandreou who
resigned as premier last Monday.
</P>
<P>
What the new government has to do first is to speed up the
nation's economic reform to meet with the European Union's
convergence goals.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Simitis is determined to
pursue an austerity economic policy, to reduce the public deficit
by cutting public expenditure. Big changes are also expected on
the boards of state companies and banks, with old PASOK faithfuls,
many of whom owe their jobs to political patronage, expected to be
sidelined in favor of professional technocrats under Simitis'
promised reforms.
</P>
<P>
The new government will also be tested in its foreign policy on
a number of sensitive issues. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Holbrooke is expected in Athens early next month to
discuss the ongoing U.N.-led negotiations on the crucial issue of
the name of the neighboring Macedonia as well as new U.S.
initiative on the long-standing Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The strain relations with neighboring Turkey has long been
regarded as one of the most sensitive and difficult aspects in the
country's foreign policy. Political observers noted that any
mishandling of the issue would cost the government dearly.
</P>
<P>
As the only country in the Balkans with a membership of both
the NATO and the EU, Greece is also trying to work out a policy
which would enbale it to play a more active role in the turbulent
region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that Simitis will enjoy a brief honeymoon, from
both the party and media. But he must take a strong showing at the
PASOK congress expected to be held in the middle of this year and
prove himself a dynamic and effective premier before the next
general elections in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Political Leaders Urged To Support Mandela's Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- All South African
political leaders should support the efforts of President Nelson
Mandela to end the carnage in Kwazulu/Natal Province, Gauteng
provincial Premire Tokyo Sexwale said today.
</P>
<P>
Closing a three-day African National Congress (ANC) provincial
constitutional conference here, Sexwale warned that if political
violence in Kwazulu/Natal continues, it could engulf the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Political violence in Kwazulu/Natal is seen by the world as
violence in South Africa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini on Friday,
Mandela said he would initiate a round of urgent peace talks with
political leaders in Kwazulu/Natal to end the killings in the
strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
Mandela stressed that the political violence is turning
Kwazulu/Natal into a "ghost province" and continues to humiliate
the Zulu nation.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Sexwale said the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)
has an obligation to the people of Kwazulu/Natal to lead them to
sit down and talk and debate the situation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the political violence between supporters
of the ANC and IFP in Kwazulu/Natal had claimed more than 14,000
lives in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the ANC decided that political power
sharing should not be enshrined in South Africa's final
constitution, saying the government of national unity at present
is only a compromise necessary for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Sexwale said the constitutional recommendations adopted at the
conference would be debated at a national ANC conference with its
allies on February 3.
</P>
<P>
He urged the IFP to return to the constitutional negotiation
table, saying that all means should be used to get the IFP to
return.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the Constitutional Assembly early last
year complaining that its constitutional demand for international
mediation on Zulu autonomy had not been met.

transport facilities, develop trade and commerce and carry out
technical and industrial projects in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said five committees are studying trilateral
cooperation in commerce, banking, transport, energy and
coordination at the attendance of respective ministers in Tehran.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Most Swazis have braced
themselves for a workers' stayaway beginning Monday by the
Swaziland Federation of Trade Union (sftu), the South African
Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sftu snubbed three meetings of the tri-partite committee
comprising government, employees and trade unions over the past
two days, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The decision to launch the forthcoming strike was reached on
January 14 after Swazi police stopped a mass meeting of the sftu
in Manzini, second largest city of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Sftu said only the lifting of a 22-year-old ban on political
parties could avert the planned national strike.
</P>
<P>
However, fears of violence between security forces and
pro-democracy protesters mount as the mass strike go ahead on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Armed police and paramilitary forces had already manned road
blocks along the Mbabane to Manzini road. All vehicles were being
searched.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Swaziland indicated that they would not hesitate to
use "all the possible legal means" to crack down on any illegal
protests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Swaziland government, employers and the
Swaziland Federation of Labor met today in Mbabane in an attempt
to negotiate a joint agreement.
</P>
<P>
A joint sitting of parliament had also been called for this
afternoon, at which Prime Minister Prince Bilini and his cabinet
were expected to inform parliament of the latest situation.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturer of Passenger Train Carriages Aiming High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The production of carriages
for express passenger trains with a speed of 300 km per hour will
be the primary goal of the Changchun Passenger Train Carriages
Plant in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Since manufacturing China's first passenger train carriages at
the end of 1950s, the plant, the largest of its kind in China
which is based in northeast China's Jilin Province, has produced
about 17,000 carriages for passenger trains, accounting for over
half of those now in service in China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the railway carriage manufacturer has become
the first in China to shift its main products from the outmoded
model 22 carriages to model 25, and the type of its products
increased from the former three or four each year to over 20 now.
</P>
<P>
It has also produced China's first carriages for express
trains with a speed of 160 km per hour, two times the average
speed for trains now in service in China, and nearly up to its
foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, the Changchun plant has manufactured over 2,000
model 25 passenger train carriages, becoming the top producer of
the new type carriages since China's railway carriage
manufacturers stopped the making of the old model 22 last year.
</P>
<P>
The plant has completed a major technical overhaul project with
a 15-million US dollar World Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
It has developed new types of railway carriages for passenger
trains with the cooperation of overseas counterparts, thus laying
a foundation for the production of express train carriages in the
last five years of this century.

<P>
ALMA ATA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The National Emergency
Committee of Kazakhstan has urged seismologists in Alma Ata city
and the states of Alma Ata and Taldi-Kurgan to keep an eye on
possible earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakhstan Soldier, a local weekly publication, in its
latest issue quoted a senior official of the committee as saying
that since earthquakes occur more frequently in autumn and winter,
necessary preparations must be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that all seismological observation
institutions in the nation are asked to make sure that their
observing facilities are working normally. The earthquake
forecasting committees should analyze the data every day, he added.
</P>
<P>
The governors of the southern and south-eastern states of
Kazakhstan should be on duty besides the working hours, according
to the decision of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Three days earlier, an earthquake of 5-6 magnitude occurred 150
kilometers south of Alma Ata.
</P>
<P>
Seismological experts predict that in the following five years
North Tienshan Mountain area, where the capital and the two states
are located, will face an active period of earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Surges In Tianjin Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that Tianjin
port, the largest in north China, handled 34.408 million tons of
cargos last year, and volume of foreign trade reached 21.746
billion US dollars, up by 43 percent and 35 percent respectively
over 1994.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Tianjin Customhouse attributed the
substantial growth in foreign trade to the customhouse's efforts
to speed up the reform of the customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
With simplified inspection procedures for imports and exports,
the value of cargos from other provinces and cities in north China
shipped through the port was boosted to 14.739 billion US dollars
last year, a rise of 33 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The official said the processing industry was also developed
quickly as a result of simplifying the registration and approval
for processing businesses.
</P>
<P>
1995 witnessed 2.46 billion-yuan-worth of new processing trade
contracts, up 76 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ministers Attacked for Violating Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 21 (Xinhua) - The conflict between Iran's
cabinet and the rightist group controlling the parliament took a
new turn today as a rightist theoretician attacked the government
for violating the constitution.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Persian evening paper Resalat,
Assadollah Badamchian lambasted the cabinet ministers for planning
to nominate their own candidates in the upcoming parliamentary
elections slated for March 8.
</P>
<P>
There are 5,000 candidates running for elections of 270 seats
in the Fifth Parliament, according to Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
"If a group of ministers and government officials as
executives want to nominate their officials, this would be a
violation of constitution and the election laws," said Badamchian.
</P>
<P>
"Those who would willingly do such things would be prosecuted
under the law," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Badamchian urged President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to require
his ministers to resign if they want to take measures that would
be interpreted as "interference of the executive branch in the
legislative branch."
</P>
<P>
Iranian daily Salam wrote today that the list of candidates
backed by the cabinet ministers will soon be published.
</P>
<P>
"It is said that election lists of candidates backed by the
ministers and executive managers are about to be completed and at
the moment 20 of such candidates have been put on the list," the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The report mentioned the name of some ministers in President
Akbar Rafsanjani's cabinet (1989-1993) as possible nominees.
</P>
<P>
Last week, sixteen Iranian top officials, including cabinet
ministers, Tehran's mayor and presidential deputies, issued a
letter to Rafsanjani, calling for more participation by all groups
in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
"The letter has greatly angered the rightist group, Society of
Bombatant Clergy (SCC), which sees itself as the target of the
letter's attack," said a source at Iranian Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The source said that the parliament is considering to fight
back with a rebuttal to the statement by the top officials.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some of the official signatories to the
letter such as Economy and Finance Minister Morteza Mohammadkhan
have withdrawn their support from the letter.
</P>
<P>
"The letter has excited the deputies so much that they are not
even paying attention to the issue at hand, the consideration of
this year's budget," added the source.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Strives to Become An Industrialized Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's largest special
economic zone, is making efforts to become a rising
industrialized province in next five years.
</P>
<P>
The island province is making efforts to build an industrial
belt with light industry lying on the eastern part and heavy
industry on the west, said Peng Qinghai, director of the
provincial industrial department.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the industrial belt would obtain an
industrial output value of 50 billion yuan by the end of this
century, doubling the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight pillar industries listed in its 1996-2000 plan,
seven fell into the industrial category including the
petro-chemistry industry, auto-making, beverage, paper pulp
manufacture, pharmaceutical and building industry.
</P>
<P>
The province is to build, in the next five years, 38 new
industrial projects which are expected to turn out an additional
industrial value of 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said Hainan has entered the early stage of
industrialization, and some newly-built key projects have showed
initial economic results, yielding an added output value of 4
billion yuan, 30 percent of the province's total industrial output
value.
</P>
<P>
Peng has expressed full confidence in Hainan's development. In
1996, he said, the province will invest 3.5 billion yuan in nine
key projects such as construction of a natural gas plant, an iron
and steel mill and a meridian tyre plant.

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber al Thani has said that the Gulf
Arab country would soon announce big petrochemical projects with
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in the latest issue of the Middle
East Business Weekly, the foreign minister said the projects with
foreign companies could not be affected by the fact that a
substantial portion of Qatar's financial reserves is still
controlled by Qatar's former ruler, Sheikh Kahlifa bin Hamad al
Thani.
</P>
<P>
Qatar would soon announce the petrochemical projects worth 500
million to 1,000 million U.S. dollars with foreign companies and
Qatar would have no difficulty in providing its share of the
equity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, the new Emir of
Qatar, is widely supported in the country and Qatar could not
return to the past.

<P>
NINGBO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A 1,000 DWT (dead weight
tonnage) luxury pleasure boat has been put into service in this
port city in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
It marks the beginning of the shipping industry here to join in
tourism services, according to Wang Mingli, chairman of the Ningbo
company operating the boat with the name of Yongjiang.
</P>
<P>
The pleasure boat, costing 20 million yuan, is equipped with
sophisticated sound systems and a cable TV system, restaurants,
bars, dancing halls, Karaoke bars, a beauty salon and medical
services.
</P>
<P>
Passenger transport by sea has kept declining in recent years,
due to the slowness, dullness and low quality service on sea
journeys. On the Ningbo-Shanghai route, passenger flow has
decreased by an annual average of 15 percent, and the only 930,000
people traveled on the route in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Pleasure boats are expected to improve the dull image of sea
journey and attract more passengers as a way of pastime.
</P>
<P>
Yongjiang boat has already opened trips to a tourist center on
Taohua Island in Zhoushan city, and other holiday trips.

<TEXT>
<P>
DA ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has appealed for
international help to deal with thousands of scared Rwandese
Hutus who poured into the country after killings in their refugee
camp in Burundi recently, according to local press here today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Defense Minister, Esdgar Majogo, accompanied by
military ranking officers, inspected the refugee camps in Kigoma
region on Saturday and made the appeal in coping with the latest
influx.
</P>
<P>
"We have said in the past and we are saying now that this
situation cannot be dealt with by my government alone. the
international community is expected and required to come in and
sort out this problem," Majogo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country, which closed its borders to refugees
last year, had decided to allow the Rwandese in but this was only
temporary and they must leave in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Up to 14,000 refugees poured into Tanzania after Burundian
troops killed about 20 Rwandese Hutus and wounded scores in an
attack on their camp in northeastern Burundi, a report said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is already home to over 700,000 Rwandese Hutus who
fled civil war in their homeland in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Norway To Release withheld Payment Balance Support To Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Norway will release 50
percent of its withheld balance of payment support to Tanzania
budgeted for 1995 amounting to about 3.6 million US dollars
following the latter's failure to collet taxes and fight
corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This action should be seen as a gesture of confidence in the
new government and its ability to enhance democratic and economic
reforms in Tanzania," said a press release issued here on
Saturday by the Norwegian Embassy in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
However, the press release said that the remaining 50 percent
would be released "only upon satisfactory follow-up of the special
program of assistance-joint evaluation mission recommendations".
</P>
<P>
The press release attributes the decision to the Norwegian
Minister for Development Cooperation, Ms. Kari Nordheim Larsen,
who had talks with President Benjamin Mkapa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister, who was in the country for a three-day
visit, in her talks with President Mkapa on Friday, said that her
government decided to assist Tanzania's economic recovery drive
by releasing part of the funds which had been withheld following
the donors' dissatisfaction with Tanzania's conduct of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The donors decided to freeze their assistance to Tanzania in
october 1994, unhappy with her failure to collect tax revenues
and widespread tax-evasion in the country.

ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Overall World Cup women's
leader Martina Ertl of Germany might has to yield her lead in the
women's Alpine skiing on Sunday after going out of a giant slalom
race by missing a gate on an icy piste at the tournament in
Cortina D'Ampezzo.
</P>
<P>
Ertl, winner of three out of four giants this season, failed to
concentrate in Sunday's first leg of the race after a Saturday's
downhill crash on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste which is also
used for the longest giant slalom of the season.
</P>
<P>
Her room mate, Olympic downhill gold medalist Katja Seizinger,
posted the fastest time of one minute 17.90 seconds in the first
leg through the 58 gates of the piste, and was looking to first
place if she won the race to add 100 points to her current 722
points.
</P>
<P>
But Austria's 1992 Olympic silver medallist Anita Wachter, who
was third fastest in 1:18.62 also had the lead place in her mind
as being the currently second overall on 735 points.
</P>
<P>
Following Ertl out of the race included big names like
Slovenia's Mojca Suhadolc, Switzerland's Karin Roten, Austrian
Alexandra, Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, and American Picabo Street.
</P>
<P>
The second leg was being raced later today under the new

<HEADLINE> Commodity Prices Soar in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The prices of various
commodities in the besieged Afghan capital of Kabul have soared in
the past week following the shutdown of the city's main supply by
rival warring faction, a report from Kabul said today.
</P>
<P>
The cost of heating fuel and staple foods have shot up about 50
percent since the key supply route linking Kabul with Pakistan's
border city of Peshawar was closed completely eight days ago. Meat
was also not available in shops and market stalls in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies warned that residents of the besieged city are at
risk of malnutrition and exposure.
</P>
<P>
The blockade also caused the devaluation of Afghani, the Afghan
currency, by 17 percent on last Wednesday. One US dollar is now
exchanged for seven thousand Afghanis.
</P>
<P>
The road has been closed because of an intra-factional dispute
of road taxes among Hezb-i-Islami led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the
report quoted stranded drivers operating on the route as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Afghan Student Militia Taliban has been
besieging Kabul since last October in a bid to topple President
Burhanuddin Rabbani by force.

<HEADLINE> HK Teenagers Urged to Be Guard Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- One in 100 people with AIDS
in Hong Kong was a teenager aged between 13 and 19, according to
Lee Shui-shan, consultant of the Department of Health's AIDS Unit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekend forum on AIDS and teenagers, Lee said
that although the ratio of teenagers with AIDS was relatively low,
the danger and risk is already there and increasing.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health figures show the number of HIV-positive
people had reached more than 600 by last September.
</P>
<P>
He said that four out of every 100 carriers of other
sexually-transmitted diseases were also teenagers.
</P>
<P>
He blamed adults for failing to set a good example for young
people and called for greater awareness and education about the
dangers of casual sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
According to the AIDS specialist, six teenagers are among the
600 patients being treated in Hong Kong for AIDS-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the true figure for those with AIDS and unknown
to officials could be five times as high.
</P>
<P>
He urged adults to adopt positive teaching of sex-related
issues to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Hong Kong AIDS Foundation chiefs are
finalizing plans for a two million HK dollar halfway house, where
victims of the disease can live while they learn to cope with
their illness, according to the Sunday Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The halfway house will give refuge to AIDS patients who face
discrimination at home or have short-term housing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Frederick Tong Kin-sang, foundation chief executive, said that
the home would have a 12-bed dormitory for HIV-positive patients
who need emotional support after finding they have the virus.

<HEADLINE> Muster Drops Out of Third Round at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Casualties ran high during the
weekend at the Australian Open, with two of the top three men's
seeds dropping out of the tournament in less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten in a four-set
clash with Mikael Tillstrom in the fourth round at Flinders Park
in Melbourne this evening, after top seed Pete Sampras of the
United States was toppled by 19-year-old Australian Mark
Philippoussis early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Muster, world No.3 and winner of the Grand Slam Cup last year,
crashed to the Swede by 4-7, 6-4, 3-6 and 2-6.
</P>
<P>
Muster hurt his right ankle in a third round match on Friday.
He seemed to have not recovered from the injury today, which
costed him the opportunity to become world No.1.
</P>
<P>
American Andre Agassi, defending champion and currently world
No.2, looks sure to rise to the pinacle of his career -- world
No.1. He squeezed out Sweden's Jona Bjorkman in a five-set duel
this afternoon and will play Jim Courier of the United States in
the quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
He appeared to be confident on winning the next match, saying
it is going to be a good one.
</P>
<P>
American Chinese player Michael Chang will play Tillstrom in
the quarter-final and enjoy a good oppurtunity to win. He
defeated Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian in straight sets this
morning. The scores were 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
If Agassi won in the quarter-final match with Courier, he will
probably play Chang in the semi-final and perhaps Boris Becker in
the final.
</P>
<P>
Becker, world No.4, will appear in a fourth round match with
unseeded Brett Steven of New Zealand tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, who ousted Sampras last night, will also play in
the fourth round tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Boat People Must Be Sent Home: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad today reiterated Malaysia's stand on the Vietnamese boat
people in the Sungai Besi Transit Camp in Kuala Lumpur, saying
they would have to be sent home.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the riot at the camp Thursday which left 24
people including seven policemen injured, Mahathir said Malaysia
could not tolerate people who come to the country and then create
problems.
</P>
<P>
"We have sympathy for them, but there is a limit to being
sympathetic," Mahathir added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Langkawi, Mahathir said since the
third countries had refused to accept the Vietnamese boat people,
then they would have to be sent home.
</P>
<P>
"The third countries have promised to take them off our hands
but now they have refused to do so and if they have the right to
refuse them, we also have the right to refuse the boat people,"
Mahathir explained.
</P>
<P>
Scores of the Vietnamese boat people living in the Sungai Besi
Transit Camp set fire to one of the blocks and clashed with police
early Thursday. Malaysian police were forced to use tear gas and
water cannon to quell the disturbance, in which 24 people were
injured and one of the injured inmates died several hours after
being treated at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether these boat people could be sent home by June 30,
Mahathir said he was not sure but he added they were not political
refugees but economic refugees.

<HEADLINE> China's Tight Monetary Policy Successful in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The amount of currency the
central bank put into circulation decreased dramatically, and the
increase in money supply dropped steadily in China in 1995, said
officials with the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, currency in circulation totalled about 790
billion yuan, of which 60 billion, or 82 billion less than in
1994, was put into circulation within the year by the central
bank, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Narrow money, or M1, referred to currency in circulation plus
enterprises' current deposits, rose by 16.8 percent to around 2.4
trillion yuan, and the rising rate was ten percentage points lower
than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Broad money, or M2, which includes currency in circulation and
all kinds of deposits, expanded by 29.5 percent to 6.08 trillion
yuan, with the growth rate nearly five percentage points less
than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1995, Chinese government had plans that
narrow money grew between 23 to 25 percent and broad money by
around 30 percent. China has seen the broad money mushroom by more
than 30 percent annually in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The fall in money supply has been an important factor in
curbing inflation, said officials with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the central bank applied new regulatory methods, such
as raising interest rates on loans, issuing financial bonds,
accepting special deposit accounts, lending through re-discount,
and extending temporary loans.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, deposits in financial institutions hit 5.39
trillion yuan, 1.3 trillion more than at the beginning of the
year. Individual deposits amounted to 2.9 trillion yuan, 813
billion yuan more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions offered 5.05 trillion yuan in loans, 934
billion yuan more than in 1994. Insurance premiums reached 55.6
billion yuan, 11.6 billion more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of renminbi, Chinese currency, remained
stable. In the second half of 1995, the exchange rate of renminbi
against the US dollar moved within a small range around 8.3.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves surged to 73.5 billion US
dollars at the end of 1995, 21.9 billion more than at the end of
1994.

<HEADLINE> Peres: All PNC Members Can Return to Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- All members of the
Palestinian National Council (PNC) will be allowed into the
Palestinian-controlled areas for discussions on changing the
Palestinian covenant, Israeli Prime Minister said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Peres told Israel Radio that in the last few days, the
Palestinian National Authority had made a strong effort to
fight violence by Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres spoke on Israel Television Saturday night that
he expects PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to keep the promise to
change the covenant.
</P>
<P>
"I expect that he will do his part to fulfill the agreement
between us and him. He needs two months from the establishment of
the elected Palestinian Council to remove from the Palestinian
charter those clauses which call for harming or destroying
Israel," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel has several ways to respond if Arafat
fails to keep his promise.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough options in hand -- and he knows that -- in
order to stop other things. This year a number of other things are
supposed to be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are supposed to redeploy in Hebron, the negotiations must
begin on the final status, the additional redeployment must be
carried out, and there must be a established system of daily and
economic relations. I don't believe he wants to break up all these
things," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
Minister Yossi Beilin said that changing the covenant is
vital to advancing the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see us opening negotiations on the final status
unless the Palestinians change the covenant, for it would be
very strange to negotiate with a party that calls for
Israel's destruction," he told Israel's Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
"If the PNC charter is changed, we will open final status
negotiations in May (this year), and I hope this stage will go
faster than planned," Beilin added.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abbs (Abu Mazen), Chairman of the Palestinian Central
Election Commission, Saturday night confirmed in Ramallah that "the
Israeli government has allowed all PNC members to be given
permanent residency in Palestinian areas." "We asked for this
a long time ago and now they have agreed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Largest Railway Station in Asia Goes into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing West Railway
Station, the largest of its kind in Asia, has opened to traffic
with an inauguration ceremony held at the station today.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng attended the ceremony and cut the ribbon for
the opening of the station, which took three years to complete at
the cost of five billion yuan (625 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo encouraged
the railway authorities to run the new modern railway station in
accordance with international standards of management and services.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the
Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, extended
greetings to all the builders for their contributions to the
successful completion of the project.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng and Wu Bangguo awarded each of the 16 construction
units a commemorative board bearing the name of the Beijing West
Railway Station written by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The new railway station, located at western part of the
Chinese capital, has a total floor space of 500,000 sq m, seven
times that of the existing Beijing Railway Station in eastern
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Modern facilities at the station include automatic audio-video
information services, a computerized ticket system, a mail center
with an annual handling capacity of 50 million packets and a
telecommunications center with a switchboard of 150,000 telephone
lines.
</P>
<P>
The station also has a series of catering, shopping,
accommodation and entertainment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Starting tomorrow, there will be a total of 27 pairs of train
to and from the new station each day. After the Beijing-Kowloon
railway opens to traffic, the station, the line's northern
terminus, will handle 60 pairs of train with 300,000 travellers
every day, equivalent to the total handling capacity of the
existing three railway stations in Beijing.

Each seven-member team would be required to pay a royalty of
50,000 U.S. dollars. Previously, five-member teams paid 50,000
dollars. Only two additional members were allowed, with each
required to pay an additional 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The maximum number of climbers in a team has also been raised
from seven to 12. The five additional climbers are each required
to pay 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
An extra charge of 20,000 would also be made to climb the
highly popular southeast ridge.
</P>
<P>
Climbers are now also able to change their originally
designated route, at a charge of 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Nepal Mountaineering Association said it had
requested the tourism ministry to reduce the cost of climbing
Qomolangma and to simplify rules for issuing climbing permits.
</P>
<P>
Teams were limited to five members in July 1992 after
environmentalists pressed the government to ban expeditions on
Qomolangma to decrease pollution.
</P>
<P>
Fees were boosted from 10,000 dollars to 50,000 dollars in 1993
in a further bid to reduce the impact of climbers.
</P>
<P>
Climbers had sullied the mountain by leaving behind an
estimated 55 tonnes of tents, empty oxygen cylinders and other
gear as well as garbage.
</P>
<P>
Teams are now required to deposit 4,000 dollars to ensure they
bring back their garbage.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 people have climbed the 8,848-meter peak.

At present, there are some 2,500 Indochinese asylum seekers
staying at the first asylum camp in Puerto Pricesa, Palawan, some
540 km south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Among them, about 130 have been recognized as refugees and are
expected to move to a country of resettlement within the next few
months.

WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- With the withdrawal of
defending champion Nicole Bobek, Michelle Kwan won the women's
U.S. National Figure Skating Championship in San Jose, California
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tonia Kwiatkowski, 25 next month, won the silver medal. Tara
Lipinski, 13, took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
All three will participate in the World Championships in
Edmonton in March.
</P>
<P>
At 15, Kwan, who received very high marks for artistic
impression, joins four other women to have won the U.S.
Championships at that age.
</P>
<P>
Bobek, 18, was in third place entering the final competition
and could have won with a top performance. But an ankle injury
that appeared to have bothered her all week finally forced her to
withdraw just moments before she was due on the ice.
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, Rudy Galindo, the troubled former
pairs partner of 1992 Olympic champion Kristi Yamaguchi, became
the oldest men's champion in 70 years as he rescinded his
retirement plans to skate in front of his hometown crowd.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Oil Company to Liquidate T-bill Holdings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Oil
Company (PNOC) will liquidate five billion pesos (200 million US
dollars) of its treasury bill holdings to raise the remaining five
billion pesos needed to wipe out the deficit of the Oil Price
Stabilization Fund (OPSF).
</P>
<P>
Official sources said over the weekend that the PNOC plans to
liquidate five billion pesos of its 16 billion pesos (640 million
US dollars) investment in government securities to cover the
remaining deficit of the OPSF.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the PNOC gave five billion pesos to wipe out the 10
billion pesos (400 million US dollars) deficit of the OPSF.
</P>
<P>
The PNOC had initially intended to float PNOC bonds which would
have been listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, the PNOC later realized that floating PNOC bonds would
carry an additional cost in terms of interest payments.
</P>
<P>
To avoid additional expenditures arising from interest payments
on the planned PNOC bonds, it was realized that liquidating part
of its t-bill investment would be more economical.

<HEADLINE> Oil Barge Spills 720,000 Gallons of Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A 340-foot oil barge that
ran aground on U.S. east coast Friday leaked about 720,000 gallons
of heating oil into the Atlantic, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Spilling oil greased birds in a wildlife refuge area on the
southern coast of Rhode Island and shellfishing was banned, an
Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
The barge, carrying four million gallons of home heating oil,
ran aground on Nebraska Shoals, Rhode Island, after the tugboat
pulling it caught fire and exploded in stormy sea.
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter airlifting the crewmen abandoning the
barge first spotted the leaking late Friday. Coast Guard vessels
with containment equipment were immediately sent to the scene.
</P>
<P>
This morning a sheen of oil about 3 miles long and several
hundred yards wide was spotted moving southeast into the Atlantic
Ocean. But the oil was too thin to be skimmed or dispersed with
chemicals. And officials had surmised that a relatively small
amount of oil had leaked.
</P>
<P>
"When we did get a chance to get on board, we found that there
are in fact considerable breaches in the bottom of the vessel...
during low tide, we began to get a significantly greater increase
in oil loss," said Arnold Whitte of DonJon Marine Services.
</P>
<P>
The four million gallons of oil were contained in 14
compartments of the barge. So far only two of the compartments
were found leaking. Work crews were going to pump the remaining
oil from the barge into another one and set it afloat again Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that by the end of (Sunday), we will have solved the
problem of leaking oil," Whitte said. But the spill is already the
worst in the state history of Rhode Island.

COLOMBO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Commercial Bank of
Ceylon (CBC) has decided to open 10 more branches in different
parts of the country, the bank's spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
These branches will be set up in four major towns -- Chilaw in
the northwest, Nuwara Eliya and Ratnapura in the Central area and
Gampaha in the Western Province, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At present, CBC operates 36 branches in the country and over 50
percent of these branches are equipped with modern electronic
banking facilities.
</P>
<P>
The bank has recently introduced a new savings scheme called
"Progressive Saver Account" to promote saving habits of the
public.
</P>
<P>
Under this scheme, customers are encouraged to maintain a
minimum balance of 5,000 rupees (about 100 US dollars) in a
savings account. If this money is not withdrawn for one quarter,
the account gets an extra income of 25 percent on the due
interest.
</P>

"This facility offered by the bank has been very popular among
the customers," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Right-Wing Demonstration Held Against Palestinian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000-15,000 Israelis
gathered in Jerusalem's downtown Zion Square Saturday night in
protest against Palestinian elections in the city's eastern part
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The rally, organized by a coalition of right-wing groups under
the banner, "Everyone to Defense of Jerusalem," was the first
clear-cut anti-government meeting since late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin's assassination last November.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally amid cheers, Rabbi Haim Druckman vowed
that Israel would return to all parts of Judea, Samaria and
Gaza. Judea and Samaria are referred to the West Bank of the
Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that we will return to Bethlehem, to
Nablus, to Ramallah," said Druckman.
</P>
<P>
Ya'acov Novick, one of the organizers of the rally, said, "we
need to demonstrate, and in a big way. We need to return to the
streets."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of policemen were on the side streets leading into
Zion Square, but no incidents were reported. The harshest chant
heard Saturday night was "Peres Go Home."
</P>
<P>
"We are organizing a struggle to ensure that facts are not
created that will divide Jerusalem," said city councilman Shmuel
Meir.
</P>
<P>
"Do not despair. A generation ago we were willing to sacrifice
our lives for Jerusalem. Today as well we have no choice but to
sacrifice our lives for Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Speculations were spread that the right-wing elements would
disrupt Palestinian polling activities Saturday, but none of such
cases occurred.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Infrastructural Constraints Hamper Bangladesh's Exports (By Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Poor infrastructure in Bangladesh
is hampering the country's exports, whose low growth has fallen
far short of the planned target, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports during the first five months of the
current fiscal year amounted to 1.58 billion US dollars, an
increase of only 7.1 percent as compared with the projected 15.15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's share of the world exports has dropped during the
1972-1994 period, plummeting to 0.04 percent from 0.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has made some progress in removing the so-called
"regulatory impediments" in exports, from which the earnings are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's two export processing zones in Dhaka and
Chittagong, the largest port city in the country, alone exported
products worth about 160 million US dollars in the second half of
1995, an increase of about 65 percent over the same period of
1994.
</P>
<P>
However, in a recent review of Bangladesh's trade policy
reforms, the World Bank has expressed concern over the country's
continued "narrow" export base, and noted that excepting the
ready-made garments, no other export sector could demonstrate any
remarkable success over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The below-expectation performance by the exports sector was
attributed mainly to a chronic port congestion.
</P>
<P>
Growth in containerized cargo from Bangladesh has been
"remarkable" but ports are unable to accommodate the pressure, the
World Bank said, adding that total costs for Chittagong port were
much higher than other Asian ports due to inefficient labor
management, shortage of handling equipment which increases
turnaround time for ships, and high domestic trucking costs.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the port situation, exporters across the country
were still plagued with electricity shortage and poor telephone
connections which are also hampering the export growth.
</P>
<P>
Critically appraising Bangladesh's poor infrastructural
facilities, the World Bank suggested that Bangladesh provide its
exporters "adequate infrastructure facilities if the full response
of policy reforms is to be elicited."

<P>
BEIRUT, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese top leaders are
expected to go to Syria today to express condolences to President
Hafez Assad on the third anniversary of the death of his son,
Basel Assad, well-informed official sources reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and
Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri as well as some other prominent
politicians are expected to go this morning to the Syrian
Mediterranean resort of Gartah, hometown of Assad, to join the
Syrian President in commemorating his son, the anonymous sources

Basel Assad lost his life in a traffic accident in which the
jeep he was driving in a high speed turned down on the Damascus
Airport Road on January 21, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese sources said that the two countries' leaders will
take the chance to exchange views on the regional situations,
especially the latest developments of the peace negotiations
between Syria and Israel, and a possible reactivation of the
Lebanese track after a breakthrough on the Syrian track.
</P>

Lebanese House Speaker Berri announced earlier that the
Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council, which was set up under a "Treaty
of Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination" signed between the
two countries in May, 1991, to hold a conference on January 27.

the United States, before the end of last year, military experts
of both sides will join the negotiators on January 24, a sign
interpreted by observers as indications of seriousness of the two
sides in reaching progresses.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Loses Iranian Rice Market to India, Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan lost its traditional
Iranian rice market to India and Thailand this year due to
non-availability of rice with the state-owned Rice Export
Corporation of Pakistan (RECP), the local newspaper The News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has finalized agreements to import
200,000 tons of rice each from India and Thailand, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
But the RECP were unable to sign these kinds of agreement,
because rice growers in the country had stopped sales of rice to
the RECP as they want to sell the commodity at higher prices than
those fixed by the government.
</P>
<P>
Rice is Pakistan's second major export crop after cotton. One
third of Pakistan's rice, or about one million tons, is for export
each year, which contributes about 20 percent of the country's
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan exports rice mainly to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
some other Middle East countries, Bangladesh and African
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years, Pakistan's rice export has been
facing fierce competition in the world market and showing a
downward trend.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that India has already thrown out Pakistan from
Middle Eastern and Saudi Arabian rice markets.

<HEADLINE> ICBC to Open New York, European Offices in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) will upgrade its Tokyo and Seoul
representative offices into branches and open overseas offices in
New York, Frankfurt and Luxembourg this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted ICBC Vice-President Liu Tinghuan
as saying the bank will continue to quicken the pace of
establishing overseas organizations and expand its banking
businesses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, ICBC officially opened its Hong Kong branch and
established representative offices in Tokyo and London.
</P>
<P>
At present, the bank has also set up a wholly-owned bank in
Kazakhstan and a representative office in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In addition to overseas expansion, the bank this year will make
preparations for the establishment of a joint venture bank in
Qingdao, a port city in Shandong province, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
ICBC has set up three joint-venture financial institutions in
China -- the Xiamen International Bank in Fujian province, the
Shanghai Paribas International Bank and the Shenzhen-based Chinese
Merchant Bank.
</P>
<P>
ICBC's goal is to increase its foreign exchange assets to 33
billion US dollars by the end of this year from last year's figure
of 24.88 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank also plans to attract 1.1 billion US
dollars in new hard cash deposits from individuals and enterprises
this year, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Starts Campaign to Oust Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision was made last night at a meeting of the three
major opposition parties -- the Awami (people's) League (AL), the
Jatiya (National) Party (JP) and the Jamaat-E-Islami.
</P>
<P>
According to their decision, the opposition would begin the
next phase of their campaign from today with the launch of a mass
contact program which will last till January 31.
</P>
<P>
The opposition is also contemplating a 48-hour strike aimed at
resisting the unilateral elections planned by the ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The country's Election Commission (EC) has set February 15 as
the polling date for the next national elections. But the
opposition parties have boycotted the election process, and demand
the resignation of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and the
establishment of a neutral caretaker administration under which
the elections would be held.
</P>
<P>
Since the nomination filing date for the elections expired on
January 17, the EC has made it clear that "now we have to go ahead
with the elections in the country and the election rules do not
allow us to reverse the proceedings of the nomination."
</P>
<P>
The opposition asked the EC to cancel the February 15 elections
and urged the candidates to withdraw their candidature or they
would be termed the "people's enemy."
</P>
<P>
"We have started the second phase of our movement. We are no
longer demanding a caretaker government. The next movement is to
oust Begum Zia from power," the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling BNP has asked partymen who have stood
against the party nominees in parliament elections to withdraw
their candidature immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, all concerned would be charged with violation of
the party decision and instruction, and punitive measures (would
be) taken against them shortly as per the constitution of the
organization," BNP Secretary General Barrister Abdus Salam
Talukder warned.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Ends African Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VICTORIA, SEYCHELLES, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China is not
opposed to non-governmental trade and economic relations between
African countries and Taiwan, but strongly opposes "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan," Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Xinhua News Agency and the China
Central Television before ending a two-day visit to the African
country, the last leg of his five-nation African tour, Qian said
China firmly opposes the practices of the Taiwan authority to make
use of the economic problems of some African countries to buy them
over and create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier also noted that economic cooperation
between China and African countries is based on mutual benefit and
mutual support among developing countries without any political
conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that more Chinese enterprises will go
into cooperation with African countries in addition to
governmental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on China's policy on Africa, Qian said the
relations between China and African countries are characterized by
mutual respect, equal treatment, mutual benefit in cooperation and
common development.
</P>
<P>
The two issues of peace and development can not be resolved
without the participation of African countries, which account for
about half of the non-aligned countries and nearly one third of
the member states of the United Nations, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to pay more attention
to Africa's voice and attach importance to its role in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
African countries have withstood severe tests of radical
changes in the international arena, Qian said, adding that they
have come to realize that the political system and economic
development model for Africa should conform to its history and
cultural traditions and be conducive to national stability and
unity.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the African countries will overcome
difficulties and achieve economic recovery and development by
relying on their own efforts and through active international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Before Seychelles, Qian visited Libya, Tunisia, Chad and
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Qian began his African tour on January 10, and is to leave for
home later today.

DHAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Traffic congestion in the capital
Dhaka has become a matter of serious concern for the Dhakaites
with the situation deteriorating to such an extent that the entire
traffic system is facing total disruption.
</P>
<P>
Except a few areas, traffic jams in the whole city have become

More than 300,000 rickshaws make the situation even worse, the

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Up 18 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade rose 18.6
percent in 1995, with foreign-funded enterprises responsible for
half the growth, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted customs statistics as showing that foreign
trade by joint ventures last year posted an increase of 25.3
percent over 1994, for a total of 109.82 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
That represented a 39.1 percent contribution to the country's
total foreign trade turnover, up 2.1 percentage points from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The net increase in trade conducted by joint ventures was 22.17
billion US dollars, more than half the national gain last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade by China's five special economic zones -- the
cities of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen and the southernmost
province of Hainan -- totalled 33.6 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
While this was a rise of 6.5 percent over 1994, it lagged
behind the national average by 12 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
However, there was good news from China's 13 state-level free
trade areas, where foreign trade tripled the 1994 figure to total
3.21 billion US dollars for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, exports from these areas doubled the 1994 total
record, while imports almost quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
After five years of development, Shanghai's Pudong New Area has
beefed up its trading power. Foreign trade last year totalled
6.89 billion US dollars, up 42.7 percent from 1994 to double the
nation's foreign trade growth rate average.
</P>
<P>
The customs report said that China established trade ties with
six more countries in 1995, to bring its total foreign trade
partners to 227 by December.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained China's biggest trade partner with bilateral
trade last year totalling 57.47 billion US dollars, an increase of
almost 20 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Japan is followed by Hong Kong, the United States, the European
Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Taiwan and the
Republic of Korea, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China's trade with its seven biggest trading partners totalled
236.5 billion US dollars in 1995, accounting for 84.2 percent of
its total turnover, the paper said.

CARACAS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Defense Minister
Moises Orozco Graterol announced Friday he will not attend a
border meeting with his Colombian counterpart Scheduled on
February 23.
</P>
<P>
"We are expressing solidarity with our foreign ministry, which
I consider has adopted a serious and responsible attitude," said
Orozco Graterol.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel
Burelli Rivas stated that he would not attend a meeting with
Colombian Foreign Minister Rodrigo Pardo as long as the latter
does not accept Venezuela's explanation about a national patrol
guard's involuntary penetration into Colombian territory.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers of both countries as well as the
governors and businessmen from the provinces on both sides of the
border were also invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Orozco Graterol assured that the attitude of the Venezuelan
Foreign Ministry does not signify a break in diplomatic relations
with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if Bogota accepts Caracas' explanation of the
border incident, the Venezuelan delegation will attend the meeting
in Cucuta, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister reiterated that his country did not invade
Colombian territory.
</P>
<P>
He also said Colombia must take action against the guerillas
and bandits who threaten Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan minister called for the government of Colombia
to take responsibility for the problem and not maintain a passive
attitude, leaving the handling of border safety to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Burelli confirmed on Friday that he had received a
communication from the Colombian Foreign Ministry, in which his
counterpart stated his country's position on the Venezuelan
national guard's incursion into Tibu, the Colombian province north
of Santander.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources indicated that Burelli was preparing a
statement which would indicate that the communication received
from Bogota "clears the air and creates the right environment for
the meeting" on February 23.

The newspaper should eulogize model soldiers and officers and
their heroic deeds displayed in carrying out the Party's line and
promoting army building.
</P>
<P>
The Party general secretary called on all editors and reporters
to go deep into the grassroot units, disseminating the party's
basic theories and basic line, reflect the demands and aspirations
of officers and men, provide them with fresh and timely
information and make friends with them.
</P>
<P>
Though the newspaper has trained a large contingent of
prestigious editors, reporters and commentators, it should not
smugly satisfied with the success it has achieved, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
A qualified journalist should adhere to a correct political
orientation, and be erudite and well versed in journalism, he said,
stressing the importance of studying rudimentary knowledge about
high technology and modern science.
</P>
<P>
Being an "engineer of the people's minds", jiang said, a journalist
should foster a correct outlook on the world, on life and on
values, and resist the influence of decadent ideology and culture.
</P>
<P>
A journalist should also strictly observe the secrets of the state,
the Party and the army, abide by journalistic discipline and be
cautious about matters concerning foreign relations.

<HEADLINE> Run "Liberation Army Daily" Better: Jiang Zemin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin has urged
all workers of the "Liberation Army Daily", the newspaper of
China's armed forces, to run their paper even better and fulfil
the tasks assigned to it by the Chinese Communist Party and the
people.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with workers of the paper on January 2, Jiang, who
is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, described the
"Liberation Army Daily" as a "very important newspaper" for the
publicity work of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
He said that to build China into a modern socialist country and
the PLA into a "powerful, modern and regular" revolutionary army,
the paper is playing a significant role in guiding the orientation
of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"To run the paper successfully, it is, first of all, imperative
to adhere to the principle of a distinct Party spirit," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued, "The PLA is an armed group whose purpose is to
implement revolutionary political tasks and an armed force under
the Party's absolute leadership."
</P>
<P>
The PLA's nature and characteristics have determined that the
"Liberation Army Daily" is not permitted to waver in the slightest
on the principle of upholding the Party spirit.
</P>
<P>
"The Party Central Committee has emphasized time and again
that senior officers must attach the utmost importance to
politics and must be clear-minded on political issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
This question must also be stressed in the Party's news work,
he said, noting that this is a necessary requirement posed by the
current new situation and tasks.
</P>
<P>
The leader quoted the late Chairman Mao Zedong as stating, "To
do news work successfully it is imperative that statesmen run
newspapers."
</P>
<P>
This instruction of Chairman Mao is still of great significance
in guiding today's work, he said.
</P>
<P>
As an ideological and public opinion form for educating and
mobilizing the people, journalism always reflects directly or
indirectly the Party's and government's political standards,
positions and viewpoints, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if newspapers in China are run successfully they
will be able to play a significant role in publicizing and
implementing the Party's line, principles, policies and tasks.
</P>
<P>
He added that they will also be able to play a significant role
in mobilizing and encouraging the people, encouraging and
carrying forward what is advanced, halting and correcting what is
erroneous, and spreading scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
If they are run unsuccessfully, especially if they commit
political deviations they will certainly cause confusion in
people's minds, and some of them could even possibly produce a bad
impact in China and abroad, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's flower industry is
blossoming as growing income gives consumers the power to indulge
in nonessential purchases, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The industry produces a total of goods and services worth four
billion yuan (481 million US dollars) in 1995, up five percent
from the previous year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure marks 11 years of growth in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Flower exports increased eight percent over 1994 to total 65
million US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Out of the current 80,000 hectares of land for flower planting
in China, only several thousand square meters are equipped with
greenhouses. Yet those 80,000 hectares fall among 20-odd provinces
between 20 and 50 degrees northern latitude.
</P>
<P>
Flower consumption in China has greatly risen since the 1980s,
espcially in big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Economy in Hainan Province to Grow 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in the southern
island province of Hainan, China's largest special economic zone,
will keep a strong momentum this year, the "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper quoted the province's governor Ruan
Chongwu as saying at a recent economic conference that Gross
Domestic Products (GDP) is targeted to grow 10 percent in 1996
from 38.1 billion yuan (459 million US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen tropical agriculture production, top priority
will be given to processing and transportation as the island tries
to cultivate a commercialized farming system.
</P>
<P>
Focus will also be given to oil refining, petro-chemicals, auto
manufacturing, food processing, chemical fibres and textiles,
pharmaceuticals, paper and pulp making, and construction
materials, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is expecting a surge in foreign investment during the
1996-2000 period, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Governor Ruan said that Hainan is expected to pump 21.6 billion
yuan this year into fixed assets this year, including 1.5 billion
dollars of actual foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used mainly for the construction of such
infrastructures as Meilan airport in Haikou, an expressway between
Haikou and Yangpu, the second section of the island's eastern
freeway, the Qiongzhou Strait train ferry project and the Dalong
Reservoir.

Defense Minister Oscar Camilion said today.

Speaking to Telam, the nation's offical news agency, Camilion
said the continuation of the embargo on weapons and military spare

<HEADLINE> Former Nepali PM to Run For Ruling Party Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister Girija
Prasad Koirala is to run for the presidency of Nepal's main ruling
party -- the Nepali Congress (NC) -- in the forthcoming party
convention, a newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Koirala will soon make public his decision to contest the
election for the party presidency, the Kathmandu Post quoted a
source from the NC party as saying.
</P>
<P>
Koirala has decided to stand for the presidency in a contest
with incumbent president Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, according to
the source.
</P>
<P>
A Central Working Committee meeting of the NC party earlier
this month had decided to hold the party General Convention in
west Nepal in late March, but it did not say there would be an
election for the party presidency.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation the two leaders have lingering differences
between them over the control of the party, which had led to the
fall of the Koirala government in 1994.
</P>
<P>
An NC-led coalition government was formed last September under
Sher Bahadur Deuba to replace the previous minority communist
government, which came to power in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang to Be China's Largest Commodity Grain Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province has set a target to become the country's largest
commodity grain production base by the year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
The northeast China's province plans to increase its grain
output by 7.5 billion kg in the next five years, and 17.5 billion
kg more between the year 2000 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province's total grain output will rise from
the current 25 billion kg to 50 billion kg by the year 2010,
most of which will be commodity grain.
</P>
<P>
The province provides more than 10 billion kg of commodity
grain annually, accounting for about one tenth of the total grain
purchased by the state.
</P>
<P>
The province has now 8.6 million ha of arable land, of which
5.3 million ha are low-yielding land but are expected to increase
a total of 12.5 billion kg of grain after transformation.
</P>
<P>
The province now boasts more than 4.7 million ha of undeveloped
areas, of which 1.7 million ha can be turned into arable land.
</P>
<P>
In order to enliven the local economy more efforts will be made
to achieve an all-round development of agriculture, forestry,
animal husbandry, side-line production and processing industry.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to apply more than 60 percent of scientific
and technological research results to agricultural production to
ensure the fulfillment of the target.

<HEADLINE> Trademark Registration Climbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Overseas trademark registration
are increasing in China, stimulated by the heated market
competition and improved intellectual property rights protection.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted sources with the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAFIC) as estimating
that by the end of last year, China had registered around 80,000
overseas trademarks, coming from more than 80 countries and
regions and including nearly all of the noted brands.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the accumulated number of overseas
trademarks registered during the 1991-95 period is almost equal to
that of the 40 years previous to 1991.
</P>
<P>
Around half of the registered overseas trademarks have not been
actually used in China -- suggesting long-term insight of these
enterprises towards the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Meng, an official with the SAFIC office, noted that an
improved legal system and speedier punishment for trademark
violators have incited the continuous increase of overseas
trademark registration.
</P>
<P>
Last year, SAFIC investigated and dealt with 16,857 trademark
infringement cases. As a result, violators paid fines of 49.6
million yuan (six million US dollars) and economic damages of 2.98
million yuan (359,000 US dollars) altogether.
</P>
<P>
This included 1,362 cases related to overseas trademarks, among
which 1,164 were settled last year.
</P>
<P>
During the 91-95 period, the administration handled more than
64,000 trademark infringement cases forcing violators to pay fines
of 137 million yuan (16.3 million US dollars) and economic damages
of 25 million yuan (three million US dollars) in total.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the top ten in the world in terms of trademark
registration today. By the end of last year the country had
approved registration of 540,000 trademarks.

<HEADLINE> Bank Savings Growing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Individual savings in Chinese
banks rose a hefty 38 percent last year, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite the issuance of a whopping 150 billion yuan (18 billion
US dollars) of State treasury bonds last year, new deposits in
Chinese banks in 1995 still topped 800 billion yuan (96.4 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
As more residents are lured by the high interest and subsidy
rates for deposits of three-year-term or longer, fixed-term
savings now account for 85 percent of the total, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources said last year's fast growth of individual savings
was achieved without breaking financial order and amid
double-digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
At present, savings in urban areas, where the population
accounts for about 30 percent of the country's total, constitutes
80 percent of all deposits, while deposits of rural people only
take a 20 percent share.
</P>
<P>
Observers have urged banks to pay more attention to rural areas
to pool deposits as farmers' income has also swelled in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Heads towards Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat is heading towards being elected President of
the Palestinian Council (PC), according to fresh vote counting
today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here at 2 a.m. this morning by Mohammad
Shtayyeh, general secretary of the Palestinian Central Election
Commission (CEC), on Saturday's historical Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Shtayyeh said that so far, 60
percent of the votes have been counted, with Arafat winning
more than 85 percent of the votes and his sole challenger
Samiha Khalil gaining less than 10 percent. Some of the
votes turned out to be invalid.
</P>
<P>
Shtayyeh said that the CEC has difficulty in reaching some
rural areas in the West Bank, resulting in a delay in announcing
the final results until this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's foregone victory is no surprise by any means
because of his long-established position of leadership among the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, after he cast his votes, Arafat said that the
event of elections "marks the beginning of a new era" and "a
foundation of a Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shtayyeh said that in average, 75 percent of the
1.04 million eligible voters turned out to the polls, but at five
post office in east Jerusalem, only 30 percent voters turned out
because of the heavy Israeli military and security presence.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, officials from the CEC press
relations office said that international observers have found
problems in the voting procedures at No. 72 voting station,
located in Deir El-Balah of the Gaza Strip, and the No. 39 voting
station in Jabalya, so that the votes there will not be counted.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that stopping counting those votes is
correct and proves that the elections are fair and democratic.
</P>
<P>
The first Palestinian elections came less than one month
after Israeli troops withdrew from six major West Bank towns
and 20 months after Gaza and Jericho gained autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the PC presidency race, the voters are also
electing 88 PC members from 672 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah movement is expected to win most of the seats.
Although Hamas and other rejectionist groups boycott the
elections, some Hamas members are running as independent
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The results of the PC elections will not be known until
later today.

TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Asian stars swept aside the rest
of Europe's best players on Saturday, winning their way into every
final of the Japan Open badminton tournament.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's Camilla Martin was the only European to put up a
serious fight, surprising Indonesian second seed Susi Susanti by
taking the first set of their semi-final 11-6.
</P>
<P>
But Susanti, twice a Japan Open champion, pulled her game
together with unerring smashes to win the match 6-11, 11-5, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final Susanti will meet China's top-seeded Ye
Zhaoying, who romped past compatriot Han Jingna 11-3, 11-2.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles, there was another Danish defeat when
China's Ge Fei and Gu Jun beat Rikke Olson and Helene Kirkegaard
15-8, 15-11 to reach Sunday's showdown with South Koreans Gil
Young-ah and Jang Hye-ock. They thrashed China's Qin Yiyuan and
Tang Yongshu 15-6, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
Europe's last hope of reaching a final died when Nick Ponting
and Joanne Wright of Britain were beaten by South Korea's Kim
Dong-moon and Gil 15-10, 15-11 in the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
For the title, they will play fellow South Koreans Park Joo-

<P>
MADRID, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia defeated Belarus 2-0
Saturday in the men's Olympic field hockey qualifying tournament
in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
All the drama in Malaysia's clash came in the final ten
minutes, with Mirnawan Nawawi netting on the 61st minute before
Noor Saiful's penalty corner on the 67th to ensure Malaysia's
second win in two games.
</P>
<P>
Lim Chiow Chuan could have broken the deadlock on the hour when
Abdul Aziz was brought down inside the circle. But keeper
Alexandre Eklemenko saved his weak penalty stroke.
</P>
<P>
But Noor immediately slipped a pass through to Mirnawan, who
flicked his side into the lead.
</P>
<P>
Noor then saw his penalty corner trickle through the entire
Belarus defence and into the net.
</P>
<P>
Belarus operated with two forwards -- Yuri Korottchenko and
Stefan Klimovitch -- but neither managed to make any headway.
</P>
<P>
A minute from time their centre half Nikolai Sankovets was
suspended for a dangerous tackle.

Spain meanwhile romped home 4-0 against Belgium, with a
hattrick from outside left Xavier Arnau. Escarre hit the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The hosts thus gained revenge for being dumped out of the
European Nations Cup in Dublin last August following a 2-2 draw
with the Belgians.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's result sends Spain to the top of the table on goal
difference from Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Beats Angola in African Nations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa defeated
Angola 1-0 with Mark Williams' goal on Saturday and are virtually
certain to reach the African Nations Cup soccer quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
South Africa seemed unsettled by the wet conditions and looked
a different side from the exuberant team which thrashed Cameroon
3-0 in the opening match of the tournament last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But in the 57th minute, an Eric Tinkler free kick was parried
by Angola keeper Orlando, and Williams, of Wolverhampton
Wanderers, pounced on the loose ball and fired home.
</P>
<P>
Angola, who lost 2-1 to Egypt, has virtually no chance of
making the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 turned out for the match, a great deal less than
the approximate 60,000, who turned out for South Africa's 3-0 win
in the opening match of the tournament last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Campos was nearly through in the 19th minute after South Africa
defender Sizwe Motaung hit a terrible back pass to keeper Andre
Arendse, who just got to the ball in time.
</P>
<P>
A minute later, Buthelezi hit a long-range shot well over, and
Paulao countered with an effort just wide of Arendse's post on the
half hour.
</P>
<P>
After the break, South Africa came more into the match, with
"Shoes" Moschoeu heading on target, moments before Leeds United
striker Phil Masinga shot over.
</P>
<P>
And two minutes before the goal, Angola had their best chance
of the match when Tubia shot straight at Arendse from 10-yards
following a goalmouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
Masinga, prominent throughout, had an eventful last half-hour.
</P>
<P>
After immense pressure from South Africa, a Masinga header hit
the stanchion of Angola's goal minutes before he was stretchered
from the field suffering from cramp.
</P>
<P>
Then, with four minutes to go, Masinga was booked for knocking
the ball into the net with his hand.

<HEADLINE> Rights to Existence, Development Primary: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- It is correct for the Chinese
government to put primary emphasis on improving people's rights to
existence and development while promoting overall human rights
conditions, a veteran law professor said.
</P>
<P>
"China is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion
and with relatively poor resources for each person. The situation
requires that the state safeguard and promote people's rights to
existence and development, and on this basis improve people's
overall human rights level," said Liu Wenzong, a law professor at
the Foreign Affairs College.
</P>
<P>
The professor, who has been engaged in studying international
legal science for decades, explained that human rights refer to
people's equal physical and ideological rights.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no equality between people, there will be no
democracy and freedom. If there is no sovereign equality between
countries, surely there will appear power politics and hegemony,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that some western countries talk too much about
civil and political rights while making few mention about people's
economic, social, cultural rights as well as the rights to
existence and development, for the countries show little interest
in improving such rights among the working people, especially
people in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Improvement in such rights goes against the foundamental
interest of ruling groups in those western countries," the old
professor noted.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, For the people in China and other developing
countries, the rights to existence and development are most
prominent. Only a strong economy can relieve the people from
worries about clothes, food, houses, travel and other daily
consuming, and as a result create a better environment for
achieving other rights, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that China, in accord with its own national
conditions, has succeeded in improving the people's rights to
existence and development on the basis of an inspiring economic
growth, he said.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Chief Satisfied With Withdrawal of Local Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- IFOR Commander Admiral
Leighton Smith said today that the warring parties have complied
with the peace agreement by withdrawing their troops before the
deadline expired on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the Bosnian government, Serb and Croatian
troops had withdrawn by two kilometers to let the IFOR troops
carve a four-kilometers buffer zone along the 900-kilometers
frontline in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Admiral said that the three sides have failed
to comply with another deadline by mid-night on Friday-- the
release of all prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The three sides freed 225 prisoners of war on Friday night
under international pressure, but there are still more than 600
pows believed to be in prisons, an apparent breach of the peace
agreement that was signed last month in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"We have observed substantial compliance on the military issues
of this peace agreement by all sides," Smith told a press
conference after IFOR ground troops commander Michael Walker met
with representatives of the three warring parties.
</P>
<P>
But he mentioned that in some areas there were partial
compliance due to such reasons as mine-clearance or bad weather.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, the U.S. Admiral added, "the parties have
shown the spirit of compliance and cooperation that we had only
dreamed of but not fully expected and we are gland we saw it."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, by assessing the army withdrawal, "it is a good day,
almost a milestone day."
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that NATO was willing to provide IFOR troops
with the limits of its resources, and to help establish a security
environment so that the international organizations could
investigate mass graves sites reported in Bosnian Serb
territories.
</P>
<P>
The new operation would expand NATO mission which is supposed
to concentrate on military affairs and could spark conflict with
the Serb army which is guarding these graves sites from any
investigations.

<HEADLINE> Ciller Tries to Break Ice with ANAP Leader for Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (xinhua) -- Turkey's caretaker Prime
Minister and True Path Party Chairwoman Tansu Ciller today took
the first steps to make preparations for the key meeting with
Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz on January 23 for a
center-right coalition.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told reporters that she would make a formal offer for
government partnership to ANAP when they meet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In what looked to be a moderate concession to the steadfast
Yilmaz, Ciller said that "the roof of the coalition can be
discussed simultaneously with its program."
</P>
<P>
She added that they were not going into the meeting with any
preconditions "and it is our right to expect the same attitude
from the other side."
</P>
<P>
In a gesture of goodwill before settling down to tough
bargaining, Ciller also paid a visit to the ANAP leader's wife,
Berna Yilmaz, who had an operation recently in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Not missing another chance to prepare a suitable atmosphere,
Ciller said the just-started fasting month of Ramadan was a
suitable time to bury past grievances and enmities in keeping with
Islamic tradition.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel assigned Ciller to form a new
government last week after pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) leader
Necmettin Erbakan admitted failure in his efforts to draw
partners from other four political parties which entered the
parliament in the December 24 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Personal rivalry between Ciller and Yilmaz, their bitter
recriminations during the election campaign and preconditions for
a reluctant partnership all doomed earlier efforts for a
center-right coalition with Ciller insisting on staying as the
prime minister and Yilmaz prepared to hear nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP leader told a private television channel over the
weekend that Ciller should not bother coming to him with a
coalition proposal without giving up the idea of heading
it.

<HEADLINE> WHO To Certify Nigeria Guinea Worm Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to be certified as
guinea worm free this year by the World Health Organization
following the reduction of the disease by 97 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was made known by the chief of Nigeria's Guinea-Worm
Eradication Program, Oladele Kale, in the southwestern city of
Ibadan today, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Cases of guinea worm in Nigeria fell from 653,620 in 1988 when
the program started, to about 15,000 in December 1995, although
the target date for global elimination of the disease is December
1995.
</P>
<P>
Measures adopted toward this end included the supply of
chemicals and cloth filters for water treatment, provision of
potable water, training of village-based health volunteers,
health education and public awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Kale, who is also the southwest zonal facilitator of "Global
2000", an international Non-Governmental Organization in the
vanguard of guinea-worm eradication in Nigeria, said the
zone recorded a 99.5 percent success last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more health workers should be trained to cope
effectively with the eradication of the "remaining pockets of the
disease."
