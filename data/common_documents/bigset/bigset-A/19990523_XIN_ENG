<P>
A research by the Women's Action Group revealed that wife
battering ranked second on causes of divorce.

divorce was that of a couple who had lived together for about two
weeks before they ended their union.

CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
held talks on Saturday with his Sudanese counterpart Mustafa Osman
Ismail on improving bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the four-hour talks, Moussa termed
the meeting as "very good and constructive," especially in
improving the ties between the two Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that "the matters are moving forward and
call for optimism."
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-Khartoum relations became tense in 1995 after Egypt
accused Sudan of masterminding the failed assassination of
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed its southern neighbor for harboring militants
attempting to topple its secular government. Sudan denies both
charges.
</P>
<P>
Ismail told reporters that progress has been made in the
security talks and cooperation between the two countries and
security officials of both sides will meet.

He said that his country began on Thursday returning Egypt its
properties seized by Khartoum in 1992, another issue which has

The disputed properties include 33 schools, 16 guest houses and

ATHENS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic said Saturday that the participation of Belgrade in the
drawing up of a resolution that will be submitted to the U.N.
Security Council and the end of the bombing by NATO against
Yugoslavia were the two preconditions for the attainment of
peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was ready to take part in talks but they feel that
NATO's bombing must end before the start of discussions as if it
was certain that peace talks could not take place in an
environment of war and destruction, he said in an interview with
the Athens newspaper "Exusia" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic described the peace proposals by seven Western
countries and Russia as "a basis for discuss."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Serb people and the country's political
leadership still had a united front 59 days after the start of the
NATO airstrikes, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 5,000
others injured.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders Emergency Wiring Inspections on Boeing 727s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) has ordered emergency tests on the tubes that
carry electrical wires through the fuel tanks on Boeing 727s, a
FAA official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The FAA directive came after workers found severe wear on the
wires and holes in the tubing on two of the jets. Mechanics also
discovered signs of electrical sparking around the wires.
</P>
<P>
The FAA ordered inspections last May on a similar area of the
727's cousin, the Boeing 737.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency also ordered similar inspections for
Boeing 747s and 767s.
</P>
<P>
Investigators still do not know what caused the plane, a Boeing
747, to explode in the United States in July 1996, killing all 230
people aboard. They suspect fumes in the center fuel tank were
ignited by electricity. Since then, they have been examining the
wiring configurations on similar planes and ordering inspections.
</P>
<P>
The FAA order gives airlines five days to perform the tests on
727s with more than 50,000 hours of flight time. On planes with
less flight time, the tests must be made within 10 days or before
a plane accumulates 30,000 hours of flight time.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,461 Boeing 727s worldwide, of which 1,081 are
operated by U.S. carriers.

<HEADLINE> Oil-for-Food Deal Fails to Alleviate Sufferings: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman
said on Saturday that the oil-for-food program failed to alleviate
the suffering of the Iraqi people and demanded a total lifting of
the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the spokesman
said that the oil-for-food program is not an alternative to the
lifting of the sanctions, arguing it has been proved that the five
phases of the program did not meet the basic humanitarian needs of
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The statement is an official reaction of the U.N. decision
Friday to continue the oil-for-food program for another six months
to help ordinary Iraqis cope with difficulties under the
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraq had fulfilled all its obligations
under relevant U.N. resolutions, thus the U.N. Security Council
should lift the sanctions immediately and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iraq following
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to humanitarian crisis in
this oil-rich country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that over 1 million Iraqi children, women and
the elderly have died of malnutrition and various curable diseases
since the imposition of the harsh U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the humanitarian situation in Iraq from worsening,
since December 1996, the U.N. has allowed Iraq to export limited
amount of oil in every sixth months to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee, or
661 committee, of suspending oil ministry's contracts to purchase
spare parts badly needed to increase Iraq's production and export
capacity.
</P>
<P>
He said that 88 contracts signed by the oil ministry in the
fourth phase and 44 contracts in the fifth phase of the
oil-for-food deal were still put on hold by the 661 committee
under flimsy pretexts.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase Iraq's production and export capacity,
the U.N. Security Council agreed last year to allow Iraq to
purchase 300 million U.S. dollars worth of oil equipment and
spare parts from the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British representatives in
the Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval of its contracts
under various flimsy pretexts such as contracted oil spare parts
of dual uses.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi oil officials said that Iraq had only received 14 million
dollars worth of spare parts so far under the contracts signed in
the fourth phase, and that no contracted spare parts under the
fifth phase which will expire on May 25 have reached Iraq yet.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British attitudes toward Iraqi contracts do not
have any legal basis, and simply aim to deprive Iraq of its rights
to benefit from its natural resources, and they aim to inflict
more harms to the country, said the foreign ministry spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Cairo for Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived here Saturday evening for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the latest developments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on prospects for reviving the stalled
Mideast peace process, especially the talks between the
Palestinians and Israel, in light of the results of the recent
Israeli elections, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit came following Ehud Barak, leader of the Israeli
moderate Labor Party, won premiership in Monday's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak's victory appears to have brought hope to the Mideast
peace process deadlocked due to the intransigent policy adopted by
the incumbent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since he
came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged during his election campaign that he would
work to revive the peace talks with Arab countries. He has more
flexible stance than Netanyahu on the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks came to a halt in December
after Israel suspended the Wye peace accord signed in October,
calling on Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, have in deadlock since early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights captured by Israel
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is a frequent visitor to Egypt to consult and coordinate
stances with Mubarak on the Mideast peace march.

STOCKHOLM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari expressed Saturday cautious optimism over the ongoing
political efforts to seek a peaceful settlement to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Certain progress has been made during talks in Moscow on
Thursday between Ahtisaari, Russian special envoy on Kosovo Victor
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
the president hinted.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, who is also the European Union's mediator for the
Kosovo crisis, told a news conference in Harpsund, 100 kilometers
south of Stockholm, that he has informed visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan about the talks on the day.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived in Sweden Friday, said great difficulties
are yet to be overcome in order to settle the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Both the secretary-general and the Finnish president declined
to disclose any details of the international peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
But Ahtisaari said he hopes those details could be announced
during the EU summit at the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
It's reported that Annan will also hold talks with former
Swedish Premier Carl Bildt and Czech Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan
during his stay in Sweden.

<HEADLINE> COMESA To Deliberate On Trade Barriers: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Elimination of tariff and non-tariff
barriers among member states of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is to dominate the fourth summit of heads
of states starting next Monday in Kenyan capital Nairobi, a senior
Zimbabwean official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Deputy Minister Obert Mpofu told the
Zimbabwe News Agency in an interview in Harare that COMESA member
states agreed to reduce tariffs to zero percent at their last
meeting in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
last June.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe had already reduced the tariffs by 80 percent
and hoped that all member states would finally eliminate tariffs
as the COMESA gears itself towards the realization of a free trade
zone by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
While other member countries are in arrears, Mpofu said the
summit will also look at ways of encouraging the payment of
subscriptions so that operations of the secretariat would not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of member countries are in arrears. We want them to pay
up to avoid inconveniencing the secretariat," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said member states particularly Zimbabwe, were benefiting
from the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA), a computer
data storage system for goods imported and exported.
</P>
<P>
The program also speeded up the clearance of goods at customs
offices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will leave here Sunday for
Nairobi to attend the summit.

LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United beat Newcastle
United 2-0 to win the F.A. Cup Final Saturday and complete their
third English Cup and League double in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United won the match with an 11th minute goal from
substitute Teddy Sheringham and a well-taken 53rd minute strike
from Paul Scholes.
</P>
<P>
The victory meant that Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson
became the most successful manager in the F.A. Cup's 127-year
history with his fourth victory after United wins in 1990, 1994
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United took control of the match soon after
Sheringham replaced injured skipper Roy Keane after nine minutes
after Keane limped off with an ankle injury following an early
collision with Newcastle's Gary Speed.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham, intercepting a pass bound for Ryan Giggs, played a
one-two with Paul Scholes, and ran on to the return pass to sweep
the ball through the legs of Newcastle keeper Steve Harper to
score.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United went 2-0 up when Newcastle defender Nikos
Dabizas cleared straight into the teeth of a United attack,
allowing Sheringham to find Scholes with a back pass and he made
no mistake with a powerful 10 metre shot.
</P>
<P>
It was Manchester United's 10th F.A. Cup win in total --
stretching their own record -- and their fourth in the last 10
years. Newcastle last won the Cup in 1955 and have now lost three
finals since then in 1974, 1998 and this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sun Moves into Men's Singles Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Sun Jun of China for the second
time advanced into the men's singles final by defeating Olympic
gold medal winner Poul-Erik Hoyer-larsen of Denmark in a semi-
final match here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shuttler, who lost a golden chance to win the world
champion two years ago in Glasgow, edged Hoyer-Larsen 15-4, 15-6
in 34 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sun will meet the winner of another semi-final match between
Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark and Fung Permadi of Chinese
Taipei in the final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While in the women's singles, Camilla Martin became the first
European shuttler to move into the women's singles final of the
World Championships since 1977 with a 6-11, 11-9 and 11-3 victory
over China's Gong Ruina Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Dannish player looked brilliant in the match in which she
lost the first set but found back her form in the next two sets,
winning the match in a dominating style.
</P>
<P>
Second seeded Gong Ruina, one of the top favourites to win the
world championship, jumped to lead 8-4 in the second set, but lack
of strength and stamina caused her first world title.
</P>
<P>
"She did not have much strength in the second half of the
second set," said Martin, who moved into the top four by defeating
China's Gong Zhichao Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit lucky to win," she added.
</P>
<P>
She will meet Dai Yun of China or Mette Sorensen of Denmark in
the final. "I am happy to be in the final, and I don't care who I
will play next match," she added.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles of the Sudirman Cup final last Saturday,
Martin lost to Dai Yun in a three-set gruelling match.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team women's singles coach Tang Xuehua said Gong's
defeat was caused by her strength. "She played quite well in the
first set,but in the next two sets, she was obviously lack of
power, and therefore she could only play rallies from the back
court," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When she was at 8-4 lead in the second set, she had chance to
win," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles final, defending champions Ge Fei and Gu
Jun will meet Ra Kyung Min and Chung Jae Hee of South Korea in the
final.
</P>
<P>
The Ge Fei and Gu Jun secured the final berth by defeating Qin
Yiyuan and Gao Ling 15-6, 15-7 in a all-Chinese semi-final while
Ra Kyung Min and Chung Jae Hee eliminated Ann Jorgensen and Majken
Vange of Denmark 15-10, 7-15, 15-10.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Appeals for Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Saturday appealed to the G8 Summit to be held next month to
expand the scope of debt cancellation and grant debt relief to the
highly-indebted poor countries, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press at Yaounde International Airport in
Cameroun, Mkapa said the G8 Summit should also look at the
conditionalities that are imposed on poor countries heavily
burdened with debts.
</P>
<P>
The president and his entourage made a stop-over at Yaounde
en-route back to Dar es Salaam after attending a three-day
African-African American Summit in Accra, Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He told journalists that the summit, the fifth of its kind,
laid emphasis on greater flow of private capital to Africa after
explaining how the environment has changed .
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mkapa told Ghanaian journalists at Kotoka
International Airport that the process of economic integration
being undertaken in the African continent lays a more solid
foundation for political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on whether there is still a political
will to achieve African unity, the president said one should not
judge this process in purely political point of view but rather
look at the need of interdependence on the economic front.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit has accelerated the pace for economic
integration and broadened the markets for goods, and provided
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of economic interests and healthy interdependence can
be a proper conduit to better political relations, media reports
quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of summits, these measures for increased economic
integration go as a necessary appendage for the process of
political co- operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meetings like this, he said, not only bears political
significance but also boost interactions of investment, commerce
and production, through which opportunities are opened for knowing
and supporting each other.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa emphasized that there still exists ignorance of
opportunities within Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president returned home Saturday night and is expected to
leave for Kenyan capital Nairobi Monday to attend a two-day Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Summit.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sierra Leone:Truce Hard to Be True </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22(Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government signed
with the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Lome Tuesday a
hardly-earned truce to be effective on May 24, which was hailed as
"the first step" toward ending "the endless suffering" of the
country.
</P>
<P>
But the heavy fightings erupted on Friday in the war-torn
country has broken the people's dream for peace and they are
preying that "the first step" could have a chance to get to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire, jointly brokered by the Economic Community of
West Africa States (ECOWAS), the United Nations and the United
States is designed to nurture an atmosphere for both sides to
launch talks on a comprehensive peace pact, hopefully could end
the country's eight-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
President Tejan Kabbah and his arch RUF rebels had agreed to
reach a cease fire and maintain their troops in present positions
before May 24.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to commence peace talks no later than
May 25 and guarantee safe and unhindered pass of humanitarian aid
to where it is needed.
</P>
<P>
But according to reports reaching here, fightings have
intensified as the May 24 cease-fire draws nearer. In the past
four days, heavy fighting caused casualties to both the rebels and
the west African peace-keeping forces ECOMOG which are on the side
of the Sierra Leonean government.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Nigeria-led ECOMOG force had been under especially
 severe attacks in Sierra Leone's eastern town of Kenema and other
diamond- producing regions, and Port Loko just north of Freetown,
capital of the tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' assaulting, geared to gain more weight in future
negotiations, also showed the two sides' fundamental disbelief
toward each other and their hesitation to make real peace.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that President Kabbah was brought to the
 negotiation table by heavy international pressures, especially
the Nigeria- dominated ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
Some commentators suggested that the presence of the ECOWAS
chairman, Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, U.N.
Representative Francis Okelo and U.S. Special Envoy Jesse Jackson
at Tuesday's signing ceremony of cease- fire was itself
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, who provides the bulk of the ECOMOG forces has met
increasingly sharp criticism at home for paying for peace in other
country, while its own economy is tottering.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been repeatedly asking the United Nations to take
over and pressing Sierra Leonean government to settle the conflict
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Without strong military back from the ECOMOG, President
Kabbah's government will find itself very hard to resist the
rebels' offensive. And it is under this context and the new
pressure from the United States, he agreed to persuade his
hard-line generals to sit down at the negotiation tables.
</P>
<P>
But from time to time, his generals are warning that the rebels
may take advantages of the period of cease-fire to rearm
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, with an eye on the diamond-rich region and a
deep-rooted disbelief in the government's promises on pardoning,
indeed stepped up their efforts to gain more land before putting
themselves in a better position to bargain at the negotiation
tables.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leoneans have witnessed too many peace pacts and too
much chaos following them, said a Freetown-based diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The people in Sierra Leone are hoping, with the help from the
international community, this peace accord to start next Monday
will turn to be a real one.

<HEADLINE> Premature Baby Survives Fall From High-Speed Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A newborn baby boy survived a
fall through the toilet of a high-speed train on the Beijing-
Guangzhou line and escaped with only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The freak accident occurred on the afternoon of May 4 as the No.
60 express train from Guangzhou in Guangdong Province to Qingdao
in Shandong Province passed the small station of Tangxi some three
kilometers from Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Aboard were Yang Zhu, a woman from east China's Anhui Province
working in a private enterprise in Guangdong, and her husband.
Pregnant for nine months, Yang was on her way back to Anhui to
give birth to her baby at home.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the train left the Guangzhou station, Yang felt a
terrible stomachache and was escorted by her husband to a toilet
on the train. To her great surprise, her baby was born into the
toilet as soon as she squatted down.
</P>
<P>
With no experience of child delivery, the panic-stricken and
screaming Yang ripped off the umbilical cord with her hands, and
the baby immediately slipped down through the toilet and fell on
to the rails.
</P>
<P>
The baby, lying in the middle of a railroad cross-tie and
covered with blood and excrement, was sighted several minutes
later by three security guards of the Tangxi Railway Station who
were patrolling along the railway. Before they could reach the
spot, however, another speedy train heading north roared by right
over the baby.
</P>
<P>
When that train passed, and the three approached the rails,
they could hardly believe their eyes: the baby was still alive
with his hands and legs quivering, and was immediately rushed to
the nearest hospital.
</P>
<P>
An initial examination of the 2.7-kilogram baby showed that his
only injuries were a small cut on the head which required three
stitches, and some slight bruises on his body. The baby has
remained in the hospital for further observation in the company of
his father.
</P>
<P>
The baby's mother was also sent to a Guangzhou hospital after
her unexpected delivery on the train.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Political Factions to Comply with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- On the second anniversary of his
election victory, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on Sunday
urged all political factions and groups in the country to comply
with the law.
</P>
<P>
"No current or faction can say it is equal to or above the
law, all must operate within the framework of the law and assume
responsibility accordingly," Khatami said in a gathering of city
and village councilors at the Azadi sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country was going through the sensitive and
significant stage of "institutionalization of Islamic democracy,"
according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Khatami warned different factions and groups against attempts
to take advantage of the "pivotal values and principles" in this
transition stage.
</P>
<P>
He said that differences of views and tastes always exist in
every society, "but the art is to turn these tastes into
identified institutions with transparent stances."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president noted that "we are at a transitional
period, treading the path towards establishment of Islamic
democracy, we should work to help the relevant institutions
establish themselves."
</P>
<P>
"We should consider the sensitivities of the transitional
period and exercise vigilance in order not to allow the free
atmosphere to be misused to undermine the people's beliefs and
the values," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 107,000 members of local city and village councils
attended the grand gathering to mark Khatami's election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, hours after Khatami's speech, clashes happened in a
student rally in downtown Tehran celebrating the second
anniversary of Khatami's victory in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
A group of hardliners attacked the celebration rally held by
over 7,000 university students, who announced their support for
Khatami's open-minded policies, particularly the policies on
freedom of expression and political reforms.

<HEADLINE> British Airways to Resume Tripoli Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) will start
flying to Tripoli in Libya from June 3 to become one of the first
major carriers to reintroduce services there since the United
Nations lifted sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The new service will be Britain's first non-stop air link with
the city, according to a Reuters report quoting BA sources.
</P>
<P>
"Tripoli has great potential as an important business market
and an emerging tourist destination, with remarkable
archaeological sites," BA's director of passenger and cargo
business Charles Gurassa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There have been no commercial flights between Britain and Libya
since 1984, when Britain broke off diplomatic relations over the
fatal shooting of a policewoman outside the Libyan embassy in
central London.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations lifted its sanctions this April, after Libya
handed over two suspects for trial over the 1988 bombing of a Pan
Am airline over Scotland, killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Stresses Importance of Promoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li Ruihuan said here
on Sunday that developing the Sino-Egyptian relations conforms to
the interests and desire of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Promotion of the Sino-Egyptian ties is also beneficial to the
world peace and development, Li, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said in an interview with Egyptian reporters.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to boosting the economic and
trade ties with Egypt, Li said, adding the two countries' joint
efforts in recent years have resulted in a trade volume of over
500 million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between China and Egypt rose by 22.7
percent and 16.3 percent in 1997 and 1998 respectively, Li said,
expressing conviction that China will become a key trade partner
for Egypt and vice versa after the two countries find new ways
and areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said the friendly cooperation between the CPPCC and the
Egyptian Shura (Consultative) Council forms an important part of
the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li underlined that China always works to strengthen the unity
and cooperation with other developing countries, a move which
he said is a basic point of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developing countries to bolster cooperation in
opposing hegemonism and power politics and to jointly defend and
maintain their legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Middle East peace process, Li stressed that
realization of peace is the common desire of the peoples in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the future Israeli government led by
Ehud Barak will abide by the relevant United Nations resolutions
and the land-for-peace principle in the peace talks with Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of the Israeli Labor Party, won premiership in
Monday's general elections. He and his party are seen as more
dovish than the incumbent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and his Likud bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader called on Barak to adopt flexible and
pragmatic policies in a bid to push the Middle East peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan arrived in Cairo on Friday for a six-day official
visit. Egypt is the fourth and last stop of his Asian and African
tour, which has taken him to South Korea, the United Arab Emirates
and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Martin Wins Women's Singles in Emotional Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Camilla Martin of Denmark
claimed the women's singles title by defeating Dai Yun of China 11-
6, 6-11, 11-10 in an emotional finish at the World Badminton
Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a European player won the women's
singles event since Lene Kopen of Denmark notched up the crown at
the inaugural world championships in 1977.
</P>
<P>
After leveling the score at one-all, Martin had a brilliant
start in the third set and led the score at 10-3.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial moment, Martin, who lost to Dai Yun in the
Sudirman Cup final after leading the final set at 9-2 last
Saturday, was impatient again and lost several match points before
Dai Yun rallied back to level the score at 10-all.
</P>
<P>
"At this time, I decided not to add point," said Martin. "And
the gamble paid off."
</P>
<P>
"Dai Yun was on a winning streak at the time, if I added three
points, she might have chance to win," added Martin. "I though my
only chance is to take one point there."
</P>
<P>
Dai Yun, who injured her thigh in the third round on Wednesday,
outplayed another Dane Mette Soronsen for the semi-final berth on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I have never thought that I can move into the final before the
championships," said Dai Yun, fourth seed in the tournament. "So I
did not feel much pressure in today's match."
</P>
<P>
She said that she did not notice there was only one point after
the score was tied at 10-all. "After I pushed the shuttle cock
outside in the last point, I even did not realize that I had lost
the match. I just thought that she had asked to add three points."
</P>
<P>
However, she did not feel much regretful for that. "It is a
shame to lose, but I am looking forward to next time," she added.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles event, Sun Jun of China defeated Fung
Permadi of Chinese Taipei 15-4 and 15-13 for the crown.
</P>
<P>
Women's doubles defending champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun retained
their title by beating Ra Kyung Min and Chung Jae Hee of South
Korea in two identical scores of 15-5.
</P>
<P>
South Koreans had two golds through men's and mixed doubles.
Hae Tae Kwon and Kim Dong Moon beat Lee Dong Soo and Yoo Yong Sung
15-5, 15-5 in an all-South Korean men's doubles final.
</P>
<P>
In the mixed doubles final Saturday afternoon, Kim Dong Moon
and Ra Kyung Min overwhelmed Simon Archer and Joanne Goode of
England 15-10, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
Next world championships will be held in Sevilla of Spain in
2001.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Offers Principle for Tackling World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Chinese leader underlined
on Sunday that seeking common ground while reserving differences,
and equality and mutual benefit form the basic principles of the
contemporary international relations.
</P>
<P>
"China sincerely hopes to co-exist peacefully and develop
jointly with all the other countries on the basis of the
principle," said Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here on Friday for a six-day official visit,
made the remarks during his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Chinese people are "sincere friends of the
Egyptian people."
</P>
<P>
He termed the Egyptian-Chinese relations as good, saying the
leaders of the two countries always exchange visits in an effort
to further promote the cooperation ties.
</P>
<P>
Li said that over 40 years after China and Egypt established
the diplomatic relations, the bilateral friendly ties of
cooperation have withstood the changes of the international
situation.
</P>
<P>
History has proved that developing and strengthening the
Sino-Egyptian relations conforms to the interests of the two
peoples, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
He described Egypt as an important developing country in the
world, which plays a key role in resolving regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
"We constantly view Egypt as our key partner in the Arab world
and Africa," Li said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Li visits Egypt, which is the fourth and
last stop of his Asian and African tour. He has visited South
Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Hold Technical Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani and Indian officials
held "technical" discussions in Islamabad ahead of the proposed
expert-level talks on the issues of peace and security, officials
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed various proposals exchanged by the two
countries regarding the forthcoming expert level dialogue," said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Acting Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad Sharat Sabarwal
and Director General of South Asia of Pakistan Foreign Office
Zamir Akran discussed a host of issues during the one-hour
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides proposed dates for the expert-level talks, which,
however, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The expert-level talks had been scheduled for late April or the
first week of May, but they were postponed after the collapse of
India's Vajpayee's government on April 27.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said last week that
foreign secretary level talks will be held after the new
government is formed in India.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the expert-level talks could be held before
the Indian elections which are scheduled for late September or
early October.
</P>
<P>
The expert-level talks will be held under the Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) issued by the foreign secretaries of the two
countries at the conclusion of talks between the two prime
ministers in Lahore in February.
</P>
<P>
The MoU requires the two arch-rivals in South Asia to reduce
the risks of accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons
under their respective control.
</P>
<P>
The two countries undertook to adopt several
confidence-building measures with regard to the strategic arms,
like advance notifications on ballistic missile tests, and steps
towards avoidance of accidental use of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The experts from both countries are expected to chalk out
details on these issues.

He stressed that the Chinese government has been firm on the
issue of Taiwan, and including Taiwan either in the "areas
surrounding Japan" or in the TMD is an interference in China's
internal affairs and will be strongly opposed by the Chinese
government and people who will absolutely not accept it.
</P>

Moore said that China has played an important role in Asia-
Pacific and even world affairs, and Australia values its
friendship and cooperation with China and hopes to hold

Moore expressed regret for the recent U.S.-led NATO attack on
China's embassy in Belgrade and his condolences for the victims

Chinese government has raised to the U.S.-led NATO, and Australia
will urge NATO to meet China's demand.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hardliners Skirmish With Pro-Khatami Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Skirmishes erupted here on Sunday
afternoon between a group of Iranian hardliners and university
students at a rally marking the second anniversary of the election
of Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
At least four people were slightly injured during the skirmishes
in Laleh Park in downtown Tehran, where more than 7,000 university
students were celebrating Khatami's landslide victory on May 23,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The skirmishes broke out when more than 20 hardliners dressed
in black tried to reached the truck where Ebrahim Asqarzadeh, a
pro-Khatami member of the newly-established Tehran municipal
council, was addressing a speech in support of Khatami's policy on
freedom and rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"Down with despotism," the students shouted to the hardliners
when they tried to attack them.
</P>
<P>
"Khatami, Khatami, we support you", "Long live Khatami
Freedom, Forever", they chanted.
</P>
<P>
The students waived pictures of Khatami and Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, the former Tehran mayor and Khatami's close ally who
has been jailed since early this month on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The students also shouted slogans against the hardliners and
called for the resignation of the Iranian judiciary head
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
"Conservatives, Resign, Resign" they shouted while Asqarzadeh
urged them to calm down and avoid clashes with the hardliners.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 anti-riot policemen rushed to the scene with
shields and sticks and managed to separate the two groups
from fighting after the organizers announced to end the rally.
</P>
<P>
Students also lined up in chains to protect themselves and
prevented the hardliners to reach Asqarzadeh, one of the nine
popular candidates for the seat of Tehran Mayor.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the rally, about 2,000 girl students lined up
and sang songs in support of President Khatami when they
started leaving the park.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said more factional clashes would be seen in
the country as the hardliners and moderates had started their
campaigns for the Majlis (parliament) elections scheduled to be
held early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting has erupted
between the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and the militiamen of
the Rahaiiwein Resistance Army known as the "RRA" outside Baidoa
town.
</P>
<P>
According to militia commanders loyal to Hussein Mohamed Aidid,
the attack was launched Saturday by their forces on the militia
bases of what they called the terrorist RRA guerrilla fighters
outside the town.
</P>
<P>
The militia commanders of Hussein Aidid also said that the
attack was aimed at dislodging the RRA men from the surrounding
areas of Baidoa town so that the town would be free from the
continued attacks of the RRA mainly instigated at the night
times. The commanders also claimed that their mission on Saturday
was a total success after dislodging the two militia bases of the
RRA.
</P>
<P>
The RRA spokesman here in Mogadishu has also confirmed the
fighting. The spokesman, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, said his men
were attacked from two fronts on their bases of El-Don and
Waranjis near the airport.
</P>
<P>
Qalinleh said his men have bravely repulsed what he called the
 aggression of Aidid's men and killed eight men on one spot at
El-Don and seven others outside the airport before forcing them
to retreat back to the town. He said his side has lost three of
their fighters and five others have suffered gunshot wounds
during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said Hussein Aidid's men have used 17 battle
wagons, 12 of which mounted with anti-aircraft heavy machine guns
and nearly 200 well-equipped infantry militiamen.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Invests More To Expand Petrochemical Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd.
plans to invest ten billion yuan through the years to 2001 to
expand its capacity to refine crude and produce ethylene and
plastics.
</P>
<P>
By then, the firm's oil refining capacity is expected to reach
10 million tons, double the current figure, and that of ethylene
may be increased to 850,000 tons from the present 550,000 tons,
according to Lu Yiping, president of company.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that China's petrochemical firms still have room for
development, as 30 to 40 percent of the petrochemical goods needed
for domestic use are now imported.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the crucial factor is to make Chinese
petrochemical products more competitive on the world market, and
to this end technical upgrading will be given priority in the
expansion process.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that the China National Petrochemical Corp. (
Sinopec) has reorganized four specialized groups centering on the
Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. and the Yanshan Petrochemical Co.
Ltd. based in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. has effectively enhanced
its acrylic fibers production capacity from 100,000 tons to 130,
000 tons by merging with the Zhejiang Acrylic Fibers Plant, which
accounts for 42 percent of the country's total output.

<HEADLINE> Israeli New Government Urged to Move Peace Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side hopes that
the new Israeli government will be able to implement the signed
agreements and move the Middle East peace process forward, a senior
Palestinian official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen, Secretary-General of the Palestine liberation
Organization (PLO) Executive Committee, told the Voice of
Palestine (VOP) that now Israel's Labor party is coming to power,
and the Palestinian side hopes this new Israeli government will
"reflect the intentions of the Israeli people and peoples of this
region."
</P>
<P>
This part of the world can no long bear wars, crises and
tensions, he said, adding that the new Israeli government to be
headed by the Labor should understand that there is no hope for
any person to live in peace without the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, he said, the Palestinians have signed
with Israel the Hebron Protocol and the Wye River Memorandum, but
yet, they have not been implemented and the Palestinians have
almost lost hope about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Memorandum calls for Israel to hand over 13.1 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians within 12 weeks after the
implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the PLO Central Council's postponement to decide
on the declaration of an independent Palestinian state in the
territories, Mazen said the council postponed its decision on
this issue at the end of April and the council's coming session
for early June may be delayed once again.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, as long as the council is on permanent
session, its general session may be held at any time and the
Palestinian leadership will decide the statehood issue after the
formation of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration of the Palestinian state has already done in
1988 and we are waiting for its implementation on ground. However,
the issue depends on the developments on the Israeli part and its
intentions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mazen urged the U.S. side to help implement the signed
agreements to move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
Labor party Chairman Ehud Barak, also leader of the One
Israel, defeated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the May
17 election. Barak started Sunday his task of forming the new
coalition government and nothing has been decided so far.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who announced to resign as the Likud chairman
following his defeat, was reportedly considering giving up his
Knesset (parliament) seat and could submit his resignation at the
Likud's Central Committee meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu canceled the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday and
did not attend the meeting of Likud ministers and Likud members at
the Knesset Sunday afternoon.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,222 kilograms of narcotic
drugs were confiscated in Iran's southeastern province of
Sistan-Baluchestan last week, a senior Iranian security commander
announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The provincial security commander Brigadier General Baser
Shabani said the drugs were seized from smugglers during
several anti-drug operations in the province, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said his forces in separate operations also seized nine
automatic rifles, 920 rounds of ammunition, three wireless sets,
and three hand grenades from the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Iran seized over 195 tons of various
narcotics during the past Iranian calendar year (which ended on
March 20).
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government started a anti-drug campaign in 1989
after the Majlis passed a law allowing capital punishment against
drug criminals.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Performance of Uganda's financial
sector is improving with closure of insolvent commercial banks, a
senior official with an international bank told Xinhua here Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Washington Matsara, managing director of Standard Chartered
Bank Uganda Limited, made the comment at a sensitization workshop
at the Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The new financial institution regulations will be put in place
very soon. With the new guidelines, the country's financial sector
will gradually be put on the right track," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank of the east African country closed the
Cooperative Bank, one of the largest local commercial banks here,
on May 20, triggering more concerns about the volatile financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's closure of more than five commercial banks
within 10 months has greatly eroded public confidence in the
country's financial sector performance. Although depositors are
assured of the safety of their money, they come to doubt more
about healthiness of this sector.

DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member delegation of the
Executive Board of the World Food Program (WFP) arrived here
Sunday from its Rome headquarters for a week-long visit to
Bangladesh to see how the food assistance is helping the poor
families build their skills and assets.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a WFP Executive Board delegation is

beneficiaries to receive a package of training and credit to
develop skills to ultimately achieve self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
About one-fourth of Bangladesh's 126 million population belong
to this group.

COPENHAGEN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ge Fei and Gu Jun became the
second women's doubles players from China to retain their titles
at the World Championships by defeating Ra Kyung Min and Chung Jae
Hee of South Korea here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese duo, who won the world championship in Glasgow two
years ago, defeated their South Korean rivals 15-5, 15-5 in a
comfortable way.
</P>
<P>
At the 1987 and 89 World Championships, Lin Ying and Guan

</P>
<P>
Sinc the World Championships was inaugurated in 1977, China has
dominated the event with eight titles in 11 editions.
</P>
<P>
Gu Jun, who is strong in back court attack, said it was a
fairly easy match today. "But we still exchanged many strikes,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"We met them twice at the Asian Games last year, so we had a
good understanding of them," said Gu Jun.
</P>

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Three Gorges Relocation Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will carry an editorial on Monday highlighting the
relocation project in the Three Gorges area in central China,
where the country is building a gigantic dam and the world's
largest hydropower and water conservancy project.
</P>
<P>
"The building of the Three Gorges Dam, a super-large project at
the turn of the century, is of historic significance in our
country's modernization drive. The relocation effort associated
with the dam area is a key to the success of the project," says
the article, titled "Ensure the Smooth Development of the Three
Gorges Second-phase Relocation Project."
</P>
<P>
Some one-million people must be moved out of the Three Gorges
area to make way for the dam, scheduled to be completed early next
century.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges relocation project, which involves 22
counties and districts in Hubei Province and Chongqing
Municipality, is unprecedented both in China and the rest of the
world. Both the Party and the government have attached the utmost
importance to it," the article says.
</P>
<P>
It hails the convocation of a two-day national conference on
the Three Gorges relocation project in Beijing last week as a "
significant event" which will have a major impact on the second-
phase relocation.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the conference, more than 100,000
residents in a dozen cities and towns to be submerged once the
Three Gorges Dam is completed have been moved out of the area in
the past six years, and most of the local enterprises have been
either closed up or moved to other places.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Three Gorges Relocation Project (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The most critical period for the Three Gorges second-phase
relocation is from 1998 to 2003, during which some 550,000 people
will be resettled," notes the article.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that some problems have emerged during the
first phase of the relocation project.
</P>
<P>
"Some engineering projects in the relocation program were
haunted by the problem of shoddy construction, loopholes remained
in the management of the relocation funds, and some local
governments didn't pay enough attention to the protection of the
ecological environment in their relocation efforts," the article
points out.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't attach the required importance to these problems
and fail to adopt effective measures to resolve them in time, they
will seriously hinder the smooth progress of the second-phase
relocation," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
The article calls on all local governments in the Three Gorges
area involved in the relocation program to unswervingly carry out
all relevant principles and policies set forth by the Party
Central Committee and the State Council, and adopt a responsible
attitude toward the State, the people, and history.
</P>
<P>
All departments under the State Council and various provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country should
also take more concrete measures to support the Three Gorges
relocation project, the article urges.
</P>
<P>
"With concerted efforts of the entire nation, we can surely
make the relocation endeavor and the entire Three Gorges Project a
success, thus realizing an ambitious wish of the Chinese nation,"
it concludes.

<P>
HANGZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China is set to draw up two
development outlines for women and children between the year of
2001 and 2010, according to the ongoing national conference on
women and children here in Hangzhou, capital of the east China
province of Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Wu Yi said at the conference that the first 10
years of the next century will be crucial for China's economic and
social development, including that of women and children as an
important element.
</P>
<P>
The proposals for the outlines in this regard have been handed
over to the senior officials present at this conference for
further discussion.
</P>
<P>
Issues closely related to the survival, protection and
development of women and children will be at the top of the agenda
in the outlines, and the development of the rural areas,
particularly the poor areas, will also be stressed, according to
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The proposals include improving women's employment
opportunities and education, and involve management and policy-
making for the social and state affairs. The health care system
and legal protection of women's rights and interests will also be
stressed in the outlines.
</P>
<P>
The outline for the children work will focus on improving
children's health care and education, better family planning, and
protecting children's legal rights and interests.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese farmers were wounded
Sunday by a shell fired from the Israeli occupied zone in south
Lebanon, a security source said.
</P>
<P>
The shell landed near two Lebanese farmers while they were
watering a citrus grove outside Mansouriyeh, a village just
outside the border zone, the source said, adding that no group has
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
But, the village was reported to be always used by guerrillas
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, for attacks on
Israeli troops inside the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
It raised to 42 the number of Lebanese civilians wounded in
south Lebanon since the start of this year. Seven others were
killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Speaker Condemns NATO Attack on Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Egyptian People's
Assembly (Parliament) Ahmed Fathi Sorour has strongly condemned
the NATO's missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Sorour made the condemnation in a meeting on Saturday with Li
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li, who arrived here on Friday for a
six-day official visit, reiterated the Chinese government's solemn
and just stand on the U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization fired three missiles
from three different angles at the Chinese Embassy on May 7,
killing three Chinese reporters and wounding over 20 others.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government issued a statement on May 8, strongly
condemning and protesting against the barbaric act of the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Through bombing Yugoslavia, the NATO is actually testing its
high-tech weapons on a weaker country, Sorour said, denouncing the
alliance's acts as hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
He termed the "human rights" that the Western countries are
flaunting as "only a political slogan and sham."
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan expressed appreciation for Sorour's views.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Li visits Egypt, the fourth and last leg
of his Asian and African tour, which also took him to South
Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Resettlement of Migrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
called on governments at all levels to strengthen leadership and
open more new channels for the resettlement of people living in
the dam area of the Three Gorges Power Project to ensure the
successful completion of the second-phase resettlement project.
</P>
<P>
Relocation of residents living in dam areas is part of the
smooth construction of the gigantic Three Gorges Power Project,
which is a key project in China's modernization drive, Zhu said at
a two-day national conference on the resettlement program held in
Beijing recently.
</P>
<P>
As the construction of Three Gorges Dam has shifted from the
first phase to the second, 550,000 people are expected to be moved
out of the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The policy of resettling rural residents in various forms will
be carried out, and people affected by the dam project are
encouraged to move to other parts of their own province or to
neighboring provinces. Governments in areas receiving migrants are
required to provide resettlers with contracted plots of farmland,
build new houses for them, and make proper arrangements for their
daily life and production.
</P>
<P>
The premier called attention to the expanded scale of
relocation, without regard to the financial ability of the
respective provinces, and urged rigid supervision of resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
In relocating industrial enterprises in the dam areas, Zhu said
enterprises producing outmoded goods or running at a loss will be
closed down, while the green light will be given to firms turning
out name-brand, new and high-quality products with a ready market,
because most of China's manufactured goods are overproduced and
the majority of enterprises in the dam areas are small, poorly
equipped, less competitive and produce heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called on leading officials in the dam areas to be honest
in performing their official duties, to serve the resettlers
wholeheartedly, and to put all relocation funds into building
villages for resettlers. Those who embezzle special resettlement
funds will be severely punished and expelled from the Party and
the government.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Vice Premier Wu Bangguo also outlined
government policies on arrangements for resettlers, readjustment
of industrial enterprises in the dam areas, improvement of project
quality, and protection of the environment and cultural relics at
the construction sites.

<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Sun Jun of China claimed his
first gold medal at world championships when he defeated Fung
Permadi of Chinese Taipei 15-4, 15-13 in the men's singles final
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first men's singles title for China after Zhao
Jianhua lifted the crown at the 7th world championships in the
same venue in 1991.
</P>
<P>
After winning the first set 15-4, Sun Jun, who lost all in his
four previous meetings with Permadi, had a flying start in the
second set and led the score at 5-0.
</P>
<P>
However, at the crucial moment, Sun Jun was a little impatient
and allowed Permadi to even the score at 5-5 and then lead at 9-5.
</P>
<P>
"I made many errors because of impatience when I was leading in
the second set," said Sun Jun. "I was forced to change my style
after I was 5-9 behind and gradually gained back points."
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun, who lost to Peter Rasmussen of Denmark in last world
championship final two years ago, rallied back to win the set and
the world crown.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit exhausted after yesterday's match," said
Permadi, who upset top favorite Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark
in a semi-final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If the final match was held in a later time, I would be fitter
for that," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles final held earlier today, China's Ge Fei
and Gu Jun retained their title by beating South Korea's Ra Kyung
Min and Chung Jae Hee 15-5, 15-5.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Launches Bio-Diversity Management Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) --Bangladesh is launching a nine-million
U.S. dollar-coastal and wetland bio-diversity management project
to set up an innovative system for preserving four
ecologically-critical areas (ECAs), the national news agency BSS
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The four areas are Hakaluki Haor, Teknaf Peninsula Beach, St.
Martin's Island and Sonadia Island.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be funded by the Global Environment Facility,
will have a significant positive impact on the long-term viability
of the country's important bio-diversity resources, Environment
and Forest Secretary Syed Marghub Murshed was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bio-diversity conservation is very critical, he said,
adding that the country has already declared six areas to be
"under threats."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Bangladesh has shown increased determination
to ensure sustainable use and conservation of its natural
resources including its bio-diversity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Environment has initiated the crucial steps
of selecting the first six areas, all within the country's highly
significant coastal, marine and freshwater wetland eco-systems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is also considering setting up a marine park and Bay
park across the coast to preserve the fragile eco-systems, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The major threats to the ECAs include excessive cutting of
mangrove, sand dune vegetation for fuel, poaching for turtles and
turtle eggs, removal of corals for sale, destructive fishing and
hunting of shore-birds, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Sliding Consumer Prices Beginning to Ease in S'pore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The long-unabated decline in
Singapore consumer prices is beginning to ease as the consumer
price index (CPI) rose by 0.4 percent in April compared with the
previous month, the Department of Statistics of Singapore said in
a press release Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The department also noted that April's CPI dipped 0.3 percent
compared to a year earlier, the 11th consecutive year-on-year
decline.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the rebound in CPI mainly to the one
percent price rise for food, the most heavily weighted item on the
index, due to more expensive pork, poultry and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The higher petrol and car prices resulting in a 0.6 percent
pick-up in the transport and communication costs also contributed
to the climbing prices, the department said.
</P>
<P>
However, housing costs sank by half a percent in April due to
cheaper household durables and accommodation, and lower
electricity tariff, the department added.

TIANJIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin International Trust and
Investment Corp. in north China Friday paid off on time another
external bond of 131 million U.S. dollars to Japan.
</P>
<P>
This was the second such payment since it settled a 84 million
U.S. dollar debt to Japan last December. The Japanese had doubts
about the company's ability to make this second payment since it
came only six months after the first bond was repaid.
</P>
<P>
Economists say they believe this demonstrates that the city's
economic development is stable and healthy by and large, and also
shows that the municipal government has given great support to the
company.

Tianjin International Trust, among the first of its kind to be
established in China, is one of ten state institutions which

meters and potential oil reserves of 29.1 billion tons, and these
reserves have been discovered in 11 sea basins so far.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec scientists note that the exploration and processing of
gas and oil could lead to other related sectors including
petrochemicals, energy, and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, four gas-or oil-based industrial projects -- a power
plant, a fertilizer factory, a refinery, and a nylon manufacturer -
- have been established or are under construction in the province.

<HEADLINE> German Delegation on Return of Nigeria's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A visiting German delegation said in
Lagos Saturday that Nigeria must furnish with solid evidence on
the ill-gotten wealth deposited in European banks before any
action can be taken.
</P>
<P>
"You are entering a democratic setting, where you have to
uphold the rule of law", told the delegation to a Nigerian dialog
party.
</P>
<P>
The revelation "shocked" Nigerians because the evidence is very
 hard to obtain, reported Sunday Times, a major Nigerian
Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as "a setback" for the incoming fourth republic,
the paper quoted an investigation by the World Council of
Churches as saying that about 700 billion francs of Nigerian's
money was siphoned out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted a story published by Financial Times of
London in the end of last year that "a former Head of State" was
sitting over 300 billion pounds in foreign accounts.
</P>
<P>
The German delegation comprising of parliamentarians and
members of Jubilee 2,000 Coalition was on a working visit to
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Lagos lawyer Bade Onimode reminded the delegation at the dialog
that "If the EU could make the release of stolen funds possible,
it will benefit itself to a large extent."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria could use the money to pay back its foreign debts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
People attending the dialog implored the German delegation to
urge Germany to make use of its advantaged position in the EU to
help solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Exporters Urge Efforts to Boost Shrimp Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has the potential to boost
the production of shrimp to 150,000 tons from the existing 30,000
tons and earn 55 billion taka (1.13 billion U.S. dollars)
annually, the president of the Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters
Association (BFFEA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This could be done through intensive farming of shrimp, Kazi
Shahnewaz was quoted by BSS news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange earned by the frozen food sector from its
exports is 100 percent staying in the country, while a major
portion of foreign currency earnings by other sectors is going
back to other countries for importing raw materials, he said,
emphasizing the need for developing the fisheries sector on a
coordinated and disciplined structure to boost export.
</P>
<P>
"It is not like other export sectors such as garments where
real value addition is only around 10 percent," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Around 10 million people in the country are employed in the
frozen foods sector, which contributes six percent of the total
export earnings, said S.M. Amjad Hossain, a major exporter of the
item. He urged the government to arrange alternative financial
support for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian country now exports 30,000 tons of shrimp and
earns 15 billion taka (309.3 million dollars) annually.

Cook also ruled out that there is any split among NATO

</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his wife Bun Rany and Co-Minister of Defense Tea
Banh, Hun Sen will pay an unofficial visit to France before he

</P>
<P>
It is the first time Hun Sen is traveling to the U.S. and

last July. His trip is expected to last more than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
According to Hun Sen's aides, it is just a personal trip. Hun
Sen's eldest son, the 21-year-old Hun Manet, has been attending
the military academy at West Point since 1995.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Observatory has
applied new innovative technologies such as weather radar and
satellites to raise the standards of its weather forecasting and
warning systems.
</P>
<P>
According to Senior Scientific Officer of the Hong Kong
Observatory Chan Chik-cheung, among the observatory's latest
initiatives is the commissioning of a weather radar last month.
</P>
<P>
"The 20 million-plus-HK dollar (2.6 million U.S. dollar)
weather radar is mainly used to monitor the location, movement and
development of rain clouds within a range of about 500 kilometers.
It is particularly useful in tracking tropical cyclones," he said.
</P>
<P>
The advent of information technology also makes possible the
extension of the weather information network and direct access by
the public at large.
</P>
<P>
Many people have cultivated a habit of calling "Dial-a-weather"
for the latest temperature and local weather forecast before going
to school, work or for leisure.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the growing number of public inquiries, the number
of telephone lines of 'Dial-a-weather' was increased by more than
40 to nearly 200 last year. The hotline is now able to accommodate
a large volume of calls especially during the rainy season," Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the increasing number of new arrivals from the
Chinese mainland, he said, the weather information on the
Putonghua channel is also updated every hour automatically since
February.
</P>
<P>
There were about 24 million calls to the hotline last year.
</P>
<P>
As the Internet is nowadays an indispensable channel of
communication in the information age, the observatory is now
considering uploading its morning television weather programs onto
its homepage.
</P>
<P>
As rainstorm is a major concern for Hong Kong people,
especially those living in low-lying areas, the observatory's
homepage runs a map on the rainfall distribution of different
districts.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash With Israeli Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of angry Palestinians
clashed on Sunday with Israeli soldiers in Der Qades Village near
the West Bank city of Ramallah, the Voice of Palestine (VOP) said
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian were protesting against Israel's confiscation
of their lands, which were used for building a road, VOP added.
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted when several Israeli bulldozers started to
pave the lands, and the angry Palestinians tried to stop them. No
casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of Jewish settlements and road constructions in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip have become a thorn issue hindering
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) issued a statement
Israel's May 17 election after its weekly cabinet meeting held in
Ramallah on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement expected a new Israeli government under the prime
minister-elect Ehud Barak to halt the spread of Jewish settlements
in the Jerusalem areas such as Har Homa and Ras Al-Amud, as well
as Jewish settlement constructions in Nablus and Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the PNA have also asked the United States side
to press Israel to immediately put a stop to settlement
construction, particularly in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The continued settlement expansion would dash the hopes of the
Palestinians that the Israeli elections had brought the
supporters of peace to the fore in Israel, PNA chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat said on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Higher Grain Production Reported in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted a higher
yield in rice and corn for the first half of 1999, exceeding the
production in the same period in 1998 by 50 and 100 percent
respectively, an official report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Philippine News Agency Sunday quoted Agriculture
Secretary William Dar as saying in a report that this was the
result of a combination of good weather conditions and government
preparations.
</P>
<P>
"So we are ending the second quarter and we are seeing a much
better performance for the first semester as a whole," Dar said.
</P>
<P>
Citing projections by his office, Dar said rice production so
far is up by 50 percent compared with the same time frame last
year, while corn yield is on track to double the harvest during
the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Due to a good harvest, Dar said, the average retail prices of
rice and corn remained stable from January to April in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said that as of April 1 this year, rice stocks totaled 2.43
million tons while corn stocks amounted to 448,000 tons in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"For the third quarter, total harvest is expected to reach 2.18
million tons, 70 percent or 900,000 tons higher than last year's
level," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to earlier official reports, the country
still has to import at least 2 million tons of rice and corn for
this year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Business Delegation Leave for Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A powerful South African trade
 delegation left here for Libya Sunday, seeking business contracts
and orders, Sunday World newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The visit was designed to "reap the rewards of the recent
diplomatic breakthrough engineered by President Nelson Mandela,
and to discuss solutions to the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) with Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
The South African delegation is led by Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin, accompanied by Mineral and Energy Affairs
Minister Penuell Maduna and representatives of sectors such as
banking, aviation equipment and services, mining, construction,
telecommunications and electricity services.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, also member of the
delegation, was quoted as saying that he had no doubt that South
Africa's diplomatic initiatives have created a favorable climate
for Libya's readmission to the international community, as well as
opening up many opportunities for the South African business
sector.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mandela's breakthrough ended more than 10
years of tension between Libya and the West over two Libyans'
alleged involvement in the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said it was important for South Africa to take advantage
of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership launched in Barcelona, Spain
in 1995, when the European Union committed itself to promoting
regional security and establishing a free trade area in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also use the visit to explore peace for the
DRC and to discuss the possibility of opening a South African
embassy in Tripoli, the capital of Libya.

ROME -- Angry Italian fishermen traveled to Venice in their
boats Saturday, threatening to block the city's canals in protest
at the government's handling of the crisis stemming from the
dumping of NATO bombs in the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 trawlers were heading for Venice from nearby ports and
fishermen said that they intended to block its narrow canals
unless Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema agreed to meet with them
and clarify the dumping issue, which has caused fishermen to
temporarily suspend their daily activities.
</P>
<P>
Alarm has been growing in the fishing sector over the impact
of the war in Kosovo, not only because of the drastic drop in
catch resulting from restrictions placed on fishing waters, but
also because of safety concerns over reports that some pilots have
been dumping their bombs on their return to Italian bases from
missions in Yugoslavia.(Italy-NATO-Protest)

<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The escalating wars in neighboring
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have derailed
the general amnesty the Zambian government offered for people with
illegal fire arms to surrender them to police, a police spokesman
has said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia quoted police spokesman Alex Chilufya as
saying here that the wars have made it difficult for the amnesty
to achieve its purpose because the wars have led to an influx of
refugees, some of whom are entering the country at various points
with fire arms thereby making it difficult for police to monitor
closely.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the Zambian government offered people
with illegal fire arms a seven-day general amnesty for them to
surrender them to the police but the general response is poor.
</P>
<P>
So far no proper figures have been given on how many people
have come forward to hand over their fire arms to the police, the
spokesman said, adding that the amnesty has been extended
indefinitely to allow those still haboring fire arms to surrender
them.
</P>
<P>
Armed robberies and resultant killings are increasing in the
country and the fire arms from the neighboring countries are
blamed partly for the escalating crimes.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 172 people died in a
deadly cyclone which hit coastal areas of Pakistan's southern
province of Sindh on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Till Saturday evening, 172 bodies had been recovered during
rescue and relief operations launched by the navy and army. In the
village of Raj Malik alone, 64 bodies were found, the local media
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Horrible scenes were witnessed after the storm water receded in
the coastal areas of Thatta district. Bodies of men, women and
children were trapped in trees and some were lying in mud.
</P>
<P>
There were great concerns that the death toll could rise
further as more people are found missing.
</P>
<P>
Ghulam Qadir Malkani, chieftain of the Jat tribe, was quoted as
saying 400 fishing boats carrying about 4,000 fishermen were still
missing.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers, battered by lashing rains and gusting winds,
had moved thousands of stranded people to safe areas, according to
army officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relief goods were being rushed to the affected areas
and packets of food items were distributed to the victims in
relief camps.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone victims complained that the authorities gave them
no advance warning of the cyclone. The authorities announced
emergency only when the cyclone had already hit the area, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Though the water was receding, hundreds of villages along the
coastal belt are still inundated while thousands of people, mainly
fishermen and their families, are prone to disease and hunger.

<HEADLINE> Over 3,000 Street-Children to Be Rehabilitated in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Ababa Administration
said it is planning to rehabilitate over 3,000 street-children and
integrate them into the society, "the Ethiopian Herald" reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mulugeta Berhe, head of the Labor and Social Affairs Bureau of
the administration, told local press that a sum of 5.2 million
birr (660,000 U. S. dollars) has been obtained from the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the government, non-governmental
organizations and the society to provide support for the
street-children who are likely to be exposed to street life.
</P>
<P>
He said that 75 percent of the street-children who beg on the
streets during day time join their families at night while 25
percent are dwellers on the streets all the time.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation effort involves construction of shelters,
provision of training in various vocations, and launching various
income generating projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total of 100,000 street-children in the country, 40
percent are found in Addis Ababa, according to Berhe.

<HEADLINE> Omani Government Revenues Fall 38 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Omani government's total
revenues was 174.1 million rials (453.4 million U.S. dollars) in
the first two months of 1999, down 38 percent from 280.6 million
rials (730.7 million dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Statistics published by the Omani Ministry of National Economy
show that the income decline was mainly due to a plunge in oil
earnings, which account for around 75 percent of the national
income.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenue dropped 43 percent to 140.6 million rials (366.2
million dollars) in the January-February period from 248.5
million rials (647.1 dollars) a year earlier, reflecting the weak
oil prices seen from early 1998 until April this year.
</P>
<P>
However, government revenue from corporate taxes rose to 3.7
million rials (9.6 million dollars) in the period from 1.8 million
rials (4.7 million dollars) a year earlier, and revenue from
customs duties rose to 5.1 million rials (13.3 million dollars)
from 3.9 million rials (10.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rises followed a hike in company taxes and customs levies
introduced by the government in the 1999 budget to offset the drop
in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from natural gas increased to 1.4 million rials (3.7
million dollars) from 800,000 rials (2.1 million dollars),
showing a rise of 75 percent, the statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Zambia President Won't Run for 3rd Term: State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
will not run for a third term of office despite calls by some
members of the ruling party, the Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD), that he should go for another term during the
2001 elections.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper quoted presidential press aide
Richard Sakala as saying that as far as state house was concerned,
there was no shift in policy or the constitution with regard to
the elections.
</P>
<P>
"The president has made it very clear that there will be no
running for a third term and however, the law does not allow it,"
Sakala said.
</P>
<P>
Last week the MMD Lusaka District Chairman Ruben Sunkutu said
the party would consider fielding Chiluba as its sole presidential
candidate if the main opposition party, United National
Independence Party, did not shelve its plans of floating former
republican president Kenneth Kaunda as its candidate. The
republican constitution allows only two five-year terms.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has made a mistake in
waiting too long to start coalition negotiations since all sorts
of blocs are forming to strengthen their positions in the talks, a
Center Party source said.
</P>
<P>
Likud's acting leader Ariel Sharon is said to be forming a bloc
including right-wing parties so as to come to the negotiating
table as unified forces.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak opens his coalition talks this week under pressure
from key members in his One Israel alliance to keep Sharon out of
both the Foreign Ministry and the treasury if the Likud joins the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
One Israel sources are predicting that Barak has already made
up his mind that he will want a foreign minister who is "neither
left nor right, but center," meaning that Gesher leader David Levy
could be going back to the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Dispute erupts between Shas Chairman Aryeh Deri and the
party's spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef over whether to join a
coalition led by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Yosef is said to favor the idea of joining the government, but
Deri insisted that it's not right for Shas to join the coalition
at any price.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian PDI-Struggle Party Starts Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian capital of Jakarta
became a "sea of red" as the most popular Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle launched its campaign for the June 7 general
election.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of PDI-Struggle loyalists boarding
trucks, buses, motorcycles and private vehicles staged rallies on
the main streets of this city of more than 9 million people,
including Thamrin and Sudirman.
</P>
<P>
Sunday is the fifth day of a 17-day election campaign for 48
political parties to contest the general election, the first
multi-party election in 30 years in the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of PDI-Struggle posts were decorated with large and
small red flags and portraits of Megawati Soeharnoputri, the
party's general chairman, who is also the eldest daughter of the
country's late founding president Soekarno.
</P>
<P>
On this fifth day of the campaign period (running between May
19 and June 4), Jakarta remains secure and under control. This
situation is warmly welcomed by the residents, including street
vendors, who returned to the strategic points around the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
When the campaign first started, many people feared clashes
might take place like that in the previous election campaigns
which claimed hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the General Election Commission (KPU) said earlier
that the crucial point of the election process would be the May 19
to June 4 campaign period, as there are likely to be some
conflicts between two or more parties. So, the government has
deployed 62,000 personnel to maintain law and order in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The local press said that in the last five days the campaign
went on smoothly despite a few clashes in several areas, but no
casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Saturday, Jakarta was flooded by the colors of
green and blue as the Muslim-backed United Development Party (PPP)
and the National Mandate Party (PAN) kicked off their first round
of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The country's 128 million eligible voters will elect 462 of 500
seats in the House of Representatives (DPR) in the upcoming
election. The remaining 38 seats will be reserved for the Armed
Forces which do not vote.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected DPR will form the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) together with 200 members nominated by the
president. The MPR, the highest legislative body, is expected to
hold its general session to elect the next president and vice
president in November this year.

<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Official development agencies have
identified about 2,000 old dilapidated buildings in southeastern
Bangladesh's Chittagong city with potential risk of collapse
causing immense loss to life and property.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong City Corporation and Chittagong Development

On The basis of an incomplete survey, nearly 2,000 buildings,
both century-old and newly-built high-rise buildings with faulty
construction, were listed.
</P>
<P>
The old buildings including some government establishments and
private residences have become dilapidated by neglect and the
Public Works Department has declared most of the buildings unfit
for use.
</P>
<P>
There are many newly constructed high-rise buildings built
without regard to safety regulations and other house building
requirements.
</P>
<P>
An official of the CDA said the organizations had served
notices but the City Corporation did noting to demolish these
risky buildings.
</P>
<P>
The CDA had also served notices to 600 owners of buildings
constructed without approval of the plan and having faults in the
construction work, but administrative, political and other
influences stalled action against the violators, sources were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many of these buildings may collapse any time creating human
tragedies, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Large Ecological Zone Set Up In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Work on a large ecological zone that
uses reeds to treat sewage water has just begun in Shouguang, a
major city in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The 160-hectare wetland zone, which has reeds growing on it, is
part of a 2,400-hectare area.
</P>
<P>
Sewage and industrial waste water from the city will flow into
the wetland zone and treated there and the treated water then will
be channeled or pumped to irrigate saline or alkaline land in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
Specialists believe that reeds can purify waste water and
related researches have shown that the operating costs of this
method of treatment are only about a tenth of those for customary
methods.
</P>
<P>
The basic construction work will cost 120 million yuan (13.5
million US dollars) and the zone is expected to have more than 30
million yuan (3.6 million US dollars) in annual returns. A
Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau source says that this
method of treating waste water is expected to be used in other
cities in China.

</P>
<P>
The seminar, aimed at medium-sized and small private

computers and electronically controlled devices all over the
world.

embedded systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Supreme Council has
called on all parliaments in the world as well as the Inter-
Parliament Union to make joint efforts in forcing NATO to halt
bombing Yugoslavia immediately and shift to a political solution
to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an appeal letter published on the newspaper "Voice of
Ukraine" on Saturday, the Ukrainian parliament said NATO's strike
on Yugoslavia has not only failed to solve the Kosovo crisis, but
has even deepened it.
</P>
<P>
It called for every political means that can be used to push
NATO towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament was very worried about a possible
spread of the crisis to other countries, which could threaten the
security of the Balkans and even the whole European continent, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter asked the Interparliamentary Conference of the
Commonwealth of Independent States to take resolved measures to
stop NATO bombing through economic, technical and humanitarian aid
to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to help the Yugoslav refugees and war
victims, the letter added, calling on the European parliaments to
take actions to curb the ecological disaster and other damages
caused by the NATO bombing.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Monks to Join Peace Mission to North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Sri Lankan Buddhist monks
will join a peace delegation to the north in a fresh bid to
facilitate the process toward solving the ethnic conflict there,
the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The peace delegation will leave for the north on Monday on a
mission aimed at providing relief and consolation to tens of
thousands of displaced people in the Wanni areas controlled by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation on its way to Jaffna, the former stronghold of
LTTE, will conduct a medical clinic for the displaced people and a
peace seminar in the Madhu area which was captured recently by the
army.
</P>
<P>
They will also distribute school books and other material, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The peace group representing the religious and national
alliances for peace on its first visit in February held talks with
top LTTE leaders and reported that the rebels were keen on a
dialogue to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a separatist war against the Sri
Lankan government since 1983 for a Tamil homeland in the north and
east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation later met Sri Lankan President Kumaratunga to
tell her of the immense suffering those people were going through
without basic needs of food, medicine and educational facilities.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga told the delegation that the government
was also ready for talks but on condition that the LTTE drops its
demand for a separate state and agrees to a time frame.
</P>
<P>
The president also said she would do everything to provide what
was needed for the displaced people through government and other
channels.

<HEADLINE> New Bridge Across Gyaing River Opened in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- One more new bridge across Myanmar's
 Gyaing River linking townships in the country's southeastern
Kayin state was opened to traffic Saturday, official The New Light
of Myanmar newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kawkareik Bridge, which is the third suspension bridge in
Kayin state, connecting Hpa-an and Kawkareik townships, is 360
meters long and 7.2 meters wide and capable of withstanding 45
tons of load.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge started in June 1997 and
completed within 21 months at a cost of 892,000 U.S. dollars plus
855 million kyats (2.85 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The first two bridges, which are the Thanlwin and the
Zarthabyin in Kayin state, were already opened respectively in
August 1997 and March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Better transport and trade in border areas of Kayin state have
benefited from successive opening of these three bridges, ensuring
a smooth flow of commodities in the region.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz has
won the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, it was reported by
The Salt Lake City Tribune Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Malone beat Miami center Alonzo Mourning in
the voting by 118 media members.
</P>
<P>
The award will be formally announced in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
Malone, who won the MVP award in 1997, averaged 23.8 points and
9.4 rebounds while helping the Jazz to a 37-13 record in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard anything," Malone said Friday. "But if it
happens, it would be a great honor. It's not my biggest worry
right now. We're still trying to get to the next round." Utah
currently trails Portland 2-1 in the second round of the best-of-
seven series.
</P>
<P>
Seven players have won the three or more MVP awards, led by
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with six, Michael Jordan five, Bill Russell

<HEADLINE> Sixteen US Fighter Jets Arrive in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen of the 24 U.S. F-18
fighter planes that NATO planned to deploy in Hungary arrived at
the Taszar airport on Saturday, with the remaining eight to follow
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The planes took off at Beaufort in South Carolina, the United
States, last Thursday and made a brief stay in Germany on their
way here. Some 400 of the 800 ground service men who would be
stationed in Hungary together with the planes had arrived here
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Defense Minister Szabo Janos said on May 20 that the
U.S. war planes to be deployed on the Hungarian soil would mainly
be used for the defense of the Hungarian air space.
</P>
<P>
However, Commander of the National Defense Forces Vegh Ferenc
said on Saturday that as the situation has been changing, the
planes could be charged with various tasks, including escorting
tanker aircraft, implementing reconnaissance and relief work and
participating in air raids against Yugoslavia. The tasks will be
subject to concrete conditions of the occasion and decisions will
be made by the NATO command, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's National Assembly passed a resolution on March 24,
allowing NATO to use the Hungarian air space and airports
unconditionally in its military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO announced its plan to deploy U.S. war planes in
Hungary on May 5, the Socialist Party, the largest opposition
party in the Hungarian National Assembly, has been demanding
revision of the above resolution and banning NATO planes to take
off from Hungary in its air raids against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Portland Beats Utah 97-87 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Portland Trail Blazers are
creating big problems for the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
The strong front line of Brian Grant, Rasheed Wallace and
Arvydas Sabonis dominated inside and powered Portland to a 97-87
victory over Utah for a 2-1 lead in their Western Conference
semifinals series at the NBA basketball league playoffs.
</P>
<P>
After matching the Jazz's precision execution down the stretch
of a tight Game Two, the Trail Blazers simply muscled their way to
an easy win. Utah looked small and slow and is running out of ways
to attack Portland.
</P>
<P>
Grant again won his duel with Karl Malone, collecting 16 points
and 15 rebounds. "That's been our force throughout the series,
going inside, being able to score," Grant said.
</P>
<P>
"Brian Grant has done a great job," Malone said. "He works very
hard."
</P>
<P>
Wallace scored 20 points. Sabonis had 15 points and eight
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Malone had 25 points and 14 rebounds, most of them after Utah
fell hopelessly behind. The Jazz had 12 turnovers against 11
baskets in the first half and showed their frustration with a
handful of technical and hard fouls.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek scored 12 points and John Stockton added nine for
the Jazz, who shot less than 39 percent (28-of-72) from the field
while committing 35 fouls and 17 turnovers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Troop Buildup for Peacekeeping in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Saturday
that it seeks to deploy a peacekeeping force first in Macedonia
for preparing peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said
this is not an ground invasion and the U.S. has not changed its
policy of air campaign.
</P>
<P>
"NATO... is currently planning for success," Bacon said of the
U.S. decision to seek a swift increase of forces in Macedonia,
near the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to get a peacekeeping force there that can move
quickly, as soon as there is an agreement that incorporates NATO's
five standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon added that President Bill Clinton has not "signed off on
any number" of the troops the United States will provide.
</P>
<P>
Washington initially agreed to send 4,000 of 28,000 troops to
Kosovo for peacekeeping but the Pentagon said earlier this week
that there needs a larger number of troops. Washington may deploy
7,000 of a 49,000-member force.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, National Security Council spokesman David
Leavy also made it clear that the U.S. has not changed its policy.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in policy... The air campaign is
making good progress. Every day we intensify the effort, every day
we see more and more signs that the noose is tightening," Leavy
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's policy making body -- the North Atlantic Council --
meets next week in Brussels to iron out details on the makeup of
the force.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said that the broad international force will take shape
later. "The key right now is working through the organization that
is considering this, and that's the North Atlantic Council."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we hope that the force will include representatives
from a number of non-NATO countries, and these countries could
range from countries in the heart of Europe, such as Austria,
Sweden," Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman anticipated that Russians would participate in
the force.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Economy Sharply Down in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian economy
registered a 4.8-percent drop in the first quarter of 1999,
entering its worst recessive phase in more than half a century,
the National Planning Department (DNP) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The drop between January and March, in contrast with the 0.50-
percent expansion during the same period of 1998, is the steepest
since the DNP started to process quarterly statistics, said DNP
director Jaime Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest crisis undergone by the country in the
last 60 years," said Ruiz, after admitting that the economy is
still affected by the high rates of interest, despite their
continuous reduction in the past months.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government is confident that the economy
will grow between 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the agriculture sector is growing very well and the
national economy will be reactivated gradually with the measures
adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said that the worst drop in the value of the production
was that of the manufacturing industry, which was 16.8 percent,
followed by the construction industry with 15.9 percent and trade
with 6.3 percent. The financial sector fell by 4.2 percent.

BRASILIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A raging storm in the Brazilian
state of Amazonas has forced 8,000 residents to flee their homes,
while 10 cities have declared a state of alarm, reports here said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rains have been falling uninterruptedly since last April in the
region, causing the biggest rise of the decade in the Solimoes and
Negro rivers, whose levels rose an average of four and seven

Some 8,000 persons have been left without a roof over their
heads in the Solimoes river watershed, while other 300,000
residents on the banks of the Negro River.
</P>
<P>
The worst case among the 10 cities in state of alarm occurred
in Benjamin Constant, where four people were drowned and 80
percent of the streets flooded.

<P>
Rescue work has been difficult because of the lack of
transportation facilities, mainly boats.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic co-operation
between China and Russia is gaining momentum as the two countries'
strategic partnership developments smoothly, "China Daily"
Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 16 business agreements signed during Premier Zhu Rongji's
visit to Russia early this year are under active implementation.
</P>
<P>
"The execution of these contracts will put new fuel into the
bilateral trade and economic co-operation between China and Russia,
" Lu Nanquan, a senior researcher from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both countries' leaders remain realistic about bilateral
economic co-operation and attach importance to such relations.
</P>
<P>
The growth of business ties between China and Russia are highly
significant for the realization of the market diversification
strategy of both economies, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian market has huge potential for Chinese goods, about
one-fourth of which currently rely on overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the current development trend of Sino-Russian
business is upbeat, Lu said. Co-operative projects in fuel, power
and timber are expected to spark the economic co-operation between
China and Russia in the future.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Takes Steps to Prevent Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government is
mulling new budget and currency exchange measures to prevent a
flight of foreign investments from the country, which is now
facing Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Central Bank President Arminio Fraga admitted that the
financial difficulties faced by Argentina are being felt in the
Brazilian markets, saying that the government must be prepared to
adopt budget and exchange measures to soften the eventual alleged
"tango effect" of Argentine financial straits.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors' speculative attacks against the Argentine
peso, which already have caused an alarming flight of resources
from that country, in addition to the tense stock market sessions
of the last days and the statements of financial tycoon George
Soros about the overvaluation of the Argentine currency have
produced a negative effect on the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro stock markets' indexes fell
Friday for the second day in a row. The Brazilian national
currency, the real, has suffered from a steady drop against the U.
S. dollar, which was sold at an average of 1.65 reals last week
and Friday was quoted at 1.7 reals. At the same time, Brazilian
debt bonds registered a strong devaluation in the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
In the two lectures he delivered in Sao Paulo last Thursday and
Friday, Fraga reiterated that the present turbulence in the
Brazilian market will be passing. In his opinion, the Argentine
economy will surmount the threat of a crisis that started with
rumors about the end of the peso parity with the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The Argentine economic team has been doing an extraordinary
job during the last 10 years of economic reforms: they reformed
their monetary policy, their social security system, their
financial system, and I have confidence in the reaction capacity
of the country," said Fraga, expressing his conviction that Brazil
will not have to face a "tango effect."

COLOMBO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has busted an
international prostitution ring involving Russian, Thai and
Taiwanese women using Colombo as their main base, police sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a raid conducted recently, Colombo police found that about
40 foreign women were involved in a highly lucrative call-girl
network.
</P>
<P>
The international call girls were operating from casinos and
gambling parlors which have mushroomed in the city.
</P>
<P>
Police detectives are now on the hunt for a Russian identified
as "Ingar" who is believed to be the main pimp in the ring.
</P>
<P>
Entering the country on a one-month holiday visa, the foreign
call girls or comfort girls began plying their trade soon after
their arrival, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police detectives said they had also found that international
call girls were operating in other cities like Kandy, Negombo and
in main tourist resorts down south.
</P>
<P>
The girls are known to be rotated and after three months
another batch is brought in, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have revealed that Colombo has been a thriving
destination for the international sex trade and main customers are
known to be local businessmen.

The Lakers are facing a clean sweep for the second straight

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Still in 'Stable' Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- "The steady growth of urban
residents'income stemming from China's excellent economic
performance has created favorable conditions for real estate
investment and consumption," said Ouyang Yonghua of the China Real
Estate Index System Office.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Bureau of Statistics, average per capita
income of urban residents stood at 1,632 yuan (197 U.S. dollars)
in the first quarter of this year, up 8 percent from the same
period of last year, according to today's China Daily Business
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang noted that the implementation of the Regulation on the
Public Housing Fund and the Regulation on Economy Housing Loan
Management has helped improve housing credit policies.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the secondary housing market on May 1 has helped
spur the country's real estate market as people can now sell their
old housing and buy new homes.
</P>
<P>
"China's real estate sector also has a favorable international
environment as the Asian economies have begun to show signs of
recovery," said Ouyang.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there was no possibility that commercial
housing prices would be pressured by economy housing, because
economy housing has its own characteristics in terms of location
and public facilities.
</P>

QINGDAO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Experts, scholars and
representatives from economic, technological development zones
nationwide have been discussing on the structures, upgrading of
industry and further opening up of the zones and other related
issues at a seminar which opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yundong, president of the Association of the China
Economic and Technological Development Zones, said at the three-
day seminar that the zones have scored great achievements since
China set them up in 1984.
</P>
<P>
But he said problems still exist in the zones and that it is
essential to tackle them promptly as China is readjusting its
policy toward the zones and quickening steps to open its domestic
market to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
China now has 32 such zones, which achieved an industrial
output value of 293.8 billion yuan last year, turned in 17.7
billion yuan in tax and earned 10.6 billion US dollars from
exports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the zones, with a combined area of some 200
square kilometers, have absorbed 50 billion US dollars in
contractual foreign investment, accounting for around 10 percent
of the total in the country.

<HEADLINE> Access to Stock Market May Benefit Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Insurance premium income should be
ushered into the securities market, which has been in the doldrums
for nearly a year, today's China Daily Business Weekly quoted Xiao
Zhuoji, a professor of economics at Beijing University, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese insurance companies are only allowed to deposit their
premiums in banks or buy government bonds. The differences between
the interest rates on savings or bonds and the nominal interest
rates of life products are the major source of income for insurers.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank has cut the interest rate six times in the
past two years, leaving the nominal rates for life policies,
standing at five percent at present, higher than returns on bank
deposits, currently 3.78 percent for a one-year term.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, insurance policies sold before the rate cuts carry
nominal interest rates of between 7.5 and 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies have been calling for their investment
scope to be enlarged to enable them to maintain and increase the
value of their premium income.
</P>
<P>
Feng Xiaozeng, vice-chairman of the China Insurance Regulation
Commission, said last month that the State Council was considering
the possibility of allowing life insurance firms to invest in
corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said it would be tougher for the central
government to give the green light for access to the stock market
as it believed that insurance companies' involvement in stock
trading could be more risky.
</P>
<P>
However, Xiao said, "It is necessary to allow part of the
premium income into the stock market, for example 20 percent."
</P>
<P>
While providing an alternative investment vehicle for the
insurers, this would both increase demand in the stock market and
strengthen the market-stabilizing force of institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said the insurance sector could play a significant role in
ensuring social stability and spreading risk for individuals'
financial assets.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of the insurance industry, which has a
relationship with millions of Chinese families, should gain
special attention from senior government leaders.

<HEADLINE> Education Loans May Pep up Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people's increasing
awareness of the importance of education is expected to help fuel
domestic demand for consumer credit, according to today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The people's Bank of China, the central bank, took a fresh step
in March by opening the consumer market to all Chinese banks and
urging them to lend more and enrich the variety of loan products.
</P>
<P>
But the much-vaunted automobile and housing loans as well as
the more recent loans for consumer durables have not boosted
consumption as expected, analysts say. They argue that the next
step must be to find a point where the consumer loan products
dovetail with consumption demands.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China (BOC) said last month that it had drafted a
guideline for granting education assistance loans and would test
it in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen. And it is expected to be launched around the end of May
or at the beginning of June, according to a manager from BOC's
retail banking department.
</P>
<P>
"The loans target a wide range spanning kindergarten education
to college education." said he.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank (CCB), which has long been eyeing
the potential market, is stepping up efforts to follow suit, CCB
sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Education assistance loans will be a new hope to address
problems in the country's education and promote China's
industrialization," said Yuan Gangming, director of the
macroeconomics research center of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Education loans are much safer for banks than automobile and
housing loans since education is meant ultimately to increase the
borrowers' income rather than pressuring their budgets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3 million high school students apply for college education
each year in China, but only around 1 million win admission. and
the number of dropouts in the 6-14 age group in 1995 was 18.4
million, according to the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
But some college students showed concern over the possible
effects of such loan. Li Jianwei from the China University of
Agriculture said that "commercial loans are only suitable for
students who specialize in computer science and other promising
majors."

<HEADLINE> Italian Fishermen Protest Over Dumping of NATO Bombs in Adriatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Angry Italian fishermen traveled to
Venice in their boats Saturday, threatening to block the city's
canals in protest at the government's handling of the crisis
stemming from the dumping of NATO bombs in the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 trawlers were heading for Venice from nearby ports and
fishermen said that they intended to block its narrow canals
unless Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema agreed to meet with them
and clarify the dumping issue, which has caused fishermen to
temporarily suspend their daily activities.
</P>
<P>
Alarm has been growing in the fishing sector over the impact of
the war in Kosovo, not only because of the drastic drop in catch
resulting from restrictions placed on fishing waters, but also
because of safety concerns over reports that some pilots have been
dumping their bombs on their return to Italian bases from missions
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On May 13, Venetian fishermen found several hundred US-made
cluster bombs in their nets as they were fishing about 35
kilometers off the port of Chioggia, 25 kilometers south of Venice.
In a separate, earlier incident, three people were injured when
bombs exploded in their fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
NATO later admitted jettisoning reportedly de-activated bombs
off Italy's Adriatic coastline without adequately informing the
Italian government of such actions and confirmed that bombs could
be dumped in six designated sites located in international water.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen of Chioggia, who mainly use trawlers and
therefore are at greater risk of fishing up the bombs, have
demanded that a "crisis body" be set up to deal with the situation
and pass on clear information to worried fishermen working in
potentially dangerous waters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO announced Saturday that it had installed a
system whereby navy authorities would be immediately informed of
any bomb dumping and the areas concerned.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Thirty nine small enterprises in
Shanghai, China's top industrial and commercial center, have been
told that they are eligible for 60.5 million yuan of loans as part
of the measures the city is taking to support and promote the
sector.

Shanghai authorities announced early this month methods which

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Keen on ISO Certificates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Enthusiasm for obtaining
internationally recognized quality certificates is on the rise in
Chinese enterprises, "China Daily" Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, over 7,000 Chinese firms had set up ISO
9000 quality systems and won certification, said Li Huailin,
executive president of the China Quality Certification Center for
Import and Export Commodities (CQC).
</P>
<P>
The center has issued quality certificates to 2,400 Chinese
firms since 1992, when it granted the first ISO9000 certificate in
China.
</P>
<P>
With 29 branches nationwide, it is the biggest ISO9000
certification institute in the country. Authorized by the China
National Accreditation Board for Import and Export Enterprise
Certifiers, a member of the International Accreditation forum, its
certification is recognized worldwide.
</P>
<P>
There are 50 to 60 such certification institutes operating in
China, including several Sino-foreign joint ventures, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The ISO9000 quality systems help the firms to modernize
management, increase efficiency and guarantee the quality of their
products.
</P>
<P>
Realizing this, even research institutions have applied for the
ISO9000 certificates and obtained them.
</P>
<P>
As many Chinese firms are trying to globalize their operations,
and since many others will have to face stiffer competition from
foreign counterparts in the years ahead, more Chinese firms will
apply for the certificates, Li predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said that his center also intended to expand its
certification business abroad.

If the restrictions are removed, it would be easier for non-EU

</P>
<P>
According to the present rules, a non-European Union player has
to be ranked among the top six earners at a club to qualify for a
work permit, which has to be renewed at the end of each season.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Property Prices to Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Prices on Guangzhou's real estate
market fell in the first quarter of this year, said today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
But, market analysts say is rather unlikely that they will drop
further in the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
The cost of buying on the city's real estate market in the
January-March period fell by an average of 5.6 percent form a year
before, while the cost of renting slid 7.3 percent, according to a
survey conducted by the Guangzhou Urban Survey Team, an
authoritative survey institution under the Guangzhou Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Lai Xiaoping, an analyst with the team, said oversupply of
commercial residential buildings and undercutting practices were
largely responsible for the price drop in the prices of multi-
story residential buildings and high-rise residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
The price of second-hand buildings for business activities
dipped 3.3 percent, while the cost of second-hand apartment
buildings went down 9.9 percent, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Lai said oversupply of new commercial apartment buildings made
it very unlikely the price of second-hand properties could pick up.
</P>
<P>
Average rentals for office buildings dropped 10.9 percent. The
cost of renting buildings for other business purposes fell 13.4
percent, and the cost of renting factory buildings and warehouses
dropped 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The analyst said that the property price is decided by several
factors, including the charge on land use for property development,
cost of building materials and labor, developers' profit margin
and charges for property management, have reached rock bottom and
further price falls would mean lower quality of property.
</P>
<P>
Lai also cited several favorable factors that are expected to
stop the trend from further deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she added that the negative impact of the Southeast
Asian financial turmoil had begun to bottom out in Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Paramilitary Claims Responsibility for Kidnapping Colombian Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Self-Defenses
of Colombia (AUC) paramilitary group Saturday claimed
responsibility for kidnapping a congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
In a message he read to a local radio, AUC leader Carlos
Castano said his group abducted senator Piedad Cordoba and
criticized the peace talks between the government and the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- the country's
largest rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Cordoba was kidnapped on Friday in Medellin, 250 kilometers
northwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing paramilitary leader lashed out at the senator
for her stance against the AUC and demanded that AUC be included
in peace talks underway between the government and leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention in the statement the condition for releasing
the congresswoman, who is a member of the opposition Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the government and the FARC resumed on
April 20 after months of stalemate.

</P>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Peter Gade Christensen may spend
the weekend in tears when he shockly crashed in the semi-finals of
the men's singles event at the World Badminton Championships here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gade Christensen, world top ranked player and first seed in the
tournament, lost to his underdog rival Fung Permadi of Chinese
Taipei 15-11, 1-15 and 15-14.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set, Gade Christensen played to his best
form in the second and rallied to level the score at one-all.
</P>
<P>
However, in the final set, Permadi tried to play more rallies
and tied the set score at 14-all.
</P>
<P>
Permadi, an experienced shuttler at 31, had a better gamble by
asking only one point at the crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to beat Gade Christensen mentally first and gave him
pressure by asking one point," said Permadi, who became the first
player from Chinese Taipei to win a medal at the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
"I am slow in speed compared with Gade Christensen, so I tried
to break his rhythm during the game," he said.
</P>
<P>
Permadi, seeded fifth in the championships, enjoyed being
treated as underdog in Copenhagen. "I tried to make myself an
underdog, it makes comfortable, as I have nothing to lose as an
unnderdog," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fung Permadi, winner of three grand prix in Switzerland,
Chinese Taipei and South Korea, will take on Sun Jun of China in
the final.
</P>
<P>
"My chance against Sun Jun is 50-50. Sun is strong, but I have
never lost a match against him in our previous meetings," added
Permadi.
</P>
<P>
For Gade Christensen, it is too difficult to accept the defeat.
"I feel sorry for the supporters, I did not live up to their
expectations," said the world number one player, who had been
weeping during post-match interview.
</P>
<P>
After the match, Gade Christensen, who went directly to his car
at the parking lot, was brought back to the interview room by
Dannish team leader Thomas Lund, a famous mixed doubles player who
won in world championships in 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Permadi played better than I did in the third set and he had
stronger mentality at crucial point," sobbed 22-year-old Gade
Christensen, winner at the All England Open Championships two
months ago.

<HEADLINE> Investment from Asia Regains Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Investment capital newly-pledged by
businesses in Asian countries to China has begun to pick up in
recent months with the recovery of East Asian economies, the China
Daily Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deng Zhan, deputy director of the Foreign Investment Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC),
is quoted as saying that the external investment capacity of
businesses from the east Asian nations is gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
The paper declined to give any specific figures, but indicated
that the reason for the investment recovery may be China's better
investment environment among the Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xueqin, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said China's investment
environment remains competitive, despite the fact that many crisis-
hit Asian countries were striving to seek European and American
investments from China.
</P>
<P>
"China's growth rate of around eight percent and its huge
market are highly attractive to foreign investors," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is making efforts to refine its investment
environment. Shi Guangsheng, minister of the MOFTEC, said that his
country is making efforts to improve rules and regulations on
foreign investment, reduce bureaucracy, and crack down on
unwarranted charges and fees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the minister pledged that China will always
protect the legitimate rights of foreign investors, whatever the
circumstances. "To absorb overseas investment is an important
component of China's reform and opening-up cause," he said.
