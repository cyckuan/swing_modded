<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Want To Reserve Oil Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than $4 billion in annual offshore  
oil-drilling royalties collected by the federal government has 
become a tempting windfall for lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation in both houses of Congress would designate about  
half the cash for states and the environment -- $1.9 billion next 
year under the Senate formula and $2.1 billion under the House 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Six states -- Louisiana, Texas, Alaska, California, Mississippi  
and Alabama -- would be the biggest winners because they have 
offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana would get the most next year, $359 million under the  
Senate plan, and Texas would finish second with $196 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But coastal states without offshore rigs also would benefit. New  
York would take in $79 million and Washington state would net $31 
million under the Senate formula. And every state and U.S. 
territory would get something. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill will improve the lives of every American,'' Rep. Don  
Young, R-Alaska, said in introducing the House measure last month. 
The Senate bill was introduced in January by Sen. Mary Landrieu, 
D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Royalties from drilling more than six miles off U.S. coasts now  
go to the U.S. Treasury to finance an array of programs. A portion, 
about $300 million annually in recent years, finances the land and 
water conservation fund, used by the federal government to buy 
environmentally sensitive land. 
</P>
<P>
	Some royalties would continue to go to the Treasury under both  
bills -- 50 percent in the Senate measure and 40 percent in the 
House version. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest would be split three ways.  
</P>
<P>
	--Both bills would allocate 27 percent to 30 states and five  
territories bordering oceans and the Great Lakes. The lawmakers say 
coastal states have special needs to fight erosion, improve water 
quality and address offshore-drilling impact. Coastal states with 
offshore drilling, extensive coastlines and large populations would 
get the lion's share. 
</P>
<P>
	--About one-fourth of the money in the House bill, less in the  
Senate version, would go to the conservation fund and for urban 
parks and recreation. Based on expected royalties next year, the 
Senate formula would allocate about $661 million to the 
conservation fund, while the House bill would provide $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--One-tenth of the money in the House bill, less in the Senate,  
would go to fish-and-game programs in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are among the most closely watched pieces of  
environmental legislation in the 106th Congress -- especially since 
Young, chairman of the House Resources Committee, and another 
supporter, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, head of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, have been criticized by 
environmentalists in the past for not doing enough to protect 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	They're winning praise by those groups now for trying to  
increase revenues going to the land and water conservation fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really like is we're going to do something,'' said  
Rindy O'Brien, vice president for policy at The Wilderness Society. 
``You've got all the right people lined up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also has caught the eye of state officials.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of people paying attention to this,'' said  
Carol Jolly, a policy adviser for Washington Gov. Gary Locke. She 
said the revenues would be useful for salmon restoration and local 
acquisition of land for parks and trails. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bills are drawing fire from private-property groups. By  
mid-February, about 100 groups had formed a new organization called 
the Keep Private Lands in Private Hands Coalition to fight the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is astounding here is that this is an effort led by some  
Republicans who are going desperately astray,'' said R.J. Smith, 
senior environmental scholar at the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute, a public policy think tank here. 
</P>
<P>
	The opponents say the government already owns too much land,  
especially in the West. Setting aside money for more land purchases 
will infringe on landowners' rights and hurt rural economies, they 
say.

<HEADLINE> CIA Trying To 'Disrupt' Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frustrated by restrictions on using military  
force against terrorists, the United States is turning to a 
lower-profile tactic. The CIA calls it ``disruption'' -- working 
with foreign law-enforcement services to harass and hamper 
terrorists around the world before they can pull off major attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Least well known of counter-terrorist weapons, disruption  
involves using new or long-established clandestine alliances with 
foreign intelligence and law-enforcement services in the tracking 
down, breaking up and knocking over of international terrorist 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no headlines when the job is done -- and no  
fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA keeps its role secret, and the foreign countries that  
actually crack down on the suspects carefully hide the U.S. role, 
lest they stir up political trouble for themselves. Moreover, the 
CIA sends no formal notice to Congress once a foreign 
law-enforcement agency, acting on CIA information, swoops in and 
breaks up a suspected terrorist cell. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to disruption is that it takes place before terrorists  
strike, amounting to a pre-emptive, offensive form of 
counterterrorism, Richard Clarke, President Clinton's 
counterterrorism coordinator, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have an opportunity to disrupt a terrorist cell that  
could potentially threaten us, we do it,'' Clarke said in a recent 
interview. ``We are no longer going to wait for the attack. We are 
going to pre-empt, we are going to disrupt, and we have done that a 
very great deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Pillar, deputy chief of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center,  
said in a recent speech that disruption focuses on impeding ``the 
recruitment, the cell-building, the moving of men, money and 
materiel and the mere maintaining of a (terrorist) presence in a 
foreign country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disruption has the advantage of utmost secrecy, hiding the hand  
of the United States and avoiding the cumbersome congressional 
reporting requirements that go with CIA-directed covert operations. 
If foreign law enforcers get rough in smashing a suspected 
terrorist cell, the CIA would have no direct control, and human 
rights organizations would have no way of identifying a CIA role. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's something major, a significant development, then  
Congress is informed,'' said a U.S. intelligence official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. ``But there's nothing formal, there's no 
monthly `disruption report.''' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. counterterrorism officials increasingly use disruption  
because other options are so few. 
</P>
<P>
	Only occasionally, and with great difficulty, do U.S.  
authorities succeed in arresting suspects after a terror act 
occurs. The United States is still trying to find perpetrators of 
the 1996 Khobar Towers attack on U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. And 
Osama bin Laden, alleged mastermind of last summer's U.S. Embassy 
bombings in Africa, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Though U.S. officials often threaten military reprisal against  
terrorists, the option has been used only three times: the 1986 
bombing of two Libyan cities, the 1993 cruise missile strike on 
Iraq and last year's attack on suspected terrorist strongholds in 
Sudan and Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, disruption of terrorist cells represents the nearly  
daily business of the CIA's new Global Response Center, a 
high-tech, Tom Clanceyesque command center on the sixth floor of 
the agency's headquarters in suburban Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Clinton administration official, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said U.S. intelligence has conducted successful 
disruption operations in as many as 10 countries in the last six 
months, mostly in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent arrest by Turkish forces in Kenya of Kurdish rebel  
leader Abdullah Ocalan is one of the rare examples where the 
disruption tactic gained public notice. The CIA and other 
intelligence agencies refuse to comment on whether they played a 
role in assisting Turkey. But other U.S. officials say the United 
States provided Turkey with critical information about Ocalan's 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Disruption entails tedious hours poring over lists of names and  
photographs of suspects. Typically, a disruption operation begins 
with a scrap of information -- an intercepted cell phone call, word 
that a known terrorist has crossed into another country, a report 
from a field surveillance team. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA might provide a cooperative foreign intelligence or  
law-enforcement service with evidence that could provide the legal 
pretext for an arrest, such as information that a terrorist cell 
crossed a border with false papers or illegal arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is early intervention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's rare that we foil a plot that is advanced enough to be  
clearly identified as a plot,'' said a senior intelligence official 
involved in counterterrorism. The aim is ``making professional life 
difficult for a terrorist group or cell.''

<HEADLINE> Software Gives Doctors 3-D View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With the ease of a youngster playing a video  
game, Dr. Sean Casey brings up on his computer screen a 
three-dimensional image of the arteries at the base of a patient's 
skull. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes about three minutes to surf through the circle of  
arteries, manipulating the image to view the surface and inside of 
the vessels from different angles as he searches for an aneurysm, a 
bulge in a weakened artery wall that could burst, causing a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability to magnify the picture makes Casey's job a lot  
easier. A radiologist, he uses the sophisticated Vitrea software at 
Fairview-University Medical Center to quickly read and evaluate 
three-dimensional information transmitted from computed tomography 
and magnetic resonance scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairview-University, affiliated with the University of Minnesota  
Medical School, is one of 10 medical facilities that worked with 
Vital Images Inc. in testing the Vitrea software now being used in 
about 80 clinics and hospitals around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey says the software allows him to do work in two to three  
minutes that used to take hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The software stacks images from the scanner and makes a 3-D  
model, which enables a technician or physician to peel back 
successive layers of an image to look deeper into the body. The 
technology also can be used to take a visual trip through the 
trachea, esophagus or colon or get a 3-D image of a shattered bone 
before surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, doctors suggested, Vitrea may eliminate the need  
by many patients for more expensive, invasive, and risky diagnostic 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 3-D imaging capabilities, clinicians looked at a series  
of two-dimensional images to imagine how the internal organs or a 
broken bone looked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the technology is so new, we're at a stage where we're  
still doing both. I think it will take a few years before the 
surgeon is comfortable with using just this,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Casey said, using Vitrea has decreased by about half  
the number of catheter angiograms done at Fairview-University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of this technology generally is to make an impact on  
a large number of patients. If somebody has an aneurysm in their 
brain, being able to go to your local hospital and have confidence 
they'll be able to perform the procedure at one-fifth the cost and 
more safely,'' said Vincent Argiro, who founded Vital Images in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began concentrating on the medical imaging market in  
late 1995 after receiving government clearance for its earlier 
VoxelView software as a medical device. Earlier, Vital Images also 
had created 3-D visualization software used in oil and gas 
exploration, seismic interpretation and reservoir modeling and 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Kach, clinic administrator of Diagnostic Radiology  
Associates of Wisconsin, sees a good future for the Vitrea 
software. His small clinic in Rice Lake, Wis., has used it for 
about 250 patients in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the tip of the iceberg of its capabilities,''  
Kach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's a surgical case, (the surgeons) have a much, much  
clearer picture of what they're going to be faced with. It leaves 
nothing to the imagination,'' Kach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact has been profound,'' said Dr. Pablo Villablanca,  
assistant professor of radiology at UCLA Medical Center, which 
expects to have five Vitrea workstations in use by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	By reducing the need for some invasive procedures, the medical  
center has cut patient morbidity, study time and diagnostic costs 
and improved treatment planning, Villablanca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers of some of the larger CT and MR scanners also make  
3-D imaging workstations, but the doctors said those systems tend 
to be more expensive than the complete Vitrea system, which costs 
about $70,000. They also are slower and more difficult to use, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of these products comes anywhere near the quality that  
Vitrea and Vital Images has. It's really a superior product. I 
think we have taken 3-D imaging to a whole new dimension,'' 
Villablanca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Harris, head of the computer-aided diagnostic center at  
Massachusetts General Hospital, had four Vitrea work stations 
installed in early January after using a demonstration system for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a significant investment,'' Harris said. ``We  
researched what we thought would be the best use of our resources 
and this is the decision that we made based on what we found 
available. It's fast. It's easy to use. It has very high-quality 
renderings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vital Images' Argiro said sales are meeting expectations and the  
company's goal is to move into the black this year. Share of the 
Minneapolis-based company are lightly traded on an over-the-counter 
bulletin board. Argiro hopes to have the company listed on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``An indication of what we can accomplish is that we have  
cracked into a layer of hospitals which have never used technology 
like this before. Now more than 50 percent of our sales are coming 
from small hospitals and private radiology clinics. We believe the 
ultimate market is very large,'' Argiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just lends itself so well to patient care,'' Kach said. ``A  
lot of companies come up with different items to be used for 
patient care and a majority of those really don't make a big 
difference on how our doctors are going to care for that patient. 
This does.''

<HEADLINE> Jasper Sunday Sermons Offer Comfort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- The first weekend after a white man was  
sentenced to die for the dragging death of a black man, ministers 
across this tiny east Texas timber town tried to bring comfort and 
peace to congregations made weary by the nation's scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate is still living and alive,'' the Rev. John D. Hardin  
assured his Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church followers. ``But 
love has already won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, 11 whites and one black sentenced John William King  
to death for the June slaying of James Byrd Jr., 49, found dead 
after he was dragged behind a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Michael's Catholic Church, the Rev. Ron Foshage spoke of  
change and forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to change,'' Foshage told his  
parishioners. ``Change our hearts and our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Foshage spoke at Saturday evening mass, King's prosecutor,  
Guy James Gray, listened with bowed head, his wife, Mary, by his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Not 20 feet away, in another pew, sat King's ailing father,  
Ronald King. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray for Bill King, that the Lord helps him seek  
forgiveness,'' Foshage said. ``We pray for Ronald King, who was so 
deeply humiliated and grieved. We pray for the Byrd family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Byrd's parents' church, Greater New Bethel Baptist Church,  
the Rev. Kenneth Lyons also used this week's events as a sermon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must agree this morning that a few months ago we had a very  
horrible tragedy occur in our town. It was an event that shocked 
Jasper, the country and the world,'' Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The men who committed this crime meant it for evil against a  
black man, but God meant it for good,'' Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Jasper United Pentecostal Church, Senior Pastor Malcolm  
Seal didn't discuss the trial in his sermon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of King's family attend the church, and Seal  
said it was sufficient that he preached about the murder right 
after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're human beings, and I'm concerned for their welfare as  
well. They didn't commit any crime. They're victims,'' Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials for King's co-defendants -- Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31,  
and Shawn Allen Berry, 24, have not been scheduled.

	Body of Missing Mass. Boy Found  
</P>
<P>
	NORTON, Mass. (AP) -- The body of 9-year-old Corey Anderson, who  
disappeared Thursday while looking for his dog in a snowstorm, was 
found today next to a shallow stream near his family's home. Rescue 
crews admitted that after four days of searching -- and temperatures 
in the 20s -- chances of finding the fourth-grader alive were not 
good. A search party made the grim discovery just before noon EST, 
police said. Rescuers used dogs, horses, boats and a helicopter 
with a heat-seeking infrared device to search woods, cranberry 
bogs, swamps and a partially frozen lake behind his home.

	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- A top aide to Nigerian presidential  
candidate Olu Falae said yesterday's election was ``completely

announcement came as officials announced that retired Gen. Olusegun 
Obasanjo, a former military ruler seeking a civilian comeback 20 
years after leaving power, had pulled further into the lead. 
Falae's accusation follows reports by international observers of 
ballot box-stuffing and other serious voting irregularities.

	Iraqi Sites Attacked by US Fighters

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. jets today fired on Iraqi defense sites  
after being attacked by Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. The Air Force 
F-15 fighters fired three air-to-ground missiles and dropped eight 
bombs on targets mostly around the city of Mosul, about 250 miles 
north of Baghdad, a U.S. military spokesman said. U.S. officials 
hope the bombings can encourage unrest in Iraq by portraying 
President Saddam Hussein as hapless and cornered, unable to defend 
his own territory and a danger to his own people.

	Working Mom Absences Said Unharmful

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children of women who work outside the home  
are not significantly harmed by their mother's absence, according 
to a study that evaluated the development and health of more than 
6,000 youngsters. The study by Elizabeth Harvey, a psychologist at 
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, published in the March 
issue of the journal Developmental Psychology, came to a different 
conclusion than some earlier studies of the same group of children. 
The new work examined the children at a later age, 12 years old. 
One observer said the study suggests that ``hours spent away from 
home (are) not as important as the quality of parenting.''

	Japan Conducts Heart Transplant  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A man in his 40s was the recipient of the first  
heart transplant in Japan in three decades today. Japan had 
effectively banned such procedures because a person couldn't be 
declared dead until the heart had stopped. That made it impossible 
to transplant the heart, liver and some other organs. But a 
controversial law passed in 1997 changed that. A 44-year-old woman 
was the first person declared brain dead since the law was passed. 
Japan's only heart transplant was done about 30 years ago, and it 
prompted criminal investigations, although the surgeon was never 
indicted.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Doctors say Boris Yeltsin's stomach pains have  
abated and minor bleeding in his stomach has been stopped, but that 
he will remain in the hospital for about a week. The ailing Russian 
president was readmitted yesterday for further treatment of an 
ulcer for which he was hospitalized two weeks last month. The 
68-year-old has had myriad health problems in the last three years 
since heart bypass surgery, raising doubts about his ability to 
complete his term, which ends next year.

Lebanese guerrillas detonated two bombs near an Israeli convoy. The 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for the

1985 in a bid to protect its northern territory from cross-border

<HEADLINE> New Crosswalk Signals Count Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOMERVILLE, Mass. (AP) -- You're on foot, running late and the  
crosswalk sign starts flashing ``Don't Walk.'' Cars are lined up at 
the busy intersection, drivers anxiously waiting for their light to 
turn green. 
</P>
<P>
	If only you knew exactly how much time you had before the cars  
zoom off the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Now you do.  
</P>
<P>
	New crosswalk countdown signs are telling pedestrians exactly  
that in communities in Florida, Colorado and Connecticut, as well 
as Somerville and two other Massachusetts towns. 
</P>
<P>
	When the traffic light turns red, pedestrians get their turn to  
move with an image of a walker and a 20-second countdown that 
flashes ``20-19-18 ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Johnson, acting director of the Somerville department of  
traffic and parking, said she decided to install one of the signs 
after seeing them in Canadian cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people feel they don't have enough time to cross and some  
of them get upset when the 'Don't Walk' starts to flash,'' Johnson 
said. ``They don't know whether they should try to get across or 
whether they should turn back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $550 signals by Tassimco in Terre Bonne, Quebec, have been  
particularly popular in Massachusetts, where drivers are aggressive 
and busy intersections baffle motorists and pedestrians alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything helping pedestrians will be useful,'' said Nancy  
Wright, a Somerville resident waiting to cross a multiple-street 
intersection.. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado has installed the signals in Aspen and Grand Junction.  
</P>
<P>
	``The countdown signs are self-explanatory. It's one of the best  
things I've ever done in this job,'' said Jim Nall, a traffic 
engineer for the Colorado Department of Transportation.

<HEADLINE> Jones Hopes To Forget Offseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- The fans still chant his name and clamor  
for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chipper Jones' squeaky clean image took a big hit during the  
offseason, when the Atlanta Braves third baseman admitted to having 
an illegitimate child and split up with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones admittedly was worried about the reception he would  
receive when he arrived for the Braves' spring training at that 
most wholesome of places, Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wonder if people are going to have the same reaction. Will  
they look at you the same?'' said Jones, one of the team's popular 
players, a three-time All Star with a career average of .313 and 
three straight 100-RBI seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, what I went through was very disappointing to a lot  
of people. But nobody is perfect. Hopefully, I will learn from 
these mistakes and be a better person down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Jones admitted to being the father of an  
illegitimate child and publicly apologized to his wife, Karin, and 
Braves fans. Jones vowed to work hard to restore his marriage, but 
moved out of the couple's home two weeks later. They have since 
filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Kehl of Brownsburg, Ind., attended a recent Braves  
workout along with her husband and their two small children. 
Afterwards, 6-year-old Taylor walked away with a bat and 8-year-old 
Jordan was clutching a bat, both items signed by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know about his personal life or the whole story from  
his viewpoint,'' Kehl said. ``But seeing his reaction to the fans, 
how he stayed out here longer than any other person today, I think 
that's impressive.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Kehl and her husband, Kenny, have warned their children against  
idolizing professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, they're just human,'' she said. `There's something  
about being a kid and getting an autograph that's exciting, but we 
try to keep it at that level. As long as they keep it at that level 
and we don't allow them to take it too far, then I think it's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kehl believes the fans will be willing to forgive Jones for his  
off-the-field problems. Jordan nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to judge someone till you've walked in their shoes  
and know exactly the whole situation,'' Kehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has some regrets about going public with his confession of  
infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it I had my druthers now, I would rather have not  
gone through that,'' he said. ``On the flip side, when I was 
keeping it private, keeping it hidden, it was a huge weight on my 
shoulders. It felt a lot better to get it off my shoulders, get it 
out in the open, show people I was genuinely sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Jones took part in a segment on the Braves' radio  
pregame show called ``Ask Chipper,'' in which kids peppered him 
with questions ranging from how to play third base to how he met 
his wife. All along, he was covering up the shame in his personal 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, echoing the line from Charles Barkley, Jones doesn't  
believe it's proper to use his entire life as a model for how 
others should live. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going about my business on the field the same way I always  
have,'' he said. ``But from this day forward, I'm not going to be 
perfect. And neither is anybody else. Nobody knows what it's like 
to be me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones maintained most of his endorsement contracts -- Wendy's was  
the only company to cut ties -- and bulked up during the offseason, 
adding about 20 pounds of weight and muscle. He wants to avoid the 
subpar finishes -- he is just a .256 hitter in September and October 
-- that have plagued his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``In September, I usually throw out an anchor,'' Jones said.  
``Hopefully, gaining some weight and getting stronger will keep me 
from hitting the wall, play through it and be more consistent. I'd 
like to hit .300 every month of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also is entering the final year of a four-year, $8.75 million  
contract, which makes him one of baseball's best bargains. Though 
the Braves have an option for 2000 that could pay him up to $4.25 
million, there have been talks on a long-term deal that would bring 
Jones' salary in line with other superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've done a lot for this organization, made them a  
lot of money,' Jones said. ``I bit the bullet signing my first 
contract, but that was my choice. No one forced me to sign that. 
But I'm not going to bite the bullet again.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Want Pennant-Type Pitcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Don't count on the Chicago Cubs acquiring a  
big-name, high-priced pitcher unless he could push them over the 
top during a pennant race, team president Andy MacPhail said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That type of acquisition is not beyond our realm, but it's  
more likely to happen if we are in the race and maybe the contract 
lasts a year or two as opposed to signing a 34-year-old player to a 
seven-year contract for $105 million,'' MacPhail said, referring to 
the Dodgers' deal with Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's Aug. 15 and you are two games, three games or four  
games in front and you can make a trade and take on a guy at $8 
million to finish up the year -- go. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs, who made the playoffs last year for the first time  
since 1989, decided to bring back most of their own free agents and 
their payroll will increase from $49 to $60 million this season 
with a veteran team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have a kind of bias, we like to reward our own guys,''  
MacPhail said. ``All things being equal, if we think we are just as 
good a team with a guy we had last year as opposed to paying the 
same or a little bit more for a guy who wore another uniform, we're 
predisposed to bring our guy back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took some chances with our right fielder and that seems to  
have worked out for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be National League MVP Sammy Sosa, whom the Cubs  
signed to a four-year, $42.5 million deal in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Cubs' next deals could be with pitcher Kerry Wood.  
General manager Ed Lynch wants it done before the beginning of 
exhibition games this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, the NL rookie of the year who struck out 20 batter in a  
game last season, made the major league minimum of $170,000 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody who has ever seen Kerry pitch would think for a minute  
he doesn't have the potential to be something very special,'' 
MacPhail said. ``The only question on Kerry is going to be his 
durability. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean you don't do a multi-year deal if you  
can satisfy both parties. We want certain protections and they are 
going to want things they feel like they have to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacPhail said there are no major changes planned for historic  
Wrigley Field that was built in 1914, even as more modern parks pop 
up all over baseball. The Cubs drew 2.6 million at home last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrigley Field is a special place and we know it. It provides  
us with some insulation when you have a lousy year,'' MacPhail 
said.

<HEADLINE> Gant Takes Swings With Phillies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- It didn't take Ron Gant long to make his  
presence felt with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	He came out swinging, at more than baseballs. Tony La Russa can  
attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant's arms still surge with strength, producing the compact  
swing that made him a power-hitting terror with the Atlanta Braves. 
Not long after ripping his first pitch over the fence for his third 
team in the post-Atlanta era, Gant let the Phillies know that he's 
here to do much more than hit. 
</P>
<P>
	First, when Phillies batting coach Hal McRae told the regulars  
that running after batting practice was optional, Gant barked, 
``We're running.'' From that day on, a dozen teammates follow Gant 
around the training complex like a bunch of ducklings dressed in 
red. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's put in his time in the game,'' third baseman Scott Rolen  
said. ``It's a calming, settling feeling having him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gant ripped La Russa, his former manager in St. Louis, for  
his quirky lineups and alleged mistreatment of players. Some took 
the accusations to be laden with racial overtones because all the 
players Gant mentioned were black. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rickey Henderson didn't like him, Royce Clayton didn't like  
him,'' Gant said. ``He treated Ozzie Smith like dirt. Brian Jordan 
didn't like him. I don't know too many people who did like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, for one, responded that Gant was exaggerating and  
expressed anger for having his name thrown into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	But the feud continued for several days, with Gant apologizing  
and La Russa saying he wanted to talk with him and clear the air. 
That never happened, and Gant wants to drop the whole thing and 
concentrate on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've both put it behind us,'' Gant said. ``He's got a job to  
do, and I've got a job to do. It's over, all gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant's saga of comebacks, letdowns and re-emergence never seems  
to end. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed his disastrous .177 average with the Braves in 1989  
with consecutive 30-homer, 30-steal seasons in 1990 and '91. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the dirt-bike accident on Feb. 3, 1994, that left  
Gant with multiple compound fractures in his right leg and forced 
him to miss the season. The Braves released him the following 
spring -- one week after he signed a $5.5 million, one-year contract 
that wasn't guaranteed. It left him with a feeling of betrayal that 
he's finally coming to terms with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent a lot of great, great years in Atlanta,'' said Gant,  
who still lives there. ``They were just tremendous years -- NL 
championships and going to World Series and playing on those great 
teams. That's always a part of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant made a successful comeback with the Reds in 1995, with 28  
homers, 88 RBIs and 23 steals. The Cardinals signed him to a $25 
million, five-year contract, but Gant had only one good year in St. 
Louis, hitting 30 homers in '96. He batted .229 with 162 strikeouts 
in 1997, having arthroscopic surgery on his knee after the season, 
and was limited to 383 at-bats with hamstring injuries last year. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa brought up Gant's lack of productivity during their  
feud. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was whiff, whiff, whiff,'' La Russa said. ``I really hope  
he goes to Philly and whiffs for them like he whiffed for us, and 
we'll see what excuse he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant only ended up with the low-budget Phillies because St.  
Louis agreed to pay about $5 million of the $11 million that the 
outfielder is due in the last two years of his contract. The 
Phillies hope Gant can return to the 30-homer, 80-plus RBI 
territory that is nearly automatic when he's healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, that's been the problem. Gant, who turns 34 this week,  
has added an intense stretching regimen and martial arts to the 
weightlifting that makes him look like a bodybuilder. He hopes it 
keeps him from breaking down again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like so far this spring, I haven't had to compensate  
for the surgery that I had on my knee. I feel like it's healed 
now,'' Gant said. ``I'm able to go after balls in the outfield 
without having to think or protect my knee. Therefore, my 
hamstrings feel a lot healthier and a lot stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No longer overshadowed by power hitters like David Justice or  
Fred McGriff in Atlanta or Mark McGwire in St. Louis, Gant now has 
a chance to do the talking with his bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that people know what type of player I am,'' Gant said.  
``I don't really have anything to prove to anybody but myself.''

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Jews Protest Court Rulings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 25,000 Orthodox Jews prayed in the pouring  
rain Sunday to protest recent political developments in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound of Biblical psalms chanted in Hebrew echoed through  
the canyons of lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orthodox faithful rode by bus from as far away as Baltimore,  
but the majority came from Brooklyn to protest Israeli supreme 
court rulings that could reduce Orthodox influence over everyday 
activities in the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no speeches at the vigil, just a sea of bearded men  
in black hats and coats, standing separately from thousands of 
modestly dressed women reciting prayers in the various traditions 
of Syrian, Lithuanian, Polish and other Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Police watched the gathering that clogged streets over a  
12-block area, but did not interfere. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, 200,000 Orthodox Jews protested in Jerusalem over  
the same grievances -- among them a recent Israeli supreme court 
edict that could allow seminary students to be drafted, and another 
challenging Orthodox control of marriage, burial and Sabbath 
travel.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Near Second Sale in Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Lightning owner Art Williams,  
facing financial losses and mounting frustration less than a year 
into ownership, said he has reached agreement to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	A sale to a group headed by Michigan billionaire William  
Davidson, which Williams outbid for the team 10 months ago, could 
take place as soon as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a verbal agreement on everything,'' Williams told  
the St. Petersburg Times. ``I just don't see it breaking down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported the purchase price to be about $115  
million, some $2 million less than what Williams paid last year 
when he bought the debt-burdened NHL team last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson owns an entertainment empire that includes the NBA's  
Detroit Pistons, the WNBA's Detroit Shock, the International Hockey 
League's Detroit Vipers, the Palace of Auburn Hills arena in 
suburban Detroit and the nearby Pine Knob Music Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson last year made a contingency-burdened offer to buy the  
Lightning from Japanese holding company Kokusai Green and was 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in it for the long haul,'' said Tom Wilson, president of  
the Pistons and the Davidson-owned Palace Entertainment Group. 
``We're not coming in to fail. We're coming in to make this team a 
thing Tampa can be proud of, and a benchmark franchise in the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No major changes are planned in the Lightning's hockey  
operations, where Jacques Demers is coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams saved the Lightning from possible bankruptcy and  
eventual collapse with his no-strings-attached bid of $117 million. 
The purchase included the Lightning's lease to the Ice Palace and a 
nearby parcel of undeveloped real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams cleared the 8-year-old franchise of debt, but has  
incurred self-projected losses of up to $20 million as the 
last-place team struggled on the ice and at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lightning, with a record of 13-41-5, has an average  
announced home attendance this season of 10,894 -- barely more than 
half of the Ice Palace capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an amount in my mind that I could afford to lose over  
four, five seasons,'' Williams said, ``and I lost that amount in 
(less than) one season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Georgia high school football coach grew weary of the  
Lightning's ineptness. Unfamiliarity with hockey only amplified his 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination,'' he said, ``of losing the money, and  
losing the games, and thinking over all those months, `You know 
what? This ain't fun.'''

<HEADLINE> Convicted Minister Leads Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- One day after being convicted of  
state racketeering charges, the Rev. Henry Lyons quietly led Sunday 
morning services at his church and then went to the funeral of a 
grandmother who helped raise him. 
</P>
<P>
	The once-influential and rousing religious leader faces months  
of legal and political battles, with the National Baptist 
Convention USA considering whether to oust him as president and 
federal prosecutors gearing up for their own trial against the 
minister next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to sit down with my deacons and with my wife and with  
my family and see what we're going to do,'' Lyons quietly told 
reporters after jurors found him guilty Saturday of racketeering 
and grand theft. ``I'll be doing some praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was his only comment to reporters as he left the courthouse  
and headed back to his congregation at Bethel Metropolitan Church 
in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters were barred from church grounds Sunday and  
parishioners refused to comment. But church officials -- who 
wouldn't discuss the verdict or its implications -- said Lyons 
conducted morning services before leaving for his grandmother's 
funeral at Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnie Lyons, 81, died as the five-week racketeering and grand  
theft trial against Lyons and a co-defendant wound to a close last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, free on bail until his still-unscheduled sentencing,  
faces three to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He once was best known as a rousing preacher, sometimes  
interrupting his own sermons by shouting ``I'm doing some preaching 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His pleas from pulpits across the country helped greatly reduce  
the $5.4 million debt the convention accrued while building new 
headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., before he was elected president 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the church, he wielded political clout as leader of a  
group that claimed to have 8.5 million members -- the largest black 
church organization in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	That influence reached members of Congress and President  
Clinton, who spoke at convention meetings and called Lyons for 
advice when 1996 riots erupted in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything changed when fire broke out in a waterfront house  
Lyons owned with another woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' wife, Deborah, said she set fires inside the $700,000  
mansion after finding a deed in her husband's briefcase showing he 
owned it with Bernice Edwards, the convention public relations 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire spurred state and federal prosecutors to follow the  
trail of Lyons' money, eventually accusing him and Ms. Edwards of 
stealing more than $4 million from corporations that wanted to sell 
cemetery products, life insurance policies and credit cards to 
convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	The membership figure was a hoax and the convention may have  
closer to 1 million members, the government said. The pair duped 
the companies by promising a membership mailing list that did not 
exist, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was acquitted of racketeering, the sole charge she  
faced. 
</P>
<P>
	But she and Lyons both still face trial in federal court -- he on  
54 counts of tax evasion, extortion, money laundering and fraud; 
she on 27 similar counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Stuart Cureton of Greenville, S.C., said he expected  
the convention's board of directors to meet this week to discuss 
Lyons' conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not clear how the board might proceed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had this experience before,'' said Cureton, the  
convention's vice president at large and potential successor to 
Lyons.

<HEADLINE> Banshee Breeze Wins Rampert Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Banshee Breeze, the Eclipse Award winner  
as last year's top 3-year-old filly, made her 4-year-old debut a 
successful one Sunday with a 5 1/2-length victory in the $200,000 
Rampart Handicap at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jerry Bailey, Banshee Breeze put away Glitter Woman in  
the final furlong to outrun the five-horse field in a time of 1:42 
4-5 over the 1 1-16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze, the 3-5 favorite, returned $3.20, $2.10 and  
$2.10 for her seventh career victory. Glitter Woman paid $2.20 and 
$2.10, and Timely Broad finished another four lengths back and paid 
$2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight horses were entered, but two early scratches reduced the  
field to six. That included Harpia, who had won five straight since 
returning to the United States from France but came down Sunday 
with a sinus infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Angel of a Mom also had to be scratched when she ran off during  
warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze, carrying the top weight of 122 pounds, was  
making her first start since losing by a nose to Escena in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff last November. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Body of Missing Mass. Boy Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTON, Mass. (AP) -- The body of a 9-year-old boy who  
disappeared while looking for his dog in a snowstorm was found 
Sunday by a shallow stream about 300 yards from his family's home, 
in an area that had been searched several times before. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Corey Anderson was found curled in a ball in dense  
underbrush along the banks of an icy brook after the stripes from 
his Boston Bruins jacket caught a searcher's eye, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the boy would be in such a spot -- with growth so  
thick an adult would have to crawl on hands and knees to enter -- 
Massachusetts State Police Trooper Paul Hartley's voice cracked as 
he responded: ``He got lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews in canoes made the discovery shortly before noon on  
the bank of Mulberry Brook. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth time the area had been searched. But police  
said the body was only visible from the creek, and snow that had 
obscured the body may have melted. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared the boy was trying to stay out of the waters of the  
swamp next to the creek when he died, Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not believe Corey drowned, but were unsure  
of the cause of death. An autopsy was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey's parents and young sister did not immediately comment,  
but through the police thanked those who helped in the search. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to them,'' said State Police Lt. Paul  
Maloney. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance during a fierce snowstorm received national  
attention as hundreds of searchers combed the boy's neighborhood, 
hoping against growing odds to find the boy alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers used dogs, horses, boats and a helicopter with a  
heat-seeking infrared device to search woods, cranberry bogs, 
swamps and a partially frozen lake behind his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey was dressed warmly, wearing two jackets, a sweater and  
fur-lined boots when he left his house Thursday during a storm that 
dumped 7 inches of snow in the area. He was looking for a golden 
retriever mix named Jasmine that had bolted from the house earlier. 
The dog turned up an hour later in a neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy suffered from attention deficit disorder and had missed  
some doses of medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey's parents made tearful appearances on the evening news  
when the boy vanished. By Saturday morning, the couple was secluded 
in their home. They had no comment Sunday after the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to them ... given the sad, sad situation,''  
Maloney said.

<HEADLINE> Match Play Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Seven birdies in 14 holes were the magic  
numbers for John Huston, who beat Steve Pate 5 and 4 to win the 
consolation final of the $5 million Andersen Consulting Match Play 
Championship on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was pretty close to the best golf I played all week,''  
said Huston, who won $400,000 for finishing third. Pate got 
$300,000 for finishing fourth in the field of 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Huston got off to a fast start with a 15-foot birdie putt on No.  
1, and also birdied the second hole for a 2-up lead. Pate won the 
third hole, but Huston said the key came on No. 4. Pate holed a 
50-footer across the green, and Huston sank a 20-footer for birdie, 
as well, ``right on top of him. That was a big one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huston, who was 4-up at the turn, closed it out when Pate  
bogeyed 13 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play too badly, but it was disappointing to bogey the  
last two holes we played,'' Pate said. ``He was definitely in 
control all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Pate and Huston said they enjoyed the match play format.  
After a week of upsets, Huston was the second highest seed left 
playing during the weekend, 27th. Champion Jeff Maggert was the 
24th seed, runner-up Andrew Magee was 50th and Pate 61st. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MILLION-DOLLAR MAGGERT:* Maggert's championship match victory  
over Magee, secured with a dramatic chip shot for birdie on the 
38th hole, was worth $1 million and moved him to the top of the PGA 
Tour money list at $1,296,060. He earned a three-year exemption on 
the PGA Tour and a spot in next year's Mercedes Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 runner-up finishes in his and just one win -- which came  
5 1/2 years ago -- Maggert said the victory was more important than the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been sitting up here talking about second too many  
times,'' he said at his post-match news conference. ``I needed to 
win for me, myself and I.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MAGEE &AMP; MONEY:* Magee, on the other hand, had said after the  
semifinals on Saturday that the $1 million first prize was a 
motivating factor. He said he was thinking about the money all day 
Sunday, but that it had nothing to do with the outcome. He gets 
$500,000 nearly double his previous biggest check of $270,000 for 
winning the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee was asked if the week's match play experience made him any  
more interested in playing on the Ryder Cup team, which competes 
for pride, not money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can play for trophies, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UPSETTING WEEK:* Maggert knocked out two top-10 players on his  
road to the championship, beating No. 1 Tiger Woods in the 
quarterfinals on Friday and No. 9 Nick Price in the second round. 
The highest seed Magee beat was No. 15 Darren Clarke. Second-seeded 
David Duval was in Magee's bracket but was knocked off by Bill 
Glasson in the second round. Magee then beat Glasson in the third 
round. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOLING OUT:* The finalists played a total of 253 holes during  
six rounds over five days. Maggert played 127 and Magee 126. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EXCITING FINISH:* Even if ABC-TV didn't get the marquee final  
matchup it wanted (no Tiger Woods, David Duval, Ernie Els, Mark 
O'Meara, etc.), it at least got two extra holes and a dramatic 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The finals of the last three Andersen Consulting World  
Championships all went down to the last hole. Unlike this 
tournament, where 64 of the world's top golfers gathered in one 
place, those championships featured qualifiers in different parts 
of the world, culminating with a two-day Final Four in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FUTURE SCHEDULE:* The Match Play Championship returns to La  
Costa on Feb. 23-27, 2000. It will move to Victoria, Australia, in 
2001, then come back to La Costa in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Rock Group's Concert Raises $13,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A free concert given by country rock  
group Sawyer Brown raised more than $13,000 to benefit victims of 
the Jan. 22 tornadoes that ravaged this city. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 people attended Friday's performance at Austin Peay  
State University, which also sustained significant storm damage. 
University officials manned collection bins, where concertgoers 
contributed everything from loose change to $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``God has blessed this town,'' said lead singer Mark Miller.  
``Sometimes he lets us know you can knock down buildings, but you 
can't kill the human spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the band was inspired to help after seeing accounts  
of the tornadoes. The damage was extensive but no one was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer Brown's hits include ``Some Girls Do,'' ``All These  
Years'' and ``Thank God for You.''

<HEADLINE> Common Signs of Inhalant Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Almost all products inhaled to produce euphoria work on the  
nervous and circulatory systems in a way similar to the depressing, 
slowing effects of anesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
	Varying with the amount inhaled, the user can experience slight  
stimulation, a feeling of reduced inhibition, loss of consciousness 
or cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say inhalant use is frequently linked to teen-agers'  
problems in school -- failing grades, chronic absences and general 
apathy. 

</P>
<P>
	Other signs include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Paint or stains on body or clothing

<HEADLINE> Clintons Relax at Utah Ski Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- President Clinton relaxed at a borrowed  
mountaintop home Sunday as his wife, Hillary, and daughter, 
Chelsea, went skiing on a brilliantly sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady and Chelsea were spotted on the slopes by  
photographers and cameramen. Mrs. Clinton was overheard expressing 
irritation to Secret Service agents about someone who had skied too 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons had a private dinner and a birthday cake Saturday  
night for Chelsea as she turned 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are staying at the posh home of Hollywood producer  
Jeffrey Katzenberg, who lent the president his gated, 
multimillion-dollar estate in the Deer Valley Resort. Katzenberg 
has several intermediate ski runs just off his backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family arrived Saturday and are staying until Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton does not ski. He tried it once 15 years ago in Sun  
Valley, Idaho, where he took repeated tumbles and finished the day 
with torn ligaments in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he planned to spend the long weekend reading  
and might make a trip into town for coffee. ``He's at home,'' 
spokesman Barry Toiv said. ``I suspect he's doing exactly what he 
said he was (going to do), which is reading. Work is low on the 
totem pole today as far as his priorities. He's on vacation, and it 
happens to be Sunday as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Clinton gets a national security report every day but  
Sunday, but that a national security official was on standby if the 
president requires a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	During last year's skiing vacation, the president strolled Park  
City's Main Street, shaking hands and visiting the historic jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, co-partner with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in  
DreamWorks SKG, is a big donor to Clinton and other Democrats. The 
former Walt Disney Co. studio chief is a frequent guest at the 
White House. Clinton has stayed at his home in Malibu, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Owners: Expos To Stay in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- The ownership group of the Montreal Expos  
remains optimistic it will be able to keep the team in Canada, its 
chairman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	L. Jacques Menard said the partnership committee did not believe  
a March 6 deadline set by baseball was ``written in stone.'' That 
is the date that baseball declined to extend Friday for having a 
new ownership group and stadium financing in place in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe baseball wants to keep a team in Montreal and will  
work with us as long as we continue to show progress,'' Menard 
said. ``The partners are committed to keeping the process going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menard acknowledged two obstacles must be overcome.  
</P>
<P>
	He said a common ground must be reached with team president  
Claude Brochu, who has said he is willing to sell his 7.6 percent 
stake in the team but has rejected an offer of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we are talking with Claude, we are making  
progress,'' Menard said. Brochu has previously been the primary 
point man for baseball, but the reorganized partnership does not 
include him. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, better economics could mean getting more support from both  
the provincial and federal government. Up to now, Quebec Premier 
Lucien Brouchard has publicly expressed strong opposition to public 
financing for a new stadium and there has been no mention of 
stadium financing in either the national or provincial budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have plans for a scaled-down stadium for about $75 million  
less than the $150 million we originally sought,'' Menard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of the committee, Mark Routtenberg, said  
``baseball will address these problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If not, there are 15 or 16 other teams just like us. The other  
teams can not continue to subsidize us for up to 70 percent of our 
revenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos, the only major league baseball team not to draw 1  
million fans in 1998, say they cannot survive at Olympic Stadium, 
which was built for the 1976 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ownership groups in Washington, D.C., and northern  
Virginia are waiting to see what happens in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the team is put up for sale with the blessing of major  
league baseball,'' says William Collins III, leader of the 
Virginia-based investor group, ``we stand ready to discuss the 
acquisition and relocation to the national capital area.''

<HEADLINE> Saint Louis Coach May Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Saint Louis coach Charlie Spoonhour is expected  
to announce his resignation at the end of the latest in a series of 
frustrating seasons, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint Louis is 14-15 heading into Wednesday's first-round game  
against Marquette in the Conference USA tournament. It's a big 
letdown from last season, when freshman guard Larry Hughes led the 
team to 22 victories and the NCAA tournament. Hughes left for the 
NBA after only one season and Spoonhour couldn't fill the huge gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour produced consecutive NCAA appearances in 1994 and '95,  
both 23-win seasons, but followed up with disappointing records of 
16-14 and 11-18 before Hughes decided to stay home in part because 
of his ailing younger brother. Otherwise, Spoonhour has lost 
recruiting battles for the city's top talent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 Division I seasons, Spoonhour is 318-70. Before coming to  
Saint Louis, he produced five NCAA tournament teams in nine seasons 
at Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Doug McIlhagga could not confirm reports that the  
school was ready to make a change after seven seasons under 
Spoonhour. 
</P>
<P>
	But rumors have circulated for months that Spoonhour, who has  
four years to go on a contract that pays him $325,000, has been 
talking about resigning or retiring. KSDK in St. Louis reported 
Sunday night that Spoonhour would quit after the Billikens' season 
ends, and that he would recommend longtime assistant Greg Lackey as 
his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour downplayed the talk after a victory in mid-January in  
an interview with the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we lose, I think about it,'' Spoonhour said. ``Then  
we win and I think I could coach forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said then that nothing would be decided until the season  
is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour made no mention of his future at the team's annual  
awards banquet Sunday night at a local hotel, but later said 
``Anybody can hang on and keep making money. I don't want to do 
that.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A real estate magnate whose  
apartment building collapsed and killed eight people last year may 
lose his U.S. assets if a Rio judge has his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Joao Baptista Chagas Filho requested Friday that U.S.  
justice officials freeze the U.S. assets of Sergio Naya, a 
developer and former federal legislator. If accepted by U.S. 
courts, the legal action would stop Naya from selling two hot-pink 
$45 million twin towers he is finishing in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Naya became widely despised after a 22-story Rio apartment  
building his construction company erected caved in last year. 
</P>
<P>
	City inspectors later found the firm had laced cement with beach  
sand and seashells, leaving pillars inadequately reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Eduardo Lutz, attorney for the Palace II Residents  
Association, Naya eventually will have to pay as much as $165 
million to satisfy the claims of the building's 130 families, who 
were left homeless after the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ruling is meant to guarantee part of that payment.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Police have unearthed the remains of an  
American couple missing for two years in southern Chile, and the 
couple's son, a former U.S. marine, is being held as a suspect in 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Maria Ines Sciolla in Chillan told TV Channel 13,  
broadcast in the Chilean capital of Santiago, that the two bodies 
had been identified as Richard Bristow and Patsy Thurman, both 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Their remains were found Saturday in the backyard of the house  
where their son, identified as Marion Lee Bristow, 40, had been 
living until last year in Chillan, 255 miles south of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the son will undergo psychiatric tests. He has  
not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The government newspaper La Nacion reported, however, that the  
former marine confessed the killings in Temuco, 400 miles south of 
Santiago, where he was arrested two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to be taken back to Chillan next week and brought  
before a judge there. The victims are believed to come from the 
Houston area, according to press reports.

	MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese guerrillas detonated a  
roadside bomb near a convoy carrying senior Israeli officers 
Sunday, killing at least three and wounding several others, 
Lebanese security officials said. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah 
guerrilla group claimed responsibility for the attack in southern

	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's former police chief  
admitted to beating ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim in a 
police lock up last year. The admission came yesterday from the 
officer's lawyer before a panel probing the assault. The news is 
likely to further discredit the Malaysian police, which has been 
condemned by human rights groups, for allegedly using harsh 
methods. The panel is investigating the beating separately from the 
trial of Anwar, who was removed from his post and charged with 
illegal sexual acts and corruption in September. Anwar insists the 
charges were trumped up to eliminate him as a rival to Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

	TOKYO (AP) -- A team of doctors assembled today for Japan's first  
heart transplant in more than three decades after a hospital 
declared a comatose woman brain-dead. The 44-year-old woman's heart 
and lungs will be sent by helicopter to a university hospital in 
Osaka, where a patient is waiting to receive the organs. Another 
patient was to receive the woman's liver. The woman is the first 
person carrying a valid donor's card to be declared brain-dead 
since a new law in 1997 allowed doctors to make the diagnosis.

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Defend Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- With Juan Antonio Samaranch calling  
criticism of the Olympic scandal ``exaggerated,'' implicated IOC 
members defended themselves Sunday at the organization's 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on the fate of 13 members embroiled  
in the worst ethics scandal in the history of the International 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Richard Pound, head of the six-man inquiry  
panel, said his group had not finished its work concerning the Salt 
Lake City report that found more than $1.2 million in bribes were 
made to one-fifth of the IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound expects to report his findings to the IOC executive board  
next week. He is under pressure to wrap up his report before the 
IOC general assembly meets March 17-18 to address the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop the bleeding by March 17,'' he said. ``Death  
by 1,000 cuts isn't much fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, in Spanish newspapers this weekend, played down many  
of the accusations in the Salt Lake report and said the bidders for 
Olympic sites must share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``The criticism has been exaggerated and it has done  
disproportionate damage,'' the IOC president told the newspaper El 
Periodico. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three members implicated in the scandal -- Phil Coles of  
Australia, Ashwini Kumar of India and Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador -- 
traveled to Lausanne to give evidence to Pound. Tight security 
prevented checks to see if others were present. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here because I wanted to explain I didn't do  
anything,'' Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members resigned or were suspended last month in the first  
round of Pound's investigations. The weekend meeting focused on 
three that remained under investigation and 10 new names that 
appeared in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of the 10 cases reported later, only one or two could have  
committed irregularities,'' Samaranch told the Union of Catalan 
Sports Federations in Barcelona on Friday on the eve of the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia, Samaranch  
said only one case might merit consideration and the other nine 
were without foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard also placed blame on the bidders.  
</P>
<P>
	``They (IOC members) are guilty 50 percent, the other 50 percent  
is the responsibility of the bidding cities, which are more 
aggressive every day,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's panel can recommend that those found guilty of  
wrongdoing be expelled or sanctioned. The final decision will be 
made at next month's general assembly, which will vote on 
expulsions and sweeping reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent case is that of Kim Un-yong, the executive  
board member from South Korea and president of the confederation of 
Olympic sports bodies. He is accused of using his influence to get 
lucrative jobs in television and entertainment for his children. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of the most influential sports officials in the 2000  
Sydney Olympics, was with the panel for about one hour and declined 
comment afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	He has denied that Salt Lake boosters paid for lavish travel and  
vacations and has threatened legal action to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumar is accused of being given a plane ticket for the IOC  
meeting in Hungary. That session awarded the 2002 Winter Games to 
Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't receive any ticket,'' Kumar said. He said while the  
ticket receipt bore the name Kumar, the first name was different. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, one of the members suspended last month, said he went  
before the panel because he was ``not at all satisfied'' with the 
initial inquiry findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of wrong information from Salt Lake City. I  
don't like to use the word lie ... I just say it's not true,'' the 
75-year-old IOC veteran said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, I haven't done anything wrong,'' said Arroyo,  
wearing the IOC trademark tie pin of five rings. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry commission in January accused Arroyo of accepting  
payments from Salt Lake bidders for himself and a family member 
that amounted to $19,000, in addition to generous travel expenses 
for visits. 
</P>
<P>
	The full IOC session in March will decide whether to implement  
the executive board's orders that he should be expelled after more 
than 30 years as a member. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also was expected to examine files from about a dozen  
cities that bid for the Olympics between 1996 and 2004. The IOC had 
asked the cities to detail any wrongdoing by members during their 
bids.

<HEADLINE> Deformed Hand Clue in 1972 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Detective John Krol and his partner were armed  
with only a sketch and a key clue: The man wanted for a 1972 murder 
on a Brooklyn street had a deformed left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, that was enough.  
</P>
<P>
	After receiving an anonymous phone tip that Joseph Carfagno was  
spotted on West 49th Street, in the midst of Manhattan's bustling 
Broadway theater district, Krol drove in from Brooklyn Friday to 
ask around. And then he spotted him standing in front of a garage, 
looking at age 71 just like the police artist projected he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked for his ID, and he tried to give it to me with his  
right hand,'' Krol said. ``I said, 'No, I want you to show me your 
ID with your left hand.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Out came the stumpy, web-like fingers Carfagno was born with.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had him,'' Krol said. ``This was the most serious, oldest  
unsolved case we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have been looking for Carfagno since 1972, when they  
believe he opened fire during a fight outside a bar, killing 
35-year-old Joseph Destafano. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had become a focus in recent years for Krol after he  
was diagnosed with Lyme disease and began periodically coming off 
street patrol to work investigations. He would get reports now and 
then that someone spotted Carfagno, who worked as a bookie and used 
the alias Carl Decarlo. The last report was in the 1980s -- on the 
same block. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like a nice old Italian gentleman, like anybody else  
out there on the street, with gray hair, balding,'' Krol said of 
Carfagno, who was convicted of rape in 1952 and was found guilty of 
possession of gambling materials in 1967. ``He seems pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on Saturday night, the elderly man was awaiting arraignment  
on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1972 victim was shot to death after arguing with Carfagno in  
the same Brooklyn bar later used in the Mafia movie, ``Donnie 
Brasco,'' starring Al Pacino as a Mob hit man.

</P>
<P>
	In 1967, U.S. Rep. Adam Clayton Powell of New York, accused of  
misconduct, was denied his seat in the 90th Congress. The Supreme 
Court ruled in 1969 that Powell had to be seated.

</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The Clinton administration will not link progress  
on human rights to China's efforts to join the World Trade 
Organization, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday. 
``We determined some time ago that it was not a good idea to link 
human rights and trade and that we actually make better progress 
with both when they are not linked,'' Albright said at a joint news

	MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese guerillas detonated two bombs  
beside a military convoy Sunday, killing a brigadier general and 
three other Israelis in one of the most serious attacks on Israel's 
forces in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese 
guerrilla group, claimed responsibility for the attack. Brig. Gen. 
Erez Gerstein was the highest-ranking officer to die in Lebanon 
since the 1982 Israeli invasion. Two Israeli sergeants and an 
Israel Radio reporter, all of whom were in Gerstein's vehicle, also 
were killed.

Embassy and four other area's in Zambia's capital. One security 
official at the embassy was killed and another was slightly 
wounded, state TV reported. Witnesses said police defused a second 
device at the embassy. There was no immediate claim of 
responsibility. President Frederick Chiluba condemned the bombings 
as ``unacceptable acts of terrorism'' and asked Zambians to be on 
the alert for further attacks. Relations between Zambia and 
neighboring Angola have been strained over allegations Zambia 
allowed illegal weapon shipments to pass through its territory to 
Angolan rebels. Zambia denies the allegations.

	Japan Conducts Heart Transplant  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese doctors today completed a heart  
transplant, the first such operation in this country in three 
decades and also the first under a new law recognizing brain death. 
The donor, a 44-year-old woman, was the first person to be declared 
brain dead since a controversial law was passed in 1997 to allow 
doctors to make the diagnosis. Before the law, Japan had not 
allowed a person to be declared dead until the heart had stopped, 
making it almost impossible to transplant some organs because they 
deteriorate too rapidly once the heart ceases. The recipient is a 
man in his 40s. Japan's only other heart transplant was in 1968. It 
prompted criminal investigations, although the surgeon was never 
indicted.

	NORTON, Mass. (AP) -- People searching for a missing 9-year-old  
boy are still hopeful of finding him alive, but acknowledge that 
time isn't on their side. Corey Anderson disappeared Thursday after 
he went out into a driving snowstorm to look for his missing dog. 
The dog returned an hour later. More than 200 people covered an 
area with a one and a-half mile radius last night. A helicopter 
with heat-seeking equipment also joined in the search.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Air Force F-15 fighters attacked Iraqi  
military installations today with bombs and missiles after planes 
patrolling the northern no-fly zone came under anti-aircraft fire, 
U.S. military officials said. The planes fired three air-to-ground 
missiles and dropped eight bombs on targets mostly around the city 
of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad, a military spokesman 
said. Allied warplanes have prohibited Iraqi military flights over 
northern and southern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to

	Yeltsin May Stay in Hospital a Week

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Doctors say ailing Russian President Boris Yeltsin  
is in stable condition today after the bleeding of his ulcer was 
stopped, but he could remain in the hospital for up to a week. The 
68-year-old was readmitted yesterday after it was found that he 
needed more treatment for an ulcer for which he was hospitalized 
for two weeks last month. Yeltsin has had a slew of illnesses in 
recent months and has spent weeks away from his Kremlin office, 
raising doubts about his ability to complete his term, which ends 
next year.

	Tensions Increase in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The disappearance of two Serb  
civilians has tensions soaring in Kosovo. International peace 
monitors believe the two were abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels. 
The suspected kidnapping has touched off angry protests by Serbs in 
the area. Some 40 Serbs surrounded a police station but later 
dispersed after police and monitors assured them they would try to 
secure the civilians' release. Forty Serbs disappeared last summer 
in the territory controlled by the rebel Kosovo Liberation army and 
are presumed dead.

	Four Killed in Bombing in Lebanon

<P>
	MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese guerrillas detonated two  
bombs near an Israeli convoy today, killing four people, Lebanese 
officials said. A general was reported among the dead, the 
highest-ranking officer killed in Lebanon in more than 16 years. 
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for the 
twin bombings. Israel has occupied the zone in southern Lebanon 
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern territory from 
cross-border attacks. Hezbollah is the most active of guerrilla 
groups fighting to oust the Israelis and their militia allies.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senator Urges Stand on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen.  
Bob Smith asserted Sunday that the GOP will ``fall into the ash bin 
of history'' if it does not make outlawing abortion its top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire senator cast aside pleas from fellow  
Republicans who have called for the party to talk about issues 
other than abortion. In a forceful speech to the California GOP 
convention, he said he refused to be treated like a ``second-class 
citizen because we stand up for the (anti-abortion) plank in our 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news, there might be a third party, the worse news,  
the Republicans might be the third party,'' he said. ``If we're not 
going to stand up for the life of unborn children, maybe the 
Republican Party deserves to fall into the ash bin of history ... 
and it will, if we don't stand up for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's remarks drew repeated ovations from the Republican  
delegates gathered for their twice-annual state convention. His 
speech preceded a vote for the new chairman of the party. That 
election campaign has become a referendum on abortion and has 
deeply fractured the state party. 
</P>
<P>
	The victor, former party Vice Chairman John McGraw, has said  
banning abortion is his No. 1 mission; his opponent, Nicholas 
Bavaro, said he would have focused on other issues. Former 
Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, a moderate, lost to anti-abortion 
conservative Shawn Steel in the contest for vice chair. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw preached harmony in his victory speech, and sought to  
rally the Republicans around the cause of beating Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this to be the party of open and honest debate,'' he  
told the delegates. ``But when that is done, I want us to unite and 
go after the Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even some state GOP lawmakers who have carried anti-abortion  
legislation have urged a party that suffered devastating losses in 
November -- only two Republicans currently hold statewide office -- 
to talk about other issues this weekend. But Smith firmly backed 
McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killing children is the central issue facing our nation today,  
and it needs to be stopped,'' he said to applause from the 
delegates. ``I'm for a big tent, but I don't want a tent that's 
flat on the ground that everybody has to crawl under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes before Smith's speech, McGraw, Bavaro and other  
adversarial leaders in the party stood together at a news 
conference meant to project unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moderates and conservatives are going to come together,''  
Bavaro said. He and the other party candidates then headed into a 
convention hall littered with signs for candidates promising party 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unity must begin today,'' read a campaign placard for southern  
vice chairman Dr. Asha Knott. 
</P>
<P>
	Second assistant secretary candidate Mike McSweeney's sign  
offered this to-do list: ``1. Unify party. 2. Win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the seventh presidential aspirant to address the  
convention. All seven oppose abortion. Some, like Smith, offered 
fiery defenses of their position. Others, like former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, called for the party to emphasize other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of laying down litmus tests and rigid pronouncements,  
reach out to others with whom we agree,'' he urged convention 
attendees Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one other issue that united Republicans at the  
gathering: their dislike of President Clinton, a man, Smith said, 
who ``behaves like an animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Smith and former Vice President Dan Quayle drew raucous  
standing ovations when they praised the House trial managers, who 
fought to remove Clinton from office following his impeachment. 
Smith, who voted to oust Clinton, said there was no one he 
respected more than the trial managers.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Explode in Zambian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- A bomb exploded Sunday at the Angolan  
Embassy, killing a security guard and extensively damaging the 
building. Bombs also went off in four other areas in Zambia's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility. President  
Frederick Chiluba condemned the bombings as ``unacceptable acts of 
terrorism'' and asked Zambians to be on the alert for further 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Police sealed off the Angolan Embassy in a northeastern suburb  
after the explosion shattered windows and damaged part of the upper 
floor of the two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
	One security official at the embassy was killed and another was  
slightly wounded, state TV reported. Witnesses said police defused 
a second device at the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationalities of the victims weren't released.  
</P>
<P>
	Relations between Zambia and neighboring Angola have been  
strained over allegations Zambia allowed illegal weapon shipments 
to pass through its territory to Angolan rebels. Zambia denies the 
allegations but concedes its lengthy border with Angola is almost 
impossible to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombs also exploded in the southern district of Chilanga, in a  
deserted railroad yard close to downtown Lusaka, in the affluent 
northern suburb of Ibex Hill, and in eastern Lusaka, police and 
witnesses said. None had any apparent Angolan connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The first explosion occurred early Sunday, damaging an apartment  
building in eastern Lusaka and leaving a knee-deep crater, 
witnesses said.

<HEADLINE> Keilor Likes Ventura in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Garrison Keillor likes Minnesota Gov.  
Jesse Ventura's chances for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Plugging his satire loosely based on the former professional  
wrestler, ``Me: by Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente, as told to Garrison 
Keillor,'' the author acknowledges the splash Ventura made with his 
surprise election win in November, calling him a ``viable 
candidate'' for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he's picked all the right enemies -- liberals, bureaucrats,  
your high school civics teacher, journalists,'' Keillor says in 
Sunday's St. Paul Pioneer Press. ``But he'd better run in 2000, 
because he isn't going to have a very long shelf life. In six 
months, he may be turning brown around the edges as far as a 
national audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura last week told the National Press Club he was not going  
to run for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	When he first learned of Keillor's book, he denounced the  
author, comparing the book to unauthorized T-shirts and other 
merchandise trading on his fame. Later, a spokesman said the 
governor wished Keillor luck with the book.

<HEADLINE> Pope Waives Wait for Mother Teresa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- Pope John Paul II has waived the  
mandatory wait of five years after death to begin the process of 
possible sainthood for Mother Teresa, the archbishop of Calcutta 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop Henry D'Souza told The Associated Press he received a  
letter from the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of the Saints 
on Dec. 12 announcing the waiver, but had not publicized it. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, the Vatican confirmed the waiver by the pope, who had  
previously indicated the five-year wait would be required, even for 
the internationally beloved nun who dedicated her life to the 
destitute of Calcutta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand was so great and insistent that the Holy Father  
thought to go ahead,'' said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro 
Benedettini. 
</P>
<P>
	With the waiver, Calcutta's archbishop has been allowed to begin  
the process of gathering information and testimony about Mother 
Teresa in the first step toward possible beatification and 
sainthood. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in recent memory that such an exception  
had been made, the archbishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an important step forward, an important testimony to the  
sanctity of Mother Teresa,'' he said, adding that the pope would 
not have granted the waiver without ``such requests from all over 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beatification requires the confirmation of a miracle. After  
beatification, research on a second miracle, needed for 
canonization, can begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Two miracles attributed to Mother Teresa have been sent to the  
Vatican for verification, the archbishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reportedly happened in the United States, where a French  
woman who broke several ribs in a car accident miraculously healed 
when she wore a Mother Teresa medallion around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other miracle, a Palestinian girl suffering from cancer  
was cured after Mother Teresa appeared in her dreams and said, 
``Child, you are cured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop D'Souza said he would send a petition to the pope to  
begin the canonization process for Mother Teresa in two or three 
months. He said he hoped the late nun would be declared a saint in 
2000, when the Vatican celebrates the start of the third millennium 
of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother Teresa died Sept. 5, 1997, in Calcutta at age 87 after a  
life spent aiding the poor through her Missionaries of Charity 
order and other good works.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Foes May Clash in Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They are the Celtics and Lakers of New Jersey  
politics. Rome and Carthage. Mr. Hatfield and Ms. McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Their political conflicts defined the 1990s in New Jersey and  
influenced national conventional wisdom about taxes, campaign 
promises and the public's appetite for bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Now fate and term limits may conspire to pit Republican  
Christine Whitman against Democrat Jim Florio yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, the current governor, and former governor Florio are  
considering a run for the Senate seat being vacated by Democrat 
Frank Lautenberg in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other aspiring politicians in both parties will surely have a  
say in the matter. Still, if destiny has a vote, it will surely 
choose to end the decade with an encore performance of the Battle 
of the '90s: 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, who cut taxes, against Florio, who raised them.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, a child of privilege with a common touch, against  
Florio, a child of hardship but distant from the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, who waited until the last year of her first term to  
tackle sky-high auto insurance rates, against Florio, who began 
implementing his own ideas on insurance overhaul virtually the 
instant he took office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't often get to read the next chapter in a lot of good  
fiction, and we don't often get to read the next chapter in 
politics. But here it comes,'' said Ingrid Reed, who monitors New 
Jersey campaigns for the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Florio, out of politics since Whitman defeated him in 1993, said  
he has a new perspective and new ideas after five years in the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a campaign against Whitman would pit ``clashing  
philosophies about what government can do and shouldn't do, how you 
can finance it, whether you think short-term or long-term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost a classic case study of what an election should be  
about,'' Florio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, facing a mandatory career change in 2001 after serving  
the maximum two terms as governor, might welcome a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Running as a virtual unknown against Sen. Bill Bradley in 1990,  
Whitman cornered Bradley into refusing to state an opinion on the a 
$2.8 billion tax increase implemented that year by Florio. Whitman 
almost rode the issue to an upset of Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, she ran against Florio for governor and won.  
</P>
<P>
	Florio considered seeking a rematch in 1997 but deferred. Still,  
Whitman used Florio's tax increase against Democratic challenger 
Jim McGreevey, who voted for the Florio plan while in the state 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	By choosing governors in odd-numbered years, New Jersey often  
sends signals to the nation about the public mood. 
</P>
<P>
	Florio's victory in the 1989 governor's race supposedly sent  
word that America was ready to roll up its sleeves in the 1990s and 
address debts and inequalities left from the boom years of Ronald 
Reagan and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean. 
</P>
<P>
	But Florio's unpopular efforts to close a budget deficit and  
increase funding to poor urban schools opened the door for Whitman. 
Her victory in 1993 provided a blueprint for Republican 
gubernatorial candidates elsewhere: promise income tax cuts, then 
provide them fast.

<HEADLINE> McGuire Likes Stanford in NCAAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Handicappers know rested horses have an edge over exhausted  
ones. Pick a nag with some gas left in the tank and it might be an 
advantage in a sprint like the upcoming NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	So while ex-coach Al McGuire acknowledges that Duke has  
established itself as the nation's No. 1 team, he has a little love 
affair going with No. 6 Stanford, still equipped with the core of 
last year's Final Four team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're sitting nice at the top of the stretch,'' said  
McGuire, who will broadcast the NCAA tournament for CBS. ``They're 
sitting perfect because they're in the only major conference 
without a tournament. I believe that's an asset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pac-10 has never figured out the need for an end-of-season  
conference tournament, an exercise everyone else, except the Ivy 
League, will be conducting this week. 
</P>
<P>
	So while the heavyweights play some more games, not exactly  
something they need at this stage of the season, Stanford and 
Pac-10 partners No. 7 Arizona and No. 15 UCLA will enjoy a little 
rest and relaxation. Don't underestimate the importance of R&AMP;R at 
this stage of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire certainly doesn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are just two reasons for the conference tournaments,''  
he said. ``Number one is the green, the scratch, the money. No. 2 
is maybe some seventh-place team can get hot and pick up another 
check for the conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, an also-ran sneaks into the NCAA tournament through  
the conference back door by muscling up in the postseason 
tournament. But if a week's worth of good games can wipe out three 
months worth of bad ones, then what were those three months all 
about in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire suspects that teams with NCAA tournament berths safely  
tucked away might not be heartbroken if they bailed out early in 
their conference tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a coach, I always was concerned with what was better for  
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather see an early exit. I think of the big picture and  
that's the NCAA tournament. I've always thought coaches get 
blinders sometimes and are too narrow in their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA locks don't need the possibility of injuries or Asian  
flu and three more games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to reduce the risk of something bad happening to a  
team when there is no time to recover. Duke doesn't need to see 
Trajan Langdon taking stitches over an eye right now. Connecticut 
cringes at the thought of Richard Hamilton coming down the wrong 
way after a jump shot this week. 
</P>
<P>
	This was never a problem when McGuire coached because he had the  
good sense to work for non-conference Marquette, an independent 
that didn't have to worry about the vagaries of what might happen 
in a postseason tournament -- except the one with NCAA in front of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	So he was able to concentrate on the main goal, unencumbered by  
peripheral issues. As long as the won-loss numbers were good enough 
to impress the selection committee, he was all right. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire did that by fattening up on what he called cupcakes,  
teams that posed little problem. ``We had to control the 
schedule,'' he said. ``You need those built-in W's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he would sprinkle in a supply of warm weather teams,  
invited to Milwaukee in the middle of January or February, when the 
snow was high and the temperature low. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you'd want to do is get out and it didn't much matter  
whether you won or not,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was perfect for McGuire's purposes.  
</P>
<P>
	``As a coach, my MO was how do you get ready for the NCAA  
tournament,'' he said. ``You want to keep the whole package 
together for the Final Four. I tried different ways -- rest them, 
work them hard; go early, go late; stay outside of town, stay in 
town. I was around long enough to try every one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one conclusion he reached was simple: Avoid the speed bumps  
that can interfere with more important goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, it's getting to the tournament,'' he said. ``Second,  
you want to see the grass popping the third week in March. Let me 
get through that and I'm happy. Hoops is the dance. That's the new 
contract. That's the recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conference tournaments -- they're just bragging rights for  
freshmen basketball junkies. Who knows who won them two weeks after 
they happen? Two weeks after the NCAA, who doesn't know who won 
that?''

<HEADLINE> CIA Using New Anti-Terrorism Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- Much of CIA headquarters lay deserted for the  
weekend. But behind a heavy door, along a drab sixth-floor 
corridor, secure phones rang with alerts from overseas, computer 
screens flashed dispatches from operatives, and analysts pored over 
spy satellite photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	This was no drill. Working through the night were 15  
counterterrorism specialists monitoring the minute-by-minute flow 
of a highly classified operation against an international terrorist 
cell. They were using the newly opened Global Response Center, 
command post of the CIA's clandestine war on terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	In an executive conference room behind a sliding glass  
partition, CIA Director George Tenet spoke by phone with his 
counterpart at a foreign intelligence service involved in the 
operation, according to two senior intelligence officials involved 
in counterterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA refuses to reveal details of what countries or terrorist  
groups were involved, but, days afterward, allowed a reporter from 
The Associated Press the first glimpse at the new command post. 
</P>
<P>
	With its wall of video monitors, gray carpeting, high-tech work  
stations and curving operations table, the suite of rooms has the 
look of a state-of-the-art military command center, 
</P>
<P>
	``The Global Response Center will permit members of the  
intelligence and law enforcement communities to communicate faster, 
coordinate better and be more thorough,'' Tenet told his colleagues 
in a private ceremony opening the center. ``Unfortunately, I expect 
it will be used frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA has had a counterterrorist organization since 1986 but  
lacked a well-equipped center for gathering in-house experts and 
representatives from the FBI, Defense Intelligence Agency, State 
Department and other agencies during crises.

<HEADLINE> Kirk Douglas Talks to TV Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A debilitating stroke has actually had some  
benefits for Kirk Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	The screen legend says he has become closer to his son, Michael,  
particularly since the stroke three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael and I kept a respectable distance, but every year, we  
have become closer. Maybe it is because he has grown up some,'' the 
actor said in the March 6 edition of TV Guide. ``He maintains that 
I have become much funnier since my stroke. So, you see, a sense of 
humor can save you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 7, Douglas will receive the Life Achievement Award from  
the Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to avoid lifetime-achievement awards, because it  
always means you are close to the end,'' he says. ``It's hard for 
me to believe I'm 82. I look in the mirror and I say to myself, 
'How did it happen? There must be some mistake.'''

<HEADLINE> Missing Sightseers Presumed Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- The state's top FBI agent on Sunday said  
a woman and two teen-age girls who disappeared nearly two weeks ago 
during a trip to Yosemite National Park are probably dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The families ``understand that the probability of their loved  
ones being alive after this length of time is very small,'' said 
agent James M. Maddock. ``But we always hold out that hope that a 
miracle could occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said he was confident the mystery would be solved.  
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund of Eureka, 43, her 15-year-old daughter, Julie, and  
Silvina Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend from Cordoba, 
Argentina, were last seen on Feb. 15 in rural El Portal, leaving a 
restaurant near the lodge where they were staying. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were reported missing Feb. 17, a day after they missed  
a rendezvous with other family members at San Francisco 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Though investigators ``don't have that concrete evidence that a  
crime occurred, we are all operating under the assumption that a 
crime did occur,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said investigators have gathered valuable information,  
but refused to elaborate.

<P>
	MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- Five best friends gather to make a high school  
health video about the dangers of smoking and drugs. Ten days 
later, the girls are killed when their car plows into a utility 
pole. In the bloodstreams of four, including the driver, are traces 
of a chemical named difluoroethane. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the crumpled car, troopers find a can of ``Duster II,'' a  
spray used to clean computer keyboards. Its ingredients include 
difluoroethane. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner's findings put the teens on a list of 240 people who  
have died from ``huffing'' inhalants since 1996, according to the 
National Inhalant Prevention Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of the girls remain stunned. Last week, they  
released a statement disputing the findings and suggesting their 
daughters might have inhaled ``the airborne agent'' 
unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	But studies and doctors who treat teen-agers say their subjects  
tell them that huffing, also called ``sniffing'' or ``wanging,'' is 
the easiest high to get and far easier to conceal than the rush 
from alcohol, marijuana or tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	It's cheap. It's intense. There are no dealers, no pipes, no  
needles, no track marks. Some teens paint their fingernails with 
typewriter correction fluid then sniff their fingers all day. Some 
soak their sleeves in solvent and sniff away, with no one the 
wiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Heiss' preferred means was sniffing air freshener in the  
back room of his house in Bakersfield, Calif. Two days before 
Christmas 1995, his older brother caught him in the act. Wade was 
startled. Moments later, he fell to the floor. His heart had 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade was dead at age 12.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I heard about this huffing,'' says Dr. Richard Heiss,  
Wade's father, a family practitioner. ``But even I didn't know the 
effects of it and I'm a medical doctor. Nobody's telling parents 
about it. Why isn't someone screaming and yelling about this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies rank huffing fourth among all forms of substance abuse  
by teens. And what many teens and parents don't realize is that 
huffing can kill, even the first time, says Harvey Weiss, founder 
of theNational Inhalant Prevention Coalition in Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 products containing ``euphoriant'' inhalants are  
widely available, including vegetable cooking spray and deodorant, 
Weiss says, and the number of easy-to-get chemicals to sniff is 
growing and changing with time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call it a silent epidemic,'' Weiss says. ``Right now,  
there's barely any public awareness out there. And in the young 
person's mind, how can they think this is dangerous if they're not 
told? They think it's just household stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most inhalants produce their effects by depressing the central  
nervous system and slowing the heart, sometimes to an irregular 
beat. If a user becomes anxious or frightened, the resultant 
adrenaline release can kick the heart into even more inefficient 
rhythms, to the point that blood and oxygen no longer reach the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a few minutes, someone who seems to be doing fine can be  
dead,'' says Earl Siegel, a Cincinnati pharmacist with expertise in 
inhalant abuse. ``People are unfamiliar with how dangerous and 
prevalent it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal study of users age 12 through adulthood estimated that  
new users of inhalants in 1997 had increased to 805,000, from 
380,000 in 1991. The study, by the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration of the Department of Health and 
Human Services, said most new users were aged 12-17. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Weiss, seventh- and eighth-graders are the most  
common users among all teens. 
</P>
<P>
	The study called for a broad educational push to cut into those  
numbers. Congress is considering a bill to designate the week of 
March 22 as National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week. And SC 
Johnson, whose Glade air freshener has been an object of inhalant 
abuse, in October joined with Deloris Jordan, mother of basketball 
star Michael Jordan, in a campaign to increase awareness. It 
distributes educational videos to schools, hospitals, drug 
counselors and social workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware County coroner Dimitri Contostavlos said he hoped to  
raise awareness by releasing toxicology reports on the girls killed 
in the Jan. 29 car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren Wells, Rebecca Weirich and Shaena Grigaitis, all 16; and  
Tracy Graham and Rachael Lehr, both 17 -- juniors at a high school 
10 miles outside of Philadelphia -- were returning from shopping for 
prom dresses when their car swerved out of control. The posted 
speed limit on the twisty, half-mile stretch of road that locals 
call ``Dead Man's Curve'' because of numerous accidents is 55 mph. 
Investigators say the teens' car, driven by Miss Wells, was 
traveling at 66-88 mph when it hit the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The can of ``Duster II'' was found in the car two days later.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever suspected these girls (of inhalant abuse),''  
Trooper Joseph McCunney says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this might finally shake a few teen-agers' trees and  
make them afraid about it. There's nothing more final than death,'' 
says Dr. Anthony Acquavella, director of adolescent medicine at St. 
Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounts talking with teens who have sworn they didn't abuse  
inhalants even as Wite-Out pens, for correcting typewritten errors, 
fell out of their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would anyone need Wite-Out these days?'' he asks. ``No one  
has typewriters at home anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Urges Preparation for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans can expect some power brownouts and  
should worry about their medical records, but disruptions from the 
Year 2000 computer glitch probably are manageable, two senators 
investigating the problem say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably not know until we go through it,'' Sen.  
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is what will happen on Jan. 1, 2000, when older  
computer systems misread the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably not have meltdown. This will not be the end  
of the world as we know it, the way some Web sites are 
predicting,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who appeared  
together on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' plan to issue a report on 
possible ramifications from the Y2K computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft version of the report concludes that aviation airways  
will be safe, nuclear weapons will stay in their silos and most 
power grids will work. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers also pointed to major problems in foreign  
countries, notably Russia. In the United States, they said, there 
could be minor disruptions in food and energy supplies, health care 
and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you ought to do is prepare for a good storm, a hurricane,  
a storm where you'd like two or three days of ... water and canned 
goods and the like,'' Dodd said. People should not withdraw money 
from banks, he said, but they might want to save their financial 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	One area of concern, Dodd said, is that some 90 percent of the  
nation's 800,000 doctors' offices are not prepared for the 
millennium bug, possibly resulting in temporary loss of medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Richer hospitals will be prepared, but ``we are very, very  
worried'' about what could happen in urban or rural hospitals not 
moving quickly enough to fix equipment such as dialysis or heart 
monitoring machines, Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said most U.S. power grids will be fine, and ``at worst  
we're going to have some brownouts'' in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities,  
who also appeared on CBS, said he was in a minority of economists 
who believe the computer problem could cause a global recession 
with the breakdown of inventory control systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett noted that one effect would be ``a flight to quality,''  
in which people take money out of countries where they fear an 
``infrastructure meltdown.'' One impact may be that the rich get 
richer and the poor get poorer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah senator said an accidental nuclear launch was ``very,  
very unlikely.'' More probable, he said, was that ``if somebody 
were to press the button to cause an intercontinental missile to go 
off, it wouldn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate report details possible problems with Russia's early  
warning system for incoming missiles. Bennett and Dodd are backing 
a plan to have experts from Russia, the United States, and possibly 
India and Pakistan, gather on Jan. 1 to ensure that no country is 
in the dark about the nuclear intentions of other countries in the 
event of a computer failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said a Senate team sent to Russia concluded that ``yes,  
they are going to have real problems and no one is going to notice, 
because they said nothing works over there right now.''

<HEADLINE> No Fanfare for Orioles' Baines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- If he wanted to, Harold Baines  
could talk for hours about the impressive numbers he's amassed 
during an outstanding 19-year career in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wanted to, Baines could have broken into a haughty jog  
after each of his 348 career homers or enjoyed the notoriety 
deserving of a player who has hit .300 seven times and played in 
five All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	Baines, however, prefers to operate silently and without  
fanfare. The Baltimore Orioles' designated hitter doesn't 
particularly care to talk about himself and probably considers a 
broad smile to be an overt show of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need the magazine covers or the newspaper coverage to  
be happy,'' Baines said Sunday. ``I'm not afraid to talk to people, 
but I don't need it. Some players like talking after games; that's 
their personality. That's not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His creed is simple: Go to the plate, take your cuts and act  
like a professional. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they announce his name, he's already gone to the plate,''  
Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``When he hits a home run he runs 
around the bases and sits down. If he gets a game-winning hit, 
he'll just walk off the field and shake hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Surhoff is one of the quietest players on the team, but  
he's downright chatty compared to the soft-spoken Baines, his 
neighbor in the Baltimore clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harold doesn't say a whole lot, but when he does say something  
it makes a lot of sense,'' Surhoff said. ``He holds his emotions 
inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not as if Baines doesn't have anything to talk about. The  
left-handed hitter has more RBIs than any designated hitter in 
major-league history (837) and ranks second among DHs in homers and 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, at age 39, he hit .300 with nine homers and 57 RBIs.  
His .347 batting average with men on base ranked third in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Baines can even be used as a weapon when he's not in the  
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want him in there because he has such good numbers, but  
he's the one guy I have that every time he gets up in the dugout, 
you see the other team get a lefty up,'' Miller said. ``Sometimes I 
call him over just to talk, and while he's walking across the 
dugout the other manager is already on the phone to his bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Were it not for the DH rule, Baines would have retired a decade  
ago because of numerous operations on both his damaged knees. There 
were times last season that Miller considered using pitcher Mike 
Mussina in the outfield before Baines, who was hobbled for weeks 
with a strained hamstring and hasn't played defense for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 10 years I did play outfield, I loved it because you could  
help the team one night with hitting and the next night with 
defense,'' Baines said. 
</P>
<P>
	His lone contribution these days is with his bat. Oh, but what a  
lethal bat it is, in part because Baines can focus fully on the 
offensive aspect of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps if you know the only job you have to worry about it  
hitting,'' he said. ``The only thing I have to be concerned about 
is what kind of pitches the other guy throws. And if I make an out, 
I can go back and study what I did wrong instead of changing gears 
and playing defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he turns 40 later this month, Baines said he won't  
think about quitting the game until he sees what type of numbers he 
puts up this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``People ask me when I'm going to retire, I say my performance  
will tell me that,'' he said. ``If you can help the team, they'll 
still want you. Once it's gone, all you can do is look back, so I 
want to stay on this ride as long as I can.''

<HEADLINE> Quake Survivors Arrive in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They lost their mother in the earthquake in  
Colombia. On Sunday -- with tearful hugs -- the Amaya girls were 
reunited with their father in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Amaya, 12, who lost her right leg below the knee in the  
Jan. 25 earthquake, is believed to be the only U.S. citizen hurt in 
the disaster that killed more than 1,170 people. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her sister, Maritza, 13, landed at LaGuardia Airport  
Sunday and saw their father, Emilio Amaya, for the first time in 
more than five years. Two local members of Congress accompanied the 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny was surrounded by stuffed animals as she left the airplane  
in a wheelchair. She and her sister cried as their father gave them 
an emotional embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God for bringing my family here,'' Amaya said in  
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Amaya, a textile factory worker in Queens, came to the United  
States in 1985 but sent his wife and children back to their 
hometown of Pereira in Colombia six years ago. Jenny was born in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hug and kiss them and tell them that I really love  
them,'' Amaya said through an interpreter just before the girls 
arrived. He brought two warm winter coats to the airport for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jenny's birthday was last week, so we plan to celebrate,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, who appeared frightened by a crowd of reporters,  
photographers and television crews, did not speak. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-Brooklyn, who traveled with the  
children, said they were anxious to see their father. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were about to land the girls were saying 'We are going  
to see daddy, we are going to see daddy,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny and Maritza's mother, Luz Dary, was at a bank cashing a  
check from Amaya when she died. The earthquake sent a wall tumbling 
on top of her and Jenny. Maritza was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Velazquez and U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-Queens, heard the  
family's story and went to Colombia to bring the girls to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny and Maritza have lived with their grandparents in Pereira  
since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Amaya had been sending money to support the family. He was  
devastated by the news of his wife's death, but was unable to fly 
back to get the girls because he is an undocumented immigrant who 
would likely have trouble reentering the United States if he 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny will receive medical treatment -- including a prosthesis  
for her damaged leg -- at Elmhurst and Mount Sinai Hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Century-Old Mill's Future Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILLINOCKET, Maine (AP) -- After Eldon Gagnier went to work for  
Great Northern Paper in 1947, the company loaned equipment to help 
him pour a foundation for his new house. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it sent a carpenter to help him build it.  
</P>
<P>
	The company did the same for countless other employees. It also  
built playgrounds, a ballpark and a golf course, and paid most of 
the local taxes. Best of all, it paid its workers well, and in 
return earned their loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best company to work for,'' said Hubert Voisine, 70,  
who was given a free plot on paper company land for his cottage 
after he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the century-old mill's future unknown, it's time for  
employees to pitch in. And they will do it in grand fashion if they 
pull off what they believe would be the first employee takeover of 
an American paper mill. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I was a little pessimistic,'' said Alan ``Butch''  
Higgins, president of one of nine unions involved in the buyout 
plan. But now, ``I think it's going to happen, and real fast, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For generations, Millinocket was an island of prosperity in the  
middle of Maine's vast industrial forest. It seemed everybody had a 
shiny car or pickup, a snowmobile or two, a decent house and a good 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mill was the backbone of the town and the only industry in  
town,'' said Francis Larkin, 77, a 31-year veteran employee. 
``Pretty near everything in the community they've done something 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But times have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bowater Inc., Great Northern's parent company and the nation's  
largest newsprint maker, announced a year ago that it will sell the 
mill instead of investing in upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes around town reflect concerns about the future of the  
Millinocket mill, the economic engine for the town of 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Storefront after storefront have ``For Rent'' signs. ``For  
Sale'' signs are sprouting on the lawns of many of the town's 
vinyl-sided homes, and a couple of the schools have closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can get a good house for $50,000,'' said Voisine, relaxing  
with his pals at the retirees' club. ``I know a lot of houses, they 
were asking $80,000 and they got $40,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the search for a buyer of the mill turned up no takers,  
the unions proposed a takeover in which the workers would buy 30 
percent of the stock, management would buy 10 percent and other 
investors would buy the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are finally getting a little bit of optimism,''  
said Higgins, the mill's payroll coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope is mixed with skepticism among some of the mill's remaining  
900 workers, down from around 1,400 at one time. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Gagnon, a salaried employee, and union paperworker Jim  
Burgess fear that Bowater will sell the mill without its 
power-generating system included in the deal. The combination of 
papermaking and power-generation, said Gagnon, makes the 
Millinocket mill unique. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Bowater has sold off 1.6 million acres of its  
timberlands. And while the Columbia, S.C.-based company plans to 
invest $200 million in its other Maine mill a few miles down the 
road in East Millinocket, the older mill that is valued at $125 
million by the town continues to languish. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've done is taken a perfect diamond, and broken it  
off a piece at a time,'' said Gagnon, sitting with Burgess in the 
Appalachian Trail Cafe on a clear February afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgess said he's confident the buyout will happen, but Gagnon  
said many mill workers have their doubts. He said workers have been 
through so many ups and downs that they've become immune to the 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
	If the unions that represent 640 employees do not succeed in  
their buyout, there may be another option for the town: profit from 
its beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	Millinocket is the principal gateway to Baxter State Park, a  
204,733-acre wilderness preserve that draws thousands of campers, 
mountain climbers, hikers and nature lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	It also leads to one of the nation's top whitewater rivers, the  
West Branch of the Penobscot, not to mention scores of lakes and 
ponds that are prized by anglers and boaters, and an endless 
network of snowmobile trails. 
</P>
<P>
	Local folks don't seem overly enthused about promoting the  
wonderland that is their backyard to the rest of the world. Some 
fret that too many outsiders pass through already without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody is saying Millinocket will curl up and die, even if  
the buyout fails. 
</P>
<P>
	``Change is hard to come by, but they can deal with it,'' said  
state Rep. Joseph Clark, D-Millinocket. ``Millinocket is a town 
that can survive almost anything.''

<HEADLINE> KU Player Wounded in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas wide receiver Michael Chandler had  
surgery after he was beaten and shot by masked intruders, police 
and university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was shot in the groin area about 5 a.m. Saturday in his  
Lawrence apartment and had surgery at Lawrence Memorial Hospital, 
where he was in good condition Sunday, said Doug Vance, Kansas 
assistant athletics director. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Terry Allen was with Chandler when he had the operation,  
Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our primary concern right now is for Michael and his family,''  
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three masked intruders broke into Chandler's apartment and  
exchanged words with him before he was beaten and shot, according 
to Vance and Lawrence police Sgt. Susan Hadel. 
</P>
<P>
	A roommate who was asleep in another room told The Lawrence  
Journal-World that he was awakened by the gunshot, found Chandler 
on the floor and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	No other details had been released by Sunday evening.  
</P>
<P>
	Chandler is a 5-foot-11, 195-pound junior from Kansas City, Kan.  
He has 46 career receptions for 577 yards, and as a junior last 
season was third on the team with 21 catches for 236 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler had been expected to sit out contact drills this spring  
while recovering from surgery to repair ligament damage in his left 
ankle.

<HEADLINE> Biographer To Publish Whitman Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new biographer of Walt Whitman will publish  
early poems not seen, he says, since they were in newspapers for 
which the poet worked more than 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Loving's ``Walt Whitman -- The Song of Himself,'' to be  
published March 11, is the first full-length critical biography of 
the poet in 40 years. The author conducted exhaustive research of 
old newspaper files. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was in his 20s, Whitman still was writing rhymed verse  
in regular meter. He abandoned that style for free verse in 
``Leaves of Grass,'' his master work. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Sketch'' is Whitman's first seashore poem, Loving writes in  
the biography, ``anticipating, though vaguely and in the convention 
of the times, the painful separation of lovers ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was published by the New York New World in 1842, when Whitman  
was 23. Loving identified it and quoted all five stanzas in the 
Walt Whitman Quarterly Review four years ago, but it has not 
appeared elsewhere. His book includes the last stanza, where the 
poet writes: 
</P>
<P>
	``But here, the billow's heaving breast,  
</P>
<P>
	``And the low thunder's knelling tone,  
</P>
<P>
	``Speak of the wearied soul's unrest,  
</P>
<P>
	``Its murmurings, and conflicts lone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Whitman became editor of the daily Brooklyn Eagle at 26. Soon  
after, he apparently wrote an elegy called ``Change,'' not 
identified as his until now. 
</P>
<P>
	Loving argues that although the work is unsigned, that was a  
usual practice at the time because it was thought a clear 
identification of the author would divert attention from the poem's 
solemnity. 
</P>
<P>
	Loving points out that the subject of the poem -- Whitman's  
predecessor as editor, William B. Marsh -- is also unnamed, as was 
Abraham Lincoln in Whitman's famous elegy ``When Lilacs Last in the 
Dooryard Bloom'd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fourth-rate poetry,'' Joann Krieg, another Whitman  
scholar and a professor of English at Hofstra University in 
Hempstead, N.Y., said of the early work. ``But it's typical of its 
time and the papers where it appeared. It was only when he brought 
out ``Leaves of Grass' that he thought he could do something 
different that would find its own audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loving also has unearthed forgotten but important prose that  
foreshadows Whitman's later work. 
</P>
<P>
	A paragraph in a speech the poet gave to the Brooklyn Art Union  
is what Loving calls ``almost a free verse poem.'' That was four 
years before Whitman first published ``Leaves of Grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biography also has new material on Whitman's campaign later  
in life, after publishing ``Leaves of Grass,'' to gain acceptance 
for what was regarded by many as a dirty book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, it was a time when they even draped piano legs,''  
Loving said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loving, who teaches at Texas A&AMP;M University, also has written a  
biography of Emily Dickinson and books on other 19th century 
American writers.

<HEADLINE> Linux Nips at Dominant Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It hardly seems like a group intent on remaking the universe:  
8,000 technology experts devoted to a software for running 
computers called Linux that most non-technical types haven't even 
heard of. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they meet Tuesday for Linux World in San Jose, Calif.,  
these computer buyers and enthusiasts will talk like passionate 
rebels of how Linux may one day be a viable alternative to the 
overwhelmingly dominant Windows software from Microsoft Corp. 
They'll underscore how Linux is breaking free of its grassroots 
beginnings and edging into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``Linux has become the poster child for anyone feeling any  
animosity for Microsoft,'' said Charlie Greco, chief executive of 
IDG World Expo, which is sponsoring its first-ever Linux event in 
response to surging interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Developed in the early 1990s by a Finnish student named Linus  
Torvalds, Linux (pronounced LINN-nucks) is a version of the Unix 
operating system used by businesses to run computer networks and 
Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most software writers, Torvalds released the basic  
blueprints for his system on the Internet and today Linux can be 
downloaded for free off the Web, or bought at retail stores for as 
little as $30. 
</P>
<P>
	Its popularity is growing fast as users embrace Linux's  
flexibility and its ability to avoid crashing. Demand is growing 
even though the software usually requires users to memorize and 
type in commands, similar to the DOS software that preceded 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	One advantage for Linux -- it's constantly being updated.  
</P>
<P>
	An army of volunteer developers scattered around the world works  
with Torvalds -- who now lives in Santa Clara, Calif. -- to improve 
it and make it easier to use. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, some are working on sprucing up a Windows-style  
``point and click'' graphical interface for Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, it's far too early to tell if the high-tech reality  
lives up to the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials portray Linux as nothing more than a minor  
rival. Windows runs about 85 percent of the world's personal 
computers, and Microsoft is notoriously aggressive in beating back 
threats to its software dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials contend that because Linux developers are so  
scattered, chaos will deter Linux from ever catching on in a big 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Linux is a hype-rich topic at the moment in the marketplace,''  
said Ed Muth, Microsoft's group product manager for Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great majority of our customers are not considering  
Linux,'' Muth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some big names are endorsing Linux. Intel Corp., the  
world's largest maker of chips for personal computers, could 
announce as early as this week a multimillion dollar investment in 
VA Research, a Mountain View, Calif., maker of computers pre-loaded 
with Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and VA officials declined comment last week, but industry  
sources say VA's machines will be adapted to work with Intel's 
upcoming chip for high-end business computers, known as Merced. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall Intel took a stake in Red Hat, a Durham, N.C.-based  
distributor of Linux software. Several major computer makers such 
as Hewlett Packard Co. and IBM Corp. have begun selling machines 
loaded with Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of Linux software jumped 48 percent to 2.9 million  
last year, says International Data Corp., a research firm owned by 
IDG World Expo's parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Linux's use in business computers is a tiny fraction of  
more established Unix systems and Windows NT, and the software 
rarely appears on desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason is there are relatively few software applications --  
such as word processors or spreadsheets -- written to work with 
Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	While Microsoft has no current plans to write such programs,  
others are. This could help Linux make inroads into desktops, said 
William Peterson, an analyst with International Data. 
</P>
<P>
	``IDC firmly believes this will be the year for Linux  
software,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, this isn't the first time rival technologies have  
tried to usurp the Microsoft crown. Other challengers such as 
ultra-simple computers tied to networks, the Java programming 
language by Sun Microsystems Inc., and even the Internet itself 
were pitched as Microsoft killers -- only to be beaten back by the 
company's counterattacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is talking about Linux emerging as a powerful system,  
but not many people are talking about the Microsoft factor,'' said 
Ullas Naik, an analyst with First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Microsoft's own fumbling may help Linux. Its next  
generation operating software, Windows 2000, has been repeatedly 
delayed and isn't expected out until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Microsoft may shy away from a strong response to Linux  
during its epic antitrust trial. Federal prosecutors accuse 
Microsoft of abusing its software monopoly to squash competitors 
and are mulling ways to try to curb the company's power. 
</P>
<P>
	But some folks believe they've already found their Holy Grail.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that Linux represents the first substantial threat  
to Microsoft that we have seen yet,'' said magazine publisher Adam 
Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Goodman will introduce Linux Magazine with a  
decidedly confident cover: Half-crumbling letters casting dramatic 
shadows and spelling a lone word -- Microscared.

<HEADLINE> Voters May Accept Female President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An unexpected consequence of the Monica  
Lewinsky affair could be that voters will be more willing to have a 
woman in the White House -- not as first lady, but as commander in 
chief. The thinking is that a woman would be better at restoring 
honesty and ethics to the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans already are accustomed to seeing women in high places.  
Nine senators are women. Female military officers, female 
astronauts, female business executives are not so rare as they once 
were. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though some people still don't like the idea of women  
in politics, a poll last year indicated that 90 percent of adults 
would vote for a woman as their party's presidential nominee if she 
were qualified. In 1972, the figure was 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, a quarter of 1,200 adults surveyed last month said  
they think a female president would be better than a man at 
``improving honesty and ethics in Washington'' -- not an unimportant 
factor in the aftermath of the 13-month scandal over President 
Clinton's affair with a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	At one time, a considerable number of men -- especially  
blue-collar workers and older men -- said they would not support a 
woman for president, but ``that's no longer true,'' said Democratic 
pollster Celinda Lake. ``A lot of older, blue-collar men want their 
daughters to be president,'' Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that 10 percent of voters who aren't sold on the idea of  
a woman as commander in chief would matter in a tight race. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't know yet,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican  
pollster, ``is if some of these older voters are more inclined now 
to support a woman because of their belief that a woman would be 
the best to return integrity to the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three countries have had female prime ministers or  
presidents. While American voters elect increasing numbers of women 
to legislative positions, they hesitate to put them in executive 
leadership positions, Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw that in the gubernatorial races in the last election,''  
DiVall says. ``We had a record number of women running for governor 
and most of them lost. Basically, the only women who were elected 
were women who were incumbents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For any woman running for president, the first imperative is  
that she project gravitas,'' wrote former Rep. Patricia Schroeder, 
D-Colo., in an opinion piece in The New York Times. ``Men are 
assumed to have it; women have to prove they have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y., who in 1972 became the  
first woman to seek the presidential nomination of a major 
political party, said some voters believe that a woman would never 
have the same kind of personal troubles as Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot of men say, `Look, these men are messing up.  
Maybe it is time to give a woman an opportunity,''' said Chisholm, 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	Gender, however, will never be the deciding factor in choosing a  
president, said former New York congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro, 
the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1984 with Walter 
Mondale. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the American public is going to turn around and  
say, `I will vote for her because she's a woman, because she's pure 
and she's not going to get in trouble,''' Ferraro said. ``They may 
consider it, but I don't think they'll vote on it. They'll look at 
the person and say, `Where is this person on the issues?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraro predicted that Elizabeth Dole, who refers to the next  
president as ``he or she'' and is a potential candidate for the 
Republican presidential nomination, will not be nominated. But 
Ferraro said Mrs. Dole could wind up as the GOP's vice presidential 
nominee, which she said would pressure Democrats to nominate a 
woman for vice president, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraro offered some political advice to first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, who is considering a bid for a Senate seat from New 
York: Don't do it yet. Write a book, run for the Senate from 
Illinois in 2004, and ``then she's our presidential candidate in 
2008.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing to see women in powerful positions -- Madeleine  
Albright traversing the world as secretary of state and Janet Reno 
at the helm of the Justice Department -- is what will convince 
voters that a woman is capable of leading the free world, Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think a woman just for the sake of being a  
woman can win,'' Feinstein said. ``I think she's got to do the 
apprenticeships, she's got to have the credentials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Ford, in a speech last week, said the most  
likely scenario for a woman becoming president would be if she were 
a vice president and the president, a man, ``should die or get shot 
or whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's the last time,'' Ford said to applause, ``that  
we'll ever have a male president.''

<HEADLINE> Phillippe in Role Reversal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising Hollywood hunk Ryan Phillippe plays a  
manipulative jerk in his new movie ``Cruel Intentions,'' a role he 
calls role reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a really dark sense of humor, so I loved how we'd say  
such horrible things in such a flippant way,'' Phillippe says in 
Sunday's Daily News. ``But my character is the exact opposite of 
me. I never had friends like that because I never liked guys on the 
make. They were full of themselves and slick. I don't have those 
sexuality issues of having to be macho. I'm fine with being 
sensitive and crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillippe got his career start playing a homosexual teen-ager on  
the soap opera ``One Life to Live.'' His film credits include ``I 
Know What You Did Last Summer,'' ``White Squall,'' ``Homegrown,'' 
``54'' and ``Playing by Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being coldhearted, even in a movie role, just isn't his nature.  
When Phillippe did a scene in ``Cruel Intentions'' where his 
character breaks up with a girl played by Reese Witherspoon, who is 
his girlfriend in real life, he says, ''I threw up.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates Catcher Kendall To Lead Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Catchers handle pitchers. They  
occasionally hit home runs. They steady the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	They do not lead off.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's because most of them can't run very well and often  
can't hit very well,'' said Pittsburgh Pirates manager Gene Lamont, 
a former catcher whose own major league career was shortened by his 
inability to run and hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Kendall can run. Jason Kendall can hit. So when the  
Pirates traded leadoff hitter Tony Womack to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on Friday, they didn't look far for their new No. 1 
hitter: They found him sitting behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice was obvious, although it would seem that a catcher --  
even a mold-breaker such as Kendall -- would be the last option of 
any manager to be his first hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, catchers are supposed to steal signs, not bases.  
</P>
<P>
	``But look what he's done,'' Lamont said Sunday of Kendall, who  
hit .327 and set a major league record for catchers with 26 stolen 
bases last season. ``He's batted second, he's batted third, I don't 
think batting first would be a big difference for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont has not officially anointed the 24-year-old Kendall as  
his leadoff hitter, if only because the exhibition schedule doesn't 
begin until Friday and the season opener is 4 1/2 weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lamont's only other options would seem to be second baseman  
Mike Benjamin, who is better suited to batting eighth, and center 
fielder Brant Brown, whom Lamont envisions more as a No. 3 or 5 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kendall leads off, he would be the first major league catcher  
to do so regularly since Houston's Craig Biggio, who eventually 
moved to second base to further take advantage of his speed, range 
and fast legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have no such position move in mind for Kendall, a  
.308 career hitter who has batted .300 or higher twice in his three 
major league seasons. They certainly don't want one of the 
cornerstones of their rebuilding program to move out of town; 
they've offered him a $16.5 million, three-year contract extension 
even though he is signed through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care where I bat ... second, third, first,''  
Kendall said. ``If they want me to leadoff, I have no problem with 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's run production likely will suffer if he leads off, as  
his 75 RBIs were third among the last-place Pirates to Kevin 
Young's 108 and Jose Guillen's 84. Last year, Kendall batted third 
102 times and second 40 times. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Kendall won't steal as many bases as Womack, who led  
the NL in stolen bases the last two seasons, his on-base percentage 
of .411 ranked seventh in the NL and was far better than Womack's 
.319. Kendall also struck out only 51 times, compared to Womack's 
94. 
</P>
<P>
	With his ability to get on base, Kendall conceivably could be  
the first catcher with 40 stolen bases in a season if the Pirates 
decide a catcher's legs can stand the wear and tear of running the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked a lot about it before we traded Tony,'' said general  
manager Cam Bonifay, who has remade the Pirates' lineup with a 
succession of off-season moves. ``Stealing bases and scratching out 
runs was a big part of our offense the last two years, but we feel 
that by improving our offense, we'll have more big innings and more 
extra-base hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Womack gone, the Pirates probably will start only three  
players who were in their opening day lineup last season: Young at 
first, Guillen in right and Kendall at catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The infield should be three-quarters new with Benjamin at  
second, Pat Meares at short and Ed Sprague at third, and Brian 
Giles and Brown will start in the outfield unless Al Martin makes a 
major push during spring training to regain his job. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many changes going on around him, Kendall must figure  
that changing spots in the batting order is the thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never worried about where I hit,'' Kendall said. ``I've  
just always wanted to play.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Urges Preparation for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's leading experts on the Year 2000  
computer problem discounted doomsday scenarios but said Sunday 
that, as before a snowstorm or a hurricane, it wouldn't hurt to put 
in a supply of food and water. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who  
head a special Senate panel on the subject known as Y2K, said it 
could bring on real problems in this country, from electrical 
brownouts to breakdowns in medical equipment. But ``we will 
probably not have meltdown. This will not be the end of the world 
as we know it,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Dodd, who appeared on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' are  
to issue a report this week on the effects of the computer glitch 
arising from the many computers' inability to differentiate between 
the years 1900 and 2000. If unfixed, this could cause computers to 
malfunction or shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of transportation, financial services, power and nuclear  
systems going awry have led to a growing number of what Dodd called 
``Y2K survivalists,'' are stockpiling food and energy in advance of 
what they fear will be social chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	That's highly unlikely, at least in the United States, the  
senators agreed. ``What you ought to do is prepare for a good 
storm, a hurricane, a storm where you'd like two or three days of 
... water and canned goods and the like,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett cautioned that no one will really know the seriousness  
of the problem until Jan. 1, 2000. ``Ultimately, when we get to New 
Year's Eve, everybody, no matter how informed we think we are, is 
going to be holding his breath,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft version of their report pointed to possible problems in  
the food supply system because of computer breakdowns. Dodd said 
another area of unease is that 90 percent of the nation's 800,000 
doctors' offices have not upgraded their computers, meaning that 
doctors could temporarily lose access to medical records or that 
dialysis or heart monitoring equipment could stop working. 
</P>
<P>
	Affluent hospitals will be in good shape, Dodd said, but ``we  
are very, very worried about what happens in the rural or urban 
situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said most power grids will be fine, and ``at worst we're  
going to have some brownouts'' in rural areas. He said he would be 
willing to fly on Jan. 1, 2000 -- on a domestic, not overseas, 
flight -- but he had heard that some insurance companies are 
refusing to insure flights without assurances that the computers 
were going to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``That becomes chicken and egg: No insurance, they don't fly;  
they don't fly, they can't prove,'' Bennett said. ``We'll watch 
that one carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities,  
who also appeared on CBS, said he is among a minority of economists 
who believe the computer problem could cause a global recession 
with the breakdown of inventory-control systems around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said one impact on the international economy could be  
``a flight to quality'' in which people remove money from countries 
where they feel there's going to be an ``infrastructure meltdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's report and CIA testimony to Congress last week  
pinpointed poorer countries in general and Russia in particular as 
areas ill-prepared for the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said an accidental nuclear launch is ``very, very  
unlikely,'' and more likely was that ``if somebody were to press 
the button to cause an intercontintental missile to go off, it 
wouldn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their report details possible problems with Russia's early  
warning system for incoming missiles. They also back a plan where 
experts from Russia, the United States, and possibly India and 
Pakistan gather in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Jan. 1 to ensure 
that no country is in the dark about other countries' intentions in 
the event of a computer failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's committee sent a team to Russia to evaluate its  
preparations. He said they returned with the conclusion: ``Yes, 
they are going to have real problems, and no one is going to notice 
because they said nothing works over there right now.''

<HEADLINE> Wotherspoon Caps Wins Two Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- Canada's Jeremy Wotherspoon capped off a  
dominant World Cup season with gold medals in the 500-meter and 
1,000-meter races Sunday in the final meet for the 1998-99 circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wotherspoon won the 1,000-meter race with a time of 1 minute,  
12.80 seconds to finish with 450 of a possible 540 points in the 
overall 1,000-meter World Cup standings. Wotherspoon, who won the 
World Speedskating Championship in Calgary, Alberta, last Saturday, 
finished 105 points ahead of world-record holder Jan Bos of the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was consistently able to race well this year, even when I  
wasn't at my peak,'' Wotherspoon said. ``I think that is a good 
sign for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 500-meter race ended in a tie, with Wotherspoon and  
Japan's Kuniomi Haneishi finishing in 37.11 seconds. Wotherspoon, 
who holds the world-record time of 34.76 seconds, won his eighth 
straight World Cup 500-meter race to finish with 530 points in the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey FitzRandolph of the United States edged out Canada's Mike  
Ireland by one-hundredth of a second to maintain second place in 
the 500-meter standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Monique Garbrecht won the women's 1,000-meter race for  
the second straight day with a time of 1:21.35 seconds, to win the 
overall World Cup with 470 points. Garbrecht won the World 
Championship last week, setting a world record with a time of 
1:14.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Witty of the United States finished second overall in the  
World Cup 1,000-meter standings, and teammate Amy Sannes wound up 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the year I met my goal for the 1,000 by finishing in the  
top 10,'' said Sannes, who is from nearby St. Paul.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Player Ken Robinson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Former major league pitcher Ken Robinson is  
dead, and a fellow minor leaguer in the Arizona Diamondbacks' 
organization is charged with second-degree murder after an 
alcohol-related auto accident Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Robinson, a 29-year-old right-hander who pitched for  
Toronto and Kansas City, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 
early-morning accident. The driver, pitcher John Rosengren, was 
being held in the Pima County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosengren, 26, of Barrington, Ill., showed signs of impairment,  
and a blood sample was taken, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Rosengren's car went off the road and overturned.  
Paramedics arrived at 1:40 a.m. to find both men in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had a severe head injury, police said. Rosengren was  
not injured. Neither player was wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had been a part of the Diamondbacks' 40-man roster in  
spring training a year ago, but missed the season because of 
shoulder surgery. He and Rosengren, who also missed all of last 
season after arm surgery, were awaiting the opening of the 
Diamondbacks' minor league training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad and tragic day for me personally,'' said  
Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter. ``The organization will miss 
Ken Robinson, both as a person and as a player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a competitor in every sense of the word.''  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had brief big league stints as a relief pitcher with  
Toronto in 1995 and 1997, and with Kansas City in 1996. He spent 
most 1997 with Triple-A Syracuse, where he was 7-7 with a 3.56 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendously sad loss of one of the finest individuals  
you'd ever want to meet,'' Toronto pitching coach Mel Queen said 
from the Blue Jays' camp in Dunedin, Fla. ``It makes you think just 
how quickly something can be taken away from you. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times you take things for granted, then something  
like this happens and you realize just how precious life really 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Queen was Toronto's director of player development from 1990-95.  
Robinson was Toronto's 10th-round pick in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's former Toronto teammates were stunned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know what to say,'' Blue Jays first baseman  
Carlos Delgado said. `It makes you think a bit, guys our age who 
played together and had a good time. It's a shame. It's just sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson appeared in 21 games for Toronto in 1995, compiling a  
1-2 record with a 3.69 ERA. During his three games with Toronto in 
1997, he allowed just one hit, Cecil Fielder's 300th career home 
run in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had a major league record of 2-2 with a 3.91 earned run  
average. The Diamondbacks signed him on Feb. 17, 1998, after he was 
waived by Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was a star at Archbishop Hoban High School in Akron,  
Ohio, and attended Florida State. He began playing professionally 
in 1991 with Medicine Hat, and also pitched for Myrtle Beach, 
Hagerstown, Dunedin and Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his widow, Lorrie, and a 22-month-old son,  
Chase. The family lives in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosengren, signed by Arizona after being released by Detroit,  
was the setup man out of the bullpen for Triple-A Toledo in 1997, 
compiling a 1-3 record with a 3.99 ERA in 54 games. He attended the 
University of North Carolina and began pitching professionally in 
1992, with stops in Bristol, Niagara Falls, Lakeland, Trenton and 
Jacksonville.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Lets LSU Play in SEC Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- LSU will be eligible to play in the  
upcoming Southeastern Conference despite recruiting violations, but 
the Tigers still face costly scholarship reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA committee agreed Sunday to let LSU play in the SEC  
tournament, which begins Thursday, but will not return scholarships 
lost as a result of violations committed in recruiting former Tiger 
Lester Earl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee felt that on balance, the serious scholarship  
penalties were appropriate. The postseason ban was not appropriate 
since it involved young people who were not even at the university 
at the time of the infraction,'' said committee spokesman Michael 
Slive. 
</P>
<P>
	The infractions took place before Dale Brown retired as coach  
two years ago. None of the old coaching staff is still at LSU and 
only one player remains on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will ensure the school will receive about $1 million  
in tournament money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very large financial problem if we didn't go,''  
athletic director Joe Dean said. ``It is a great thing for our 
team. The appeal was worthwhile from that point of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Dean was welcoming the financial boon, coach John  
Brady was worrying about the effect of the scholarship reductions 
that stayed in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I never had the idea they would do is limit you to  
signing four over two years,'' Brady said. ``That was never an 
assumption of the university or anyone else for that matter. We 
knew there would be limited scholarships, but to not be able to 
sign more than four players over two years makes it much more 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school appealed the ban on postseason play this season, a  
limit of four new scholarships awarded during the next two years 
and an additional overall one-scholarship reduction for the 2001-02 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment was imposed after an investigation found several  
infractions, including an LSU booster's $5,000 payment to Earl to 
induce the former high school All-American to sign with the Tigers. 
Earl later transferred to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA sanctions were added to LSU's self-imposed sanctions,  
which included a loss of five scholarships during the next three 
years, a reduction of six official recruiting visits, forfeiture of 
five games in which Earl played and the disassociation of two LSU 
boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee announced their decision on Sunday, the day after  
the appeal, because of the effect on the SEC tournament, which 
begins in Atlanta on Thursday with LSU playing Florida. Normally, 
decisions are released days or weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU said in its appeal that there had never been a postseason  
ban placed on an institution when the NCAA hadn't found the school 
having a lack of institutional control. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady's worry is that player attrition could leave him short of  
players and unable to replace them without scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get to the point where we are equal with  
everyone else and then see what we are about,'' Brady said. ``This 
is just another thing we will work through and have to work 
through. We have to be more careful in our recruiting. If a player 
or two decides to leave for whatever reason, we won't be able to 
replenish the team in a normal way, but we'll work through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following LSU's hearing, Brown made a lengthy appearance before  
the Appeals Committee about an accusation by LaWanda Earl that he 
helped her secure a job. The end of the meeting was reportedly 
punctuated with a fist-pounding thud easily heard outside the 
closed doors of the meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown would not comment on the proceedings. However, he did say  
he presented the committee with information it had not seen before. 
Slive said a ruling on Brown's appeal will come later.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Options Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Carl Levin, an author of the Independent  
Counsel Act 20 years ago, said Sunday the law may be beyond rescue 
as a result of Kenneth Starr's investigation of the White House. He 
proposed that the Justice Department be given new tools to 
investigate possible wrongdoing within the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Other senators agreed that the law, enacted after Watergate, was  
unlikely to survive when it's current authorization expires on June 
30. Most welcomed its demise. 
</P>
<P>
	``My great fear is that the excesses of Kenneth Starr have now  
made it almost impossible for us to reauthorize this,'' Levin, 
D-Mich., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Levin suggested that if 
it can't be saved, one alternative might be giving the Justice 
Department's Office of Public Integrity greater investigative 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1978 law grew out of President Nixon's firing of Archibald  
Cox, the special counsel investigating Watergate. The aim was to 
ensure that future investigations of high officials could be 
carried out without fear of interference from the president or his 
appointees at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate Governmental  
Affairs Committee, which is holding hearings on the act, said the 
act is going to die not because of Starr but because of a 
fundamental problem in balancing independence with accountability. 
``We've concluded you can't have both at the same time,'' said 
Thompson, who appeared on NBC and CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said the 20 independent counsels  
appointed under the act had spent $150 million. ``We're avoiding 
other policy issues, we're wasting money, we're destroying the 
reputations of people,'' he said. ``We ought to give it a decent 
burial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for us to close the books and try to find  
another way within the Justice Department itself to handle these 
responsibilities,'' Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the law was enacted, the Attorney General could name  
special counsels who had less independence and were more beholden 
to the Justice Department. Dodd noted that the system worked well 
during Watergate, when Cox's successor, special counsel Leon 
Jaworski, went on to win 39 convictions on 45 indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said that returning to some form of the old system  
``would require Congress to do a better job,... would require 
Justice to be more accountable and it would require the American 
people to pay more attention and demand that justice be done in 
these cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., on CNN, said that of the six  
special prosecutors appointed by presidents through Nixon, three 
were fired, and Congress should use caution in abandoning the 
current system. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel law was allowed to expire in 1992, when  
Republicans were unhappy with independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's 
long and expensive inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair. It was 
finally reauthorized in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, Lieberman said, ``are falling into that same trap''  
because they object to Starr's four-year, $40 million investigation 
of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	A House subcommittee holds hearings on Tuesday, and Thompson's  
committee will hold one Wednesday to hear arguments for or against 
the statute and possible alternatives.

<HEADLINE> Saint Louis Coach May Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Saint Louis coach Charlie Spoonhour is expected  
to announce his resignation at the end of the latest in a series of 
frustrating seasons, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint Louis is 14-15 heading into Wednesday's first-round game  
against Marquette in the Conference USA tournament. It's a big 
letdown from last season, when freshman guard Larry Hughes led the 
team to 22 victories and the NCAA tournament. Hughes left for the 
NBA after only one season and Spoonhour couldn't fill the huge gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour produced consecutive NCAA appearances in 1994 and '95,  
both 23-win seasons, but followed up with disappointing records of 
16-14 and 11-18 before Hughes decided to stay home in part because 
of his ailing younger brother. Otherwise, Spoonhour has lost 
recruiting battles for the city's top talent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 Division I seasons, Spoonhour is 318-170. Before coming to  
Saint Louis, he produced five NCAA tournament teams in nine seasons 
at Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Doug McIlhagga could not confirm reports that the  
school was ready to make a change after seven seasons under 
Spoonhour. 
</P>
<P>
	But rumors have circulated for months that Spoonhour, who has  
four years to go on a contract that pays him $325,000, has been 
talking about resigning or retiring. KSDK in St. Louis reported 
Sunday night that Spoonhour would quit after the Billikens' season 
ends, and that he would recommend longtime assistant Greg Lackey as 
his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour downplayed the talk after a victory in mid-January in  
an interview with the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we lose, I think about it,'' Spoonhour said. ``Then  
we win and I think I could coach forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said then that nothing would be decided until the season  
is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour made no mention of his future at the team's annual  
awards banquet Sunday night at a local hotel, but later said 
``Anybody can hang on and keep making money. I don't want to do 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Software Gives Doctors 3-D View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With the ease of a youngster playing a video  
game, Dr. Sean Casey brings up on his computer screen a 
three-dimensional image of the arteries at the base of a patient's 
skull. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes about three minutes to surf through the circle of  
arteries, manipulating the image to view the surface and inside of 
the vessels from different angles as he searches for an aneurysm, a 
bulge in a weakened artery wall that could burst, causing a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability to magnify the picture makes Casey's job a lot  
easier. A radiologist, he uses the sophisticated Vitrea software at 
Fairview-University Medical Center to quickly read and evaluate 
three-dimensional information transmitted from computed tomography 
and magnetic resonance scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairview-University, affiliated with the University of Minnesota  
Medical School, is one of 10 medical facilities that worked with 
Vital Images Inc. in testing the Vitrea software now being used in 
about 80 clinics and hospitals around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey says the software allows him to do work in two to three  
minutes that used to take hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The software stacks images from the scanner and makes a 3-D  
model, which enables a technician or physician to peel back 
successive layers of an image to look deeper into the body. The 
technology also can be used to take a visual trip through the 
trachea, esophagus or colon or get a 3-D image of a shattered bone 
before surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, doctors suggested, Vitrea may eliminate the need  
by many patients for more expensive, invasive, and risky diagnostic 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 3-D imaging capabilities, clinicians looked at a series  
of two-dimensional images to imagine how the internal organs or a 
broken bone looked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the technology is so new, we're at a stage where we're  
still doing both. I think it will take a few years before the 
surgeon is comfortable with using just this,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Casey said, using Vitrea has decreased by about half  
the number of catheter angiograms done at Fairview-University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of this technology generally is to make an impact on  
a large number of patients. If somebody has an aneurysm in their 
brain, being able to go to your local hospital and have confidence 
they'll be able to perform the procedure at one-fifth the cost and 
more safely,'' said Vincent Argiro, who founded Vital Images in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began concentrating on the medical imaging market in  
late 1995 after receiving government clearance for its earlier 
VoxelView software as a medical device. Earlier, Vital Images also 
had created 3-D visualization software used in oil and gas 
exploration, seismic interpretation and reservoir modeling and 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Kach, clinic administrator of Diagnostic Radiology  
Associates of Wisconsin, sees a good future for the Vitrea 
software. His small clinic in Rice Lake, Wis., has used it for 
about 250 patients in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the tip of the iceberg of its capabilities,''  
Kach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's a surgical case, (the surgeons) have a much, much  
clearer picture of what they're going to be faced with. It leaves 
nothing to the imagination,'' Kach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact has been profound,'' said Dr. Pablo Villablanca,  
assistant professor of radiology at UCLA Medical Center, which 
expects to have five Vitrea workstations in use by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	By reducing the need for some invasive procedures, the medical  
center has cut patient morbidity, study time and diagnostic costs 
and improved treatment planning, Villablanca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers of some of the larger CT and MR scanners also make  
3-D imaging workstations, but the doctors said those systems tend 
to be more expensive than the complete Vitrea system, which costs 
about $70,000. They also are slower and more difficult to use, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of these products comes anywhere near the quality that  
Vitrea and Vital Images has. It's really a superior product. I 
think we have taken 3-D imaging to a whole new dimension,'' 
Villablanca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Harris, head of the computer-aided diagnostic center at  
Massachusetts General Hospital, had four Vitrea work stations 
installed in early January after using a demonstration system for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a significant investment,'' Harris said. ``We  
researched what we thought would be the best use of our resources 
and this is the decision that we made based on what we found 
available. It's fast. It's easy to use. It has very high-quality 
renderings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vital Images' Argiro said sales are meeting expectations and the  
company's goal is to move into the black this year. Share of the 
Minneapolis-based company are lightly traded on an over-the-counter 
bulletin board. Argiro hopes to have the company listed on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``An indication of what we can accomplish is that we have  
cracked into a layer of hospitals which have never used technology 
like this before. Now more than 50 percent of our sales are coming 
from small hospitals and private radiology clinics. We believe the 
ultimate market is very large,'' Argiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just lends itself so well to patient care,'' Kach said. ``A  
lot of companies come up with different items to be used for 
patient care and a majority of those really don't make a big 
difference on how our doctors are going to care for that patient. 
This does.''

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Roger Clemens' debut for the New York Yankees is all set.  
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young winner will make his first spring  
training start Saturday on the road in a split-squad game against 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre picked Clemens to pitch in Haines City, Fla.,  
about 60 miles east of the Yankees' camp in Tampa, for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay away from the media circus more than  
anything,'' Torre said. ``That was the purpose for not pitching him 
against Toronto the first couple of days and I said I might as well 
do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, traded by Toronto to the World Series champions on Feb.  
18, will work a maximum of three innings or around 45 pitches 
against the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens threw 56 pitches during his second batting practice  
stint on Sunday. Torre has not decided on who will start the 
regular-season opener at Oakland or the Yankee Stadium opener 
against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still haven't put it together yet,'' Torre said. ``We have  
a lot options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates, meanwhile, are becoming concerned about  
right fielder Jose Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates excused him from the first few days of spring  
training because of his father's death. But as of Sunday, they had 
not heard from him for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	And, aware of how close Guillen was to his father, the Pirates  
were worried he wouldn't be able to fully concentrate on baseball 
once he arrives at Bradenton, Fla., from the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to get him in here so we can get him going,''  
general manager Cam Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen hit .267 with 14 home runs and 84 RBIs last season. If  
he does not report in the next several days, Al Martin will 
probably start in left field and Brian Giles might make a few 
starts in right field once the exhibition games begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies have no such concerns about third baseman  
Vinny Castilla, especially this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, born in Mexico, has already circled April 4 on his  
calendar -- that's the date the Rockies play San Diego in the major 
league opener at Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited about this game,'' Castilla said at Tucson,  
Ariz. ``It's going to be in front of my people. They've followed me 
all through my career. ... People love me over there. I love them, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, who has hit at least 40 home runs in three straight  
seasons, is Mexico's biggest baseball star since Fernando 
Valenzuela started throwing his screwball for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like the president out there,'' said Colorado Rockies  
outfielder Curtis Goodwin, who played with Castilla in the Mexican 
winter league. ``He's probably bigger than the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves also seem to be looking ahead to the start of  
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox, who already has chosen rookie Bruce Chen as  
the starter for the Grapefruit League opener Friday against 
Houston, revealed the rest of his pitching plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the process, Cox gave the likely order for his top four  
starters once the real season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Cy Young winner Tom Glavine will pitch Saturday against Tampa  
Bay, meaning he probably will start the April 5 opener against 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine will be followed by Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Kevin  
Millwood (17-8), which seems the logical order for the rotation. 
Chen is expected to be the fifth starter.

<HEADLINE> Working Mom Absences Said Unharmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study evaluating the development and health  
of more than 6,000 youngsters suggests that children of women who 
work outside the home suffer no permanent harm because of their 
mother's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found there was no difference between children whose mothers  
were employed versus children whose mothers were not employed 
during the first three years,'' said Elizabeth Harvey, a 
psychologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``Being 
employed is not going to harm the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey's study, published in the March issue of the journal  
Developmental Psychology, came to a different conclusion than some 
earlier studies of the same group of children. The new work 
examined the children at a later age, 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	This suggests, said David Eggebeen of Pennsylvania State  
University, who co-authored an earlier study, that problems 
detected in children of working mothers at age 3 and 4 may have 
gone away by the time the children were 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harvey's study suggests that the number of hours spent away  
from home is not as important as the quality of parenting,'' said 
Lindsay Chase-Lansdale, an associate professor of human development 
at the University of Chicago. She called the Harvey study ``an 
important contribution'' but not the final answer on issues 
relating to children and working mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Harvey used data from the National Longitudinal  
Survey of Youth, an in-depth interview study of 12,000 young people 
between the ages of 14 and 22 that started in 1979. Harvey 
concentrated on children born to the women in the study after 1980. 
The children were assessed every other year from 1986 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more than 6,000 children of all races in Harvey's  
study, most evaluated more than once. The youngest child assessed 
was 3, the oldest 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey used standard psychological tests to evaluate children's  
language development, academic achievement, self-esteem and 
behavior problems. Some of the results were based on reports of the 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison with children of mothers who did not work, Harvey  
said she found no statistically significant difference in any of 
the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when comparing children within the group of mothers who  
had outside employment, Harvey found very slight differences that 
were dependent on how many hours the mother worked and how soon she 
started work after the child was born. Some women in the study 
returned to work as quickly as four weeks after giving birth, while 
others waited three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Returning to work later and having more breaks in employment  
was associated with more compliant children,'' said Harvey. ``The 
children (of later-working mothers) were better behaved'' between 
the ages of three and four. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she noted, ``the difference was very tiny and disappeared  
by the age of 5,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another slight difference, apparent only in the scientific  
tests, was linked to the number of hours per week worked by the 
mothers, the researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more hours the mother worked per week during the first  
three years, the lower the children's language development and 
academic achievement,'' Harvey said. ``But, again, these effects 
were very tiny -- so small you would have a hard time detecting 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the age of 10, the difference in academic achievement went  
away. She said the language development difference ``never went 
away in the data, but got continuously smaller by the age of 12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fundamentally, said Harvey, the study suggests issues exist in  
raising children that are more important than outside employment of 
the mother. These include the quality of the parent-child 
relationship and the quality of the child's day-care arrangement, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message should be that being at home during the early  
years, or being employed during those years, are both good 
choices,'' Harvey said. ``Both can result in healthy, 
well-developed children.''

<HEADLINE> Colts To Sign Ex-Giant DE Bratzke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts have agreed to terms  
with former New York Giants defensive end Chad Bratzke in an effort 
to upgrade their sagging defense, team officials announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Indianapolis Star and  
News reported today that Bratzke agreed to a multiyear contract 
paying him more than $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bratzke, who became an unrestricted free agent this year, was  
the top DE in this year's market. He ranked eighth in the NFL with 
11.5 sacks last season and has started 42 of 50 games with the 
Giants since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He visited the Colts on Wednesday and has also met with Chicago,  
Tennessee and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Bratzke, 27, was taken by the Giants in the fifth round of the  
1994 draft out of Eastern Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts have also signed former Carolina defensive end Shawn  
King and safety Chad Cota from New Orleans, reuniting both with 
Colts general manager Bill Polian, who drafted them while working 
as Panthers general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts have also added Vic Fangio as defensive coordinator  
and Michigan State assistant Tood Grantham as line coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said the team also is interested in Atlanta linebacker  
Cornelius Bennett, although nothing has been finalized. Bennett was 
the Colts' top pick in the 1987 draft before being traded to the 
Buffalo Bills.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry To Open Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After nearly two months without a live witness and  
a 2 1/2-week break for the jury while attorneys argued over thousands 
of documents, the tobacco industry is set to defend itself in a 
landmark smoking case. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first class-action lawsuit by smokers to reach trial.  
In this first phase, a jury will determine whether the defendants -- 
Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and other cigarette 
makers and industry groups -- are responsible for injuries the 
plaintiffs claim they suffered because they were deceived into 
taking up a habit they couldn't quit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tobacco companies are found liable, the jury will then  
decide which of the named plaintiffs should receive punitive 
damages. After that, other smokers could pursue their own trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense was scheduled to start its presentation Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Edward L. Sweda, senior attorney with the Boston-based Tobacco  
Products Liability Project, said the industry lawyers won't be able 
to use some of their favorite defenses, such as blaming the smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury's focus, particularly in the initial phase, is on the  
industry's conduct,'' Sweda said. ``So (the industry is) in a very 
difficult position to try to explain away the long history of what 
they have done, and what their own documents spell out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The papers admitted include letters detailing attempts to  
influence scientists' interpretations of their research and figure 
out ways to keep negative findings from being used against the 
industry in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began, the tobacco industry has already been  
dealt a blow via the Feb. 10 verdict in a California smoker's 
trial. Patricia Henley, a former three-pack-a-day smoker with 
inoperable lung cancer, contended Philip Morris had concealed the 
risks and addictiveness of smoking -- some of same issues raised in 
the Florida case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors awarded Henley $51.5 million. Of that, $50 million was  
punitive damages, far exceeding the $15 million her attorneys had 
sought.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox's Lowe Returns to Bullpen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Derek Lowe is looking forward to  
pitching 70 games for the Red Sox this season. Just don't ask him 
to pitch the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, who came to Boston in a trade with Seattle midway through  
the 1997 season, has been dominating out of the bullpen but 
disappointing as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He says it's because he can't show hitters all his pitches on  
their first at-bat since they'll be used to his repertoire the next 
time around the lineup. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan says it's 
because a starter needs three outstanding pitches and Lowe has just 
two -- a sinker and a curve. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, Lowe was 0-7 with a 5.81 ERA in 10 starts  
last season and 3-2 with a 2.88 ERA and four saves in 53 relief 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, I really enjoyed starting, but toward the  
end it was getting kind of monotonous with all the losing,'' Lowe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston obtained Lowe from Seattle with catcher Jason Varitek for  
reliever Heathcliff Slocumb, who struggled and is now with 
Baltimore. Lowe, 25, and Varitek, 26, are two of Boston's most 
promising young players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox have shown no desire to involve Lowe in another  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me any team I ever talked to in those winter  
meetings always seemed to want to bring up his name,'' Boston 
manager Jimy Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be wanted, but you can't think about it too  
much,'' Lowe said. ``I'm happy they didn't trade me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was glad to leave Seattle where, he said, he didn't get the  
positive reinforcement that Williams and Kerrigan provide even when 
he struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt somewhat of an outcast at times,'' Lowe said.  
``You'd have a bad game and no one would really say much to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Lowe's sinker is so good that he led the majors last year  
with a ratio of allowing 4.58 ground balls to every fly ball. For 
every nine balls hit fairly, seven went on the ground. Terry Adams 
of the Chicago Cubs was a distant second at 2.82. Kerrigan says 
Lowe's ratio is the best since such statistics were first kept in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``You bring him in in the middle of an inning with runners at  
first and third and one out or nobody out, you know you've got a 
good chance to get that double play,'' Kerrigan said. ``His sinker 
is very consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Varitek, who played with Lowe in the Seattle system, said,  
``when I first caught him he threw about 83, 84, 85 mph and now 
he's back up to 89, 90, 91. It makes a big difference when you've 
got his kind of sinker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox wanted to use Lowe as a reliever but injuries forced  
him into a starting role last season and, after the sinker and 
curve, his third best pitch, the changeup, was inconsistent. He was 
back in the bullpen for good after his last start on June 28, a 5-1 
loss to Florida that dropped his record to 0-7. 
</P>
<P>
	He was outstanding the rest of the way. In the AL Division  
series, won by Cleveland 3-1, Lowe allowed one earned run in 4 1-3 
innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every player wants to end the year on a high and I was able to  
do that,'' he said. ``When you've had success (as a reliever) 
you're comfortable in that role and, at the time, it was a good 
move to get me back into the role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unimpressive statistics as a starter, Kerrigan  
thinks Lowe benefited from that ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting really educated him,'' Kerrigan said. ``It threw all  
the variables at him that he had to know about growing up and 
learning how to be a pitcher in the big leagues, and the situations 
you're faced with that you have to come up with a plan for in the 
middle of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he went back to the bullpen, he became a better  
pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe and Jim Corsi are expected to share the middle relief and  
setup jobs for closer Tom Gordon, who was successful in 46 of his 
47 save opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just go as hard as you can, knowing you're not going to be  
out there for the long haul,'' Lowe said. ``I learned a lot last 
year so, hopefully, I can carry that over into this year.''

<HEADLINE> Transplants May Help Brittle Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Imagine crossing your fingers for good luck only to crush your  
knuckles. Or, shrinking from a mother's embrace because she could 
snap your ribs with a loving hug. 
</P>
<P>
	For thousands of people with catastrophically brittle bones, the  
most routine movements can be life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Now an experimental bone marrow transplant tried on three  
children with the crippling genetic disorder Osteogenesis 
Imperfecta has strengthened the youngsters' skeletons and reduced 
the frequency of debilitating fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplant study appears in the March issue of the  
scientific journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not cured the disease,'' said Edwin Horwitz, who  
directed the experimental transplants. ``Our goal was to reduce the 
severity of their symptoms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bone marrow transplantation is an arduous procedure most  
commonly used to kill late-stage cancers. After heavy doses of 
chemotherapy, patients are infused with stem cells that spawn new 
and healthy immune and blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The new method, tested at the St. Jude Children's Research  
Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., infused a different group of stem cells 
known as mesenchymal cells, or MSCs, that develop into bone and 
cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	The therapy previously only had been tried in laboratory mice.  
</P>
<P>
	Conventional treatment of OI is limited to surgically implanting  
metal rods along the long bones of the arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	If it succeeds in larger trials, transplanting MSC cells would  
be the first long-term treatment of OI. 
</P>
<P>
	The bone marrow transplant also might be used to treat other  
bone, joint and growth deformities, including osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``MSC transplantation holds promise,'' said Stanton L. Gerson, a  
bone marrow transplantation specialist at Case Western Reserve 
University in Cleveland who reviewed the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The OI Foundation in Gaithersburg, Md., refused to comment on  
the study before its publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease is linked to abnormalities in genes responsible for  
the production of collagen, the fibrous protein that forms the 
body's bones and connective tissues. It's also affected by 
increased absorption of bone cells and slow bone formation. 
</P>
<P>
	One in 50,000 persons in the United States suffer from OI. In  
severe cases, patients may suffer hundreds of fractures in a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetuses that develop OI in the womb rarely survive long after  
the trauma of birth. Youngsters with OI rarely grow more than 4 
feet tall and often are confined to wheelchairs. Most die early. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Memphis study, Horwitz and other researchers selected a  
girl and boy, both 13 months old, and a 32-month old boy for the 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 13 months before their transplants, each of the patients  
had snapped bones at least three times; the infant girl suffered 37 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	Horwitz infused each child with MSC cells donated by healthy  
brothers and sisters. Within six months the conditions of the three 
children improved, although their progress varied.

<HEADLINE> Flames Trade Fleury to Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Theo Fleury, one of the NHL's top scorers, was  
traded from the Calgary Flames to Colorado on Sunday in a move the 
Avalanche hope will bolster their offense for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theo Fleury will bring some additional scoring punch to our  
hockey club and much more,'' coach Bob Hartley said. ``For many 
years in this league, he has been a proven leader and a great 
playoff performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season,  
went to the Avalanche with winger Chris Dingman. The Flames 
received forward Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak and future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, a 30-year-old wing, has spent his entire NHL career with  
the Flames, winning a Stanley Cup with the team as a rookie in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 30 goals and 39 assists this season, ranking sixth in the  
NHL in scoring. He has said repeatedly he wouldn't sign a new 
contract until testing the free-agent market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an amazing opportunity that we couldn't let go by,''  
said Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Flames GM Al Coates didn't take issue with that.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Colorado Avalanche are a much better team today,'' he told  
The Canadian Press. ``Theo's a great player. We're going to miss 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, who flew into Denver on Sunday night and was met by an  
impromptu welcoming party of media, fans and curious passengers at 
Denver International Airport, said he was ``shocked'' when he was 
informed of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough, really tough'' to leave Calgary, he said. ``But  
I tell you, I was thrilled it was Colorado. They've got a great 
team. I think this is a great opportunity and a great situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected to be a rent-a-player for the playoffs or  
planned to be with Colorado beyond this season, he said, ``We'll 
see how it works out. My No. 1 focus is just hockey right now. The 
only reason why I'm here is to help this team win a Stanley Cup, 
and that's my intention. I don't think we need that distraction of 
me talking about my contract every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche lead the NHL's Northwest Division with a 30-22-8  
record but have been inconsistent. They began the year with a 1-5-1 
record, then later ran off a 12-game winning streak that was 
followed immediately by an 0-3-4 stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theo Fleury is an exciting player who will bring great energy  
to our club,'' Lacroix said. ``We were not the only NHL club 
interested in this type of player. We were able to make this deal 
mainly because of the depth in our organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Fleury's acquisition, Lacroix said, ``I think we have the  
potential to reach the ultimate (Stanley Cup) this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said he wasn't deterred by Fleury's contract status.  
</P>
<P>
	``We made this transaction purely on a hockey basis,'' he said.  
``The next few months will give us a chance to talk contract with 
Theo and his agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury became the Flames' career scoring leader last Friday. In  
791 games, he has 364 goals and 466 assists for 830 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Calgary's Cory Stillman said Fleury is ``by  
far our greatest player and he's proving it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley said he hasn't decided which line Fleury will play on,  
but said the acquisition probably means the breakup of the Peter 
Forsberg-Joe Sakic pairing that has worked well for much of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take some time to see who plays better with whom,''  
Hartley said. ``We have to give the players time to get adjusted to 
Theo and for him to get adjusted to us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave up two good players and a future prospect, but that's  
the price you pay in this business. It's a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic, who is a close friend of Fleury, said Fleury ``makes us  
that much better. I think what it really does is give us two solid 
lines. He's an exciting player who is great with the puck and is a 
spark plug out there. Obviously, we feel that with this trade we 
have a great chance to win the Stanley Cup. That's what this 
organization has always been about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right wing Adam Deadmarsh called the trade ``definitely a  
shocker'' and said Fleury is ``one of the best players in the 
league -- one of the top 15 players, I'd say, for sure. Who wouldn't 
want him on their team?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Adam Foote said Fleury ``gives us two huge lines now  
and just strengthens the whole team. He's an offensive threat, a 
natural goal scorer, and he's also going to bring leadership and 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingman, an enforcer, has played only two games this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Corbet, 25, has eight goals and 14 assists in 53 games but is  
currently sidelined with a strained hamstring. Belak, a 22-year-old 
prospect who was a No. 1 draft pick in 1994, had no points while 
appearing briefly in 22 games this season with the Avalanche. He 
currently is playing for Colorado's American Hockey League 
affiliate in Hershey, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's stance on free agency might explain why the Flames  
didn't get much in return for him. 
</P>
<P>
	While the trade immediately makes the Avalanche a serious  
Stanley Cup contender, it hurts the Flames (21-29-10) in the 
short-term. They are only two points behind Edmonton for the eighth 
and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, but now have lost 
their only true star.

<HEADLINE> Oil Glut Costing Norway Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A lingering glut on the world petroleum  
market has Norwegians bracing for a problem they had nearly 
forgotten after years of prospering on oil wealth: unemployment 
</P>
<P>
	Some fear the slump could cost 30,000 jobs in the national oil  
and shipyard industries. That would be a staggering blow to a 
country where an average of just 56,000 people -- 2.4 percent of the 
work force -- were without jobs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the government summoned representatives of the oil  
industry to see what could be done. Easing heavy taxes on oil was 
seen as possibility, although no decisions were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a willingness to pull together,'' said Oil Minister  
Marit Arnstad after the meeting. ``The industry itself is willing 
to make an effort, which it will have to do. The unions are willing 
to discuss things with industry, which they will have to do. And we 
from the government are open to considering measures, which we also 
have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norway is the world's second largest oil exporter, pumping about  
3 million barrels a day. With just 4.4 million people, the country 
has had more money than it could spend. The government has been 
salting away the surplus in a national Petroleum Fund that now has 
$22 billion as a cushion against the day oil production declines. 
</P>
<P>
	But oil prices are now below the $12 per barrel it costs for  
exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunnar Berge, head of the state petroleum directorate, last week  
said a sense of panic seemed to be spreading throughout the 
national oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Berge's comments came during what Norwegians are now calling  
``Hell Week.'' The country's three oil companies, state-owned 
Statoil, state-controlled Norsk Hydro and private Saga Petroleum, 
all announced poor profits and plans to lay off as many 3,500 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	A slump for oil companies can easily spread to other concerns  
that provide engineering services, supplies or build oil platforms. 
Aker Maritime -- a major offshore supplier -- last week said it may 
have to lay off 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effects of low oil prices on Norwegian society are  
serious,'' said Deputy Oil Minister Erlend Grimstad. ``But I don't 
agree that there is a panic by the oil companies or the 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the state labor directorate revised its  
unemployment projections for 1999, saying that the jobless rate 
would increase by 15,000 people to 3.1 percent by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be conservative. The Norwegian news agency NTB checked  
with virtually all oil-related concerns, which now employ 110,000 
people, and counted as many as 30,000 jobs that could disappear 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the problem in Norway's labor market seemed to be  
finding enough people to fill all the jobs. Unemployment was so low 
last year that labor unions were able squeeze a more than 6 percent 
average pay raise out of employers. The six-year boom was getting 
so hot last year that experts and the government feared the economy 
was set to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was also good news for Norway in its misery of low oil  
prices, according a report from the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development last week. 
</P>
<P>
	It said a tight 1999 budget adopted by the government, reduced  
spending by industry, if combined with moderate wage increases this 
year, could allow the Norwegian economy to cool off without 
nose-diving into a slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Svein Gjedrem, governor of the state central Bank of Norway,  
warned the government to resist the temptation to spend too much of 
its oil wealth to stimulate the economy and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pursuing such a policy -- assuming that the oil price remains  
low -- would have a major impact on the government's ability to 
finance the welfare state. He said at current oil prices, an 
increase in government spending of just one-half of a percent of 
gross national product per year would have Norway running a budget 
deficit in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The petroleum fund would suffer a sad fate and be depleted in  
18 years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> OSU's Cooper Looks at Big Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State's John Cooper is about to join  
an exclusive club -- college football coaches with contracts 
guaranteeing them at least $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unidentified sources told The Columbus Dispatch in a story  
published Sunday that Cooper and Ohio State are working on a new 
contract that will assure him of reaching the million-dollar 
plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract Cooper signed in 1995 has matured to nearly  
$750,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers include $170,772 in base salary, $290,000 in  
radio-TV compensation and $217,000 from the athletic department's 
multimillion-dollar contract with Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	Added to that will be a $35,000 bonus for taking the team to the  
Sugar Bowl; $10,000 for the team finishing in the top 10 of at 
least one major poll; and $10,000 for at least a nine-win season 
that included a victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also has earned three more ``rollover'' years to be added  
to the five-year contract he signed in 1995, meaning his current 
deal would take him through the 2002 season anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the total doesn't include what is said to be  
a $100,000 personal-services contract with the Kroger department 
store chain, and any other compensation he can find, with approval 
of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper is expected to join Florida's Steve Spurrier, Florida  
State's Bobby Bowden and Penn State's Joe Paterno as college 
football coaches thought to earn at least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent newcomers to the group include Mack Brown of Texas, Phil  
Fulmer of Tennessee, Rick Neuheisel of Washington, Bill Snyder of 
Kansas State and Tommy Tuberville of Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper won't talk about the prospects of joining the club, but  
athletics director Andy Geiger said the pay scale for coaches is 
being driven by the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might feel comfortable with it or not comfortable with it,  
but it falls under the 'facts of life' department,'' Geiger said.

<HEADLINE> ACC Tourney Is Next Duke Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Duke guard William Avery insists it  
will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
	But at this point the No. 1 Blue Devils are making everything  
look easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke routed No. 14 North Carolina 81-61 on Saturday night to  
become the first Atlantic Coast Conference school to complete the 
regular season at 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Blue Devils go at it again, trying to knock off three  
more league teams and capture the conference tournament that starts 
Thursday in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a great team, even better than I thought,'' North  
Carolina coach Bill Guthridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we played well in the first half but they have  
quickness and energy and they're well-coached. I've never seen 
anyone such an odds-on favorite to win the national championship. 
They're head and shoulders above everyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery scored 24 points and Elton Brand had 17 points and 13  
rebounds to lead the Blue Devils (29-1) to their school-record 24th 
straight victory with the win on their archrival's home floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hadn't won here since 1991 and we were looking to change  
that but we also wanted to get ready for the ACC tournament,'' 
Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven teams had perfect records in the ACC before the league  
expanded to nine teams in 1991-92, the last being North Carolina in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a special feat for us,'' Brand said. ``We did it. No one  
can take it away from us and it's very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels (22-8, 10-6 ACC) came into the game leading the  
league in rebounding (40.6 per game) and rebound margin (10.4). 
Their rebound margin, the best in ACC history, was also the tops in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Blue Devils met that challenge and did it without the  
scrappy Shane Battier, outrebounding the taller Tar Heels 52-36. 
Battier, the team's third-leading rebounder, dressed but did not 
play after spraining his left ankle in a 96-64 win over DePaul last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand and freshman Corey Maggette picked up the slack, combining  
for 24 rebounds, including 12 on the offensive glass alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the team not to concentrate on Battier being out or on  
Carolina or last year,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``I told 
them to concentrate on blocking out and executing, things we could 
be in control of. They did that the whole second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Carrawell added eight rebounds and Trajan Langdon  
contributed six. Even Avery, Duke's 6-foot-2 point guard, had four 
rebounds, one more than North Carolina's 7-foot center, Brendan 
Haywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebounding was the top priority in practice this week,'' Brand  
said. ``They're a huge team but our rebounding improved from that 
last game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's 52 rebounds was the most against North Carolina since  
Massachusetts grabbed 54 in a 91-86 win over the Tar Heels in 1993. 
The Blue Devils recorded their biggest victory in Chapel Hill since 
a 104-69 victory on Feb. 29, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as bad as we looked,'' Guthridge said. ``They've  
done that to every team. The way we played we could have beaten a 
lot of teams tonight, but not Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils pulled away in the second half with a 22-6 run  
that featured 3-pointers on three of four possessions. When Avery 
scored on a drive with 5:25 left to make it 68-47 and end the run, 
what had been a fired up sellout crowd became very quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was 46-41 we went to some of our sets and made some  
big shots,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We just had contributions from a 
whole bunch of people. I'm proud of winning here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haywood had 16 points to lead the Tar Heels, which shot 31  
percent in the second half (9-for-29) in their worst home loss 
since Temple beat them 83-66 in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Candidate's Phony Site Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A phony Internet Web site for Philadelphia  
mayoral candidate John White that mentioned his views on race was 
shut down Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, apparently designed by someone connected to an  
opponent's campaign, posted an apology before shutting down for 
``causing Mr. White's campaign some harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over the fake Web site has cost the jobs of two  
top campaign aides to Democratic rival Dwight Evans. At issue were 
quotes attributed to White, taken from a Spanish-language 
newspaper, about how black and Latino voters ought to consolidate 
political power. 
</P>
<P>
	The White campaign said it does not a have a Web page and that  
the quote was taken out of context. They also suggested the site 
was created as a smear campaign to create racial controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Evans and White are black. They are seeking the Democratic  
nomination in the race to replace Mayor Edward Rendell, who is 
barred by the city charter from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	The page was registered to a Cambridge, Mass., Web site designer  
Evans said was ``associated'' with his deputy campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The page displayed in large letters a quote from a White  
interview in Al Dia, which said, ``The black and the brown, if we 
unite, we're going to control this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said the quote was accurate, but had been taken out of  
context in Al Dia. What he meant, he said, was that minorities 
should participate in the political process.

<HEADLINE> USOC Ethics Report To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The role of the International Olympic Committee  
in cleaning up the worst scandal in the history of the games is 
expected to be a focus of an elite ethics report issued Monday, a 
source familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George  
Mitchell, is likely to suggest ways for the IOC to help avoid a 
recurrence of the bribery scandal that has erupted around Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, according to the 
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report will include some really creative things that the  
IOC should do to go forward, things we haven't heard about 
before,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC already has expelled five members and is investigating  
13 others in connection with the scandal. It has announced plans to 
radically change the way it selects Olympic host cities and even 
break its historic secrecy by submitting to frequent audits and 
issuing financial reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell commission is scheduled to release its report at a  
news conference Monday morning and was working through the night to 
finish its findings and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent inquiry probably won't contain new revelations  
of wrongdoing or list millions of dollars in improper inducements 
to IOC members, as two other investigations already have done. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mitchell's report to the U.S. Olympic Committee will draw a  
road map for future American bidders that won't include stops at 
the gift shop or help in getting athletes from overseas ready to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake scandal, the worst in Olympic history, pointed out  
those areas ripe for corruption. While Mitchell and his panel, 
including former White House chief of staff Ken Duberstein and 
baseball union chief Donald Fehr, have refused to discuss details 
of their two-month investigation, the former senator from Maine 
said it would look ahead, not back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis will be on recommendations for rules, compliance  
and enforcement which we hope, if adopted, will avoid a recurrence 
of the type of action that lead to the creation of the 
commission,'' Mitchell said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The report will go to the USOC's executive committee, which is  
to announce its response at its own news conference Wednesday in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's commission is a standing ethics watchdog for the  
USOC, appointed last year by committee president Bill Hybl. But to 
underscore the commission's independence, no USOC officials will 
share the stage with Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IOC and Salt Lake City Olympic officials have been  
damaged in the scandal, the USOC has escaped virtually unscathed. 
But two areas in which it did take hits are expected to be 
mentioned by the Mitchell report. 
</P>
<P>
	One is staff oversight. Alfredo la Mont resigned as the USOC's  
director of international relations last month after it was 
revealed he did consulting work for Salt Lake bid leader Tom Welch. 
Olympic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at the 
time that La Mont was paid to gather information on IOC members in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is training programs for foreign athletes. The USOC  
regularly provides facilities and supervision at its training 
centers for athletes from other nations, usually from the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
	While such programs are seen to epitomize the Olympic ideals of  
competition and fairness, cases in the United States and Australia 
showed that they could also be used to help bid committees foster 
goodwill with attractive packages offered around voting time. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the other two reports into Salt Lake released so far,  
Mitchell's commission lacked subpoena power and had to rely heavily 
on public record. 
</P>
<P>
	It received almost 200,000 documents from USOC files as well as  
responses from letters sent to some 400 present and former 
committee officials and staff members asking about gifts they 
received from Salt Lake or other cities hoping to be America's 
candidate for the 1988 and 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	All gifts, which could be a mundane as T-shirts or as  
extravagant as ski trips, are expected to be banned under upcoming 
USOC and IOC reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell report and USOC response, plus action by a special  
IOC assembly next month, will be watched closely in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating possible bribery, mail  
fraud and tax violations in the Salt Lake scandal, and the Senate 
Commerce Committee is considering hearings on the Olympics that 
could be aimed at punishing the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on Capitol Hill hearings won't be made until after  
the IOC session March 17-18, according to a spokeswoman for 
Commerce Committee vice chairman Sen. Ted Stevens.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Mulholland in Rotation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Terry Mulholland's arm should have been  
swollen, sore and drooping at his side. He'd thrown 121 pitches, 
going eight strong innings as the Chicago Cubs lost their 
regular-season finale to Houston last September. 
</P>
<P>
	But the next day, with the Cubs facing a one-game playoff to win  
the NL wild card, Mulholland walked into manager Jim Riggleman's 
office. If needed, he said, he could pitch again that night in 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	And he did, giving up a run and a hit but getting Barry Bonds to  
hit a ninth-inning sacrifice fly with the bases loaded for a key 
out in the Cubs' 5-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a rubber-armed performance Riggleman said he will never  
forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever seen anybody do something like that,''  
Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't seem that much out of the ordinary or strange for me  
to ever consider doing that,'' Mulholland said with a shrug, 
sitting by his locker in the Cubs' spring training clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously you don't see that happen that often, but the  
circumstances were such that it was in the season right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland wasn't always the happiest pitcher last season. He'd  
hoped to be a starter but spent most of his season -- 64 of 70 
appearances -- working out of the bullpen. He had a $550,000 base 
salary, and his contract was laden with incentives based on starts. 
</P>
<P>
	He made several key starts in September, including the one in  
Houston, but was so effective out of Chicago's struggling bullpen 
that's how he was used most often. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew I would use him the way I wanted to use him, and it  
was understood he didn't like it,'' Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no misunderstanding about that. I knew he didn't  
like it, and he knew I was going to do it. And he pitched his butt 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs thought so much of Mulholland's effort -- he finished  
6-5 with a 2.89 ERA-- they rewarded him with a two-year, $5.9 
million contract that included a $750,000 signing bonus, 
compensating for the incentives he missed from the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me a two-year deal, which no one in my entire career  
has ever done,'' said the 35-year-old left-hander, who was 
Chicago's opening day starter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the question surfaces again: Where will Mulholland be? A  
starter or back in the bullpen? For now, he's in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I don't expect anything. We're not all here to  
make Terry Mulholland happy,'' Mulholland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a personal standpoint, I'd prefer to start, but I know if I  
don't, I can still contribute quite a bit to the club. You know -- 
either or both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Cubs rotation also includes Kevin Tapani, Kerry  
Wood, Steve Trachsel and newcomer Jon Lieber, along with 
Mulholland. But with Jeremi Gonzalez, who underwent elbow surgery, 
expected back by mid-season, it's impossible to predict where 
Mulholland will end the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs have one lefty set for their bullpen, Felix Heredia,  
and are looking at several other candidates in spring camp. But 
Mulholland was so effective in relief, he could end up back there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're winning and Mulholland is in the rotation, we're not  
going to mess with that,'' Riggleman said. ``I don't know how it 
will shape up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland will accept whatever he's asked to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they need me as a starter, I can do that job. If they need  
me in relief, I can do that, too,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Fatal Mass. Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNN, Mass. (AP) -- The mother of a man police said threatened  
his ex-girlfriend's building with arson has been arrested in 
connection with a fire that killed five people there. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Hilton, 52, was scheduled to be arraigned Monday on  
murder and arson charges. She was arrested Saturday. Her son is no 
longer a suspect in the case, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all felt we had probable cause to make her arrest and  
charge her with the crime,'' prosecutor Kevin Burke said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities last week had arrested the son, 22-year-old Charles  
Loayza, and charged him with violating a restraining order after he 
threatened to burn the building where his ex-girlfriend, Krystina 
Sutherland, lived. He still faces that charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said Hilton was aware of her son's volatile relationship  
with Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of the relationship (between Loayza and Sutherland)  
was the basic fundamental cause or part of the motive for the 
fire,'' Burke said.

<HEADLINE> Reading on Clinton Vacation Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- While Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter  
Chelsea enjoy the sun and ski slopes, President Clinton is settling 
into a little quiet time at the gated multimillion-dollar estate of 
a Hollywood friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect he's doing exactly what he said he was (going to  
do), which is reading,'' said spokesman Barry Toiv. ``Work is low 
on the totem pole today as far as his priorities. He's on 
vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters en route to Park City from a fund-raising  
visit to Los Angeles that he was looking forward to a long weekend 
of reading with no bigger plans than perhaps a trip into town for 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons had a private dinner and a birthday cake Saturday  
night for Chelsea as she turned 19. It was the second straight year 
they have celebrated her birthday here. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady and Chelsea were spotted on the slopes Sunday by  
photographers and cameramen. Mrs. Clinton was overheard expressing 
irritation to Secret Service agents about someone who had skied too 
close to her. 
</P>
<P>
	As they did last year, the Clintons are staying at the home of  
Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who lent them his his estate 
in the Deer Valley Resort. Katzenberg has several intermediate ski 
runs just off his backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family arrived here Saturday and will stay until  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton does not ski. He tried it once 15 years ago in Sun  
Valley, Idaho, where he took repeated tumbles and finished the day 
with torn ligaments in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Clinton gets a national security report every day  
except Sunday, but that a national security official was on standby 
here if needed to brief him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the president strolled Park City's Main Street,  
shaking hands and visiting the historic jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, co-partner with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in  
DreamWorks SKG, is a big campaign donor to Clinton and other 
Democrats. The former Walt Disney Co. studio chief is a frequent 
guest at the White House and Clinton has stayed at his Malibu, 
Calif., home.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Seeks His Own Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- After spending his career performing roles  
written for others, Luciano Pavarotti would like someone to compose 
an opera with him in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been my dream of 20 years or more that a pop composer  
would put himself together with a classical composer and make an 
opera,'' the tenor said backstage while rehearsing for a Sunday 
appearance with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is writing music for someone like me today,'' Pavarotti  
said, describing himself as ``someone very romantic, someone who 
likes melody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a composer of opera today, one has to write dissonant  
music or one is considered antique. That is why I like to sing with 
pop singers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he got tired of performing the same repertoire,  
Pavarotti said, ``It is always a live performance. It is always 
risky. But on top of singing, which is a joy, they pay you for 
it.''

<HEADLINE> China Says Currency Is Main Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Maintaining a balance of international payments  
and protecting the stability of the currency are the two main goals 
in 1999 for China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, a 
Chinese newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Fuxiang, the foreign exchange bureau's director, also vowed  
to continue the government's clampdown on illegal foreign exchange 
trade, according to the Financial News, the official publication of 
the People's Bank of China, the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, an outflow of hard currency from China eroded foreign  
exchange reserves as fears mounted that Beijing might devalue its 
currency to boost exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government responded by tightening controls on trade  
financing, a major channel for converting the Chinese yuan into 
foreign exchange. Beijing also adopted a tougher stance toward the 
black market, making unofficial currency trade a criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, reserve levels rebounded, with China reporting $145  
billion in foreign exchange reserves at the end of 1998, up $5 
billion from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders, who pledged not to devalue the yuan in 1998 and  
reiterated that stance for this year as well, want to minimize 
points of weakness for the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials point to massive reserves, second largest in the world  
next to Japan's, as proof that it can keep the yuan stable. China 
also recorded a $43.59 billion trade surplus last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But stagnant exports, hurt by Asia's slow economic recovery,  
will make it difficult to match the same level in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Li, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange director, said  
China would try to make management of foreign exchange more 
efficient as part of efforts to bolster foreign trade and 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Sunday, Chinese analysts said China should  
increase its gold reserves to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar 
and to hedge against financial risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are problems with the dollar, there will be an  
international catastrophe,'' said Liu Shan'en, deputy director of 
the Gold Economic Development Research Center. ``An increase in our 
country's gold reserves is necessary,'' the Business Weekly quoted 
Liu as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	China doesn't disclose what portion of its foreign reserves are  
held in dollars, but officials acknowledge the bulk of it is 
invested in U.S. treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, China's gold reserves represented only 2.6 percent  
of total foreign reserves.

<HEADLINE> China To Cut Phone, Internet Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will slash long-distance telephone and  
Internet fees, the government announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese have faced high costs for making international phone  
calls and surfing the Internet. While these costs will drop 
beginning Monday, postal fees will go up 20 percent to 60 percent, 
the Ministry of Information Industry announced. 
</P>
<P>
	China's telecommunications monopoly, China Telecom, wanted to  
lower costs out of fear that high rates would strangle demand and 
innovation, according to the state-run news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the old rates, a call from Beijing to New York was billed  
at about three times the rate from New York to Beijing. Higher 
Internet service rates and lower incomes meant using the Internet 
in China was 30 times more expensive than in the United States, the 
official Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of calls to the United States will drop by 18 percent,  
Xinhua reported. Calls to other Asian countries will also cost 
less, it said without reporting the percentage amount of the 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet charges will drop by 50 percent, to about 50 cents per  
hour for the first 60 hours of use, the report said. Fees for 
telephone installation, local calls and mobile phones also will be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	China's government has been trying to loosen the Ministry of  
Information Industry's hold on China Telecom. A plan to break up 
the monopoly into separate companies offering services in four 
areas -- mobile communications, fixed line, paging and satellite 
data transmission -- has been submitted to the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Risks of Gasoline Additive Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DIAMOND BAR, Calif. (AP) -- Freda Kubas came to hear experts  
debate the perils of a gasoline additive, but she believes you 
don't have to be a chemist to know that the compound called MTBE 
can hurt your health. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cringe when I go to fill my car up with gas,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kubas blames seizures, gastrointestinal trouble and other health  
problems on MTBE, not to mention the virtual demise of Glenville, 
population about 130, near Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials found that the compound had leaked from the  
only gas station, ending up in private water wells and being drunk 
by ``nearly everybody in town'' at the local cafe, she said. The 
station, the cafe and the wells were shut down in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	California scientists, industry experts and people like Kubas on  
Feb. 19 opened the biggest debate to date on whether to stop use of 
smog-reducing MTBE, which is widely blamed for tainting drinking 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is one of several  
oxygenating agents that may be put in gasoline for cleaner 
combustion; ethanol is another. Manufacturers favor MTBE, however, 
and federal authorities say it has helped cut air pollution 
drastically. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaked into drinking water, MTBE may also pose higher risks of  
cancer, respiratory irritation and other health problems, according 
to a study by University of California scientists. The clear 
compound smells like turpentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the advent of unleaded gas in the 1980s, some  
refiners added MTBE in small doses. In urban California and other 
U.S. smog zones, the average blend jumped to about 11 percent MTBE 
when 1996 federal air control rules began requiring higher oxygen 
levels in gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The richer mixture means more MTBE is finding its way into lakes  
and groundwater from leaky tanks and two-cycle boat engines, UC 
experts told an audience of about 300 people at the first of two 
hearings sponsored by the state's Environmental Protection Agency. 
(The second was held in Sacramento on Feb. 23-24.) 
</P>
<P>
	``MTBE is an animal carcinogen, in our estimation,'' said Elinor  
Fanning of UCLA, an expert in environmental toxicology. The 
compound is ``potentially relevant to humans,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical manufacturers disputed the conclusion, which could  
reverberate in other states. The MTBE debate has also stirred 
recently in New England and other areas with traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	But California's is ``certainly the first public debate of this  
magnitude,'' said Don H. Olsen of Huntsman Corp., an MTBE 
manufacturer based in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several data gaps in the UC study,'' he said in an  
interview. The study, ``seriously overestimates the cost and 
underestimates the health benefits of MTBE. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to harming human health, MTBE has been shown to help  
human health,'' he said. ``It decreases exposure to harmful air 
emissions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fanning and other UC experts acknowledged that the compound  
hasn't been around long enough in volume to gather conclusive data. 
Since the study was circulated late last year, however, three tests 
on lab rats and mice have suggested that MTBE contributes to 
testicular tumors in males and kidney tumors in females, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heed the suggestions of risk that are there,'' she urged the  
state health regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings and study, published by UC Davis, were mandated in  
legislation sponsored by Sen. Richard Mountjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	The state legislator supports a ban on MTBE, which goes into  
most of California's 16.9 million cars, 5.6 million trucks 
(counting pickups) and 400,000 motorcycles. The UC scientists 
recommend phasing out MTBE. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis is to evaluate the testimony and the UC report  
and to issue findings on any MTBE risks. If he determines there are 
dangers, he is to take steps to protect public health. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, meanwhile, has asked Congress to  
drop California from the federal order requiring additives such as 
MTBE. 
</P>
<P>
	California's MTBE debate broke out at Lake Tahoe, where the  
chemical drips into the water from two-stroke boat motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Several counties, including Lake County, have adopted  
resolutions demanding it be banned. The 27-member Regional Council 
of Rural Counties said there was an ``urgent and convincing need'' 
to ban MTBE. 
</P>
<P>
	Other towns report MTBE buildups in underground drinking water  
due to leaking pipelines or tanks at filling stations. Santa Monica 
has one of the heaviest reported concentrations of that sort. 
</P>
<P>
	Statewide, MTBE has been detected at 3,180 groundwater sites,  
said John E. Reuter of UC Davis, a specialist in environmental 
sciences and a leading expert on MTBE. There may be up to 6,000 
MTBE-tainted spots all told, with more expected to show up as years 
pass, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Donner Lake, in the Sierra Nevada, MTBE concentrations rose  
along with boat use in summer and dropped after Labor Day, a study 
found. The chemical doesn't break down when it gets underground, 
and it moves more quickly than other gas components, UC scientists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our town is a ghost town because of the MTBEs,'' Kubas said.  
``We had state-of-the-art tanks. They didn't help any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gasoline doesn't belong in water, there's no doubt about  
that,'' Olsen said. ``But the problem isn't the compound, it's the 
container.'' The real culprits are leaks and two-cycle engines, he 
said.

	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo appears  
increasingly certain to win Nigeria's presidential vote. Election 
officials said Obasanjo had captured 62 percent of the vote with 31 
of Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital reporting. Final 
results were not expected until tomorrow. Obasanjo's opponent, Olu 
Falae, the former finance minister, plans to contest the results. 
International observers reported ballot box-stuffing and other 
serious voting irregularities. Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
nation, has never held a presidential election in which the loser 
accepted defeat.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Premier Upbeat on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The Hungarian economy is expected to  
grow from 4 to 5 percent this year, Prime Minister Viktor Orban 
said on state-run radio Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke to reassure the public that the economy remains strong  
despite the sudden decision nine days earlier to freeze $222 
million in contingency spending. 
</P>
<P>
	That move came in reaction to the dramatic widening of the  
country's current account deficit, which was $2.3 billion in 1998, 
up from $981 million in 1997. The current account, a broad measure 
of trade, measures the difference between income from foreign 
sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	On the issue of the need for a supplementary budget, Orban said  
first-quarter data and second-quarter trends must be studied before 
a decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the present economic situation, the ministries should not  
even think of getting supplementary funding,'' Orban said.

<HEADLINE> Evangelist Roberts Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Evangelist Oral Roberts was  
hospitalized in stable condition Sunday after suffering a mild 
heart attack two weeks ago, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, 81, underwent an angioplasty procedure at Hoag Memorial  
Hospital Presbyterian to reopen a primary artery in his heart -- the 
same artery that caused heart problems six years ago, hospital 
spokeswoman Debra Legan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The angioplasty was performed without any complications, she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oral is now recuperating. We hope he will be up and going  
soon,'' a statement released by the family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts founded the Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., and  
retired as its president in 1993. His son, Richard, is now 
president of the university, but Roberts still serves as chancellor 
and travels around the country on speaking engagements.

<HEADLINE> Working Mom Absences Said Unharmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children of women who work outside the home  
suffer no permanent harm because of their mother's absence, a study 
that evaluated the development and health of more than 6,000 
youngsters suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found there was no difference between children whose mothers  
were employed versus children whose mothers were not employed 
during the first three years,'' said Elizabeth Harvey, a 
psychologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``Being 
employed is not going to harm the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey's study, published in the March issue of the journal  
Developmental Psychology, came to a different conclusion than some 
earlier studies of the same group of children. The new work 
examined the children at a later age, 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	This suggests, said David Eggebeen of Pennsylvania State  
University, who co-authored an earlier study, that problems 
detected in children of working mothers at age 3 and 4 may have 
gone away by the time the children were 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harvey's study suggests that the number of hours spent away  
from home is not as important as the quality of parenting,'' said 
Lindsay Chase-Lansdale, an associate professor of human development 
at the University of Chicago. She called the Harvey study ``an 
important contribution'' but not the final answer on issues 
relating to children and working mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Harvey used data from the National Longitudinal  
Survey of Youth, an in-depth interview study of 12,000 young people 
between the ages of 14 and 22 that started in 1979. Harvey 
concentrated on children born to the women in the study after 1980. 
The children were assessed every other year from 1986 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more than 6,000 children of all races in Harvey's  
study, most evaluated more than once. The youngest child assessed 
was 3, the oldest 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey used standard psychological tests to evaluate children's  
language development, academic achievement, self-esteem and 
behavior problems. Some of the results were based on reports of the 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison with children of mothers who did not work, Harvey  
said she found no statistically significant difference in any of 
the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when comparing children within the group of mothers who  
had outside employment, Harvey found very slight differences that 
were dependent on how many hours the mother worked and how soon she 
started work after the child was born. Some women in the study 
returned to work as quickly as four weeks after giving birth, while 
others waited three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Returning to work later and having more breaks in employment  
was associated with more compliant children,'' said Harvey. ``The 
children (of later-working mothers) were better behaved'' between 
the ages of three and four. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she noted, ``the difference was very tiny and disappeared  
by the age of 5,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another slight difference, apparent only in the scientific  
tests, was linked to the number of hours per week worked by the 
mothers, the researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more hours the mother worked per week during the first  
three years, the lower the children's language development and 
academic achievement,'' Harvey said. ``But, again, these effects 
were very tiny -- so small you would have a hard time detecting 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the age of 10, the difference in academic achievement went  
away. She said the language development difference ``never went 
away in the data, but got continuously smaller by the age of 12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fundamentally, said Harvey, the study suggests issues exist in  
raising children that are more important than outside employment of 
the mother. These include the quality of the parent-child 
relationship and the quality of the child's day-care arrangement, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message should be that being at home during the early  
years, or being employed during those years, are both good 
choices,'' Harvey said. ``Both can result in healthy, 
well-developed children.''

<HEADLINE> Magee Has Week of Career  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- It was the week of Andrew Magee's  
career, though it ended abruptly with Jeff Maggert costing him 
$500,000 with one shot. 
</P>
<P>
	This was one second place finish he would savor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day I'll never forget,'' Magee said. ``This week was  
the best I've had on tour. I'll remember this even more than my 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Magee was disappointed that Maggert chipped in on the 38th  
hole of the day to win the $1 million first prize, he didn't show 
it a few minutes later as he sipped a light beer and looked back on 
a match that might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the $500,000 he pocketed for second helped ease the  
load. His biggest previous payday was $270,000 for winning the Las 
Vegas Invitational -- one of four career wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about the money all day,'' Magee said. ``It's my  
biggest paycheck by double.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magee could do nothing but watch with a wry grin on his face as  
Maggert's chip rattled into the hole for birdie on the par-3 11th 
for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	He had just missed a long putt for birdie himself and was  
already thinking about how he was going to play the next hole when 
the chip dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ending was classic,'' Magee said. ``I even enjoyed it a  
little bit being the weirdo I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magee, who had beaten five other opponents going into Sunday's  
final, would have been the first champion if the final had only 
gone 18 holes like all the other matches. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 3-up after nine holes and 2-up after 18, only to see his  
lead evaporate in the afternoon 18. By the time Maggert rolled in a 
short birdie putt on No. 13 the match was even, and they would both 
par the next six holes before Maggert's chip-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee just missed a 12-footer on the 17th hole to take the lead,  
then had a putt from the fringe on 18 come up just short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I made the putt on 17,'' he said. ``And I thought I  
was going to hole out on the last hole. That was my mentality this 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the chip-in ended Magee's tournament just as he had  
ended John Huston's in the semifinals when he chipped in on the 
17th hole for a win. 
</P>

	``I have no regrets,'' he said. ``I played as good as I could.  
That was a lot of golf.''

<P>
	Indeed it was. Magee had played 126 holes when Maggert suddenly

tour.

<P>
	The two players may not have been names like Tiger Woods and  
David Duval that tournament organizers hoped for in the finals, but 
they played a match that certainly surpassed expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (fans) could just kind of put blinders on and think we  
were Tiger and Duval out there,'' Magee said. ``They wouldn't have 
known the difference.''

<HEADLINE> Hasbro Creates Bob Hope G.I. Doll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Hope, who has received numerous accolades  
for entertaining U.S. troops, is getting another honor: a G.I. doll 
created in his likeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hollywood Hero'' has been designed to pay homage to the  
95-year-old comedian, who spent a half-century entertaining U.S. 
troops around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard how much he likes it,'' Jon Fitch, associate  
marketing manager of Hasbro, told the March 6 edition of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hope Enterprises was involved in all of it, right down to the  
scoop on the nose,'' Fitch said. ``They even asked us to make it 
more prominent than we originally had it.''

<HEADLINE> Shinn Accuser Wants Him Accountable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The woman accusing Charlotte Hornets  
owner George Shinn of sexual assault at his South Carolina home in 
1997 says she's suing him to keep the millionaire businessman 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day, I'll have to explain to my daughter what happened,''  
said Leslie Price, who agreed to identify herself publicly in an 
interview with The Charlotte Observer. ``What would I tell her if I 
didn't challenge him? That I gave in? That I let him get away with 
it? ... I can't let him do it again, not to me or anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price, 29, of Matthews, accuses Shinn in a Richland County,  
S.C., lawsuit of forcing her to perform oral sex at Shinn's 
mansion. Shinn, 57, has acknowledged having sex with Price but says 
it was consensual. Price is seeking unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn was not charged with a crime. Prosecutors said there was  
not enough evidence to prove criminal charges. He declined to be 
interviewed for an Observer article published Sunday, but he issued 
a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly sorry for the pain these false accusations have  
caused my family, friends, employees and our fans and community,'' 
Shinn said in the release. ``... There are those who will take 
extreme measures to discredit someone whose life is very public, 
and I am trying to cope with that in the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to my family, friends and a strong organization, I've  
begun to rebuild my life and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn's attorneys call Price a liar with a history of  
instability and an opportunist. Shinn has countersued in Charlotte, 
alleging he was slandered and targeted in a $5 million extortion 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who was separated at the time of the encounter with  
Shinn, says she is now reunited with her husband, Jeff. They have a 
daughter. She's also free from a seven-year addiction to pain 
killers and says she nearly died during an overdose two months 
before meeting Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Price spends her days working with attorneys on her case and  
searching the Internet for information about Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I'm the last person on earth George Shinn thought  
would stand up to him,'' she said. ``You don't want to look at it 
like a personal vendetta, but it is a vendetta. You can't get any 
more personal than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Shinn offered to introduce Price to a lawyer  
who could help her with child custody problems. The encounter 
occurred when Shinn drove her to his house in Tega Cay, S.C. 
instead of driving to a meeting with the attorney, according to 
Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviews by the Observer and investigative files show Shinn  
and Price tell vastly different stories, contradicting each other 
in almost every important detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn paints Price as an eager, assertive sex partner. He did  
nothing, he says, that she might have misunderstood as force. Price 
recounts a violent, humiliating sex act. She struggled and 
screamed, she says, and Shinn could not have mistaken that for 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Price's lawsuit may go to trial this spring in Richland County.  
Both sides call an out-of-court settlement unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Schwarzkopf Honors Gulf War Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Under light rain and an overcast sky,  
retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and Kuwait's ambassador to the 
United States placed a wreath Sunday to honor the U.S. soldiers who 
died in connection with the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, attended by about  
300 of the victims' family members, marked the eighth anniversary 
of the Gulf War's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarzkopf said the troops he commanded ``willingly faced death  
so that others might be free.'' He praised the soldiers' commitment 
to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't want to go to war, they didn't want to leave their  
families, but when their country asked them to, they did, because 
they thought it was the right thing to do,'' Schwarzkopf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting back tears, Schwarzkopf looked at the audience: ``They  
were truly, truly the best thing America has to offer the world. 
I'm sorry I couldn't bring them all back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Desert Storm, the 43-day war that included a sustained  
bombing attack and a 100-hour ground campaign, 147 Americans died 
in action. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's ceremony also honored an additional 289 service members  
who died in accidents during the war itself as well as during the 
multimonth Desert Shield buildup and during the ongoing Provide 
Comfort operation under which U.S. forces continue to patrol the 
skies over northern and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Mohammed Sabah Al-Salim Al-Sabah thanked the American  
troops for helping to regain his country's independence and called 
the United States the only country with the ``moral fortitude'' to 
put down Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. On Saturday, Al-Sabah 
hosted the family members in the Kuwaiti Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was attended by representatives of the nine other  
countries of the anti-Iraq coalition that suffered casualties in 
the Gulf War. Each representative, escorted by a Kuwaiti 
schoolchild, placed a flag on a panel honoring the war dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The guests recited a pledge, read in English and Arabic by  
children of soldiers who died in the Gulf War: ``I hereby commit 
myself to fostering peace. I promise to do everything I can to help 
create a common future of peace with justice for all human 
beings.''

 *Michael Avallone    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Angelo Avallone, a mystery writer who  
penned the Ed Noon series and whose original novels were based on 
the television series ``The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' and ``Hawaii 
Five-0,'' died Friday after suffering from heart failure. He was 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	Avallone wrote more than 200 books and short stories during his  
45 year career, including Westerns, horror stories and children's 
books. He was best known as the author of the Ed Noon series of 
detective novels published between 1953 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Avallone also wrote movie novelizations, including ``Beneath the  
Planet of Apes'' and ``Shock Corridor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The author, whose works were translated and published around the  
world, once said he began to write ``when he discovered pencils'' 
and said: ``I never wrote a book I didn't like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first novel, ``The Tall Dolores,'' was published in 1953 and  
featured his detective character Ed Noon. He went on to pen 36 Ed 
Noon novels. His last Noon novel, ``High Noon at Midnight,'' 
featured an older detective, much like the author, and addressed 
the author's thoughts on aging. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote gothic romances under the pen name Edwina Noone.

 *Stanley Dance    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jazz critic Stanley Dance, a confidant of Duke  
Ellington and Earl Hines who won a Grammy in 1963, died Tuesday of 
pneumonia. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Dance was one of the genre's most respected critics and his work  
spanned 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Revered by fans and musicians, Dance coined the term  
``mainstream'' as a way to describe a jazz style. He won a Grammy 
Award in 1963 for writing the liner notes for the album ``The 
Ellington Era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dance also wrote liner notes for the Sweet Baby Blues Band and  
was featured chanting on the track ``Sometimes it be That Way'' on 
singer-pianist Jeannie Cheatham's 1987 album ``Homeward Bound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stanley was a giant, a lifelong jazz devotee and one of the  
most honest men I've ever met,'' Ms. Cheatham said. ``He didn't 
bite his tongue, he said what he thought, and that was that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in England, Dance began writing about jazz professionally  
in 1935, eventually marrying Helen Oakley, who was in charge of 
Variety Records and produced several of Ellington's small group 
records in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Dance read the eulogy at Ellington's funeral in 1974. The jazz  
critic co-wrote Ellington's autobiography and other books, 
including ``The World of Swing'' and ``The World of Earl Hines.'' 
His work appeared in the New York Herald Tribune, Saturday Review, 
Down Beat and Jazz Times. He was also book review editor at Jazz 
Times from 1980 until last fall.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Winthrop Edey, internationally known for his  
love and knowledge of clocks and the keeper of a meticulous diary 
documenting life in New York, died Feb. 22 from Hodgkin's disease. 
He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Edey gained international recognition as an expert on antique  
clocks and started buying them before they were considered 
collector's items. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped the Frick Collection bring together an exhibit of  
French clocks in 1982. Nine of the best clocks were from his own 
collection. He had a special fascination with studying their inner 
mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
	Edey also was known for his detailed diary writing, which he  
started at age 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have guessed that his multivolume and still unpublished  
diary could become an important reflection of New York life. Edey 
mingled in different art circles and befriended Andy Warhol and 
Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Edey was included in Warhol's 1963 movie ``The 13 Most Beautiful  
Boys.''

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Harry Rossoll, who as a U .S. Forest Service  
illustrator created the Smokey Bear fire prevention messages that 
became one of the most successful public relations campaigns, died 
Thursday of an intestinal aneurysm. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Norwich, Conn., he provided the rough draft for  
Smokey Bear in 1944 as the character to promote forest fire 
prevention after rejecting figures including a forest ranger and a 
beaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossoll drew more than 1,000 ``Smokey Says'' cartoons that were  
published in newspapers across the nation for 25 years. He also 
talked with foresters in the field and gave talks about Smokey and 
fire prevention to school children.

 *Harriet Waddy    	
</P>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Harriet Waddy, one of the first black  
officers commissioned in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps during 
World War II and one of the highest ranking black women in its 
successor, the Women's Army Corps, died Feb. 21. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddy joined the WAAC early in World War II and underwent basic  
training in Iowa. She returned to Washington in 1942 to work as an 
aide to the director of the corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps was made part of the regular Army and renamed the  
Women's Army Corps later in 1942. Waddy graduated from Adjutant 
General's School and was put in charge of 50 civilian typists in 
the Casualty Branch. Their job was to write letters notifying 
families that soldiers had been killed, wounded or were missing in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	A photograph caption from that time notes that the task rested  
on the ``feminine but capable shoulders'' of Major Waddy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a newspaper interview from 1942, Waddy said succeeding as a  
WAC would drive a wedge into prejudicial beliefs. She noted that 
her uniform entitled her to go anywhere in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	She served on active duty in the Army until 1952 and was in the  
reserves until 1969. She worked for the Federal Aviation 
Administration for 25 years, retiring in Los Angeles in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddy, born in Jefferson City, Mo., was raised by a strict  
grandmother. The family was mixed race for several generations, 
including grandparents who met during the Civil War. Waddy was 
proud of her family background, calling herself a ``Heinz 57'' and 
believing she symbolized the American cultural melting pot.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kasich Defends Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Rep. John  
Kasich, excluded from a California GOP convention because he 
offered to help a California Democrat, says more politicians should 
follow his example and put friendship ahead of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, R-Ohio, was not invited to speak at the convention  
because he offered to give a fund-raising dinner for Rep. Gary 
Condit, a conservative Democrat who represents a central California 
district in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary is a good guy, and you know at times friendship ought to  
transcend party labels,'' Kasich said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
``Gary Condit's one of my best friends in Congress, and he's one of 
the most conservative Democrats, and he's always helping us to cut 
taxes and to cut spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner for Condit never occurred because Condit ``canceled  
it on me because he was afraid it was going to hurt me,'' Kasich 
said. ``That's the kind of friend you want in politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said being passed over for a speaking slot at the state  
convention was ``not a big deal,'' adding that the California GOP 
``was flooded with calls from people saying, `If sometimes a 
politician can put friendship and principle above partisan 
politics, that's a good thing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
businessman Steve Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and 
conservative commentator Alan Keyes were among potential 
presidential candidates who attended the conference in Sacramento.

<HEADLINE> Clemens To Make Spring Debut Sat. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens  
will make his New York Yankees' spring training debut Saturday on 
the road in a spilt-squad game against the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	`I just want to stay away from the media circus more than  
anything,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was purpose for not pitching him against Toronto the  
first couple of days and I said I might as well do the same 
(Saturday),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals play their games in Haines City, more than a hour  
east of the Yankees' camp in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza will start the Yankees' other split-squad game  
Saturday in Tampa against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who will work a maximum of three innings or around 45  
pitches, was obtained from Toronto for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd 
and Homer Bush on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez will start the Yankees' spring opener Thursday  
against Toronto. Hideki Irabu will get the call in Friday's rematch 
with the Blue Jays at Dundein. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte will go against Minnesota next Sunday and David  
Cone will face the Philadelphia Phillies on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has not decided on who will start the regular season and  
Yankee Stadium openers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still haven't put it together yet,'' Torre said. ``We have  
a lot options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens threw 56 pitches during his second batting stint Sunday,  
while Cone and Irabu had bullpen workouts. Pettitte had a long toss 
session and will throw batting practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will play the first of two intrasquad games Monday.  
None of the starting rotation will participate in the games. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has started talks  
with the agents representing Mendoza, Jorge Posada, Shane Spencer 
and Ricky Ledee. If deals can not be reached, Cashman said the team 
would ``probably earlier than later'' renew contracts between March 
2-11. ... Designated hitter Chili Davis should see some time at 
first base against left-handed pitching. ... Posada and Joe Girardi 
will both catch Clemens during spring training. ... Darryl 
Strawberry returned Sunday, taking batting practice indoors after 
practice was cut short by rain. The outfielder had a limited 
workout Saturday after undergoing chemotherapy on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mets Getting To Know Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- With so many new faces in the New  
York Mets' camp, several key players are spending spring training 
getting to know their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides of the infield are making adjustments, now that  
Edgardo Alfonzo has shifted from third base to second. For 
shortstop Rey Ordonez, that means a new double-play partner in 
Alfonzo and a new third baseman in Robin Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Ordonez and Ventura) looked good. They looked like they could  
have fun together,'' manager Bobby Valentine said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Repetition is really key,'' he said. ``I can't really tell you  
what they need until maybe I see them in the regular season. It 
seems like it is going to be the regular stuff in spring 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Bobby Bonilla and Rickey Henderson, the  
outfield is feeling its way through a new season as well. But 
Valentine was quick to point out that Henderson has free reign on 
any ball he can get to, including those tricky popups between the 
infielders and outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until Rey is going real full blast and Ricky's got his  
adrenaline going the range factor would be hard for them to 
determine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets will have another special visitor at their complex  
Monday in Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, who will broadcast his former team's games this season,  
also signed to help the Mets pitchers in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he had no idea who Seaver would work with or what  
he would do, but added he thought starter Rick Reed and minor 
leaguer Dan Murray had styles similar to Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax visited camp and worked  
with the pitchers, especially Al Leiter.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Brit Official: Euro Will Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A former governing Labor Party treasury chief on  
Sunday announced the formation of a new group aimed at stopping 
Prime Minister Tony Blair from adopting the euro, and predicted a 
quick collapse of the new European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Denis Healey, who as Chancellor of the Exchequer in  
the 1970s presided over a British balance-of-payments crisis that 
rocked the pound, reflected a deepening national dispute over 
whether to abandon sterling. 
</P>
<P>
	``An economic recession will require the existing members of  
(European Monetary Union) to have different interest rates and 
exchange rates,'' Healey said in an interview with GMTV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I myself believe that EMU will probably break down before  
Blair is called on to take a decision whether or not Britain should 
join,'' added Healey, now a member of the House of Lords, Britain's 
unelected upper chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Blair announced a multimillion dollar package to  
prepare for a possible switch to the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	He called it a ``change of gear'' rather than policy, but it was  
the firmest indication yet that his government favors adopting the 
euro after the next national elections. These must be held by early 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair has pledged a referendum, and opponents say he is  
softening up Britain's mainly anti-euro voters by making the 
adoption of the new currency appear inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is the only major European Union country not included in  
the euro, launched by 11 of the 15 members Jan. 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ANGOLA, La. (AP) -- The pressure of success is growing on the  
editor of one of Louisiana's most honored publications. Wilbert 
Rideau is juggling even more calls, visits, obligations -- lately 
because of his work on a film that is nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is relaxed. He has years to get his work done. Maybe a  
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prison keeps you real,'' said the editor of The Angolite  
magazine. ``It focuses your attention and shows you how little is 
really a necessary part of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He should know. At the age of 57, Rideau has been a resident of  
Louisiana State Prison at Angola for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, when he was just 19, Rideau robbed a bank and took  
three hostages. While they begged for their lives, he shot them. 
One of the victims fell into a bayou and escaped. One, shot in the 
neck, feigned death. The third tried to crawl away and Rideau 
stabbed her and slashed her throat. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting to die in the electric chair, Rideau was reborn.  
Unlike most death-row conversions, however, words became his 
salvation, not religion; he taught himself to read and began 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want a criminal act to be the final definition of  
me,'' Rideau said. ``I picked up a pen and tried to do something 
good. It allowed me to weave meaning into what would have been a 
meaningless existence. It also gave me a chance to try to make 
amends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Louisiana's death  
penalty and Rideau was re-sentenced to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Refused a job by the then all-white staff of the prison  
magazine, The Angolite, Rideau started his own publication, The 
Lifer, and began writing a weekly column for a chain of black 
newspapers. In 1976 he was named editor of The Angolite and 
transformed it from a mimeographed newsletter into a slick 
bimonthly magazine that has won a string of awards. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical day last week saw Rideau preparing for visitors from  
Emory University journalism school and the Southwestern Louisiana 
criminal justice classes. Celebrity lawyer Johnnie Cochran was 
expected, Time Magazine was phoning, The New York Times was back 
for a second day of interviews. On top of that he had a magazine to 
get out and was trying to sell another film. 
</P>
<P>
	This recent attention comes for his work helping to direct the  
Oscar-nominated documentary ``The Farm,'' which also won last 
year's prize for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, he was named ABC News' ``Person of the Week'' in  
1992, profiled in Life Magazine in 1993. He wrote and narrated an 
award-winning National Public Radio documentary, did a television 
documentary and collaborated on a film about an execution for the 
Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Rideau bills himself as ``The Most Rehabilitated Prisoner in  
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But despite his impressive resume, he still earns 20 cents an  
hour, sleeps on a narrow metal bunk in a 74-man dormitory, and must 
get permission and a guard to move around on prison grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what I do or what awards or honors I get, this is  
still prison,'' Rideau said. ``And the key to getting out of prison 
is anonymity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one who believes his accomplishments are the  
reason he's still locked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were 13 men on death row when Wilbert Rideau got  
there,'' said Ted Quant, director of the Twomey Center for Peace 
Through Justice at Loyola University and the Rideau Project they 
run. ``Every one of them was released except Wilbert Rideau. There 
were 31 murderers sent to Angola in 1962; all but Wilbert Rideau 
have regained their freedom. But you never heard of any of those 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what bothers Rideau most.  
</P>
<P>
	``If all those people were still in prison I'd say what's  
happened to me is fair,'' he said. ``But they aren't. I get post 
cards from a former inmate who killed four people. He's out and I'm 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rideau has gained Pardon Board recommendations for release since  
1984, but so far four governors have refused, including Edwin 
Edwards who pardoned 89 murderers before leaving office in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of the crime he committed was so unnecessary I can  
only believe it happened from some mental lapse,'' Edwards said. 
``I was just afraid if he was released to society it might happen 
again. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Rideau's accomplishments don't sway Louisiana's current  
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor will tell you very quickly that prison is for  
punishment,'' said Cheney Joseph, executive counsel to Gov. Mike 
Foster. ``I don't think anyone these days would tell you it's about 
rehabilitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rideau remains optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe I'll get out someday,'' he said. ``Of course,  
all prisoners believe that. You have to or you couldn't get up 
every day and go on.''

<HEADLINE> RNC Member Quits CCC Over Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A member of the Republican National  
Committee told state Republicans he was severing his bond with the 
Council of Conservative Citizens, which has been accused of being 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Witherspoon, a state GOP activist and member of the  
national committee, told the state party's executive committee on 
Saturday he would no longer be part of the CCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a Christian. I am a conservative. But one thing I am not  
is a racist,'' an emotional Witherspoon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, national GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson condemned the  
CCC, saying it held racist views, and asked Witherspoon to renounce 
any ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Witherspoon said then he wouldn't. The group was advocating  
conservative causes, like displaying the Confederate battle flag 
and playing ``Dixie'' at public events, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center, which studies hate groups, said  
the CCC is ``the reincarnation of the racist white Citizens 
Council,'' that battled Southern integration in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> 'Eight Millimeter' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Violence beat romance at the box office over  
the weekend, with the grim pornography drama ``Eight Millimeter'' 
and the action-packed ``Payback'' topping ``Message in a Bottle'' 
and ``The Other Sister,'' according to Sunday estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eight Millimeter,'' with Nicolas Cage as a private eye  
investigating a possible murder captured on film, debuted at No. 1 
with $14.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Other Sister,'' with Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi in  
a love story about two mentally challenged people, opened in third 
place, with $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mel Gibson shoot-'em-up ``Payback'' had $6.9 million for  
second, while the Kevin Costner romance ``Message in a Bottle'' was 
fourth with $6.4 million and ``My Favorite Martian'' was fifth with 
$5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``200 Cigarettes,'' the story of young people heading to an  
early 1980s New Year's Eve party in New York, opened weakly, 
landing at 10th with $3.2 million. ``Just the Ticket,'' a romantic 
comedy starring Andy Garcia and Andie MacDowell debuted with just 
$266,500 on 82 screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``October Sky,'' fell from fourth place to sixth with $5  
million, followed by the best-picture Oscar nominee ``Shakespeare 
in Love'' in seventh with $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were ``Blast from the Past'' in eighth  
with $3.7 million and the high-school comedy ``She's All That'' in 
ninth with $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Another teen-oriented film, ``Jawbreaker,'' tumbled more than 50  
percent in its second week, collecting just $750,000 for a low $936 
per-screen average. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday

<HEADLINE> N.J. Police Superintendent Is Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman fired the head of the  
New Jersey State Police on Sunday after he said in a newspaper 
interview that minority groups were more likely to be involved in 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Ministers Council of New Jersey and the state chapter  
of the NAACP had been calling for State Police Superintendent Col. 
Carl Williams' ouster for weeks, saying he was not acknowledging a 
history of racist procedures on the part of the State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said Sunday the state's law enforcement system must be  
carried out free of bias. She said Williams' comments ``are 
inconsistent with our efforts to enhance public confidence in the 
State Police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her spokesman, Pete McDonough, said Williams' comments were the  
last straw in an already hostile situation between minorities and 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has come under fire over allegations that the agency  
practices racial profiling, targeting minorities for traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark published Sunday,  
Williams said he did not condone racial profiling, but said it is 
naive to think race is not an issue in drug crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks ago, the president of the United States went to  
Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go 
to Ireland. He didn't go to England,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine or  
marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved with 
that,'' said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 58, has repeatedly said he has never condoned racial  
profiling. But he told the newspaper some generalizations can be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're looking at the metamphetamine market, that seems to  
be controlled by the motorcycle gangs, which are basically 
predominantly white,'' he said. ``If you're looking at heroin and 
stuff like that, your involvement there is more or less 
Jamaicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said Williams' comments were unacceptable.  
</P>
<P>
	``The comments were insensitive and absolutely counter to  
bolstering confidence in law enforcement,'' McDonough said. ``There 
are vast segments of the New Jersey public whose confidence in the 
system is shaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported that the Justice  
Department's Civil Rights Division had been investigating the New 
Jersey State Police for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was not immediately available for comment, and a state  
police spokesman, John Hagerty, did not return messages.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Player Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Comets point guard Kim Perrot walked away  
from the hospital Sunday morning, four days after doctors removed a 
golf ball-sized cancerous tumor from just below the surface of her 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This first part of this journey has been successful,'' Perrot  
said at a news conference shortly before her discharge from the 
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. ``I feel like I 
can run around and play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot's steps were slow but sure. She wore a WNBA championship  
hat to conceal the scar on the left side of her head. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 19, doctors told Perrot that it was a brain tumor  
causing the recent weakness in her right arm and headaches. Worse, 
three weeks of testing had revealed the tumor was caused by 
spreading lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot, 32, is scheduled to begin 2 1/2 weeks of radiation therapy  
next Monday to eradicate several smaller tumors in her head. Then 
she'll immediately start six months of chemotherapy to attack the 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, she's in excellent condition,'' said Perrot's  
radiation oncologist, Dr. Ritsuko Komaki. ``I do not expect any 
problems during radiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot might be able to at least suit up with the Comets this  
summer if she responds well to chemotherapy, doctors have said. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the large brain tumor was located perilously close  
to the motor cortex of the brain that provides strength to Perrot's 
right hand and arm. Dr. Raymond Sawaya had to remove the cancer 
from between two folds of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very delicate because of the location of the tumor,''  
said Sawaya, who had to be worried about applying too much pressure 
to the brain while extracting the growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot proudly made several clinched fists for television  
cameras Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I have not lost any strength in my hand,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot, supported by visiting family members from her hometown  
of Lafayette, La., and elsewhere, said she's been overwhelmed by 
cards, letters and e-mails from fans around the world. But 
basketball has dominated her thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about it every day. It's what I've been doing all my  
life and I've made a career out of it,'' said Perrot, who rose from 
obscurity to help lead Houston to the WNBA's first two titles. ``To 
think that could be taken away was hard to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm going to be playing basketball again.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Senator Urges Stand on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen.  
Bob Smith warned Sunday that the GOP will ``fall into the ash bin 
of history'' if it does not make outlawing abortion its top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire senator cast aside pleas from fellow  
Republicans who have called for the party to talk about issues 
other than abortion. In a forceful speech to the California GOP 
convention, he said he refused to be treated like a ``second-class 
citizen because we stand up for the (anti-abortion) plank in our 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news, there might be a third party, the worse news,  
the Republicans might be the third party,'' he said. ``If we're not 
going to stand up for the life of unborn children, maybe the 
Republican Party deserves to fall into the ash bin of history ... 
and it will, if we don't stand up for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's remarks drew repeated ovations from the Republican  
delegates gathered for their twice-annual state convention. His 
speech preceded a vote for the new chairman of the party. That 
election campaign has become a referendum on abortion and has 
deeply fractured the state party. 
</P>
<P>
	One candidate, party Vice Chairman John McGraw, has said banning  
abortion is his No. 1 mission; his opponent, Nicholas Bavaro, has 
said he will focus on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some state GOP lawmakers who have carried anti-abortion  
legislation have urged a party that suffered devastating losses in 
November -- only two Republicans currently hold statewide office -- 
to talk about other issues this weekend. But Smith firmly backed 
McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killing children is the central issue facing our nation today,  
and it needs to be stopped,'' he said to applause from the 
delegates. ``I'm for a big tent, but I don't want a tent that's 
flat on the ground that everybody has to crawl under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes before Smith's speech, McGraw, Bavaro and other  
adversarial leaders in the party stood together at a news 
conference meant to project unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moderates and conservatives are going to come together,''  
Bavaro said. He and the other party candidates then headed into a 
convention hall littered with signs for candidates promising party 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unity must begin today,'' read a campaign placard for southern  
vice chairman Dr. Asha Knott. 
</P>
<P>
	Second assistant secretary candidate Mike McSweeney's sign  
offered this to-do list: ``1. Unify party. 2. Win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the seventh presidential aspirant to address the  
convention. All seven oppose abortion. Some, like Smith, offered 
fiery defenses of their position. Others, like former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, called for the party to emphasize other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of laying down litmus tests and rigid pronouncements,  
reach out to others with whom we agree,'' he urged convention 
attendees Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one other issue that united Republicans at the  
gathering: their dislike of President Clinton, a man, Smith said, 
who ``behaves like an animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Smith and former Vice President Dan Quayle drew raucous  
standing ovations when they praised the House trial managers, who 
fought to remove Clinton from office following his impeachment. 
Smith, who voted to oust Clinton, said there was no one he 
respected more than the trial managers.

<HEADLINE> Flames Trade Fleury to Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Theo Fleury, one of the NHL's top scorers, was  
traded from the Calgary Flames to Colorado on Sunday in a move the 
Avalanche hope will bolster their offense for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season,  
goes to the Avalanche with winger Chris Dingman. The Flames 
received forward Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak and future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, a 30-year-old wing, has spent his entire NHL career with  
the Flames, winning a Stanley Cup with the team as a rookie in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 30 goals and 39 assists this season. He has said  
repeatedly he wouldn't sign a new contract until testing the 
free-agent market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche spokesman Jean Martineau said Fleury would arrive in  
Denver on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury became the Flames' career scoring leader last Friday. In  
791 games, he has 364 goals and 466 assists for 830 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Calgary's Cory Stillman said Fleury is ``by  
far our greatest player and he's proving it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingman, an enforcer, has played only two games this season.  
Corbet, 25, has eight goals and 14 assists in 53 games. Belak, a 
22-year-old prospect, has no points with the Avalanche this season.

<HEADLINE> Working Mom Absences Said Unharmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children of women who work outside the home  
are not significantly harmed by their mother's absence, according 
to a study that evaluated the development and health of more than 
6,000 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found there was no difference between children whose mothers  
were employed versus children whose mothers were not employed 
during the first three years,'' said Elizabeth Harvey, a 
psychologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``Being 
employed is not going to harm the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey's study, published in the March issue of the journal  
Developmental Psychology, came to a different conclusion than some 
earlier studies of the same group of children. The new work 
examined the children at a later age, 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	This suggests, said David Eggebeen of Pennsylvania State  
University, who co-authored an earlier study, that problems 
detected in children of working mothers at age 3 and 4 may have 
gone away by the time the children were 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harvey's study suggests that the number of hours spent away  
from home is not as important as the quality of parenting,'' said 
Lindsay Chase-Lansdale, an associate professor of human development 
at the University of Chicago. She called the Harvey study ``an 
important contribution'' but not the final answer on issues 
relating to children and working mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Harvey used data from the National Longitudinal  
Survey of Youth, an in-depth interview study of men and women 
between the ages of 14 and 22 that started in 1979. Harvey 
concentrated on children born to the women in the study after 1980. 
The children were assessed every other year from 1986 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more than 6,000 children of all races in the study,  
most evaluated more than once. The youngest child assessed was 3, 
the oldest 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey used standard psychological tests to evaluate children's  
language development, academic achievement, self-esteem and 
behavior problems. Some of the results were based on reports of the 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison with children of mothers who did not work, Harvey  
said she found no statistically significant difference in any of 
the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when comparing children within the group of mothers who  
had outside employment, Harvey found very slight differences that 
were dependent on how many hours the mother worked and how soon she 
started work after the child was born. Some women in the study 
returned to work as quickly as four weeks after giving birth, while 
others waited three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Returning to work later and having more breaks in employment  
was associated with more compliant children,'' said Harvey. ``The 
children (of later-working mothers) were better behaved'' between 
the ages of three and four. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she noted, ``the difference was very tiny and disappeared  
by the age of five,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another slight difference, apparent only in the scientific  
tests, was linked to the number of hours per week worked by the 
mothers, the researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more hours the mother worked per week during the first  
three years, the lower the children's language development and 
academic achievement,'' Harvey said. ``But, again, these effects 
were very tiny -- so small you would have a hard time detecting 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the age of 10, the difference in academic achievement went  
away. She said the language development difference ``never went 
away in the data, but got continuously smaller by the age of 12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fundamentally, said Harvey, the study suggests issues exist in  
raising children that are more than outside employment of the 
mother. These include the quality of the parent-child relationship 
and the quality of the child's day-care arrangement, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message should be that being at home during the early  
years, or being employed during those years, are both good 
choices,'' Harvey said. ``Both can result in healthy, 
well-developed children.'' 
</P>

the American Psychological Association.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Returns; Denigrates Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Barkley ripped into the Los  
Angeles Lakers on Sunday before returning to action against them 
two weeks to the day after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so disgusted by NBC and the L.A. press,'' Barkley told  
reporters an hour before the Houston Rockets and Lakers played 
their nationally televised game at the Forum. ``You guys make me 
sick. I'm sick of NBC showing the Lakers every week and saying how 
good they are. They're a glamour team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You all picked them to win the championship. Now, they're  
struggling. Now, they bring in Dennis Rodman and they're going to 
win the championship again. They've got a lot of talent. They're 
8-6, aren't they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was before the game. Rick Fox scored 15 of his 21 points in  
the first 6:55 of the fourth quarter and Rodman provided a spark 
with 10 rebounds and defensive energy as the Lakers beat the 
Rockets 106-90 to raise their record to 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, who averaged 19.2 points and 17.0 rebounds in five  
games before having surgery to repair a tear of the medial meniscus 
in his left knee, had 14 points and six rebounds in 19 minutes of 
action. He had said beforehand he hoped to play 30 minutes but 
would settle for 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley said prior to the game he thought the best teams in the  
Western Conference right now are defending conference champion Utah 
and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're right there,'' he said. ``I like our team a lot. We're  
going to be good. We've got a lot of good pieces. We were playing 
really well before I got hurt. We just have to play like we were 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I see (the Western Conference) as a three-team race  
-- Portland, Utah and us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he ranked the Lakers fourth in the West, he smiled  
and said, ``I don't rank 'em. They don't get anything for coming in 
fourth.'' 
</P>

	Barkley, who turned 36 on Feb. 20, brought career averages of  
22.5 points and 11.7 rebounds into the season. He has never played

<HEADLINE> Grudzielanek Poised for Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Grudzielanek got very tired of  
hearing about his defensive deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's annoying,'' Grudzielanek said after Sunday's workout at  
Dodgertown. ``It really is. But on the other hand it's something I 
needed to get better at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of sitting around and sulking during the offseason,  
the Dodgers shortstop, who committed 33 errors last year and 32 the 
previous year, did something about it -- he worked all winter with 
Bucky Dent at the former major league shortstop's baseball school 
in Boca Raton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pretty much had a total tuneup,'' said Grudzielanek, a Palm  
Beach resident. ``We went through footwork, throwing -- where I 
place the ball in my hand -- double plays. It was more talking about 
it than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek, who was traded to the Dodgers from the Montreal  
Expos along with Carlos Perez and Hiram Bocachica for Wilton 
Guerrero, Ted Lilly, Peter Bergeron and Jon Tucker last July 31, 
has always put up solid numbers offensively. 
</P>
<P>
	After working with Dent, he's confident he now has the glove to  
go along with his bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this will be the last year anybody says anything bad  
about my defense,'' said Grudzielanek, who lost his arbitration 
case this winter. He will make $1.9 million instead of the $2.6 
million he was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing but praise for Grudzielanek when he got to the  
majors in 1995 with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fine hitter,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He  
has a lot of power for a shortstop and he usually hits what he 
swings at. But I thought he was a little too pull conscious last 
year, and I'd like to see him use the whole field more. If he can 
do that, I think he'll have a big year for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Grudzielanek's first full season in the majors, he hit  
.306 with six home runs with 49 RBIs and 33 steals, earning him a 
trip to the All-Star game. Although he committed 27 errors, the 
future looked bright and nobody was questioning his defensive 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
	Then things started to go downhill quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	His relationship with team officials were strained after a  
contract squabble in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new start for me,'' Grudzielanek said. ``I'm happier  
here with the Dodgers, I'm healthy, and I'm going to be playing on 
grass. With all those factors going in my favor I think this will 
be a good year for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek, who has always been secure about his job status in  
past training camps, still has to beat out Jose Vizcaino for the 
starting shortstop job this spring, but he appears to be the clear 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I've done the last few years speak for themselves,''  
Grudzielanek said. ``I'm not worrying about (the competition). I'm 
going to do what I've done the previous spring -- getting myself 
ready for April.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago's City News Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After more than a century of chronicling  
politics, murder and mayhem in Chicago, the City News Bureau is 
closing its doors forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The City News, a gritty training ground for cub reporters for  
108 years, had a skeleton crew at work Sunday in its downtown 
office, monitoring phones, the morgue, police and fire scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	At midnight, the office would be shuttered for good.  
</P>
<P>
	The bureau's joint owners, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago  
Sun-Times, announced in October that it was no longer financially 
viable to keep the service open. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a coalition of 10 Chicago news operations has  
stepped in to create a replacement wire service. The New City News 
Bureau, a streamlined version of the old one, will begin operations 
out of Chicago Tribune offices on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing marks an end to an era in journalism, said Paul  
Zimbrakos, who as managing editor has headed City News for more 
than 30 years and started out as a copy boy there 41 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad. For 108 years City News trained hundreds and  
hundreds of reporters,'' said Zimbrakos. He estimated he has 
handled more than 30,000 homicide stories and 72 elections since 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
	Since City News opened its doors in 1890, the service has  
provided news 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to Chicago's major 
newspapers and other subscribers, including The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid reporters shoestring salaries, as editors and rewrite  
staff intimidated, cajoled and often coerced their young charges 
into getting the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Many City News veterans, like the late Pulitzer Prize-winning  
columnist Mike Royko, went on to work for Chicago's daily 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other alumni include novelist Kurt Vonnegut, journalist Seymour  
Hersh, and playwright Charles MacArthur, who based ``The Front 
Page,'' the play he wrote with Ben Hecht, in part on his experience 
as a City News reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	During a farewell party Friday night, some of Chicago's  
best-known reporters recalled witnessing grisly scenes and running 
to the nearest pay phone to call in their scoops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are the bodies? I'm from City News,'' Chicago Sun-Times  
reporter Charles Nicodemus said he told a police officer after 
arriving by bus at his first murder scene.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Adopt New Logo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens have a new logo -- no  
shield, just the bird. 
</P>
<P>
	When players take the field this year, they will wear helmets  
decorated with the profile of a raven's head as per the wishes of 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 7,107 fans chose the new logo during a two-day poll  
conducted by The (Baltimore) Sun. A straight-on look of the bird's 
face was chosen by 6,256 respondents. In all, 18,708 people 
participated in the poll, which ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am excited that the fans in Baltimore had the opportunity to  
speak, and it's obvious, with close to 20,000 calls coming in, that 
the fans were interested in being heard,'' David Modell, the team's 
president, told the newspaper for Sunday editions. ``Their voice 
continues to shape the face of this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why a new logo? Because the team had to give up the old one -- at  
least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled four months ago that the team's original  
primary logo -- a shield featuring a ``B'' and wings -- had been 
copied from Frederick Bouchat, an amateur Baltimore artist who had 
faxed a similar design to the team three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchat sued for $10 million in damages and whatever profits the  
team made by putting the logo on T-shirts, hats and other 
souvenirs. A separate jury has to decide how much Bouchat should 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Ravens and the NFL are appealing the decision,  
saying the original logo was not copied from Bouchat's design.

<HEADLINE> Swimmers Stretch Their Abilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Swimmers tethered to elastic cords learn to  
stretch their abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	A swimmer attached to a cord can get everything from resistance  
exercise to a thrill ride, coaches say. Cords are being used by 
everyone from Olympic-level swimmers to members of high school 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love it,'' said swim coach Tony St. Onge of Moses Lake,  
Wash., High School. ``We call it bungee swimming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One technique practiced by St. Onge and other coaches is to  
attach one end of the cord at one end of the pool and have the 
swimmer walk to the other end, stretching the cord. After the 
swimmer enters the water, the combination of the cord tension and 
the swimmer's own strokes and kicks lets the athlete literally zoom 
down the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bigger boys try tying on two or three bungees, and they  
can fly down the pool,'' St. Onge said. ``Our 25-yard record is 
about 6 seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the swimmers get, besides entertainment, is an easy way to  
see how it feels to hit race speed without actually putting out 
race effort. Swimming at race speed in repeated practices wears out 
a swimmer -- and, as the athlete gets fatigued, form gets more 
erratic. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have the opportunity to experience what it's like to  
sprint at high velocity except when you get ready to do that,'' 
said Jonty Skinner, national team coach for swimming at the Olympic 
training complex in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting partly hauled down the pool lets the swimmer work on any  
problems that may surface at race speed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner's swimmers can be towed at constant speeds on a cable,  
which he considers is an improvement over stretch cords that lose 
tension as the swimmer comes down the pool. Coaches try to 
compensate by hauling in slack by hand, but they concede this only 
approximates the tension needed for an even speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimming toward the end of the cord is not the only way in which  
swimmers can benefit from the bounce. They also can swim away from 
the cord. In this case, the tension fixes them in place in the 
pool. For all their effort, they go nowhere -- but fast. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one of Skinner's prime uses.  
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is that the mild resistance will allow them to feel  
the patterns of their techniques, maybe accentuate the (swimming) 
motions, and spot weaknesses or problems,'' Skinner said. And 
because the swimmer is in one place, the coach doesn't have to 
chase the athlete up and down the pool to keep an eye on the 
swimmer's form, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tying up the swimmers also conserves pool space, which is an  
important consideration to St. Onge. ``It's just a small pool,'' he 
said. ``But you can gang up 10 to 12 kids on the side of the pool 
and they only have to swim 10 feet and hold their stationary 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some coaches use the cords out of the water as well, as  
resistance trainers. At Stanford University, the middle of the cord 
is anchored so the swimmers can grasp an end in each hand. By 
pulling on the cord, the exercisers work their upper bodies, said 
assistant swim coach Ted Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
	The major benefit of the cords, however, seems to be for nerves  
more than muscles. Using the elastic lets swimmers set the patterns 
of muscle control that they'll need for the race, said David Marsh, 
head men's and women's swimming coach at Auburn University. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some swimmers don't benefit. Distance  
swimmers can practice speed simply by breaking their distances into 
shorter segments and going all-out in the segments, said Skip 
Kenney, Stanford's head swimming coach. ``With the longer events, 
you can swim faster than race pace without assistance,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen on profit-taking in  
early trading Monday, while Japanese stock prices inched higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.12 yen, down 1.20 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and slightly below its New York level of 119.17 yen late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 36.51 points  
or 0.25 percent, to 14,404.05 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the index shed 102.91 points, or 0.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar faced sell orders from domestic  
exporters wanting to take take profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors remained on the sidelines ahead of high-level  
talks on economic deregulation between Japan and the United States, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were alert to comments from finance officials during  
the talks and also watched a World Bank symposium on global finance 
and development, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.13 yen, down  
from 132.35 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rose despite Friday's decline on  
Wall Street. Traders said encouraging Japanese economic data 
prompted expectations the nation's economy may be starting to 
bottom out. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said  
Japan's industrial production rose a larger-than-expected 0.8 
percent in January, climbing for the second straight month. MITI 
also forecast output would continue to rise in February and March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.76 points to 9,306.58  
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the

	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Early poll results this morning gave  
retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo the lead in two states and the 
capital in Nigeria's presidential elections. Marking the final 
phase of democracy's return to Africa's most populous nation, tens 
of millions of Nigerians turned out at polls yesterday in the 
long-awaited election. Many hope the event will sweep aside 15 
years of corrupt and brutal military rule. The race pits Obasanjo, 
a former military ruler seeking a civilian comeback 20 years after 
leaving power, against former finance minister Olu Falae.

of lifesaving defibrillators in more hands across the nation. While 
CPR buys patients crucial time, it will not restart a heart. Now 
companies, shopping malls, even amusement parks are buying portable 
defibrillators, small versions of the electric shock paddles made 
famous on TV, that can jolt hearts into beating again. Experts say 
portable defibrillators could save 100,000 lives a year.

<HEADLINE> Jagge Wins Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OFTERSCHWANG, Germany (AP) -- Finn Christian Jagge won his second  
slalom race this season convincing fashion, and Norwegian teammate 
Andre Aamodt vaulted to the top of the World Cup overall standings 
with a third-place finish Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagge skied down a course made difficult by soft snow in 1  
minute 47.76 seconds for his two runs in the first World Cup event 
held in this resort. He flashed across the finish line 1.05 seconds 
ahead of Austrian Thomas Stangassinger, who took a big step toward 
wrapping up the slalom title. 
</P>
<P>
	``The slope was a little fast and a little slippery, but it was  
good for me,'' said Jagge, 32, who won his sixth career slalom 
title. ``I've had a difficult year, but now I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt's third-place finish gave him 1,130 points in the overall  
race, allowing him to pass Austria's Hermann Maier at 1,103 and 
fellow Norwegian Lasse Kjus, who has 1,089. Kjus was the leader 
before sitting sat out the weekend's races with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt was third in 1:49.13, denying Bode Miller a podium spot  
by just nine-hundredths. The American was fourth, but had the 
fastest second run of 54.48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said his surprising eighth-place finish in the world  
championships three weeks ago in Vail, Colo., bolstered his 
confidence. He put together one of the best placings by any U.S. 
men's skier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	No American has won a World Cup slalom since 1983.  
</P>
<P>
	Stangassinger built his leading total in the season slalom race  
to 466 points. Jure Kosir of Slovenia, who settled for sixth place 
Sunday, is second with 391. 
</P>
<P>
	Stangassinger now just needs a 10th-place finish in the final  
slalom event -- next month in Sierra Nevada, Spain -- to wrap up the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	For Stangassinger, the race was revenge for the way outsiders  
swept the top three spots at the worlds under icy conditions in the 
event, leaving the proven slalom skiers behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagge, who was unbeatable today, me and Aamodt were out front.  
In Vail, we were the victims of the ice -- now we've shown what we 
can do, under fair conditions,'' Stangassinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagge led after the first run in 53.28, then used his experience  
to slide through the ruts left by the previous skiers to finish 
second behind Miller at 54.48 on the next go-around despite 
starting last among the top racers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalle Palander of Finland, the surprise gold medalists at the  
worlds, was disqualified on the first run after skidding by a gate. 
Austrian rookie sensation Benjamin Raich, who has claimed two 
slaloms this year, suffered the same fate on his second run to 
spoil his 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palander's gold at the worlds, the first by a Finish skier, had  
electrified his country. But he again failed to win a World Cup 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a stupid mistake, just stupid,'' Palander said. ``I  
came at the gates too directly, then was leaning too far back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead in the battle between Aamodt, Kjus and Maier traded  
hands twice in as many days. Maier had seized first place in the 
standings by finishing fourth in Saturday's giant slalom behind 
countryman Stephan Eberharter.

buying a multimillion dollar stake in VA Research, a Mountain View, 
Calif.-based maker of business computers that run on Linux, 
industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at both the Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel and VA  
Research declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux was developed in the early 1990s by a Finnish student  
named Linus Torvalds. The grassroots software is edging into the 
mainstream as users embrace its flexibility and its propensity to 
avoid crashing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Linux as the biggest thing since the Internet,'' said  
Larry Augustin, chief executive of VA Research. He declined to 
comment on any investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Intel took a stake in Red Hat, a Durham, N.C.-based  
distributor of Linux software. Several major computer makers such 
as Hewlett Packard and IBM have begun selling machines loaded with 
Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	VA's machines are expected to be adapted to work with Intel's  
upcoming chip for high-end business computers, known as Merced. 
</P>
<P>
	While Linux is rapidly gaining acceptance as an operating system  
for business machines, it's still used in only a small fraction of 
computers and hardly appears on desktops. Microsoft officials 
dismiss Linux as only a minor rival.

<HEADLINE> Cherry Growers Invest in Boiler / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASCO, Wash. (AP) -- Ami and Dave MacHugh hope to protect their  
cherries from spring frost by firing up a huge boiler that should 
make their orchard warm and steamy. 
</P>
<P>
	They got the idea from the Washington Public Power Supply System  
nuclear power plant, across the Columbia River from their orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just looking across the river at that steam plume every day,  
we thought we needed to capture that and bring it over here when 
it's cold out,'' said Ami MacHugh, president of the Franklin County 
Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The MacHughs unloaded the 90,000-pound blue boiler last week. It  
was a castoff from a nuclear submarine base. 
</P>
<P>
	They would not say how much it cost, but they spent $26,000 to  
transport it across from Connecticut on a flatbed truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Much is at stake, said Robert Evans, agricultural engineer at  
the Prosser agricultural research station. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the tremendous economic consequences of not  
protecting, producers in the region have established one of the 
most extensive, elaborate and expensive frost-protection networks 
in the world,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs can range from $400 to $15,000 an acre.  
</P>
<P>
	The MacHughs' diesel-powered boiler heats 40-degree Columbia  
River water to 100 degrees at a rate of 1,800 gallons per minute. 
The water then is sprayed around the orchard through irrigation 
lines that run underneath the mature, high-value trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we could make fog,'' Ami MacHugh said.  
</P>
<P>
	The MacHughs' boiler, about 15 feet high and 30 feet long, is  
sitting on a concrete pad in the middle of the orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans are to heat enough water to cover half of the 100-acre  
orchard with the 2,000-horsepower boiler. With luck, wind will blow 
the warmed air over the rest of the trees, Dave MacHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The application should raise the orchard's air temperature a few  
degrees to keep the buds from freezing and dying. Just a degree or 
two can make the difference between a lost crop and a profit of 
several hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans has spent the past five years testing a similar, much  
smaller system on two acres in Prosser. He found it to be six or 
seven times more efficient than the old-fashioned smudge pots that 
burn oil in canisters to heat orchard air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It works very well,'' Evans said. ``The disadvantage of this  
is it's very expensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the McHughs' system proves itself, more farmers will try it,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are running out of options in a lot of ways,'' Evans said.  
``When you have $10,000 to $15,000 invested per acre, you can 
almost not afford not to heat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smudge pots are on the way out because of the smoke they  
produce. Some farmers are turning to propane-fired heaters or 
installing overhead sprinklers in new orchards.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Warn About Blue Chips / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors trying to play it safe in the stock  
market these days may actually be taking a pretty big risk. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion many analysts and money managers reach as  
they watch money pouring into two or three dozen big-name blue 
chips and the mutual funds that invest heavily in those stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	As these ultraglamorous multinational and technology giants  
attract more and more investors, they have come to dominate one of 
the best known market indicators, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock 
composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of other stocks, meanwhile, have been languishing for a  
year or more. This has led to dramatic ``divergences,'' in Wall 
Street parlance, which skew perceptions of what the market is doing 
and have many analysts predicting trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Enthusiasm for the Terrific Twenty has been fueled by severe  
international currency and debt problems. With the world in 
financial crisis, the reasoning goes, it's best to invest only in 
the strongest, most reliable growth companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble is, when almost everybody decides to do that, the  
price you have to pay for this seeming security soars. ``The cost 
of deflation insurance is very high,'' says Michael Goldstein at 
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Or in the words of managers of the Longleaf Partners Fund in  
their just-published annual report to shareholders: ``The S&AMP;P has 
never sold at today's elevated valuation levels. The 
market-weighted S&AMP;P index is selling at over 27 times current 
earnings, and several of the large companies that dominate the 
index sell at 60 times to 80 times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Owners of this index have NO margin of safety between the  
price they are paying and the value of the businesses they own,'' 
write managers Mason Hawkins, Stanley Cates and John Buford. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason this situation bothers professional money managers so  
much is the difficulty it has caused them in their efforts to keep 
up with the S&AMP;P 500. Contrary to the image of day traders merrily 
doubling or tripling their money on the Internet, many individual 
investors face the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
	As the S&AMP;P 500 has pushed higher over the last couple of years,  
the average stock just hasn't done very well. ``While the majority 
of investors and advisers remain convinced the bull is alive and 
well, market statistics suggest otherwise,'' notes the advisory 
letter Dow Theory Forecasts in Hammond, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Stock Exchange advance-decline line, a running  
total of advancing stocks minus declining stocks, has recovered 
just 10 percent of its April-to-October downturn. Only 29 percent 
of NYSE stocks are trading above their 200-day moving averages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually, the divergence between the S&AMP;P 500 index and the  
broad market will be resolved. Either the index will correct or the 
broad market will get in gear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors can do some things to protect themselves against the  
risks these analysts see. ``In our view, holding 10 percent to 20 
percent of portfolios in cash is a prudent hedge,'' Dow Theory 
Forecasts declares. 
</P>
<P>
	David Tillson, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Trust Corp. in  
New York, recommends ``looking beyond today's large-cap market 
leaders for investment value. Focus, he says, on companies whose 
stocks haven't soared to lofty levels -- ``less recognized names 
that appear to have fallen off investors' radar screens and are 
trading at levels where they have attractive risk-reward 
profiles.''

<HEADLINE> Leaking Ship's Bow Dragged To Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- The broken bow of a cargo ship that ran  
aground and spilled thousands of gallons of oil was slowly dragged 
through the surf toward open water Saturday on its way to a burial 
in the deep Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the New Carissa ran aground in a storm  
three weeks ago, rough weather actually helped salvage crews, 
helping to dislodge the rusty, charred front portion of the ship 
from the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The tug Sea Victory put 106 tons of pulling power on a  
1,100-yard towline connected to the 420-foot-long bow section, 
making progress so slowly it was barely perceptible to the human 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a spectacular thing,'' said Bill Milwee, salvage  
consultant for the ship's Japanese owners. He figured it was moved 
only about 40 feet by evening. 
</P>
<P>
	With the tide receding, the tug crew backed off their engines,  
maintaining about three-quarters power while waiting for the next 
high water late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got to let Mother Nature do the work with a little  
help from the tug,'' said Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The bow section still must be dragged over two sandbars. It will  
take two to three days for the hulk to be towed far enough so it 
can be sunk in 9,000 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, carrying 400,000 gallons of heavy oil to fuel its  
engines, ran aground on Feb. 4 while waiting out a storm to enter 
Coos Bay for a load of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	It eventually spilled an estimated 70,000 gallons of oil. So  
far, 134 birds have been found dead in the oil spill area, 59 of 
them with oil on them. An additional 87 oiled birds were captured 
for rehabilitation and 14 of them died. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy explosives team blasted open the fuel tanks and set the  
remaining oil on fire with napalm to prevent more from spilling. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fire, the ship broke in two, leaving 130,000 gallons  
of unburned oil in bow tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The stern section remains mired deeply in the sand and is  
considered free of oil. Salvagers have said they may leave it 
there.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Options Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With both political parties having been burned  
by special prosecutors, the Independent Counsel Act almost 
certainly will be allowed to die this year, key senators say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it is fixable,'' Senate Democratic leader Tom  
Daschle of South Dakota said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``The 
time has come for us to close the books and try to find another way 
within the Justice Department itself to handle these 
responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law was enacted in 1978 in the wake of the Watergate  
scandal. It gives outside prosecutors the freedom to investigate 
government wrongdoing without concern of interference from the 
president or the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is almost no sentiment for renewing the law when its  
authority expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held up reauthorization for 18 months in 1992  
because of anger over Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's long and 
expensive inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair. Democrats now say 
that Kenneth Starr's extended pursuit of President Clinton shows 
the law is not working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken Starr has demonstrated the excesses and the extreme to  
which an independent counsel can go unless you have limits on that 
work,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., an author of the 1978 law. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate committees plan hearings this week on the act.  
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties said Sunday that the ultimate  
solution might be to return investigative authority to the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 180 years, we had a good system. It can work. It can work  
again. We don't need this independent counsel statute,'' Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said the old system worked even when President Nixon fired  
special counsel Archibald Cox in 1973 because of his probe into 
Watergate. Cox was succeeded by another Justice Department special 
counsel, Leon Jaworski, who won 39 convictions on 45 indictments, 
Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental  
Affairs Committee that oversees the Independent Counsel Act, said 
the problem was not with Starr but with a law that has failed to 
balance independence with accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to think it would be better to put it back in  
Justice, demand more accountability, bring in these special 
counsels when the situation calls for it,'' he said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, the ranking Democrat on Thompson's committee, also said  
Congress may have to look at a way to keep investigations within 
the Justice Department without sacrificing independence ``so that 
we can have that kind of public confidence without having the 
abuses we've seen over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said the 20 independent counsels appointed under the act  
have spent some $150 million and two-thirds of their investigations 
have not led to any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said on CNN's ``Late  
Edition'' that Democrats should not rush to kill the act because of 
their distaste for the Starr investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six special prosecutors appointed by presidents through  
Nixon, three were fired and ``the system came close to a collapse'' 
when Nixon fired Cox, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sister Power: Venus, Serena Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Playing a continent apart, teen-age sisters Venus and Serena  
Williams have been e-mailing each other all week. On Sunday, they 
had plenty to say, becoming the first sisters to win WTA Tour 
events on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Serena defeated Amelie Mauresmo 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4) for  
her first WTA Tour victory in the Gaz de France Open in Paris. Then 
Venus defended her title, defeating Amanda Coetzer 6-4, 6-0 at the 
IGA SuperThrift Tennis Classic at Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just totally unreal for us,'' said Richard Williams,  
the girls' father and coach, who accompanied Venus in Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me think about where we came from, out of the ghetto  
(of Compton, Calif.). To have them both win ... it brought tears to 
my eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena escaped a third-set jam when she blew a 4-1 lead and then  
was unable to close out Mauresmo when she served for the match at 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble was only temporary. The 17-year-old regrouped to  
beat Mauresmo, who was a finalist at last month's Australian Open 
and defeated Martina Hingis earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always dreamed of winning Grand Slams and this is a  
start,'' Williams said. ``It is good to win a smaller tournament 
because when I get to the big events I will have the experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the time difference, Venus Williams knew how her kid  
sister had done when she went out to face Coetzer in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found out that she won before I came out to play the match,  
so I really felt that it was my duty to come out here and win,'' 
Venus said. 
</P>
<P>
	It completed a perfect tournament for 18-year-old Venus, the No.  
5 player in the world. Serena will advance from No. 24 to No. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus did not lose a set in her four matches this weekend and  
finished each match in less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Williams thought Serena might have given Venus more  
trouble than any of the opponents his older daughter faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone challenges the ball like Serena does,''  
he said. ``I really think Serena would have been the one to win 
this tournament last year if her knee wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one hits a forehand like Serena. No one takes control of a  
serve as well as Serena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena said Mauresmo's strokes were powerful, but nothing like  
the shots she faces when she practices with Venus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think that she hit that hard,'' Serena said. ``But  
maybe I am just used to it.''

<HEADLINE> Vinny Castilla Is Jordan of Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Vinny Castilla has supplanted Fernando  
Valenzuela as the Michael Jordan of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like the president out there,'' said Colorado Rockies  
outfielder Curtis Goodwin, who played with Castilla in the Mexican 
winter league. ``He's probably bigger than the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla-mania promises to grow exponentially in the next month  
as the Rockies prepare to play baseball's season opener April 4 in 
Monterrey, Mexico. It's a date Castilla has circled on his 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited about this game,'' he said Sunday. ``It's going  
to be in front of my people. They've followed me all through my 
career. ... People love me over there. I love them, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, who has hit at least 40 home runs in three straight  
seasons, is Mexico's biggest baseball star since Valenzuela started 
throwing his screwball for the Los Angeles Dodgers nearly 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's No. 1 in Mexico right now,'' said Roberto Ramirez, a  
Colorado pitcher who played for Mexico City from 1991-97. 
``Fernando Valenzuela was a big man in Mexico. Right now, It's 
Vinny Castilla -- in all parts of Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla has willingly embraced the role, returning home each  
year to make an appearance in the Mexican winter league. He did not 
disappoint in 1998 despite playing all 162 games for the Rockies 
before traveling to Japan with a group of major league stars in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``One month's enough for me to rest,'' Castilla said. ``I just  
love the game so much. People ask me, `What's your hobby? Do you 
play golf?' My hobby's baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by the Rockies in the 1992 expansion draft, Castilla's  
dedication has helped transform him from a scrawny infielder in the 
Atlanta Braves organization into a two-time All-Star who has 
surpassed Colorado's modest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt he had the potential to be a 20, 25 home run guy,''  
Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard said. ``He's just gotten bigger 
and stronger and better each and every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting 32 homers as Colorado's full-time third baseman in  
1994, Castilla hit 40 homers and 113 RBIs in each of the next two 
seasons. He was rewarded with a four-year, $24 million contract and 
responded by hitting 46 homers and driving in 144 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered a bargain at today's free-agent prices, Castilla  
shows no sign of slowing down. He has played in 247 straight games 
and 620 of the last 630. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a blue-collar worker's dream,'' Colorado hitting  
instructor Clint Hurdle said. ``Every day he shows up, it's a brand 
new day. I don't think he knows when he's in a slump because ... 
his best recollection is yesterday, if he even goes back that far. 
He's always looking forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he doesn't dwell on the past, Castilla will never forget  
falling in love with baseball while growing up in Oaxaca, Mexico. 
His dad played in the Mexican League, prompting Castilla to take up 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	His talent led to a contract with the Braves, who bounced him  
between Atlanta and the minors before leaving him unprotected in 
the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The road will come full circle when the Rockies and San Diego  
Padres play before a sellout crowd in Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've come a long way,'' Castilla said. ``I never  
thought I was going to be a big league player. I've come a long 
way, man, a long way.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Senator Urges Stand on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican activists have ended a  
state party convention that featured a leadership fight centered on 
the candidates' abortion stances. Now, they are ready to return to 
their real business -- defeating Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to the differences between us and the Democrats, the  
differences between one Republican and another are minor,'' 
convention delegate Adam Fogerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's dislike for President Clinton emerged as a unifying  
factor at the semiannual weekend gathering that featured 
appearances by seven White House hopefuls. It was a reflection of 
the new clout in presidential politics that comes with California's 
earlier-than-ever primary next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and former Vice President Dan  
Quayle both drew standing ovations when they praised the House 
trial managers who fought to remove Clinton from office following 
his impeachment. Smith said the president ``behaves like an 
animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While all seven GOP aspirants oppose abortion, their political  
handling of the issue mirrored the split in the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith made a fire-and-brimstone presentation of his  
anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killing children is the central issue facing our nation today,  
and it needs to be stopped,'' he said. ``If we're not going to 
stand up for the life of unborn children, maybe the Republican 
Party deserves to fall into the ash bin of history ... and it will, 
if we don't stand up for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, like former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, echoed those  
who called for the party to emphasize less-divisive issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of laying down litmus tests and rigid pronouncements,  
reach out to others with whom we agree,'' he urged convention 
attendees. 
</P>
<P>
	The California GOP suffered devastating losses in November's  
election, with just two Republicans holding statewide offices. That 
upped the ante for pulling the party together at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Schnur, a GOP consultant, said he came in bracing for a  
``circular firing squad'' but witnessed merely ``a water balloon 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This party did what you're supposed to do when you're looking  
to get back on track -- it argued its differences and put them aside 
and moved on,'' he said. ``We're not going to solve them at a 
convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not the party emerges from its convention truly  
unified remains to be seen, but Republicans were clearly happy to 
get past the battle for the state party chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	The victor, former party Vice Chairman John McGraw, has said  
banning abortion is his No. 1 mission; his opponent, Nicholas 
Bavaro, said he would have focused on other issues. McGraw won 
decisively. 
</P>
<P>
	He preached harmony in his victory speech, and sought to rally  
the Republicans around the cause of beating Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this to be the party of open and honest debate,'' he  
told the delegates. ``But when that is done, I want us to unite and 
go after the Democrats.''
