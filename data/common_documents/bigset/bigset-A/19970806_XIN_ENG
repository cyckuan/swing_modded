<HEADLINE> Toxic Chemicals Spill Alert After Truck Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A truck driver was seriously
injured early today after his tanker overturned on an expressway
in Japan, spilling some 1,600 liters of toxic chlorine chemicals
onto the road, the press reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened this morning on the Tokyo-Nagoya in
Shizuoka Prefecture when the truck hit the central barrier and
turned on its side, blocking traffic in both directions.
</P>
<P>
Rain turned the leaked fatty acid chloride into chlorine gas
and emergency warnings were broadcast to local residents, telling
them to close their windows and stay indoors, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police highway patrol squads and local firemen spread sand and
counteragents to clean up the substance, and two other tanker
trucks were sent to the site to siphon the remaining chemical from
the overturned truck, highway patrol officials said.
</P>
<P>
The highway interchange between Yoshida and Kikugawa was closed
around 6:30 a.m.. The part of the highway carrying Tokyo-bound
traffic was reopened in the afternoon, while that to Nagoya is
expected to return to operation later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Lifting Siege on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called for lifting "the siege" imposed by Israel on the
Palestinian people and resuming their security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we denounce terrorism that kills innocent people,
we should say no to the siege of the Palestinian people as well,"
Mubarak told a press conference following his meeting with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the best way to settle the crisis is to establish
security cooperation between the Palestinians and the Israelis, to
eliminate all obstacles facing the peace process and to build
confidence between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he discussed with the Israeli minister the
"punitive" measures imposed on the Palestinian National Authority
following the July 30 Jerusalem bombings that killed 15 people and
injured 170 others. But he declined to go into details.
</P>
<P>
"We are against terrorism, bloodshed and killing of innocent
people and also against leaving people starved and without medical
treatment," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are a number of proposed ideas on resuming
negotiations and coordination is going on with the United States,
the key mediator in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had also been mediating between the Palestinians and
Israelis for a resumption of peace talks while the twin bomb
attacks in Jerusalem shattered the hope.
</P>
<P>
Levy arrived here today to discuss with Egyptian leaders on the
peace process. The visit came a few days ahead of another regional
tour of U.S. Mideast Envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Levy defended Israel's crackdown on the Palestinian-controlled
areas in the wake of Jerusalem bombings and urged the Palestinians
to uproot terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We were forced to take these measures," he told a press
conference held after a 30-minute session with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The aim is not to "weaken the powers of the Palestinian
National Authority nor to lead to its fall," but to create "a sort
of awareness of the importance of security cooperation and of
uprooting terrorism," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Levy is apparently taking advantage
of Egypt's influence on PNA President Yasser Arafat to pressure
the PNA to launch a war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the PNA is doing everything possible to prevent
further deterioration of the situation and urged Israel to ease
its "collective penalty" of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Levy's visit here synchronized with an emergency meeting of the
Arab League, called by Arafat to discuss Israel's "collective
punishment" of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the twin bomb attacks, Israel imposed tight
travel restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza, halted the transfer
of tax revenues to the PNA and suspended peace talks. It has
rounded up 156 Palestinians suspected of terrorist activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said that his office and the SAR Government have
established a close cooperative relationship in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting held tonight by the Hong Kong Chinese
General Chamber of Commerce, Ma said that, with support and
assistance from the SAR Government and Hong Kong residents from
all walks of life, his office has been operating in a quite normal
way since its establishment a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"I myself has established a close working relationship with
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa. All the department directors in my
office have also set up communication channels with related
offices of the SAR Government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past month he has passed three letters of
authority signed by Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
onto Tung Chee Hwa, which were about the signing of the Hong
Kong-British civil aviation agreement, negotiations on mutual
visa-free access agreement with related countries, and
negotiations with related countries on legal assistance,
investment protection and civil aviation transit agreements.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the Commissioner's Office, the HKSAR
Government and the Chinese embassy in Cambodia have also been
working closely to provide consular protection and assistance to
Hong Kong residents stranded in that country during the conflict
last month.
</P>
<P>
At present the Office is working closely with the SAR
Government on preparations for the World Bank/International
Monetary Fund annual meetings to be held in Hong Kong in
September, as well as on the issue of the Vietnamese boat people.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central People's Government has granted the SAR
Government quite comprehensive authority in dealing with external
affairs and this fully demonstrates the Central Government's trust
in and support for the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
He said the Office is established to protect the country's
sovereignty and interests, including the interests of the HKSAR
and the legal rights and interests of Hong Kong residents, and
assist the SAR in developing economic, trade and other relations
with foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner's Office will strictly abide by the related
provisions in the Basic Law, and the staff in the Office will also
abide by related laws of the SAR, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ma also talked about the responsibilities of the Commissioner's
Office, the relationship between the Office and the SAR
Government, the scope of authority granted to the SAR by the
Central Government and other related matters.

<HEADLINE> British Government Pledges to Help Montserrat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government has pledged
to help the Caribbean island of Montserrat in reversing the
exodus of local residents from the island, which has been severely
hit by a series of powerful volcanic eruptions.
</P>
<P>
Britain's International Development Secretary Clare Short told
a press conference today after meeting with chief minister of the
British colony Bertrand Osborne that Britain would help Montserrat
by carefully developing the northern part of the island unaffected
by the active Soufriere Hills volcano.
</P>
<P>
"It is my own view that people who have left might well return
when they know what our commitment is to the north," Short said.
</P>
<P>
Short ruled out the possibility of evacuating the eastern
Caribbean island, saying a massive evacuation had "never ever been
contemplated".
</P>
<P>
Osborne said scientists had advised that about 15-16 square
miles (39-41 sq km) in the northern part were safe, giving the
possibility of a planned development of the island with suitable
housing and with a view to tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to a new Montserrat and we are pretty
confident that we will have a new Montserrat that most
Montserratians will come back to," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also promised
to help the people of Montserrat during his talks with Osborne on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Government will continue to place the highest priority on
sustaining, and improving, the economic and social structure of
Montserrat," Cook said.

GENEVA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China said today that no country
should impose its domestic laws on the rest of the world with
regard to human rights.
</P>
<P>
The rule of law should not be distorted into a self-claiming
authority of a big power to impose its internal law on the rest of

Chinese human rights expert told a meeting of a sub-commission of
the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Any resolution adopted in the legislative body of a single
state ... has no competence whatsoever beyond its boundary and can
in no way be accepted as a supra-national legal instrument," Fan
Guoxiang told the 49th session of the Sub-Commission on Prevention
of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities.

The current session will last until August 29.

ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said on Tuesday that some

</P>
<P>
Samaranch said there was a split in international sport between
officials who wanted to catch doping offenders and those who did
not.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised with sports that there are two different
worlds," Samaranch said. "One world with the IOC and international
federations fighting against doping.
</P>
<P>
"There is a second world where they do nothing against doping."
</P>
<P>
But he did not give the names of the countries or federations
to which he was referring.

The International Ski Federation (FIS) want the downhill

But Nagano chiefs have refused, saying it would break

Samaranch said: "Thousands of skiers use this zone during the

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The MCI Communications
Corporation, the second largest player in the telecommunication
industry in the U.S., is expected to offer a service that will
permit computer users simultaneously to receive video broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
By using the technology of a small new company in Seattle
called Progressive Networks, MCI wishes to let computer users to
watch both live and on-demand broadcasts, according to a report by
the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Although the alliance with Progressive Networks is another step
in the convergence of television and the Internet, experts said
there are sill considerable barriers in producing
television-quality programs by way of the Internet. The images are
small and motion is often jerky or sometimes nonexistent because
of network congestion.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, MCI and Progressive Networks planned to
distribute copies of digital video programs to many points in
MCI's Internet backbone. The so-called multicast capability of the
Realnetwork system will permit as many as 50,000 users to view it
simultaneously and as many as 10 million to 15 million people
daily to tune in to digital programs on their PC's, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The two companies said that the project will be profitable
even though they will reach far smaller audiences than are now
reached by broadcast television.

Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi declared that any oil
contract between the Caspian Sea littoral states and foreign
companies without taking into consideration the interests of other
countries concerned lacks legal base and will be problematic.
</P>
<P>
"Inviting third party companies for partnership in oil
exploration in the Caspian Sea should be on the basis of the legal
status of the sea approved by the littoral states and any
unilateral action in this respect should be avoided," he was
quoted by the official news agency IRNA in an interview.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian official did not point his figure to any
specific nations. It is obvious that Iran refers to oil contracts
concluded between Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and U.S. and European
firms.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi said, according to the 1921 Amity and Friendship Accord
between Iran and the former Soviet Union and the Navigation and
Trade Treaty Of 1940, any unilateral action by the states
bordering the Caspian Sea will be unacceptable unless the legal
regime of the Caspian Sea is approved by all littoral states.
</P>
<P>
He said any reference made by the officials of the
littoral state to the divisions of the former Soviet Union is
not acceptable because the international conventions are legally
more valid than individual rights.
</P>
<P>
"Certain states have caused unrest in the sensitive region by
signing unilateral contracts with foreign companies," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said "Iran believes that all rights concerning the
Caspian Sea should be honored equally on the basis of the
principle of respecting the independence of the states, good
neighborly relations, and useful cooperation and that the Caspian
Sea should be exploited for peaceful goals."
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, the largest landlocked sea in the world,
has proven oil reserves of 28 billion barrels and large amount
of natural gas resources. The five littoral states are Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Mandela: S.Africa-Portugal Ties Still Sound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said today that relations between Pretoria and Lisbon remain
sound after expulsion of Portuguese Ambassador Vasco Valente.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters in Pretoria that he had been in contact
with his Portuguese counterpart Jorge Sampaio over the incident.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations (with Portugal) remain sound...If there are any
differences and reservations, they relate only to the particular
official," he said.
</P>
<P>
Valente was given 48 hours to leave South Africa last Friday
after a private letter from Mandela to Indonesian President
Suharto was mistakenly delivered to the Portuguese Embassy in
Pretoria and then leaked to the media.
</P>
<P>
The letter called for the release of jailed East Timorese rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
Valente, whose term of office was to have expired on August 30,
left for home last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese Foreign Ministry in a statement Monday said it
regretted the expulsion, which is the first of its kind since the
Mandela government took power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs today also played down
reports of a diplomatic tiff with Portugal, saying the expulsion of
Valente in no way reflected on the cordial relations between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt, Oil Firms Clash over Price Fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government and the
oil industry are in dispute over what the authorities called unfair
pricing of petroleum products by oil companies, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government appears impatient with the way the eight local
oil companies are pricing their products and has gone to the
extent of threatening to re-introduce price controls if the
industry fails to regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
However, the oil companies, argue that pricing policies are
dictated by market forces and are, therefore, unlikely to change
simply for the sake of pleasing the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The standoff heightened last week when the government hinted
at a high level meeting with the oil industry players that it
might be forced to put in place some controls over retail prices
of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan Minister for Energy Kirugi M'Mukindia accused
the oil firms of being too quick in raising retail prices of
their products "at the slightest excuse" while dragging their
feet to reduce prices when international crude oil prices
dropped.
</P>
<P>
Only last month, some oil companies delayed reducing pump
prices by up to two weeks following the lowering of international
crude oil prices, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that the government would find it hard
to re-introduce price controls without upsetting other key
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
They said that re-introduction of controls would not be viewed
well in terms of the financial reforms that had been going on
over the last few years, and could be seen as a "complete
turnaround" in government policies.
</P>
<P>
They also charged the government of sometimes failing to take
into account the factors that are critical in the pricing of oil.
</P>
<P>
Although the prices of crude oil in the world market has
stabilized at slightly over 18 Dollars per barrel, a slight
depreciation of the Shilling would have a very severe effect on
retail prices, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
With the suspension of aid by the International Monetary Fund
announced last week, the shilling is expected to continue
depreciating further pushing procurement costs higher.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation has already started taking its toll. Last
week all oil companies except Mobil increaseed their prices by
between 40 cents and 60 cents to reflect the change in the
Shilling's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The shilling suffered further on Friday, dropping to 60
Shillings the dollar range. Before riots rocked the eastern
African country on July 7 with 13 killed, the shilling had
stablized at 55 shilling against one dollar.

<HEADLINE> Britons Are Much More Found of Chocolate than Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain is a nation of
chocoholics, consuming much more chocolate per head than any other
European country.
</P>
<P>
The average consumer in the UK spends 91.11 US dollars a year
on chocolate, eating almost 14kg annually, according to a survey
by Datamonitor, the management consultants.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Britons spend 5.3 billion US dollars a year on
chocolate, a quarter more than Europe's second largest market,
Germany (4.3 billion US dollars), and substantially more than the
number three market, France (2.1 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ireland comes a close second, with average consumers spending
90.39 on 13.72kg a year.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and Switzerland, renowned for their chocolate-making
skills, rank numbers four and eight in the chocoholics league
table of per capita spending.
</P>
<P>
The chocolate market in Europe was now worth more than 30
billion US dollars, and no one was contributing more to this
figure than the British, Datamonitor said.
</P>
<P>
The total chocolate market in western Europe is 18.5 billion US
dollars, up from 16.8 billion US dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to Roccoco, one of Britain's retailer of hand-made
chocolates, the British love affair with chocolate is becoming
ever more adventurous.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are moving away from traditional milk chocolate to
bitter dark bars, and flavors such as chilli and Earl Grey are
selling well, Roccoco said.
</P>
<P>
Chocolate has been credited with a number of unique qualities
since it was introduced to Europeans by Spanish explorer Hernan
Cortes in early 16th century.
</P>
<P>
Most recently doctors claimed that chocolate could help in the
prevention of heart attacks.

women's 1,500 meters gold medal with a time of four minutes 4.24

</P>
<P>
The silver and bronze were won by Regina Jacobs of the United

</P>
<P>
The race saw the field roll forward like a tight knot with Malin
Eweriof of Sweden leading the pace. Jacobs, the 1997 world leader and
U.S. champion, and Sacramento, world bronze medallist in 1995, stayed
close behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
Jacobs accerelated at the bell with Weyermann and Sonia O'Sullivan
of Ireland running together with her. The race turned to a
push-and-hustle battle on the back stretch where Weyermann pushed
her way clear to lead the bunch.
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, who was still fourth off the final curve, opened a
brilliant kick on the straight for the title, while Weyermann got the
bronze with a desperate fling at the finish. O'Sullivan, former world
champion and world number one from 1994 to 1996, fated to eighth in
4:07.81.

<HEADLINE> Cape Town Represents Africa for 2004 Olympic Bid: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J0HANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Cape Town is representing
Africa for the 2004 Olympic Games bid and all the continents had
hosted the Olympics except Africa, South African president Nelson
Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks when he was meeting with visiting
members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Pitching Cape Town's bid for the 2004 Olympic Games, Mandela
said, many people had offered assistance in different forms, but
"your vote for the African bid would be a vote for the deepening
democracy".
</P>
<P>
He said, while he understood the difficult decision faced by
the IOC members, who had also been canvassed by other bid cities,
South Africa expected "Our friends all over the world to support
us entrench democracy".
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela had
emphasized that South Africa had the capacity to host the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Mandela deserved a thank-you for showing the world how the
problems of a country could be solved without bloodshed or
frightening minorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world owes South Africa the Olympic Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
All 20 African members of the IOC have indicated they will
vote for Cape Town's bid, the city's Bidding committee announced
last month.
</P>
<P>
The other world cities bidding to host the 2004 Olympic Game
are Greece's Athens, Brazil's Buenos Aires, Italy's Rome, and
Sweeden's Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will meet on September 5 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to
select the winning city of the five bidders.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Most stock markets in Europe
shrugged off Wall Street's opening decline and ended higher today
on a firmer dollar and solid corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
Leading shares on the London market, Europe's largest, soared
to their highest level for a fortnight, just short of their record
closing value as the FTSE 100 index jumped more than a percent to
close at 4,960.60, up 64.9 points.
</P>
<P>
Drug and oil companies led the surge, shrugging off the threat
of another rate rise later this week and boosted by strong
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares finished the session little changed
after erasing strong early gains on the back of a sharp decline in
bond prices. The DAX-30 index closed up 5.74 points at 4,302.68.
</P>
<P>
However, French shares on the Paris bourse closed moderately
lower on continued profit-taking fuelled by expectations that US
interest rates, and possibly German rates, will rise soon. The
CAC-40 index ended the session down 8.31 points at 2,984.10.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker Calls for End of Total </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The legislative Palestinian
Council President, Ahmed Queria, today warned of the dangerous
consequences of the week-long collective punishment by the
Israeli government of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued in Ramallah, Queria appealed to
the Israeli government to halt all of its arbitrary and
aggressive measures, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli government should immediately stop
"coverting 3 million Palestinians into hostages and detainees
in their cities, villages and refugee camps."
</P>
<P>
"We Palestinian people will not accept bow to be a victim of
war and expansion ideology which dominate the minds of some
Israeli leaders," Queria said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities imposed a total closure on the
Palestinian territories in the wake of a double suicide bombing
in Jerusalem Wednesday, in which 15 people were killed and 170
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians say that the blockade has caused 5 million
U.S. dollar loss for the Palestinian economy every day.
</P>
<P>
Israel also suspended tax revenue transfer to the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and jam the Voice of Palestine radio
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the U.S. role, Queria said in the statement: "If
Washington does not play its role as a neutral co-sponsor for
the peace process, it will drive the peace process to a total
collapse."
</P>
<P>
The head of the Palestinian legislature criticized the
U.S. Congress for its decision to halt financial support to the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, the Congress is proving its hostile position
toward the Palestinian people and its prejudice in favor of the
Israeli acts of aggression," he said.

CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Trade between Cyprus and Israel reached 70
million U.S. dollars in the first half of this year from 52
million dollars during the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the Israeli Embassy here
today, the increase in trade was almost entirely caused by a
sharp rise in Israeli exports to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Imports by Cyprus from Israel, mainly pharmaceutical products
and electrical equipment, stood at more than 50 million dollars
in the January-June period, an increase of 17 million dollars
over the corresponding period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot exports to Israel, mainly leather and wood products,
totaled 19.7 million dollars in the first half of 1997,
virtually unchanged from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The total profits of 23 Kuwaiti companies
registered at the Kuwait stock market reached 158.8 million
dinars (524.0 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of this
year, up by 40 percent compared with the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Bader Fahd Al-Humaidhi, board chairman and managing director
of the Securities Group said the whole earnings of these firms
amounted to 113.7 million dinars (375.2 million U.S. dollars)
during the first six months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
He anticipated a 60 percent rise of the companies' profits in
the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said share holders' returns from stock investments will be
higher than those earned from bank assets, averaging at 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Altogether 77 public sector companies have been
offered for sale by the end of June as Egypt picks up its pace of
six-year privatization, Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial Committee for Privatization under the
chairmanship of Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri Monday
reviewed the privatization program until June 1997 by which date
nearly 22 percent of the public enterprise sector had been offered
for sale.
</P>
<P>
They included 14 companies whose assets and shares were totally
sold, 43 others over half of whose shares had been sold and 20
companies with less than 50 percent of their shares being sold.
</P>
<P>
The committee also approved to sell part of the shares of other 33
state-owned companies in the field of maritime transport, industry
and trade in the Bourse in the latter half of 1997, said
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif.
</P>
<P>
The total proceeds from selling the shares of these companies
totaled 5.88 billion Egyptian pounds (1.73 billion U.S. dollars)
of which 1.878 billion (552 million dollars) had been used to pay
debts owed to the banks.
</P>
<P>
Participation of the private sector represented 60 percent of
the volume of economic activities in Egypt by 1995, a 50 percent
rise over the 1970s. The sector is expected to shoulder 70 percent
of the investments in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
But the government has been reluctant to sell a majority stake
in vital sectors, such as oil and gas, telecommunications and
transports.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crown Prince to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
deputised Crown Prince Hassan to visit Israel tomorrow for talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The king made the decision after meeting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, who concluded a 2-day official visit here today,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's talks with Netanyahu will focus on ways to revive
the deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and overcome
the obstacles facing them.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with Netanyahu on the recent Israeli
measures against the Palestinians following double Hamas suicide
bombings that killed 15 people last week in West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held talks with Hussein, Hassan and Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali during his visit on the latest
developments of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president called for international intervention to save
the peace process today at a joint press conference with Majali
before leaving Amman.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held close-door talks with Hussein on Monday. During
the talks, the king made separate telephone calls to Netanyahu,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the United States Secretary
of State Madleine Albright to seek for means to reactivate the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled for more than four months
since Israel declared to build Jewish settlements in Arab East
Jerusalem. On July 26, Israel decided to build new Jewish
housings in Arab neighborhood in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The peace process then took a turn for the worse after the
Jerusalem bombings as Israel exerted a security clampdown on the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only Arab countries to have reached
peace with Israel and both mediators in the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector in
land-locked Lesotho remains an important stimulus for the
kingdom's economic growth, with the continuing inflow of foreign
investments, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 30 anniversary of Lesotho National Development
Corporation (LNDC) on Monday in Maseru, capital of the kingdom,
LNDC's Chief Executive Sophia Mohapi said foreign investors
continued to respond to the tiny kingdom's investment overtures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that foreign investment to the LNDC's 21
development projects by the end of 1996 stood at 57 million Rand
(about 12.4 million US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mohapi said these projects had an employment potential of
6,500 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
She also said the success in the clothing and footwear sectors
would continue to act as the main source of investment into the
country.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mohapi stressed that the successful
development of the manufacturing sector in the kingdom would
depend on the cooperation and support of all government
ministries, the private sector and international financing
institutions in the implementation of the corporation's
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked mountain country surrounded by
South Africa.

<P>
ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- World defending champion Ivan Pedroso
of Cuba retained his world title in the men's long jump final with a
8.42-meter leap at the 6th World Athletics Championships here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The silver and bronze medals were snatched by Erick Walder of the
United States at 8.38 and Kirill Sosunov of Russia at 8.18
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Pedroso, whose personal best is 8.71 meters, opened brilliantly
with his longest leap tonight, but fouled the following four jumps in a
row. His fifth round leap was about 8.70 meters, but he slightly
fouled at the jumping line.
</P>
<P>
The world indoor champion this year went all out on the final
outing, only managing a poor 7.60.
</P>
<P>
Walder chased the Cuban all the way, with a 8.29m opener, followed
by an impressive combination of 8.15, 8.29, 8.36 and 8.30.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan would not meet South African
President Nelson Mandela this week, the South African president's
office announced today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the announcement, Mandela told reporters in Pretoria
that last night Annan and him had telephone conversation on what
he described as "sensitive matters" .
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important that he should come here to discuss
these issues further. We will meet on Friday," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela declined to say what the issues were.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Annan, said in New York yesterday
that an "unfortunate misunderstanding" had arisen during Anan's
telephonic conversation with Mandela earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
A poor line was apparently to blame for Mandela mistakenly
believing that Annan was coming to South Africa, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
He added it it was understood that Jamsheet Marker, a special
representative appointed by Anan to mediate in talks between
Indonesia and Portugal to settle differences over East Timor
would meet Mandela, but no date had been set.
</P>
<P>
Marker is chairing UN-sponsored talks in New York on East
Timor to resolve the dispute between Indonesia and portugal over
the former Portuguese colony.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania today urged the
United Nations to ensure it extends the Security Council's
permanent membership to include African, Asian and Latin American
Regions.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian stand was expressed by Minister for foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation Jakaya Kiwete in a speech
read by the ministry's principal secretary, Elly Mtango, at a
two-day workshop on "U.N. Reform" in the Tanzanian capital.
</P>
<P>
Kiwete said in the speech that expansion is necessary to
ensure fair representation in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania supports the U.N. reform but the issue of inequitable
representation in the Security Council is one of major concerns,
according to Kiwete.
</P>
<P>
Other issues of concerns listed by Kiwete are the right to
development, financial crisis of the U.N. system, restructuring
of the U.N. secretariat, coordination of the U.N. and its
specialized agencies, peace and security, economic and social
issues and humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these concerns have covered in the U..N reform
proposals which contain wide ranging recommendations on how best
the U.N. system should function in the changing world and
especially in the next millennium," the Tanzanian foreign
minister noted.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Considers Upcoming Direct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
considers the forthcoming second round of direct talks between
leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities as the
utmost importance for a Cyprus settlement, a government spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides made the remarks at
his daily press briefing while commenting on the upcoming second
round of U.N.-sponsored direct talks between Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
scheduled to take place in Switzerland from August 11 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Christofides pointed out that "our wish and objective is to
continue these talks which we believe offer a unique opportunity
to break the deadlock and make progress toward a solution."
</P>
<P>
Referring to possible outcomes of the talks, the spokesman
said the two sides could reach a joint agreement giving the
guidelines on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that everybody involved in this process will
seek ways to bridge the gap between the two sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government, he said, agrees with a U.N. suggestion
that both sides submit a draft constitution by the end of the
year, but would also like to see the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides submitting documents on all aspects of the Cyprus problem,
which need to be clarified.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman for the U.N. peace-keeping force in
Cyprus, Waldemar Rokoszewski, confirmed here today that the
second round of talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides will take place in the small town of Glion, near Montreux,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He said Clerides and Denktash will continue their talks that
began in Troutbeck, near New York, last month.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel will
leave Sunday for Geneva to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign envoys, who were present in the first round of direct
negotiations in Troutbeck, will also be in Glion, to assist
the U.N. if and when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite this island
nation as bi-communal, bi-zonal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urges Closer Ties Among Southern African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Fisheries
Fatima Jardim today said Southern African countries, especially
the coastal countries should work out common development strategy
and strengthen bilateral cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Jardim made the remarks to newsmen after she met the visiting
Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao.
</P>
<P>
During her talks with Simao, the Angolan minister said the two
sides agreed that Mozambique and Angola should enhance
cooperations in every field, especially in trade, mutual
investment and the exchange in developing new products.
</P>
<P>
This would benefit entrepreneurs of the two countries, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
Jardim said Angola and Mozambique have mapped out new programs
for bilateral and regional cooperation, as the economic treaty on
cooperation signed seven years ago ceased to be implemented since
the two countries were busy on its own peace process and came
across economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
She said Angolan leaders will soon contact their Mozambican
counterparts, in a bid to coordinate their policies and resume
and further promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jardim stressed the importance to step up the bilateral ties
between Angola and Mozambique and the relations among the
Southern African countries, saying this would help cement the
friendship among the countries and maintain stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Simao arrived here Monday for a four-day visit with the aim of
strengthening the bilateral ties between Angola and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Role Projected for Turkish Party's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Welfare Party (RP)
leader Necmettin Erbakan today threatened that he will appeal to
the European Court of Human Rights if his party is closed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the RP parliamentary group meeting, Erbakan vowed
that no political parties legally established should be abolished
in any democratic countries.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister said that his RP, with around 4
million members, is the biggest party in Turkey and should be by
no means neglected.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the remark amid the growing calls from the
certain secularist force for the closure of the RP, the senior
partner of the coalition government which resigned in June.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Chief Prosecutor filed a case to call for RP
closure at the Constitutional Court on May 21 on the grounds of
RP's Islamic tendency.
</P>
<P>
The RP had submitted a 215-page petition containing its
preliminary defense to the court on Monday, according to local
reports.
</P>
<P>
Describing the anti-RP case as "an artificial move," Erbakan
said that the charge against his party has no legal reason.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and his RP have long been accused by the military and
other opposition parties of conniving at the fundmentalists in the
secular republic.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic politician resigned June 18 under the two fold
pressure from the military and rebelling parliamentary deputies
of the True Path Party, the junior partner of then coalition
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Russia and
Japan are better now than ever before, Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov told journalists on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Moscow and Tokyo have managed to overcome the
negative aspects related to the territorial problem in their
relations.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed on the need to develop mutually-beneficial
joint economic activities in the South Kurils among other places.
</P>
<P>
Agreements on fishing remain the only difficult problem, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Practice of regular top level Russian-Japanese
consultations may become an indication of the significant
improvement of relations, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The development of relations with Japan and other countries of
the Asian-Pacific region is of extraordinary significance for
Russia from the view point of its geopolitical interests and the
strengthening of its role in a new, multipolar world, Primakov
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that as for China, the key task for the two countries
this year will be "the completion of the border demarcation."
</P>
<P>
If this does not happen, the future of the border agreement
with China, which is very important for Russia, may come under
question, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He called for dropping regionalist interests hindering the
dialogue between Moscow and Beijing on border matters, or for
being guided by the need for speedy enforcement of the border
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Arab League: Israeli Practices Invite Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Council said
today Israel's failure to abide by the peace agreements with the
Palestinians has invited violence to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of an emergency meeting here
today, the AL's permanent delegates outlined a unified Arab stand
in face of Israel's "retaliatory" measures.
</P>
<P>
They categorically rejected Israeli allegations that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is culpable for the July 30
twin bombings in Jewish west Jerusalem that killed 13 Israeli
civilians and injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
"Such acts are virtually the product of Israel's arrogant
stances and its non-commitment to the accords it signed with the
PNA while the latter is fully abiding by them," said the
harshly-worded communique.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's halt of the peace process on all
tracks has escalated tension in the region, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
"Its persistence in expansionist and settlement-building
policies, usurpation of the Palestinian lands, alteration of the
demographic features of Jerusalem and demolition of the bases of
the peace process, have triggered off the current state of
affairs," the communique added.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers' desecration of the Muslim and Christian sacred
figures and beliefs also contributed to the tensions in the
region, it said.
</P>
<P>
The communique saw the Israeli measures tantamount to waging a
war upon the Palestinians and their leadership and requested an
immediate end of them.
</P>
<P>
Accelerating resumption of the peace process on all tracks,
reaching a fair, permanent and overall peace and a full Israeli
withdrawal from territories occupied in and after 1967, represent
the sole way out of the current stalemate and tension, it
concluded.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid, at a press conference
at the end of the meeting, urged an immediate action on all the
regional and international arenas to lift the embargo on the
Palestinian people imposed by Israel after last week's bombing
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting, convened a month ahead of schedule, was
called at the request of PNA President Yasser Arafat to discuss
Israel's "collective punishment" of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The council, the supreme organ of the Arab League, may, if
necessary, hold an extraordinary session at the request of two
member states.
</P>
<P>
Following the Jerusalem bomb explosions, Israel imposed a total
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, canceled the planned
resumption of peace talks and halted the transfer of tax revenues
to the PNA. It has arrested 156 Palestinians suspected of terrorist
activity.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that Arafat
should launch a long-term war against anti-Israeli terrorist
organization and their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
mid-March when Israel began the construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Russian Soyuz TM-26 Launched Successfully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Soyuz TM-26 spacecraft
with Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel Vinogradov blasted off from the
Baikonur space center without a hitch today at 7:35 p.m. Moscow
time, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The launch was attended by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev,
Russian Defense Council Secretary Yuri Baturin, Strategic Missile
Forces Commander Colonel-General Valery Grin and Russian Space
Forces.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted a Mission Control spokesman as saying Soyuz
TM-26 has successfully entered orbit at nine minutes following the
lift-off.
</P>
<P>
The two astronauts are coming to Mir for an unprecedented
mission of repairing the orbiting space station Mir damaged on
June 25 by collision with a Progress payload craft and continuing
the research program.
</P>
<P>
They will make a spacewalk into the damaged module on August 20
to mend its disabled power circuit and examine the module's
jacket to locate the puncture.
</P>
<P>
Another sortie into the airless Spektr module is scheduled for
September 3. Solovyov and Vinogradov will inspect the module's
exterior for any possible damage before further decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect this to take up to six spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
It is not ruled out that American astronaut David Wolf, who is
to come to Mir on the Atlantis shuttle to replace Foale in late
September, will take over one or two spacewalks from Vinogradov,
to handle the problem module with Solovyov.
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and space Administration has passed a
tentative decision on Wolf's part in the repairs job, with
reshuffle of Wendy Lawrence, an originally planned replacement
for Foale, for Wolf, her back-up.
</P>
<P>
Once the renewed Russian-American crew patch up the Spektr
laboratory module and restore it to operation, research will come
in the foreground.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today hoped that the friendly partnership relations
between his ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and
the Communist Party of China (CPC) will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who doubles as MMD Chairman, said he also hoped the
friendly ties between the two countries will be reinforced
further.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with a visiting CPC delegation led by Li
Chengren, deputy head of the International Department of the CPC
Central Committee, Chiluba congratulated China on its resumption
of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong last month, a
source from the delegation told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Ciluba said Zambia does not want to see China's territory
divided and that this is his country's stance of "one China".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of Hong Kong will be decided
by the Chinese people, not by others.
</P>
<P>
The president highly spoke of the gradual and systemic reforms
of China and the achievements made through these reforms.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China for its consistent support to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The best way to strengthen the bilateral relations is to
develop partnership, work together and make profits together,
the Zambian President pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On Zambia's internal affairs, Chiluba said his government
advocates dialogue, and is opposed to violence and destruction.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Li Chengren said that under the leadership of
President Chiluba and the MMD party, Zambia has made a great
stride in safeguarding its sovereignty, maintaining national
unity, developing economy and improving people's life.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese Communist Party is willing to enhance the
bilateral relations with Zambia on the basis of complete
independence, equality, mutual respect and non-interference in
the internal affairs of other parties.
</P>

The delegation, which arrived here on July 31, will leave for

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Criticizes Judge Confirmation Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno on Tuesday criticized the Senate of an "unprecedented
slowdown" in confirming President Bill Clinton's nominees for
federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
In prepared remarks for the American Bar Association convention
in San Francisco, Reno says the situation has reached crisis
proportions.
</P>
<P>
The national debate over who should sit on the federal bench
"has been infused with a kind of criticism that does not seek to
argue the rightness of an issue, but to undermine the very
credibility of the judiciary," news reports quoted Reno as saying.
</P>
<P>
One out of every eight federal judge positions is vacant -- 101
out of 844. Though the administration sent up 46 nominations in
1996, the Republican-dominated Senate approved only 17 U.S.
district judges and no federal appeals judges. So far this year,
the Senate has confirmed nine district judges, including three
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reno said the cooperation between Congress and the
administration during President Clinton's first term has been
"derailed."
</P>
<P>
She said, "We have seen an unprecedented slowdown in the Senate
confirmation machinery...At this rate it would take almost seven
years just to fill out the existing vacancies."
</P>
<P>
Reno said the impact has been felt in Illinois and Texas, and
the chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit has had to cancel oral
argument in 600 cases this year. The circuit includes California,
Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii and Montana.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said the U.S. District Court in San Diego
"is holding only about 10 civil trials a year."

<HEADLINE> Canada's Building Permits Value Up in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The total value of building
permits rose to 5.6 billion U.S. dollars in Canada in the second
quarter, up 3.8 percent from the previous quarter, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive quarterly increase of the value
of building permits, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities issued 3.3 billion dollars in building permits
for new housing between April and June, down 5.1 percent from the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, residential permits issued still represent
the second highest level of activity since the third quarter of
1994, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In the non-residential sector, the value of permits increased
in the first two quarters of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, building intentions in the
non-residential sector rose by 19.5 percent to 2.3 billion
dollars. The sector has not been this buoyant since the fourth
quarter of 1990.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- June's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, a main gauge to trace the U.S. economic course, held
steady at May's level of 103.8, the Conference Board reported.
</P>
<P>
This has been regarded as a weaker performance by analysts who
had forecast a 0.4 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The unchanged performance in June followed an increase in May
of 0.3 percent and a decline in April of 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the six months from December 1996 to June 1997, the index
increased 1.1 percent. During the same period, seven of the 10
leading economic indicators advanced.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said five of its 10 indicators rose in
June, with the most significant coming in stock prices and money
supply. The most significant negative contributors in June were
average weekly first-time unemployment claims and the length of
the average factory work week.
</P>
<P>
The leading index is designed to forecast economic activity six
to nine months in advance. Thus, its June performance is in line
with a widespread belief that the economy's growth has cooled
off.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Enact New Constitution Soon, Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A new constitution will be
enacted in the war-torn Sudan within the next few days to secure
peace, according to Sudanese Vice President Al-Zubeir Mohammed
Salih today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made to the public in Atbara, north Sudan, Salih
said the implementation of the country's 14th constitution marks
the start of the four-year interim period for south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A council for the coordination of the south affairs, or "the
southern government," will be formed under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The council will comprise government officials and leaders of
the four small southern rebel factions, according to the Khartoum
Peace Accord signed between the two sides last April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy speaker of the National Assembly (Sudanese
parliament) Abdul-Aziz Shedu called on John Garang, the leader of
the largest anti-government group operation in southern Sudan, the
Sudan People's Liberation Army, to join the Sudanese peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Symposium on the new constitution today, Shedu
said "Garang has no longer a cause to fight for as the problem of
the south was solved by means of the Khartoum Peace Accord and the
14th Constitution provides for the implementation of the accord."
</P>
<P>
The rebels started their fighting in 1983 for an increased
autonomy for the predominantly African, animist and Christian south
of Sudan, which is traditionally dominated by the Muslim and Arab
north. The four rebel groups that signed the peace treaty broke
away form Garang's army in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Join International Convention against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August, 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon, which used to be
labeled by the West as a "heaven of hostage takers," today took a
crucial step forward to join international efforts curbing
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign and Emigrant Affairs Committee in the Parliament
approved a government bill to allow the country to join the
convention of countering international hostage-taking, the
official Lebanon News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The approval came six days after Washington lifted a
10-year-old ban on U.S. citizens' travel to Lebanon, imposed in
1987 after a series of kidnapings of U.S. citizens in Lebanon. But
the parliamentary committee denied any link between the two moves.
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Ali Khalil, stressed that the
committee approved the bill after hearing Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri's clarification that it was not under any pressure for
the government to work out the bill.
</P>
<P>
In the explanatory notes attached to the bill, the committee
emphasized that the approval didn't mean Lebanon's recognition of
Israel and Lebanon's agreement to establish any relations with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Lebanon's adherence to the resistance in south
Lebanon against the Israeli occupation, the committee said the
convention will not affect Lebanon's stance supporting the right
of any state or people to confront and resist foreign occupation
on their lands.
</P>
<P>
The bill has to be submitted to the parliament's general
session for a vote to become effective. Local political observers
say any bill adopted by its subordinate committees is always
passed by the unicameral house without difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Tanzania to Boost Coop in Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Moseveni said today that his country will boost cooperations in
road and water transport with neighboring Tanzania in a bid to
link the east African region with the rest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a speech opening bilateral talks here, Moseveni said,
Uganda and Tanzania are linked both culturally and politically,
especially in the struggle against foreign domination.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is ready to discuss all matters with Tanzania
particularly on the issue of road and water transport, the
Ugandan president added.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Uganda and Kenya are trying to solve some
transport issues in the region of Mount Elgon to link the region
with Ethiopia, whereas Uganda and the Democratic Republic of
Congo (formerly Zaire) will soon meet to map out how to improve
road transport between areas of western Uganda and eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
If the projected road program in the region is realized, the
continent of Africa will be linked, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, on his part,
pointed out that projects of cooperation between the two
countries are for their mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of exchanges between the private
sectors of the two countries, Mkapa noted that the current
Tanzanian delegation for bilateral talks has included businessmen
and enterpreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said he is confident that his visit will further promote

<HEADLINE> Johnson Rises, Zelezny Fells in Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- American Olympic hero Michael Johnson
overcame the tough time to gain his fourth world title in a row in the
men's 400 meters, while Czech men's world javelin record holder Jan
Zelezny slumped miserablely here Tuesday at the 6th World Athletics
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Johnson brought the third gold medal to the United States, which is
leading the gold medal table. Germany places second with two golds,
and the other nine top laurels were split each by as many nations.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's victory came not without a fight. The world best athlete
last year, who suffered a lot this season before the meet, lost his
dominating speed in today's final. He came off the final turn second
but somehow found some reserved strength with 50 meters to go for a
44.12-second win.
</P>
<P>
"I felt a cramp in my upper left leg at the entry to the last 100
meters. Fortunately, I got through it. After the rough season I have
had, I am glad to win and I don't want to look at the time as usually
everybody does," said the winner, whose 54 winning streak over eight
years for the 400 meters snapped last month.
</P>
<P>
Davis Kamoga of Uganda prevented an American 1-2 finish by beating
Tyree Washington in 44.37. Washington was timed in 44.39.
</P>
<P>
It was Zelezny's darkest night during his career. The three times
world champion and the outstanding world leader this year toppled
badly in the final, finishing ninth after the first three throws with
a 82.04 heave. The distance is more than 16 meters short of his world
record.
</P>
<P>
"No excuses! The day of th qualification was a good one, the day of
the final was an off one! The only problem has been my very poor
throwing technic today, " Zelezny said after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The men's javelin gold surprisingly went to Marius Corbett of South
Africa, who flang the spear to 88.40 meters, nearly four meters longer
than his personal best.
</P>
<P>
Steve Backley of Britain, Olympic and world silver medal winner,
almost went home empty-handed. He hit the silver winning throw on the
final round at 86.80, nipping Kostas Gatsioudis, the local hero
tonight, by 20 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ivan Pedroso of Cuba lived up to expectation by
winning the men's long jump gold with his 8.42-meter opener. The world
indoor champion this year fouled the following four leaps before
landing a poor 7.60m jump.
</P>
<P>
Erick Walder of the United States grabbed the silver at 8.38 ahead
of Kirill Sosunov of Russia's 8.18.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the first jump for the gold medal. Then I tried to get
the nine meters. The fourth and fifth attempts were very close, but I
slightly fouled," said a beamed Pedroso after the battle.
</P>
<P>
The day's other two finals were won by Carla Sacremento of Portugal
in the women's 1,500 meters and Sally Barsosio of Kenya in the women's
10,000 meters respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, world bronze medallist in 1995, beat Regina Jacobs of
the United States, the year's leader and hot favourite, with a
blistering kick on the home stretch to clock 4:04.24. Jacobs had to be
satisfied with the silver in 4:04.63. Anita Weyermann of Switzerland
nailed the bronze in 4:04.70. Former world great Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
The women's 10,000m final was also a giant-killing affair which saw
Barsosio, outside of the top 10 on this year's world best list, reel
over world and Olympic champion Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal with
three laps to go. She maintained her tempo to victory in 31:32.92.
Ribeiro wound up second in 31:39.15 and Japan's Masako Chiba finished
third in 31:41.93.
</P>
<P>
Barsosio said after her triumph:"From the beginning of the race I
planned to go away. Ribeiro has a strong kick and I didn't want to
wait for it. All the Kenyans at home will be proud of me."
</P>
<P>
Ribeiro, who only competed in the event once this year before the
meet, said:"I am happy of being second because I have been bothered by
some injuries. I tried to win but I couldn't make it. I am not
disappointed at all."
</P>
<P>
In today's qualification rounds, world famous athletes advanced to
next rounds smoothly. Five finals are slated for Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Armed Robberies Rampant in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Armed robberies in the west of
Nigerian commercial capital have increased over three times in
the last two weeks, apparently due to a lull in police's
crackdown operation.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted residents of Festac
Town, west of Lagos, as saying that two security guards were
gunned down last week by the hoodlums while two Chinese on a
trade mission were robbed thousands of U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A police source in the town confirmed residents' accounts that
the robbers have operated unchallenged in areas where the
security guards were shot at point-blank range for refusing to
open the gates.
</P>
<P>
Many of the robberies were so easily carried out that some
residents believed that the burglars could be living within the
town as they "knew exactly where police patrols are and their
modus operandi" before they struck.
</P>
<P>
Police, however, attributed their inability to deal with the
increasing armed robbery cases to inadequate telephone facilities
and fewer police vehicles deployed in the area.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources as saying that the relocation of
some well-to-do retired military and civil servants as well as
prosperous businessmen to the area and the intensification of
security patrols in other parts of Lagos have forced some of the
armed robbers to shift base to areas they consider safe.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of two helicopters two weeks ago to the police
to fight crime in the state has made it harder for criminals to
operate with impunity as they used to in broad day light in some
of the city's business districts.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has allocated 632,900 dollars to help
Ecuador and Peru lessen the most serious effects of El Nino, a
disastrous climatic condition, according to the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, which in past years has caused severe flooding,
droughts, avalanches and mudslides in parts of Latin America,
could affect over 8 million people in Peru and Ecuador in 1997,
according to recent forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's assistance will be mainly used to strengthen the
governments' ability to plan preventive measures and respond to
natural disasters, and will make improved satellite images and
weather maps available.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP and the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs are also
helping Poland respond to the worst flooding in Central Europe
this century, which has forced evacuation of 140,000 people, left
50,000 homeless and severely damaged infrastructure, agriculture
and industry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, S. Africa Seal Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and South Africa signed
here today the awaited trade agreement on satisfactory quota and
preferences for agricultural products in the ongoing negotiations
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
the accord, which was expected to increase Zimbabwe's trade
volumes to South Africa, however, excluded certain veterinary and
photosanitary issues.
</P>
<P>
Signed by Zimbabwean and South African ministers of industry
and commerce Nathan Shamuyarira and Alexander Erwin respectively,
the pact meant that virtually all products that were covered in
the 1964 agreement had been dealt with and preference margins
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
The products include beef, cereals, dairy products and
poultry.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 tons of beef, 1,000 tons of poultry meat and live
pigs are expected to be exported to South Africa duty free.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to boost agricultural exports to
South Africa by 44 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen and expand the trade accord, the two
ministers proposed to establish a trade and investment committee
which they would chair together.
</P>
<P>
The committee would monitor current arrangements and review
them when necessary.
</P>
<P>
It would deal with further trade liberalization, both
bilateral and in the context of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) protocol, and promote trade through private
sector participation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it would promote trade through harmonization of
all trade related measures and standards, promote investment
through conferences, cooperation by development corporations and
facilitating investment.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkish PM's Claim Over Aegean Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece today criticized the
statements by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz over the Aegean
Sea, saying that such claim undermined the spirit of the Madrid
communique signed between the two countries last month.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz reportedly said in the Sunday edition of the U.S. daily
Washington Post that international law could not be applied in
the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis said today
that Athens had requested clarification from Ankara over the
accuracy of Yilmaz's statements.
</P>
<P>
If Yilmaz was quoted accurately in the U.S. newspaper, his
claim undermined the spirit of the Madrid communique and supported
a claim that was entirely illogical, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Yilmaz's statements do not contribute to the efforts to
improve Greek-Turkish relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that relations between the two countries must be
governed by international law and international treaties.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique, which was signed between Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
while attending the NATO summit in Madrid, called for respect for
the sovereignty of each country, international law and treaties as
well as resolution of disputes through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> US President Signs Balanced Budget, Tax Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed into law today balanced federal budget and tax breaks bills
designed to balance the U.S. budget by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The legislation calls for balancing the federal budget in five
years by cutting government spending by about 130 billion dollars.
The tax bill will trim taxes by 152 billion dollars over five
years, the largest tax cut in the U.S. since 1981.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony held in South Lawn of the White House,
Clinton hailed the new laws as "a true milestone for our nation."
</P>
<P>
The balanced-budget bill is designed to eliminate deficits for
the first time since 1969. It calls for about 130 billion dollars
in spending restraints, much of it from squeezing payments to
doctors and hospitals in the giant Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
The tax bill features a 500-dollar-per-child credit for
families; a reduction in the capital-gains tax and roughly 35
billion dollars in benefits for students that Clinton wanted.
</P>
<P>
Details of the measures approved today now must be written into
13 appropriations bills that the U.S. Congress must pass for
Clinton to sign.
</P>
<P>
The balanced-budget and tax agreement was reached only when the
U.S. government and Republican-controlled Congress abandoned their
political grudges early this year, aided by a booming economy that
produced higher government revenues than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
In the fierce struggle between the two U.S. parties in 1995 and
1996, President Clinton twice vetoed Republican balanced budget
bills, leading to two partial government shutdowns in the winter
of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich attended the ceremony and said
that he doesn't intend to abandon the spirit of cooperation that
led to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, an opponent of the
pack, did not attend today's signing. In a letter, he urged
Clinton to use his line item veto authority to strike a provision
of the law that allows tobacco companies to deduct the proposed
cigarette tax increase from the proposed tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
Under the tax bill signed today, the current 24-cent-a-pack
federal tax on cigarettes will increase by 10 cents in 2000 and by
another nickel in 2002. That will raise 5.2 billion dollars over
five years and 16.7 billion over 10 years for the government
revenue.

these regions has risen from seven in 1985 to 110 this year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, more than 6,000 students from Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan are studying in mainland's colleges and universities,
mostly spreading in the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin and the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei and
Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the State Education Commission and other
departments concerned have taken various kinds of measures to
provide conveniences for Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan students, he
said.
</P>
<P>
the Commission will, as always, welcome and encourage more
students from these regions to come to study in China's inland
areas according to the principles of giving them the same national
treatment as mainland students, bestowing appropriate
consideration to them and guaranteeing the quality.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Sales at the Big Three auto makers
soared in Canada in July, setting a host of records for the month,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Canada Ltd. posted the biggest gains, breaking a

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Vows Fight Against British Rule to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), said today
that his party would maintain its objective of ending British rule
in Northern Ireland during next month's multi-party peace talks on
the region's future.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein enters negotiations as an Irish Republican party
seeking to promote the broad nationalist objective of an end to
British rule in Ireland," Adams said in his first meeting with
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam in Belfast since
the IRA declared a ceasefire on July 20.
</P>
<P>
"We want an Ireland free and independent," media reports quoted
Adams as saying while the talks were underway.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein had been barred from negotiations on Northern Ireland
between officials from Britain, Ireland and the United States'
mediator because of the IRA's refusal to renounce violence in its
struggle against British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,200 people have been killed in the fighting over
the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader also appealed to the pro-British unionist
parties not to walk out of the talks when they resume in the
second week of September.
</P>
<P>
The unionist parties in Northern Ireland insist that Sinn Fein
be excluded from the multi-party peace talks until the IRA
surrenders its weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein wants to see the unionist parties at the negotiating
table in September... Unionists are an intrinsic part of
Ireland. This is your home," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Labor government to adopt the role of "a
persuader" to convince Unionists that their future inevitably lies
in a united Ireland.

<P>
Beijing, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior PLA officer has called

and greet the upcoming 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party by recording new achievements.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yongbo, director. of the General Political Department of the

</P>
<P>
Yu said Jiang's speech laid the ideological and theoretical
basis for the forthcoming Party congress.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the important decisions made by the Party
Central Party follow the directions of Deng Xiaoping's theory of

<HEADLINE> South Africa Beats India to Qualify for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa defeated India 3-0 in
a qualifying match here on Wednesday, thus becoming the first team
to qualify for the World Cup women's field hockey tournament next
year.
</P>
<P>
India struggled to answer to the awesome strike power of
18-year-old Pietie Coetzee, who scored all three of South Africa's
goals to bring her total to 10, including another hat-trick, in
four qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
South Africa opened nervously without their usual fluency, and
were initially troubled by the close passing and artistry of their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
In the 21st minute, however, Coetzee put South Africa on the
board with a powerful reverse stick shot from the left that
bounced off the far post -- and her team then took control of the
game.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, a free hit by Lindsey Carlisle from just
outside the circle saw Coetzee pouncing on the ball to score and
give South Africa a 2-0 interval lead.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw India penned into their own half for long
periods with Coetzee completing her hat-trick twelve minutes into
the period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Refute US Report on Religion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's religious
community and scholars today expressed indignation over a recent US
State Dept. report on religion which included unfounded
accusations on the religious situation in China.
</P>
<P>
The US report represents a gross interference in China's
internal affairs, according to members of the religious community
and scholars attending a forum sponsored by the Religion Research
Center in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Shi Zesheng, vice-chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic
Movement Committee of Protestant Churches in China, pointed out
that China's Constitution and related laws guarantee Chinese
citizens full freedom of religious belief, and protect the
activities of religious organizations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that some people flaunt the banner of
religion and disrupt public security by resorting to demagogy to
engage in seducing female followers.
</P>
<P>
He added the United States has itself cracked down on similar
illegal activities, with the most notable case centering on the
all-out assault on the Branch Davidians some two years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, some people in the United States cited China's
punishment of law violators as "interference in religious freedom"
and 'cracking down on religious groups'.
</P>
<P>
He said that in doing so, these people deliberately confused
right from wrong and represented nothing more than blasphemy of
sacred religious belief.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech at the forum, Doctor Han Wenzao, president
of the China Christian Council, said that he was shocked that the
US State Deptment would release such an unfactual report.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that there is religious freedom in China, Han said.
</P>
<P>
More than 12,000 Protestant churches and 25,000 religious
venues have reopened in China since 1979. Today there are over 17
Protestant seminaries, compared to only one prior to the Cultural
Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Han pointed out that Xu Yongze, the subject of the report,
wantonly preached that "the end of the world is coming
soon," and incited followers to engage in extended sessions
of wailing. Xu's activities seriously affected the normal life
and work of his followers, with a number of people later diagnosed
as schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
"Xu's activities deviated from the true teachings of the
Sculpture and the truth of Christianity, and he has been detained
for illegal activities in accordance with normal legal procedures
in China. Xu's detention can in no way be compared to
so-called 'religious persecution," said Han.

Bishop Ding Guangxun, president of the China Christian Council,
said that the US report "fully demonstrates that the United States
considers itself as the world police and global leader.
</P>
<P>
"I did not hope that the US advisory committee on overseas
religious freedom will become a tool enabling the US State
Department to engage in overseas intervention."
</P>
<P>
Ding also serves as honorary chairman of the Three-Self
Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China,
an self-supporting organization in terms of both administration
and propagation.
</P>
<P>
The US report blatantly attacks China for "controlling churches"
and "denying the Vatican the authority to appoint bishops."
</P>
<P>
However, Fu Tieshan, vice-chairman of the Chinese Catholic
Bishops College, refuted the argument on historical facts.
</P>
<P>
Fu noted that 29 Chinese bishops, or 21 percent of the total
number of bishops nationwide, served in 137 parishes during
semi-feudal and semi-colonial periods in old China. He also
pointed out that only three of 20 archbishops were Chinese.
</P>
<P>
All colonial characteristics of Chinese Catholicism ended with
liberation. China currently has 115 parishes led by Chinese
bishops and parish priests.
</P>
<P>
The parishes have made a conscientious effort to nurture
more than 900 young and capable priests.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the nation's Catholic churches host more
than 100,000 priests and religious believers from some 90
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese bishops, priests and believers in Old China were seldom
invited to participate in foreign exchanges or international
conferences.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten-plus years, however, members of the Chinese
Catholic community have visited 20 countries and regions,
including Belgium, Germany and the United States.

Jing Hui, vice-president of the Buddhist Association. of China
who has lived in temples for decades, outlined freedom of
religious belief in China based on his personal experience.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Jing has been in charge of reconstructing the
Bailin Monastery belonging to the Dhyana Buddhist Sect. According
to Jing, the monastery performs large-scale meditation and sutra
recitation services at least four times per year, with hundreds
to thousands of devout believers attending each session.
</P>
<P>
The monastery has organized summer camps for young Buddhists on
an annual basis since 1993, with each camp attracting as many as
200 participants, including a number of young people from
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
All these activities are organized and managed by local
Buddhists and are free from any outside interference.
</P>
<P>
With reference to the US report's support of the 14th Dalai
Lama, Jing Hui and Jiamyang Tubdan, abbot of the Yonghe Lamasery
in Beijing and executive council member of the Buddhist
Association of China, pointed out that the 14th Dalai Lama has
alienated himself from the vast majority of Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
The 14th Dalai Lama has abandoned the fine tradition of loyalty
to the motherland established by his predecessors, and has instead
opted to establish a government in exile, engage in activities to
split the motherland, violate all historical conventions and
sabotage the search for the reincarnated soul boy of the 10th
Panchen Lama, and disrupt the internal unity and precepts of
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Jiamyan Tubdan asked why Buddhist believers should have
any trust in the 14th Dalai Lama, a harbinger of disaster to his
country and Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the United States has acted as a mouthpiece
to air the grievances of the Dalai Lama clearly indicates the
backing he receives from foreign forces.

Min Zhiting, vice-president of the China Taoist Association,
said the Constitution stipulates religious freedom for all
Chinese. No government department, mass organization or individual
may force a Chinese citizen to either believe or disbelieve in
religion, nor are they allowed to discriminate against citizens
believing and not believing in religions.
</P>
<P>
"Constitutional protection has enabled Taoism to enjoy New
China's religious freedom which is totally free of
discrimination," said Min.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is currently home to 4,105 Taoist temples,
as well as 15 Taoist associations at the provincial level and 108
associations at the county level.
</P>
<P>
Taoists are playing their role in the political arena by
serving as deputies to people's congresses and members of Chinese
people's political consultative conferences.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The US report totally distorts the actual religious
situation in China."
</P>
<P>
Haji Shamsiddin Mahmud, vice-president of the China Islamic
Association, refuted allegations that China is restricting the
religious freedom of ethnic minorities."
</P>
<P>
Mahmud pointed out that the Constitution guarantees the right
to religious freedom for all Chines citizens, and he stressed that
the Chinese government has paid special attention to protecting
the legitimate rights and interests of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
For example, the government has granted Muslims the right to
burial rather than cremation, protected their traditional
lifestyles, and severely punished those defiling their religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Mahmud said the government has provided convenient passport
certification, foreign currency exchange and transportation enabling
large numbers of Muslims to take pilgrimages to Mecca, and travel
to other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 45,000 Muslims have undertaken paid pilgrimages and
engaged in religious studies in other countries, said Min.

Wu Yungui, director of the Religious Research Institute under

director of the Religion Research Center, maintained that it is
beyond the realm of common sense that the US report claims that
the Chinese government restricts freedom of religion and
persecutes religion.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party has
been unswervingly pursuing the policy on religious freedom,
and respecting both religions and religious believers.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution stipulates religious freedom as a basic right
for all Chinese citizens, with detailed clauses on protection
contained in the Criminal Law, General Rules on Civil Law, Law on
Regional Autonomy, Military Service Law, Compulsory Education Law,
Election Law and Village Committee Organization Law.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Zhao joined in stressing that not a single person in
China has been imprisoned or arrested for their religious beliefs,
and that all citizens are equal before the law, regardless of
their religious preferences.
</P>
<P>
People the US report cited as being involved in so-called
"religious persecution" cases were, in fact, criminals and
punishment of criminals has nothing to do with religious beliefs.

Ma Yuhong, a researcher with the Religions Research Center,
repudiated the wanton distortions the US report placed on China's
registration of religious venues.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that countries around the world have adopted the
common practice of requiring mass organizations to register with
the government.
</P>
<P>
For example, Japan has passed a law governing legal religious
representatives, and religious organizations in the US are
required to register with the government for tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
Religious organizations in China, just as any other mass
organization, are required to register with the Civil affairs
departments.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 religious organizations have registered with
the government, and some 80,000 religious venues have been granted
registration certificates over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Registered venues enjoy better legal protection in accordance
with China's laws and regulations. This in no way involves
"controlling religions", according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the US State Department accusation that the
Chinese government shuts down family churches is totally
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are no so-called "family churches" in
China. Chinese refer to Christian customs such as relatives,
friends and family members gathering in a private residence to
engage in prayer and the recitation of scriptures as a "family
get-together."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has never interfered with the
aforementioned family gatherings, which are instead highly
respected and not subject to registration. Therefore, the
aforementioned accusation is totally groundless.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the forum were members of the Beijing's
religious community and organizations, as well as scholars from
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing University,
Central University for Ethnic Minorities and the Religion
Research Center.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Poll Body Asked to Explain Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court today
required the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to explain its
earlier decision to dismiss a plea by a private group to verify
the signatures gathered for changing the constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution, the court gave the poll body a non-extendible
period of 10 days to explain why to reject the six million
signatures gathered by the People's Initiative for Reform,
Modernization and Action (PIRMA) for the purpose of amending the
charter.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA, created by Ramos' supporters in late 1996, has
sought to rewrite the country's 1987 constitution to lift term
limits of all elective government officials including President
Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The high tribunal made the decision after the PIRMA filed a
petition seeking an order from the court directing the Comelec to
act on the signatures. But the court did not require the poll body
to act on the signatures the PIRMA submitted to it in June.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec rejected the signatures last month on the ground
that the Supreme Court had already issued a ruling in March
banning any initiative for charter change because of the lack of
such enabling law in the country.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said it seemed that the Supreme Court
is changing its mind to give the PIRMA a chance since today's
ruling is conflicting its earlier ban which also requires the
PIRMA to stop collecting signatures.
</P>
<P>
According to Clerk of Court Luzviminda Puno, the high tribunal
has to wait for the comment of the Comelec before it can decide
whether to require the poll body to act on the signatures.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1987 constitution, the Philippine president can serve
only one single six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has vowed on many occasions that he will step down when
his term of office expires in June 1998. But he also insisted
that the people have the right to change the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Stands Firm on Punitive Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today stood firm on continuing the punitive
measures taken against the Palestinians following last week's
suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after his talks with
visiting Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, Netanyahu said the
measures were necessary to protect Israel's security as long as
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) refused to commit
itself to fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held talks here with Hassan and Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul-Salam Majali to discuss the heightened
Israeli-Palestinian crisis in the aftermath of the double
bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market last Wednesday,
which killed 15 people and wounded 170 others.
</P>
<P>
No apparent results were achieved in the talks, in which the
Jordanian side tried to persuade Netanyahu to ease the tough
measures taken against the PNA, including a total closure on the
territories, travel ban on Palestinians, expelling Palestinian
workers and halting transfer of tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
"We know that this campaign of terror must be stopped before
to have peace. If we have to say what is the indispensable step
to saving peace, peace between us and Palestinians, it is for
the Palestinian Authority to take firm, excessive, comprehensive
and immediate steps against the infrastructure of the terrorist
organizations," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The hardline Israeli leader pinpointed the Israeli concern
that the PNA's failure to fight terror would not only undermine
the ability to apprehend those behind the recent suicide
bombings, but also increase difficulty in preventing future
attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Preventing such attacks should be the interest of the
Palestinian Authority, as is ours, and certainly their solemn
obligation to fight terrorism. This is the heart and, indeed,
main principle of the Oslo accords," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated that the tough measures taken by Israel
were not directed at the Palestinian people, but aimed at
protecting Israel's security. He noted that Israel allowed the
transfer of food and medicines on humanitary grounds.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Prince Hassan said Jordan was committed to the
concept of "no peace without security, and no security without
peace." Warning the situation was on verge of dangerous crisis,
he expressed the hope that security cooperation between Israel
and the PNA would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
While expressing understanding about Israel's security
concerns, Hassan called on Israel to ease the tough measures
against the Palestinians in order to make a "human peace."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say very clearly that we are dealing here
with a human peace, a peace that affects life, promotes life and
promote human dignity, and in particular the parity of people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan hoped that the ongoing mediation efforts by Jordan,
Egypt, European Union (EU) and the United States could bring the
peace process back on track in the next few months. He stressed
that this was the right response to extremism and violence.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's visit was part of a flurry of intensive diplomatic
efforts aimed at easing the rising tension between Israel and
the Palestinian side and reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last week's terror attack, the U.S., EU, Egypt
and Jordan launched a diplomatic campaign to try to save the
ill-fated Israeli-Palestinian peace process from collapse.
</P>
<P>
But in a sign of difference, Hassan came here in stead of
King Hussein, who canceled his trip here for fear about the
lack of substantial results from his talks with Netanyahu, who
reportedly has been invited to visit Amman next week for further
consultations.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Jordanian and Israeli leaders also came
ahead of arrival here this weekend of U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross, who is expected to initiate a new round of mediation to
get the derailed Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on
track.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of HK, Macao and Taiwan Students for Mainland College Entrance Exams (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The total number of the students
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan applying for the entrance to
colleges and universities in China's inland areas this year
reached 1,286, hitting an all time high in history.
</P>
<P>
The work for the enrollment has been doing smoothly and will be
completed by the end of this month. The number of the enrollment
this year is expected to surpass that of the previous years.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by a leading official of a department under
the State Education Commission in an interview with Xinhua here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said the above-mentioned figure represents a 45 percent more
than last year. Of 1,286 students, 283 came from Hong Kong, 738
from Macao and 247 from Taiwan, registering an increase of 73, 32
and 52 percent compared with last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan students
applying for the entrance to the mainland's post-graduate schools
reached more than 670, up 22 percent from last year. Among them,
more than 330 students have already been enrolled.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the increasing number of students from
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan applying for the entrance to
mainland's colleges mainly to the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- Young people from these regions are eager to know more about
the motherland under the background of Hong Kong's return;
</P>
<P>
-- Over the past few years, frequent and close educational and
academic exchanges of China's inland areas with Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan have deepened mutual understanding and resulted in
changing the underestimation of the education standards in China's
inland areas;

<HEADLINE> Development of Cooperative Share-holding Firms in Cities Suggested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China will pay greater attention
to the development of cooperative share-holding enterprises in
cities.
</P>
<P>
A document, which was recently issued by the State Commission
for Restructuring Economic System under the State Council, noted
that the development of such enterprises in cities will suit the
needs of a socialist market economy and help promote the
development of productive forces.
</P>
<P>
The document with the title of "Guiding Comments on the
Development of Cooperative Share-holding Enterprises in Cities"
said that based on experience in the rural reform of the country,
many cities have established cooperative share-holding firms and
the establishment of such enterprises has reinvigorated a large
number of small companies.
</P>
<P>
The document terms the kind of enterprises a new form for
collectively-owned economic entities, which combines labor
cooperation with capital cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The system is in conformity with the present situation for
state-owned small companies and collectively-owned firms and it
meets the demands of the modern enterprise system with the
characters of having a clear property right, being clear in rights
and obligations for all parties involved, separation of government
functions from enterprises, and operating scientifically, the
document said.
</P>
<P>
In such a company, it said, the staff and workers work
together, jointly own and utilize the production means, share weal
and woe, and conduct democratic management and administration.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that shares held by staff members and the
collectives should account for the lion's share of the total
capital in these firms, and, meanwhile, part of the shares could
be held by the state and legal persons.
</P>
<P>
The setting-up of this kind of firms could play a positive role
in developing local economy, increasing financial income for local
governments, creating new employment opportunities and maintaining
social stability, the document stressed.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Boss Threatens to Expel Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Fifa president Joao
Havelange threatened on Wednesday that Brazil would be expelled
from the world soccer's governing body and from the World Cup if a
bill drawn up by Brazilian sports minister Pele becomes law.
</P>
<P>
Havelange said in an interview with the Jornal do Brasil daily
that there would be no alternative if the bill was approved.
</P>
<P>
"The Fifa committees will have a meeting and expel Brazil, who
will not be able to take part in the World Cup as a result, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pele's new bill, presented to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso on Tuesday, proposes incentives for clubs that become
publicly traded companies, making soccer club directors more
accountable and to turning all players into free agents within two
years.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes taking control of disciplinary tribunals and
refereeing away from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF)
and handing them to independent bodies.
</P>
<P>
"Fifa statutes say that referees have to be subordinated to the
(national) associations, just as do disciplinary tribunals,"
Havelange said.
</P>
<P>
"The CBF has been a member of Fifa for more than 80 years,
always respecting its statutes and rules. It's the same with all
the other affiliated associations. Anyone who does not agree can
leave. But they won't get a game.
</P>
<P>
"It's strange that the (sports) ministry should turn against an
institution that is being run in an efficient and modern way," he
was quoted as saying, referring to the CBF. "I'm respected in the
entire world and now I see the government of my country turning
against the entity (over) which I preside."

<HEADLINE> Minister: Iraq Expects Resumption of Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced today it will
resume its oil exports after the U.N.'s approval of its new oil
pricing list in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed made the announcement
at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said that Iraq sent an oil pricing list Tuesday to the
U.N. Sanctions Committee for approval, adding that Iraq expects the
approval in a few days.
</P>
<P>
After the approval, the Iraqi Oil Ministry can sign contracts
with world companies willing to import Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed expected the exportation of Iraqi oil to resume within
a week or 10 days via the Iraqi port of Al-Bakr and the Turkish
port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that Iraq's oil production capacity is
capable of meeting its exporting quota for the second six-month
period of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed the oil-for-food deal with the U.N. in May last
year. The deal went into effect in last December, allowing Iraq to
export 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The deal was renewed by the U.N. on June 8, allowing Iraq to
export another 2 billion dollars of oil.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed added that Iraq is ready to pump out its oil across the
Iraqi-Syrian pipeline as soon as it gets Syria's approval, and
that it will carry out the natural gas project agreed upon with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had stopped exporting its oil for the second stage of the
oil-for-food deal pending the U.N. chief's approval of Iraq's new
food distribution plan. The plan was endorsed by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Japanese-U.S. aviation
meeting closed today with no accord reached as the two sides
failed to narrow their differences over measures to liberalize
trans-Pacific flight services.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries remained wide apart over important issues,"
Hiromichi Toya, Japanese vice transport minister who headed the
Tokyo negotiating team, told a press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alan Larson said, "Although
we developed some bracketed text on certain issues, the two sides
are still far apart."
</P>
<P>
At the vice ministerial meeting, the U.S. renewed its demand
for an "open skies" pact with Japan for full liberalization of the
aviation market between the two countries, Kyodo news service said.
</P>
<P>
Japan rejected the U.S. request but presented its own phased-in
deregulation measures and asked Washington to rectify the 1952
civil aviation treaty which Japan sees as unfairly benefiting
U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
Under that treaty, three U.S. carriers -- Northeast Airlines,
United Airlines and Federal Express -- are allowed to expand
flights and add new routes, while only one Japanese carrier, Japan
Airlines, enjoys the same privileges in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The two sides will meet again in Washington on August 27-29.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen to Seek King Sihanouk's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said today that he and newly-elected First
Prime Minister Ung Huot hope to meet King Norodom Sihanouk soon
and get his support for the key government change.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly
earlier today to confirm Foreign Minister Ung Huot as the
country's first prime minister to replace Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, Hun Sen said he hoped the King would accept the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot, 50, said after his election that he hopes to meet
Sihanouk soon along with Hun Sen and the acting head of state,
Chea Sim.
</P>
<P>
Only 99 of parliament's 120 legislators took part in the vote,
with 86 votes for and four against Ung Huot, whose name was put
forward by Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the vote, which demonstrated Ung Huot's support
from FUNCINPEC, his own Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the
other two coalition parties, signaled the end of the country's
one-month political crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said he would cooperate with Ung Huot to prepare for a
free and fair election in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot, who will keep his current portfolio as foreign
minister, said he would work closely with Hun Sen's People's Party
to build Cambodia into a country enjoying political stability,
economic development and social security.

<HEADLINE> German Population Tops 82 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of people living in Germany
has topped 82 million for the first time in history, exclusively due
to immigrations, the German Federal Office of Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wiesbaden-based agency, German population rose
0.2 percent from the level of 1995 to reach 82.012 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As was the case in the past several years, the number of births in
Germany last year once again ran below the number of deaths with a
difference of 87,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of people immigrated to Germany dropped
from 800,000 in 1995 to 700,000 in 1996, 178,000 of them were ethnic
Germans from eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Last year also saw much less Germans move from the eastern part of
the country to the western half when compared with the figures
registered immediately after the German reunification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Separately, according to an expert of the German Federal
Institute for Population Research, Evelyn Gruenheid, the number of
Germans over 90 years old could reach nearly one million up to the
year 2040.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the average life expectancies are nearly 80 years for
the female newborns and 73 years for the male in Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A three-day southern African
conference on culture and development opened here today, with
over 50 delegates from the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) states to discuss relations between culture and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Vice-Chancellor of University of
Zimbabwe Graham Hill said the impact of Africa's colonial legacy
on culture and the drive towards economic and cultural
globalization made it imperative for the SADC states to assume a
common cultural stance.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa's drive towards economic development cannot be
achieved unless the countries, as stakeholders in the global
village, assume a common cultural stance, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that southern African countries should study their own
cultures rather than wait for outside motivation.
</P>
<P>
Africa could not attain its goals without putting the cultures
of its people, the beneficiaries of development, at center stage,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hill said, "when the cultures of the people at the grassroots
of African societies take the center stage of social
transformation, only then will it be possible to genuinely
improve the quality of lives of many people."

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea sat down for the
first time Tuesday with South Korea, the United States and China

The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The alleged mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing
went on trial Tuesday, with a prosecutor saying the defendant
wanted to topple the twin towers to "send a message to Americans
that they were at war." The bombing in February 1993 killed six
people, injured more than 1,000 and caused 500 million dollars damage.
</P>
<P>
-- A South Korean Boeing 747 jetliner crushed in rugged
jungle terrain as it was attempting to make an early-morning
landing on the South Pacific island of Guam, killing more than
200 people.

<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>

the currency.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhengzhou, August 6 (Xinhua) -- After a 132-day dry-up, the
lower reaches of the yellow river had water flow again this
morning, bringing hope to the weathering crops there.
</P>
<P>
Lijin Hydrographic Station at the end of the lower reaches of
the yellow river had water running through it at 7:18 this
morning. By 8:00 am, the rate of water flow reached 510 cubic
metres per second.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the water conservancy Commission of Yellow River
said that the dry spell in the middle and lower reaches of the
river was disrupted by torrential rains that hit the provinces of
Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan from July 28 to 31.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains resulted in flood peaks to Huayuankuo Hydrographic
Station at the mouth of the lower reaches of the yellow river on
August 4, with a flow rate of 4,020 cubic metres per second.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River which cuts through seven provinces in
northwest China has suffered frequent dry-ups since 1990 due to
reduced rainfalls and rapid growth in the use of water for
industrial and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
This year's dry-up started in February, earlier than usual and
its dry-up length is the longest in history.

Addressing a distance education librarianship seminar at the
Sesa Training Center, Chombo said the charter will pave the way
for the establishment of a open learning distance education
center.
</P>
<P>
The success of distance education programs in any country
depended on librarians, Chombo added.
</P>
<P>
"In the next three months, we are going to start eight-degree
programs for distance education at the newly established open
learning distance center," said Chombo.
</P>
<P>
He said, "there is need for versatile librarians in Zimbabwe
whose work will determine the success of these proposed distance
education programs."
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar, attended by some 25 librarians from
Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe, was
organized by the Zimbabwe Library Association and the
Commonwealth Library Association
</P>
<P>
Chombo said that seminars used to formulate new strategies
would get Commonwealth governments to speed up and sensitize
education administrators about the importance of providing
regulatory and infrastructural framework appropriate for building
up platforms for libraries for distance education.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "Education is a basic right to all human
beings, but not all people get the privilege to pursue formal
classroom education either for the basic education or
professional enhancement."
</P>
<P>
"Libraries and librarians are pivotal to formal education and
are even the backbone for distance education as they match and
bridge documented information and the consumers," he said.

<HEADLINE> Star-Studded Field Expected for Hong Kong Squash Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to host one of
this year's most important squash tournaments later this month,
organizers announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific Squash Open '97 is slated for August 24-31 in
the Hong Kong Squash Center and the Hong Kong Park Indoor Games
Hall, with a record entry of 23 players out of the world's top 23.
</P>
<P>
World champion and seven-time winner of the Hong Kong Open
Jansher Khan from Pakistan will return to gain revenge over
defending champion world number three Rodney Eyles of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Rodney upset the form book with a convincing straight-games win
over Jansher in last year's Hong Kong Open.
</P>
<P>
Up-and-coming star and local favorite, Scotland's Peter Nicol,
has improved greatly with his world ranking rising to number
two. He beat Jansher 3-1 in the final of the Al-Ahram
International in Egypt in June.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Shum, a former ace player of Hong Kong, will return to
this year's Open after being absent from the tournament for at
least two years. Having aimed at next year's Asian Games in
Bangkok, he is keen to represent the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), Shum is favored to pass the
qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Faheem Khan, ranked 45th in the world, has obtained
 a wild card to spearhead the HKSAR side in the challenge in the
main draw. But he will first play in the World Games and
Singapore Open before coming back for the Hong Kong event.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in South Chinese Region Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region had 454 million US dollars worth of overseas
investment during the first half of this year, a 7.2 percent rise
over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase is a result of six regulations for increasing the
use of overseas investment in the region. The policies are
expected to improve the local investment environment by ensuring
on-time repayment of overseas loans and putting an end to illegal
charges for local overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1996 period, the overseas funds in the region
amounted to nearly 4.4 billion US dollars worth, accounting for 20
percent of the local investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The region will place emphasis of the use of overseas funds in
developing local resources, transforming state enterprises, and in
infrastructure construction, mostly in the field of transportation
and energy.

<HEADLINE> Pacifists Protest Nukes at NATO Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 pacifists today
protested against the nuclear programs of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) in front of its headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
The protesters came from the Netherlands, Finland, Ukraine,
Russia, Britain, the United States, Germany as well as Belgium.
They demonstrated slogans of "Remember Hiroshima" and "Nuclear
Weapons Illegal".
</P>
<P>
One protester appealed, through a hand-held loudspeaker, to
passers-by and passing motorists that the anti-nuclear voice
should be heard.
</P>
<P>
One Dutch demonstrator, Freed Schmitter, said that these
individual pacifists gathered here for a one-day protest,
demanding NATO to abandon its nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
"The International Court last year ruled that nuclear weapons
are illegal and NATO should abide by the ruling and give up its
nuclear weaponry prior to the year 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Willemyn van der Werf, also from the Netherlands, said that
there is an anti-nukes society in her country and the organization
now boasts of more than 6,000 members from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
She said that most of the protesters arrived here earlier this
month and will leave for more protests to be held at NATO military
bases and depots.
</P>
<P>
Local police deployed seven anti-riot vans and many police cars
near the alliance headquarters.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Secretary Meets With Sinn Fein Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam began her first face-to-face meeting today
with Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein,
to discuss peace process in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in Belfast less than three weeks after
Irish Republican Army, a guerrilla group aiming to end the British
rule of Northern Ireland, called a ceasefire on July 20.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam is expected to tell Adams that Sinn Fein will be allowed
to take part in multi-party peace talks in September for the first
time if the British government judges that the IRA ceasefire is
deemed genuine and credible.
</P>
<P>
There have been no IRA bomb or gun attacks since the guerrillas
called the truce last month in a bid to get Sinn Fein to the
negotiating table for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam is also expected to tell Adams that Northern Ireland
will remain part of Britain so long as the majority, which is
currently 60 percent pro-British Protestant, wants it to be and
that nothing will alter that, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Adams told reporters before the talks began that he has been
trying to join the all-party peace talks since 1993 and Sinn Fein
should have been in talks with the British government "a long time
ago".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was barred from the talks by Britain and Ireland,
co-sponsors of the negotiations, and cast into the political
wilderness until the July 20 IRA truce to its 28-year war which
has cost lives of about 3,200 people.
</P>
<P>
Adams' meeting with Mowlam will mark a step towards ending his
vilification by successive British governments who banned his
voice from the airwaves and barred him from Britain until the
first IRA truce in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Wins Again in Under-23 Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Puerto Rico, stunned by
under-rated New Zealand in the first half, fought back to maintain
its unbeaten run with an 11 point victory in the men's Under-23
World Basketball Championship in Melbourne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand led 39-35 at halftime before the Puerto Ricans
turned on a powerful finish late in the final term for a 70-59
win.
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico strengthened its grip on the gold medal as it
finished the preliminary rounds as the only unbeaten side.
</P>
<P>
But New Zealand gave the favorite a fright, setting the pace
for all but the last 10 minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
New Zealander guard Mark Dickel contributed 10 points and six
assists in a fine first half display and was supported by center
Tony Rampton, who finished the match with 11 points. Forward
Robert Tuilave hit a game-high 13 points and also chipped in with
five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
But Puerto Rico drew away gradually with 10 minutes remaining
and wore down the New Zealanders with a better shot percentage.
</P>
<P>
Center Daniel Santiago finished with 12 points while
fleet-footed guard Eddie Santiago scored 11.
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rican coach Carlos Morales said that he had watched New
Zealand play against Yugoslavia and the United States and did not
underestimate them.
</P>
<P>
"They play very hard and they don't back off from anybody,"
Morales said.
</P>
<P>
In the other match of the first session, Yugoslavia crushed
China 104-51 at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
Yogoslavia was off to a quick start with guard Dragan Lukovski
running up 17 points for the half, backed up by Vlado Scepanovic
13 and Aleksandar Cubrilo 11.
</P>
<P>
Turkey defeated Korea 84-63 and Argentina beat Egypt
97-58.

HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A major international congress
on marine science and technology opened at the Chinese University
of Hong Kong here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day '97 Pacific Congress on Marine Science and
Technology (PACON '97) is a major annual event of PACON
International, a non-governmental forum of concerned marine
scientists, engineers, industrial organizations and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 marine scientists, engineers, technologists, policy
makers, economists and resource managers from the Pacific Rim
countries are attending the congress to discuss resource
development, environment issues and the sustainable development of
coastal waters and provide solutions for ocean management.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the congress said the ocean is abundant in
resources but far from well exploited. It may provide solutions
to an increasing population, shortage of resources and deterioration
of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of the ocean economy to total output value of
the world economy increased from two percent in 1970 to five
percent in 1990. It is expected to rise to about 10 percent at the

KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank allocated three
billions Ugandan Shillings (about three millions U.S. Dollars) to
fight water hyacinths in Lake Victoria over a five-year period,
"The New Vision" reported today.

The money is part of Lake Victoria management program.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for eradicating the weed is yet to be decided
on the control options to be selected by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The fighting against the weed will be a continuous process due
to the nature of the fast reproducing weed.

Scientists estimated that 6,000 hectares of the lake and 80
percent of the shore area of the lake are covered by the weed.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Bus Blaze Prompts Official Vigilance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's bus companies have
been asked to improve maintenance and prepare for spot-checks
after a fourth major vehicle fire in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
A Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) vehicle caught fire while on road
Sunday. The fire was put out soon by firefighters. There was no
casualty as in the previous three similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Transport Department announced tougher tactics
Tuesday including spot-checks of 10 buses a day without prior
notice.
</P>
<P>
Current maintenance adopted by the three major local bus
companies consists only of a visual check.
</P>
<P>
A KMB spokesman said the company's routine inspection is
carried out by the vehicle's captain. If he finds anything
unusual, he reports it to the service engineer.
</P>
<P>
Citybus adopts a similar maintenance system. When a bus
returns to the depot, the mechanics do a visual inspection. The
China Motor Bus services its vehicles on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
But Polytechnic University associate lecturer in mechanical
engineering Lo Kok-keung said that visual checks were insufficient
and probably responsible for the recent fires. Equipment must be
used in the checks, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Lo described the fires "abnormal" as a diesel engine is really
safe and difficult to catch fire.
</P>
<P>
KMB expects to have re-checked 190 of its Denis 12-meter buses
and 90 MCW 11-meter vehicles by this weekend. Both models caught
fire recently because of dirty engines.
</P>
<P>
A fire in the engine of a Denis 11-meter model Sunday was found
to be caused by a loose bolt on the engine's fuel injection pump
which allowed diesel fuel to leak.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Urges Private Involvement in Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The G-15 Business and Investment
Forum (BIF) meeting concluded in Harare with a call for the
private sector in member countries to be active in the
development of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The delegates underscored the need for the private sector to
take the initiative and become more involved in the activities of
the BIF, at the forum which ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said the private sector must identify potential
investment projects and implement BIF projects to complement the
efforts of governments.
</P>
<P>
G-15, founded in September 1989, is composed of 15 members
from the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America,
aiming at strengthening south-south cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Future BIF meetings, the delegates said, should focus more on
generating concrete business transactions and urged leaders of
chambers of commerce and industry to attend the investment
forums.
</P>
<P>
BIF Chairman Nick Ncube said, "the business sectors need to
affirm their commitment to the BIF and actively participate in
exhibitions, trade fairs and workshops. The private sector
should frequently organize and fund business meetings and appoint
secretariats to facilitate follow-ups."
</P>
<P>
Ncube said, "these participants should make available relevant
information on business interests, costs of labour, product
profiles, pricing and tariff regimes before and during BIF
meetings."
</P>
<P>
Summerizing the meeting, Ncube, who is director of the
Zimbabwe Investment Center, said member countries should set up
national focal points to ensure that the BIF operates
independently but in line with the objectives of the G-15.
</P>
<P>
He said financial packages must be created to increase
economic cooperation and trade among G-15 member states.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this member states may need to investigate the
viability of setting up a G-15 international bank to facilitate
these initiatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the removal of trade barriers and
restrictions or delays hampering the movement of labour and
capital in G-15 countries remained a top priority.
</P>
<P>
The delegates resolved that the outcome of the Harare BIF be
presented to heads of state and government at the forthcoming
G-15 summit in Malaysia and facilitate the implementation of
their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum was attended by nine countries -- Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Senegal and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The BIF is a vehicle through which G-15 member countries can
exploit varied trade and investment opportunities brought about
by the globalization of the economy.

Paduka Zaleha Ismail told a news conference that by June 1997,
Malaysia's population reached 21.66 million with about one third
below 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that 56.3 per cent of the population now live

The fertility rate went down from 3.9 to 3.3 during the same
period.

XINING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai province, northwest China,
has drawn a total overseas investment of 240 million US dollars,
and approved the establishment of 143 foreign-funded enterprises
since early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Business people from overseas have so far invested in more than
20 fields, including engineering industry, communications, tourism

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Down to 17.5 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria recorded an inflation rate
of 17.5 percent in June this year, down from the 19.2 percent for
the previous month, according to the Federal Office of Statistics
(FOS).
</P>
<P>
FOS, the government body for collecting, analyzing and
publishing statistical data, also projected the rates for July
and August at 15.5 and 13.8 percent, respectively, if all things
work according to plan, said a report on local daily, "This Day",
today.
</P>
<P>
The trend indicated that the Nigerian government is likely to
achieve its goal of reducing inflation to 15 percent by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate measures the rate of general increase in prices
of goods and services and consequent fall in the purchasing value
of money.
</P>
<P>
The rate has been on the decline in the country since last
year as a result of the tight monetary policy of the government,
from 72.8 percent at the end of 1995 to 28 percent at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The persistent decline in the inflation level and the
brilliant performance of other macroeconomic indicators are a
good testimony to the fact that the economy is on course despite
insinuations to the contrary from some quarters, a government
official was quoted as saying by the paper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government stock of external reserves shot up
to seven billion U.S. dollars by the end of May from 5.9 billion
in April.
</P>
<P>
"What this means is that government can now finance several
months of export, far more than the four months envisaged in the
1997 budget," a top Finance Ministry official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The local currency, Naira, has also appreciated against other
currencies, with one U.S. Dollar selling for 83 Naira last week
as against 85 Naira about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
However, experts noted that despite the declining inflation
rate, all is still not well with the economy. And the cost to
achieve that and increasing foreign reserve remains a question to
many observers.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Manufacturing Association of Nigeria (MAN)
raised an alarm on the state of the economy, asking the federal
government to halt the deteriorating state of infrastructure in
the country and save the industries from total collapse.
</P>
<P>
In a memo sent to the head of state, MAN observed that the
poor state of infrastructure has made it difficult for
manufacturing industries to operate especially since they have
had to bear rising cost of production which would not be passed
on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most of the warehouses in the country are now
full of unsold stock.
</P>
<P>
"What this means is that inflation is coming down not
necessarily because the economy is performing well, but because
consumers are not buying," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
Experts thus cautioned that bringing inflation down should be
one of the several economic goals of the government.
</P>
<P>
The federal government should also pay attention to the rising
unemployment and population as well as declining consumer
purchasing power and agricultural production, among others, they
said.

<HEADLINE> 221 People Killed in South Korean Jet Crash on Guam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 221 people were killed in
a pre-dawn crash in Guam of the South Korean Air (KAL) with 231
passengers and 23 crew members on board.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Boeing 747-300B plane crashed in the forest 4.8
kilometers south of the Agana International Airport, Guam, at
01:55 a.m. local time (15:55 GMT) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Foreign Ministry said that only 30 of the 254
on board had survived, while the KAL announced that the number of
survivors were 33, the Yonhap News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane left Seoul at 8:20 p.m. (11:20 GMT) Tuesday and
crashed into a hill after cutting off communication with the
airport's control tower minutes before touching down on Guam.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 217 South Korean passengers were on vacation,
including newly-wed couples off to the Pacific resort island for
their honeymoon. Other passengers include 13 Americans and one
Japanese girl who was luckly enough to survive.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy, Air Force and coast guard troops launched rescue
operations immediately after the mishap with helicopters in the
thickly-wooded rain forest.
</P>
<P>
The injured passengers were evacuated to the U.S. Naval
Hospital and Memorial Hospital on the island for treatment. The
number of survivors were worried to decline as several of them
were listed in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
South Korean government officials said that they would look
into all possible causes of the crash, including fuselage defects,
weather condition, guidance system and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A KAl official said that he had received a report that the Guam
Airport's automatic landing guidance system was malfunctioning,
adding that the exact cause of the crash would be found after
examining the recovered black box.
</P>
<P>
The plane was also suspected to have mechanical failure causing
the fatal crash.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Oil Production Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's daily crude oil
production hit 2.34 million barrels by the end of June this year,
the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said this is 6.4 percent up from the 2.2 million
barrels a day in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)
sources as saying that the increased production mainly came from
two local companies and the two joint ventures NNPC has with
Mobil and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
Mobil's production went up from last year's 450,000 barrels a
day to 530,000 barrels a day, while the production of Chevron
increased from 400,000 to 420,000 barrels a day in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The NNPC sources, however, argued that the country's output is
still in line with its 1.865-million-barrels-a-day quota from the
Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
"The 2.34 million barrels a day level represents the country's
capability and not what its pushing out," a top official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the application of new technologies
by oil firms has led to more oil finds in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
While Nigeria wants to increase its oil production to three
million barrels a day by the year 2000, Chevron and Mobil have
reportedly taken the targets of 600,000 and 900,000 barrels a
day, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts, however, feared that government budget
cut for the oil sector earlier this year is already having an
adverse effects on the target.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Chinese Province Auctions Off State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Leshan Pharmaceutical
Factory, a state enterprise, was auctioned off on July 30 in
Leshan City of Sichuan Province, southwest China, the first time
in that part of the country for a bankrupt state firm to be put on
the auction block.
</P>
<P>
The 50,000-sq.m. facility sold for 24.2 million yuan, which was
just above the minimum bid price. It employed 900 people used to
be a major medicine producer in Sichuan, capable of producing more
than 150 pharmaceutical products. It went bankrupt because of a
long history of poor management, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Present at the auction were State Economic and Trade Commission
officials, Ministry of Finance and State Bureau of Land
Administration officials, and interested buyers from Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing municipalities, and other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Minggui, chief executive of the Auction Center,
auctioning off state assets is a novelty in China, especially in
western areas. Bankrupt state companies often used to be sold at a
low price to other large state enterprises, with the participation
of the local government.
</P>
<P>
These deals created many problems, however, that were difficult
to solve. Assets of bankrupt enterprises were hard to sell, and
finding jobs for employees and paying off old company debts were
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Luo Xiling, a workers' representative told the reporter that
his fellow workers are all in favor of the auction, and they think
it could bring some vigor to the failed production and help many
laid-off workers go back to work.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoquan, chairman of the purchaser, a local investment
firm, welcomed the company's former employees, saying he'd like
them to stay on. He also told Xinhua that the company plans to
work with Qinghua University and Beijing University to rebuild the
factory into a production base for herbal medicines.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker today in Sydney, but off its intraday lows, following
selling by Japanese accounts.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the selling followed a rout of the U.S. dollar/yen
rate, which fell in afternoon dealings on the back of some
concerns of a possible trade row between the U.S. and Japan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the local unit was being weighed by a slip in
gold and commodity prices overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 73.65 U.S. cents, off an
afternoon low of 73.50 and compared to 73.96 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If tomorrow's job data are weak, "the market may start to
factor another cut in toward the last quarter of this year. The
data is quite important," a trader said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 87.79 Japanese yen, compared to
87.62, and at 1.3854 German marks from 1.3772, previously.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Chief Resigns for Presidential Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced here today he had accepted the resignation of Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa who has decided to run for the
presidency in the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Ramos said he asked de Villa to
stay until 15 September in order to ensure an orderly transition
and search for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
De Villa, who took office in June 1992, will also quit his
other duties such as chairman of the National Disaster
Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
Ramos did not mention the reason for the departure of de Villa,
who submitted his letter of resignation on July 20. Neither did de
Villa say why he quit in his resignation letter which was made
public by Ramos today.
</P>
<P>
But it is widely believed that de Villa quit because of
mounting pressure from the opposition camp and in order to prepare
for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Proclaimed presidential aspirants from the opposition camp
accused de Villa of taking advantage of his present position to
promote his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
De Villa earlier publicly proclaimed his bid to run for the
presidency in the May 1998 polls and joined the ruling Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats) party in late June to
compete for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party led by Ramos is expected to hold a national
convention to choose its presidential bet in November.
</P>
<P>
With the resignation of de Villa, the struggle among the ruling
party for the anointment of Ramos as the party's standard bearer
in next year's presidential polls will get more bitter, political
observers said.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders for Ramos' backing include his economic
adviser Emilio Osmena, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo and his
younger sister Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani. De Ocampo, who is
not a Lakas member, said he will join the party soon.
</P>
<P>
Opposition presidential contenders include Vice President
Joseph Estrada and Senate President Maceda. Estrada had already
resigned from his only cabinet post, chairman of the Presidential
Anti-Crime Commission.

The targets of the health sector cannot be achieved without the
overall development of safe drinking water, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is determined to enforce and follow up
such programs.
</P>
<P>
The minister also promised that the capacity of district
hospitals will be increased during the Ninth Five Year Plan

<HEADLINE> China's State Enterprise Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has made some progress in its reform and opening-up
efforts, since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) in October 1992. For this fall's 15th National
Congress, Xinhua is providing an outline of the third generation
of leaders of the CPC Central Committee, headed by Jiang Zemin,
and how it has followed Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is the third part of
the series.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China has done some experiments
in reforming its state-owned enterprises since the 14th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1992 developed the
strategy for establishing a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, particularly the past five, a way has
been found for some sluggish state enterprises to restructure
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Company Law of 1993 pointed the way for organizing
companies from state-owned enterprises, a novel reform method.
</P>
<P>
After that, state enterprises were restructured by establishing
a modern enterprise system to meet the needs of a socialist market
economy, by clarifying property rights and responsibilities, and
by separating the functions of the government from those of
enterprises, and with more scientific management.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the state started the project in 100 large and
medium-sized enterprises, and later, more than 2,000 state
enterprises experimented with the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
By now, most enterprises have been re-organized into companies
and nearly half have issued shares. More than half of the general
managers of the newly re-organized companies are appointed by
board of directors.

<HEADLINE> China's State Enterprise Reforms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the experimental period, state assets tended to grow and
the companies had better returns.
</P>
<P>
The reforms also provided valuable experience and laid a solid
foundation for the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Priority is given to a mechanism in which the most competitive
companies survive, so outmoded industrial methods have to be
improved and enterprises with heavy losses are allowed to declare
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the central government selected 18 cities to support
the reform measures and improving enterprises' use of
capital. This is meant to change operations, provide new funds,
relieve them of their debt and social burdens, find jobs for
redundant employees, establish a social security system, and help
them become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
So far, 111 cities, almost all of them major industrial cities,
have adopted the pilot measures. The state set aside 20 billion
yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) in bank funds last year, and will
set aside 30 billion yuan this year, for mergers and bankruptcies.

<P>
The central government has decided that this year there will be
120 experimental enterprise groups with certain decision-making
powers.
</P>
<P>
Some of better qualified ones can take the lead in setting up
finance companies and raising funds abroad, and in stocks and bond
issues.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local governments have made some of the more
than 240,000 small state-owned businesses enter the market by
restructuring, combining, leasing, or selling them.
</P>
<P>
In the process of reforming state enterprises, the State
Council has been urging those in charge to adopt better management
methods as required by the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The Handan Iron and Steel Company in north China's Hebei
Province has set a good example for others in this with its good
management.
</P>
<P>
In using the company's experience in 1994, state enterprises in
the metallurgy sector had better profits than other sectors in
spite of a market slump and financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The central government is determined to do a thorough study
this year on the leadership of state enterprises, and those that
don't meet the reform and economic development needs will be
reorganized.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that state-owned enterprises will be able to
have some success and be revitalized in the end.

LUANDA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos said here Tuesday that the current visit of Presidnet
Laurent Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo indicates the two
countries wish to open up a new era in their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Santos said the friendly, united, good-neighborly and mutually
supportive relations between the two countries are not based on
expedient interests.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should join hands in their effort to get rid
of starvation, poverty, diseases, threats to political stability,

president said.
</P>
<P>
Santos said that the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola
should face up to the challenges of the 21st century together.
</P>
<P>
Most of the difficulties African countries are facing, he
said, are not easy to overcome, but his country is encouraged to
create every condition to revitalize its economy.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said in a brief speech at a banquet given in his honor
that he was very grateful to all the help Angola has offered to
his country in its "struggle for liberation", and his country
will never forget the political, diplomatic and material support
Angolan people have given to Congo, which helped bring their
victory.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived in Angola Tuesday for an official visit at the
invitation of his Angolan counterpart President Santos. This is

<P>
XI'AN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, home of terra-cotta
warriors, vows to build four major industries to help with local
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This capital city of northwest China's Shaanxi province has
designated electronics and information, transportation, electric
equipment and tourism as four economic pillars for the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
All four areas have a solid foundation for future development.
</P>
<P>
New electronic products are the focus of local developers.
</P>
<P>
The local Datang Telecom Corp. is now one of China's major
digital switchboard producers with a capacity of two million lines.
</P>
<P>
Also, companies in the city have formed a computer production
capacity of 60,000 units a year.
</P>
<P>
Other products on the development list are microwave and
satellite equipment, as well as Chinese-based software products.
</P>
<P>
In the field of transport, the city plans to focus on the
manufacture of aircraft, train wagons, and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Yun-7 plane, developed by Xi'an Aircraft Manufacture
Corporation, is now China's backbone local-made model flying on
domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Rail Vehicle Factory holds a major share of the local
rail vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
Xifei-Volvo deluxe buses produced by a Sino-Volvo joint venture
can rival with foreign models in the marketplace. Other auto
products, including cars, heavy-duty trucks and mining vehicles
made by local makers were also recognized by the users.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is now also one of China's major electric equipment
producers. Xidian Corp., the largest among all local companies,
last year earned 55.94 million US dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
As a famous cultural and historic site in China, the city
accomodated some 480,000 overseas visitors and 9.6 million
domestic travelers last year.

<HEADLINE> Economist on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Chinese economist
says that a socialist market economy's goal is to combine social
equality with market efficiency, and the state-owned enterprise
reforms must work toward this goal.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fureng, vice-chairman of the Financial Committee of the
National People's Congress, in an article carried in Beijing's
Economic Reference Daily, said that China has replaced its planned
economy with the socialist market economy because it is more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the market economy has its weakpoints or
shortcomings, he said, one of which is its unfair distribution
owing to market competition leading to shifts in wealth and unfair
distribution of it.
</P>
<P>
Socialism's fundamental demand is social fairness. Therefore,
the goal of China's current economic reforms conforms to the
country's socio-economic goals.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the state-owned enterprises should do what the
non-state firms can't do by providing the government with the
means to interfere in and regulate the market. A certain number of
state-owned or state-controled commercial banks, non-bank
financial institutions and warehousing enterprises are necessary.
</P>
<P>
The state has to invest in non-profitable public facilities,
infrastructure, and hi-tech industries that the non-public sector
is unwilling or unable to get involved in because of the
difficulty in making a profit and the risks.
</P>
<P>
The State-owned enterprises should be set up where a state
monopoly is needed, like the weaponry industry or currency
printing sector. If state enterprises are maintained in these
sectors, state-owned assets of other industries that do not need
to be maintained could be transferred for development purposes.
</P>
<P>
Assets of state firms could be transferred to the non-state
sector and profits from their sale could be used to pay off bank
debts to relieve banks of the burden or for resettlement of the
surplus labor force, and bankruptcies of certain companies could
prevent further losses. Funds from the transfer could be used for
pensions or finding jobs for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer, the number of state-owned firms needed
would be substantially reduced and the state exchequer and banks
could also use the funds to help the remaining state companies in
technological improvements or development.

its river-bed higher than the ground in many parts, have fortified
its dams and dikes to be prepared for the coming flood season.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the Yellow River Anti-flood Office,
the river has passed through 50 years without any major outbreak,
but the danger is still there as the river-bed is growing up year
by year due to soil-erosion in the upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Yellow River Anti-Flood Headquarters, based in
Zhengzhou, capital city of central China's Henan province,
sponsored a meeting with officials from four provinces in the
middle and lower reaches of the river to mobilize local people to
prepare for potential floods.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 223 sites that were damaged by last year's floods
have been repaired, while another 101 anti-flood projects have
also been completed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government has invested to improve the
telecommunication condition for local anti-flood departments and a
responsibility system has been set up for local leading officials
to organize anti-flood efforts.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that floods have already occured in the
river.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has set itself the goal
of producing electrical-generating equipment with a total capacity
of 4.8 million kw this year, and 5.4 million kw by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
As the center of China's manufacturing industry, Shanghai has
provided more than 40 million kw of thermal power equipment since
1955, when the first home-made generating unit was built. The
equipment's installed capacity is equal to a fourth of the
country's total, making Shanghai one of the country's major
generating unit production bases.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Shanghai has had plans to make generating equipment
a leading industrial sector. The city produced generating
equipment with a total capacity of more than 4.5 million kw last
year, more than double the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
The city will improve new product development and the
industry's products mix by increasing the use of technology. It
will also increase the use of overseas investment and place
emphasis on producing high-capacity, high-parameter,
high-efficiency thermal power facilities.

<HEADLINE> Tea Production Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production fell by
around 28 percent in the first six months of 1997 compared with
the same period last year due to bad weather, the East African
Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tea yield totaled 96.73 million kilograms in Kenya between
January and June, a decrease of 37.6 million kilograms or 27.99
percent compared with the same period in 1996, said a statement
from the leading brokerage company Africa Tea Brokers Ltd. (ATB).
</P>
<P>
The crop figure for June 1997 was 16.264 million kilograms, a
fall of 1.634 million kilograms or 9.13 percent over the same
month last year, according to the statement issued on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most tea-growing areas in the country remained cold and wet
last month, resulting in the inhibition of tea growth and the
reduction of plucking rounds, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, with slightly warmer temperatures, leaf intake
will show a gradual improvement" in most tea-yielding areas, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya was the world's leading exporter of black tea last year
with a record production of 257 million kilograms. Tea is second
behind tourism as the main hard currency earner of the eastern
African country.

<HEADLINE> Most Schools in S. Africa in Poor Conditions: </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Education
Minister Sibusiso Bengu has confirmed that most schools in the
country are either in bad conditions, or in need of facilities.
</P>
<P>
Bengu on Tuesday quoted a recent comprehensive register of
education institutions as saying that nearly a quarter of the
country's schools had no water within walking distance, less than
half of the schools had electricity, and many schools experienced
a shortage of toilets.
</P>
<P>
According to the register, school buildings in many provinces
are in bad conditions. The most serious problems were in Northern
Province, where 41 percent of school buildings are in a weak or
very weak state.
</P>
<P>
Facilities such as laboratories and workshops at secondary
schools are virtually non-existent. Most schools in the former
"Black Homeland" are the worst off.
</P>
<P>
"These shocking findings are an indictment of all who by
commission or ommission allowed this injustice to occur in this
country.
</P>
<P>
"It is the worst form of human degradation to condemn children
to an educational enviroment without toilets, libraries,
laboratories, water, classrooms," Bangu said, stressing this had
to be changed.

NANNING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jianyun, a farmer in the
southern part of China, has joined some 20,000 other
holiday-makers flocking to the beaches of Beihai City these days.
</P>
<P>
"A dozen friends and I plan to stay in Beihai for a week, and
we'll spend most of the time swimming in the sea," the 21-year-old
woman from Yulin in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said.
</P>
<P>
Because she and her family earn about 40,000 yuan (4,800 US
dollars) yearly from farming and growing litchis, she can well
afford the trip, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Beihai Yintan (Silver Beach) Holiday Resort on the Beibu
Gulf has become a popular spot for holiday-makers. Every day, as
many as 30,000 people can be seen lying under colorful parasols or
swimming in the blue waters of the 12 beaches.
</P>
<P>
"The beaches, unusual forests, and fresh air are what drew us
to Beihai," Miss Chen said. These are also what has changed Beihai
from a small backwater town to a national holiday resort, one that
has had 10 million tourists since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The tourism boom has brought with it luxury hotels, spas,
parks, swimming pools, and bowling alleys.

<HEADLINE> China to Use High-Tech in Dunhuang Grotto Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China is to introduce laser
technology, infrared photography and some other high-tech methods
in the protection of the Dunhuang Grottoes.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with scientific research institutions both at
home and abroad, the Dunhuang Research Institute will launch
projects in sand-proof, computer inputing of frescoes in Dunhuang
caves dating from 366 A.D., resuming the original colors of the
frescoes and biological protection research.
</P>
<P>
Li Shi, deputy director of an institute attached to the
Dunhuang Research Institute, said some of the projects are being
prepared.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 3,000 meters of a sand-proof shield was
built atop the Dunhuang Grottoes which reduced over 70 percent of
the sandfalls in front of the Dunhuang caves.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, as shifting sand on the top of the caves has
became a new problem, Chinese and US researchers are to improve
the sand-proof system for the grottoes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists also decided to use infrared photographic
techniques to resume the original looks of the mural, as the
original color on many parts of the mural has faded and the mural
became darkened.
</P>
<P>
Li said as biological molds have seriously eroded the mural,
his institute is to seek a biological protection method for saving
the mural.
</P>
<P>
He added that for permanent protection of the Dunhuang mural,
several research institutions have combined efforts to input the
Dunhuang frescoes into computers.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged Avoiding Dependency on Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has urged Kenyans not to panic over the suspension of aid to
Kenya by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and work hard to
avoid dependency on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Considering the difficult economic situation affecting the
world in general, Kenyans should not expect much in terms of
external assistance, he said in Nyeri District, southern Kenya,
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also called for proper management of Kenya's resources for
sustainable economic development, urging all Kenyans to be united
and work together for self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he played down the effect of the IMF aid cut,
saying the suspended 215-million-U.S.-Dollar loan is "very small
compared with the government's annual expenditure of 161 billion
Shillings (2.93 billion Dollars) as recorded last year."
</P>
<P>
The deficit would be compensated by revenue generated from
agriculture and other sectors and the whole economy would not be
threatened, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced Thursday it held back a three-year Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) because of the alleged
failure of the Kenyan government "to show its commitment to
fighting corruption," and this aroused strong reactions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors pulled out of the Nairobi Stock Exchange in
droves on Friday by selling 250 million Shillings (4.1 million
Dollars) of the fourth issue of the Central Bank of Kenya
floating-rate treasury bond.
</P>
<P>
They only sold 13.35 million Shillings (243,000 Dollars)
during the whole of the previous week, traders said.

WASHINGTON -- A South Korean Air jet with 254 on board crashed

nearly 500 million U.S. dollars that it collects each year from
Palestinians who work or buy goods in Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Developing economies should make
full use of domestic resources to achieve growth and development,
South African Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 600 delegates to the 54th Zimbabwean
Commerce Farmers' (CFU) congress, Erwin said the natural wealth
in the Southern African region was its greatest asset which, if
exploited in a sustainable manner, would lead to the development
of the region's economies.
</P>
<P>
He urged countries in the region to trade among themselves and
not to favor trade with industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, CFU President Nick Swanepoel
told delegates that increasing financial returns from agriculture
were necessary for Zimbabwe's national growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
These returns were essential if farmers were to maintain
services, downstream business activities and employment growth,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to reconsider its position and
priorities with respect to the allocation of funds to
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Zimbabwe's competitiveness as an agricultural
exporter had declined more than any of the 12 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member countries due to the decline
of domestic support for the sector by the government and
increased levels of direct taxation.

<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Finance
(MOF) reported initial success in its effort to rectify the
working order in the accountancy industry starting from last April.
</P>
<P>
The MOF has spot-checked nearly 840,000 units during the past
three months, imposed fines on more than 70,000 of them found of
deception in accountancy, disqualified more than 200 accountants,
and brought 46 of them to justice.
</P>
<P>
A MOF official in charge of the nationwide examination said
that chaos still existed in accountancy of many units, and
prominent irregularities included opening false accounts,
fabricating information and having disorderly accounts.
</P>
<P>
More than 16 percent of the examined units were caught to have
opened false accounts involving more than 14 billion yuan, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to other problems including a drain on state assets as
a result of the abuse of power by some enterprise managers, the
official called for redoubled efforts to rectify the working order
of accountancy and tighten supervision over the accountants.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Movement Attacks Government's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's organization Peace
Now charged the government with being intent on destroying the
peace process by planning more settlements, The Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmaker Ran Cohen, a Peace Now member, was quoted
as saying that the government is planning to build 42,000 new
housing units in different stages in settlements in the Binyamin
region in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the government is secretly carrying out plans for
mass building in the settlements without the public's
knowledge. He added that the Peace Now's statistics are based on
information gathered from government sources, visiting sites in
the area and from the settlers.
</P>
<P>
"Such construction will cause a total explosion of the peace
process and the end of dialogue with the Palestinians and the
Arab world," Cohen warned at a news conference held Tuesday in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mossi Raz, Director of Peace Now, stressed that the majority
of the settlements mentioned are deep in the West Bank, many of
them small and isolated.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Israeli Defense Ministry issued a statement
rejecting the Peace Now's charges. It denied there are any new
settlements being constructed in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel's expansion of settlements is the stumbling obstacle
in advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process which has been
frozen since March when Israel began building the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has been demanding a halt
to the settlement expansion before resuming and advancing the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Manila Offers Jobs, Education to Solve Drug Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The government of Mandaluyong in
Metro Manila is providing employment, livelihood activities and
education to help curb the serious drug problem in the city.
</P>
<P>
Mandaluyong Councilor Benjamin Abalos launched the program for
drug abusers and potential victims under the supervision of the
city government, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abalos was quoted as saying the solution to the drug problem is
to offer jobs and education to the victims of illicit drugs as
research showed that unemployment contributes most to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Abalos' findings jibed with the recent studies of the Dangerous
Drugs Board which show that drug addiction often results from lack
of jobs and educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the city government would provide education
opportunities through a special scholarship to young people who
were driven to drugs.
</P>
<P>
"If we can address these issues effectively, we can put a stop
to the vice (illegal drugs) and provide people with better
alternatives in life," Abalos said.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that 1.7 million Filipinos are drug addicts and
80 percent of them are aged between 25 and 29.

<HEADLINE> Gigantic Thunder Strikes Jiuzhi in Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A gigantic thunder struck Jiuzhi
County in northwest China's Qinghai Province days ago and more
than 100 people reported an experience of an electric shock.
</P>
<P>
An investigation made county government officials showed that
the thunder burned nine television sets, 21 telephone sets and a
number of other domestic electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the county seat, which is 3,200 meters above sea
level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, recalled that when the thunder
landed, houses shaked and people felt like experiencing an
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
An expert with the Qinghai Provincial Meterological Bureau said
Jiuzhi County is often struck by heavy thunders.
</P>
<P>
He said the average annual precipitation is about 800 mm. The
high elevation narrows the distance between water-bearing clouds
and the ground, which provides fine conditions for thunders.
</P>
<P>
He said the lastest thunder strike in Jiuzhi County was a
direct hit on buildings which could cause serious damage.
</P>
<P>
As thunders have brought about casualties of people and cattle
in the province each year, the province has established thunder
monitoring stations.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Fighting Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province is fighting a battle against a severe drought that has
affected more than 1.3 million ha of farmland
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the province have had less than ten mm
of precipitation this summer and temperatures have been two to
five degrees Celsius higher than usual. This has resulted in
withered crops on 600,000 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
In the western part of the province, one of the important grain
production bases, farmers are carrying water by every possible
means. In the northern part of the province, people have been
organized to dig wells.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation projects are an important part of the campaign, and
the provincial irrigation department has sent six groups to rural
areas to help farmers fight the drought.
</P>
<P>
Nanchengzhi reservoir has provided farmland on the lower
reaches of the Liaohe River with 20 million cubic meters of water
and more than 100 ponds have helped provide relief from the
drought. And large state-owned enterprises have come up with more
than 10,000 buckets to support the struggle.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Plane Crashes on Guam, Some 200 Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean Air jet with
254 on board crashed and burned early Wednesday when it was trying
to land at Guam's A.B. Won Pat International Airport.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 people aboard the Boeing 747 survived the crash
that occurred five kilometers from the airport at about 1:50
a.m. local time (15:50 GMT Tuesday), said U.S. Navy officials.
</P>
<P>
But, the airline's officials put the number of survivors at 50.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was on a routine flight between the South
Korean capital of Seoul and Guam, was carrying 231 passengers and
23 crew members, mostly Korean tourists, when it went down in the
hills during an attempted landing.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said they saw flames or heard an explosion
before the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
As the plane crashed, it hit an oil pipeline that runs through
the rugged jungle area, causing the line to rupture and spill
about 1,000 gallons of aviation fuel. But the fuel did not catch
fire as the break came away from the crash site, U.S. Navy
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board had sent an
18-member team from Washington to investigate the accident. An
investigation member said the voice and flight-data recorders had
been recovered from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Officials on Guam had confirmed that the airport landing system
known as the glide slope, which leads planes to the runway, had
not been in service at the airport since last month.

<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in Shanghai,
China's largest industrial center, has grown to contribute five
percent to local revenues, and is expected to play an increasingly
more important role in economic development.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 new private businesses have been launched
during the first half of this year in Shanghai, making the total
number to 62,000, involving 657,000 employees, China Business
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The average registered capital for each business is nearly
600,000 yuan, 20 percent more than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal Government gave more autonomy to its
districts and counties in managing enterprises. As a result, those
districts and counties have developed 72 industrial parks for
private firms. Now, 75 percent of the city's private sector have
settled in the parks.
</P>
<P>
In some districts and counties, private enterprises contribute
30 percent to local revenues.
</P>
<P>
The sector has employed a tenth of the city's workers,
including more than 100,000 laid-offs and some 300,000 rural
laborers, the newspaper said.

COLOMBO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Five regional leaders of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are in Colombo to plan
their attacks in the capital city, according to police sources

<P>
These leaders are here directing operations along with 12 Black
Tigers who came here several weeks ahead, the sources said.

coming here in the near future to plan attacks and disrupt the way
of life in the city.

cordon-and-search operations in the past week to capture the
rebels operating in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Three lodges in the city were shut down by the police in the

rebels, the sources said, adding that the police will take strict
action against all lodges in the capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hiroshima today marked the 52nd
anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city by calling for the
elimination of nuclear weapons and praying for those who died from
the blast, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 45,000 people, including victims of the attack and those
who lost relatives, gathered at Peace Memorial Park, located near
the point of the bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, along with
dignitaries from many countries, also attended the ceremony and
offered flowers at a cenotaph for bomb victims at the Peace
Memorial Ceremony.
</P>
<P>
At 8:15 a.m., the exact time of the blast, participants at the
ceremony offered one minute of silent prayer.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka delivered a peace declaration
and appealed to the world for the elimination of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We in Hiroshima are outraged that nuclear weapons have yet to
be abolished and banished from the face of the earth," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a swift ratification of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and strongly criticized a subcritical
nuclear test conducted by the United States in early July.
</P>
<P>
After 1,500 doves symbolizing peace were released, Hashimoto
delivered a speech and called a nuclear-free world "the fervent
wish" of his country which is "the only country to suffer an
atomic bombing in human history."
</P>
<P>
The atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, by
the U.S. B-29 bomber "Enola Gay." The bomb destroyed the city and
was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 140,000 people by
the end of 1945.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Using Foreign Funds For Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China,
which is using overseas capital for key projects, recently was
approved by the World Bank for a 400-million-yuan water diversion
project in Pianguan County.
</P>
<P>
The loan is a sixth of the bank's total loans for China this
year. It will be used for the first phase of a warter-diversion
project, from the Yellow River to Taiyuan city, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi can apply for bank loans for the second phase as soon as
the first phase construction is underway, said Mr. Daniel
Gunaratnam, a bank official who has been overseeing the water
diversion project.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the Yangcheng Power Plant, China's first
inter-provincial thermal power plant, has begun. It is expected to
transmit all its electricity over a 755-km high-voltage wire to east
China's Jiangsu Province by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The plant has a 2.1 million kw annual capacity and will cost
13.2 billion yuan, nearly 900 million US dollars of which comes
from overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi and Hong Kong have established two highway investment
companies, with 60 million US dollars in registered funds. And
five banks from Hong Kong and Macao provided 24 million US dollars
in highway loans earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to expand co-operation with overseas
investors to other sectors, relying on the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) method.

<HEADLINE> East China Expanding Economic Cooperation with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, Aug 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province will
accelerate economic cooperation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chuntao, director of the provincial Commission of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, says that he is confident about
economic cooperation prospects between Shandong and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is one of China's fastest developing provinces
economically, and has increasingly mature, large markets with many
resources, which Hong Kong lacks, Wang said. At the same time,
Shandong needs Hong Kong's capital and advanced industrial
technology. Hong Kong has now become Shandong's biggest investor
and one of its most important trading partners.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1996, the total volume of trade between Shandong
and Hong Kong reached 13 billion dollars, accounting for 14
percent of the total trade volume of the province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the Provincial Government had approved
processing trade zones in the cities of Liaocheng and Heze in an
effort to attract more investment. And in order to strengthen
Shandong-Hong Kong economic and trade relations, Shandong will
open markets further in Australia and the South Pacific and
further develop transit trade with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shandong will also become an increasingly large market for Hong
Kong products, especially consumer goods, and Hong Kong will need
more raw materials and semi-finished products from Shandong.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), Shandong
plans to get 18 billion U.S. dollars worth of direct foreign
investment, something that will be a strong inducement for Hong
Kong investment, which is expanding northward from China's
southeast coastal areas, especially after Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, there have been 9,300 Shandong-Hong Kong ventures
and solely Hong Kong-backed enterprises in Shandong, accounting for
43 percent of the province's foreign-funded enterprises.
Contractual investment from Hong Kong amounted to 11.4 billion
dollars and actually utilized capital, more than 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 3,400 of the Hong
Kong-backed firms have been begun operation in Shandong,
accounting for 42 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises
operating there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Parties' "Soft Money" Multiply, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The two major political
parties in the United States, the Republican and Democratic
parties, have multiplied the "soft money" they raised over recent
years, a report released today by an advocacy group said.
</P>
<P>
The two parties received a total of 34 million dollars in the
first half of 1997, which is more than double the 13 million
dollars they raised in the six months following the last
presidential election, said Common Cause, a nonprofit group
advocating for tighter controls on campaign money.
</P>
<P>
Republican committees raised 23 million dollars, while the
Democrats got 11 million during the first six months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Together, the Democrats and Republicans raised 262 million
dollars in soft money in the two years leading up to the 1996
election, which triples the amount raised just four years earlier,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Soft money is supposed to be spent on party-building activities
such as get-out-the-vote drives, and not on promoting individual
candidates.
</P>
<P>
But both parties have got more creative in using soft money and
poured millions into advertisements aimed at influencing last
year's presidential election, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Congress must act...to end the discredited soft money system
that is overwhelming elections and poisoning our political
system," Common Cause President Ann McBride has said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and some lawmakers have also called for
a ban on soft money and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) is
studying the matter.

<HEADLINE> Czech Output of Hops to Take Drastic Decline: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The production of hops in the Czech
Republic will drop 25 percent to 8,000 tons this year, an official
of the hops growers' association said.
</P>
<P>
The recent devastating flood and shortage of capital are being
blamed for the reduction.
</P>
<P>
The flood, the biggest in recent years, damaged large stretches
of fields used for growing hops, while the actual acreage used for
growing hops dropped 17 percent for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
Hops, known as "green gold" in the Czech Republic, is essential
for beer production and is the country's biggest foreign exchange
earner. The Czech Republic exports two thirds of its hops.
</P>
<P>
Czech hops are reputed to be the best in the world and are
often used in international markets as the standard against which
hops from other countries are tested.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Adopts Plan to Win IMF Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday adopted
a comprehensive fiscal and monetary reform plan to streamline the
country's finance sector in an apparent bid to meet conditions to
win rescue aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The most radical measure under the plan is the government's
decision to suspend 42 finance firms, including subsidiaries of
Thailand's leading commercial banks, such as Bangkok Bank, Thai
Farmers Bank and Siam Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the suspension, the Thai Finance Ministry said in
a statement that the measure is aimed at separating those
unhealthy finance institutions from healthy ones in a bid to raise
confidence of creditors in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The announcement put the total number of suspended finance
firms at 58, as the government had earlier this year already
suspended operations of 16 finance firms which were short of
funds.
</P>
<P>
The announcement sent a fresh shock wave through the local
finance and banking markets.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Stock Exchange of Thailand suspended trading in
the finance and banking sector and people flocked to some of the
finance firms to withdraw their funds.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said it will protect depositors and
creditors of the suspended firms, which have been ordered to
present rehabilitation plans within 60 days before they can
restore operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the government provides guidelines and
macroeconomic action plans and measures to tackle the country's
current economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and fiscal and monetary problem that urgently
needs to be resolved is to restore confidence in the stability of
the fiscal and monetary system," the government said in a lengthy
press release available today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will make efforts to maintain its foreign exchange
reserves at a level not less than 25 billion U.S. dollars, or
sufficient to support 3.5 months' imports and resolve the crisis
affecting the financial system.
</P>
<P>
As part of its macroeconomic action plans and measures, the
Thai government will cut its current account deficit to five
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) this year from eight
percent in 1995, and to three percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country will also try to maintain its annual economic
growth at 3-4 percent this year and next year, cap inflation at
8-9 percent this year and restore finance stability immediately
through balancing income and expenditure, reforming the finance
system, and borrowing from the IMF and other countries and
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the comprehensive plan, the Thai government also
introduced some important steps to address the country's current
economic and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The government will first of all allow the Financial
Institution Development Fund to provide guarantee for depositors
and creditors and in the future, a deposit insurance institution
will be set up for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, The Thai government will raise value added tax from
seven percent to 10 percent as from August 16 this year.
</P>
<P>
The government also will retain the managed floatation of the
baht and restrict spending to the public sector, including
education, public health, infrastructure, social welfare and
investment in state enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said in a statement
Tuesday that Thailand's ailing economy needs assistance from the
IMF and the painful measures will help Thailand to achieve
sustainable economic development in the long-term.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to be patient, disciplined and frugal and not
to lose heart in the struggle through economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
Thailand reportedly is seeking an initial credit line of 15 to
20 billion U.S. dollars from the IMF. The IMF has formulated an
overall rescue package, but with six conditions attached -- higher
taxes, a clean-up of the finance sector, a balanced budget,
elimination of subsidies to state agencies, tight monetary policy
and maintenance of the current foreign exchange system.

<HEADLINE> Failure of Safety Device May Be Blamed for Crash: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Failure of a safety device may
be blamed for today's jumbo jet crash on Guam that killed some 200
people on board Korean Air Lines (KAL) Flight 801 bound for Agana
from Seoul, a KAL vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Tae-won said failure of a safety device used to assist
pilots during instrument landings may have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
Guam officials have confirmed that the airport's glide slope, a
device used for instrument landings during poor visibility, had
been out of service for some time.
</P>
<P>
Lee said there were 55 survivors.
</P>
<P>
His version contradicted other accounts: U.S. navy officials
said earlier that 33 survivors had been rescued and there was
little chance of finding any others. The 747s 'black box'
recorder, however, has been found and sent to Hawaii for
examination.
</P>
<P>
A stewardess was reported to be unscathed following the crash
and was found walking about at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747, carrying 231 passengers and 23 crew members,
exploded into flaming pieces at a hilly jungle area after striking
a pipeline.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. rescue team rushed to the scene soon after the crash.
</P>
<P>
Poor visibility, shoulder-high grass and muddy conditions
hampered earlier rescue efforts. Rescue workers had to follow
screams to find those trapped in the burning wreckage and a path
had to be carved through the jungle for emergency rescue equipment.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean team of experts has also left for the crash site
to investigate the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam called an emergency
meeting of cabinet ministers and ordered all necessary support for
the rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of those on the plane are waiting anxiously at KAL
headquarters in Seoul for news of family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
Among the 231 passengers on board the ill-fated aircraft, there
were 21 foreigners, three children and Shin Ki-ha, a four-term
lawmaker and former parliamentary leader of the main opposition
National Congress for New Politics, his wife and 20 party members.
</P>
<P>
A KAL official said Flight 801 was upgraded from an Airbus to
the larger Boeing 747-300 because of an increase in tourists to
Guam during the current summer holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Guam, the largest of the Mariana Islands, in the unincorporated
U.S. territory, is one of the most popular tourist destinations
for holidaymakers from both sides of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Its capital Agana is dotted with five-star hotels that offer
water sports and outdoor activities. Snorkeling, scuba diving and
deep sea fishing are the most popular activities in the island.

<HEADLINE> Five Million Nepalese Children Forced to Work: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- An estimated five million child
laborers work in different sectors in Nepal and most of them are
forced to support their families, an official survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Nepal's National Planning Commission,
said poor economic conditions are the major reason behind child
labor.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, children work simply because of poverty, the
survey said, adding that only 10 percent of the child laborers
take up a job of their own free will.
</P>
<P>
While in urban areas, economic conditions plus parental
pressure are to be blamed. The survey found that 29 percent of the
children work for economic reasons, 20 percent due to parental
pressure and another 20 percent of their free will.
</P>
<P>
But for the bonded child laborers, poverty tells all.
</P>
<P>
The survey says almost 88 percent of them work solely for
economic reasons, eight percent due to parental pressure and a
mere one percent of their own will.
</P>
<P>
Some 54 percent of the rural child laborers and 37 percent of
the urban ones come from families heavily indebted, the survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey further notes that 46 percent of the rural child
laborers and most of the urban ones come from wage earning
families.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the bonded child laborers depend on agriculture for
livelihood, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows these child laborers are basically engaged in
five sectors: agriculture and house work (86 percent), service
sector (6 percent), business and cottage industry (three percent),
factories (2.4 percent) and construction (0.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Country Level Consultation on Child Labor held
here Tuesday, some noted that children who go to cities become the
victims of financial, physical, mental and sexual exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Nepali newspapers quoted a senior official of the International
Labor Organization as saying that child laborers deserve to be
identified, exposed and eliminated without further delay.

<HEADLINE> Lima Remains One of Most Dangerous Cities in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Lima, capital of Peru, remains among
the cities with the highest crime rate in Latin America, in spite
of improvement in social security in the 1990s, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lima is now ranked the sixth of the most dangerous city in the
region instead of the second in the late 1980s, when it was
preceded by Cali, Colombia, said Andres Bernales, chairman of
Peruvian Council of Integral Security.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Peruvian government has taken measures to
curb terrorism and other criminal acts, said Bernales. And 300
private security companies have also contributed to better social
security, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the current situation is still very serious. So far
this year 800 abductions, four cases each day on average, have
taken place, the security official said.
</P>
<P>
Every day, five raids were committed on financial agencies and
banks, and 1,000 assaults were witnessed.
</P>
<P>
The Council has attributed the high crime rate to economic and
social unrests and a poverty-stricken population.
</P>
<P>
The five cities with the highest crime rate in Latin America
are Bogota, Rio de Janeiro, Cali, Caracas and Mexico, Bernales
said.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Give Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia would provide another
2.56 million U.S. dollars in food aid for the famine-stricken
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Australian Minister
For Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer announced today.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the additional funding was in response to the
latest international appeal issued by the United Nations World
Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
He said Australia, through the Australian Agency for
International Development or AusAID, had already provided 2.96
million U.S. dollars for food aid, including 93 tons of
Australia-made high energy biscuits, to help alleviate the food
crisis in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"The additional funding will contribute to the WFP's program of
increasing daily food rations for 2.6 million DPRK children aged
under six from 100 to 250 grams a day," the foreign minister said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the Australian aid would be channeled through the
WFP because it was one of the few humanitarian agencies with a
presence in the DPRK and was best able to manage and monitor food
distribution.

A mild tremor was also felt in the capital Dhaka Tuesday night,

<HEADLINE> Tax Collection Falls Short of Target in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tax revenue collection
suffered a major setback in the fiscal 1996-97, forcing the
government to borrow a huge amount of money from the banks to meet
the revenue expenditure, said official sources.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, collection of tax revenue
during the last fiscal ending June this year amounted to 124.4
billion taka (about 2.86 billion U.S. dollars) as against the
target of 130.4 billion taka (about 3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure, however, indicated a 9.42 percent growth compared
with the 113 billion taka (about 2.6 billion dollars) collected in
the previous fiscal.
</P>
<P>
Revenue officials attributed the shortfall mainly to frequent
congestion at Chittagong port, the largest seaport of Bangladesh,
which witnessed frequent strikes last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the customs duty collection during the
period came to 40.07 billion taka (about 921 million dollars),
which was 4.03 billion taka (about 92.6 million dollars) less than
the target.
</P>
<P>
To meet the revenue expenditure, the government already
borrowed 14.97 billion taka (about 344 million dollars) from the
banking sector in the last fiscal. Further increase in government
borrowing would mean higher inflation, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Zones Tap Oceanic Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The government has selected five
pilot zones for developing the oceanic economy to pave the way for
restructuring its oceanic industrial projects and accelerating
coastal economic growth, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Zhao Jihao, vice-director of
the planning and finance department under the State Oceanographic
Administration (SOA) as saying that these zones are the Bohai Bay
Rim, the Yangtze River Estuary and the Hangzhou Bay Area, the
southeastern offshore area of Fujian province, the Pearl River
Estuary and the Beibuwan Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
The country's oceanic economy has grown rapidly over the past
two decades, as the oceanic output value reached more than 24
billion US dollars in 1995, about 30 times that of 1979.
</P>
<P>
To curb serious waste of raw materials and ease huge pressure
on environment, the national programme on oceanic resource
exploitation fixed the coastal zones as pilots for sustainable
integrated oceanic and land economic development first in the
coastal areas and later in the inland regions.
</P>
<P>
These zones have developed their oceanic economy through
constructing and expanding ports, improving techniques of aquatic
breeding and oceanic chemical industry as well as bettering the
coastal tourism service trade.
</P>
<P>
Provinces like Shandong, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Fujian and Hainan,
as well as Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have worked out their
own plans for developing their oceanic economy under the guidance
of the national programme and have increased investment in
advancing oceanic technologies.
</P>
<P>
China claims more than 18,000 kilometers of coast line. It has
jurisdiction over three million square kilometers of sea under the
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Interested in Slavery Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The White House said today
that President Bill Clinton does not consider apologizing for
slavery to be an appropriate first step for his national dialogue
on race.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton decided soon
after his June 14 speech in California on race that he was not
interested in an apology, although he said in later interviews
that he would consider the idea.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said an apology "is not the place that he chooses to
begin this dialogue.... I don't anticipate the president putting
any of the focus of his energy on that subject any time soon."
</P>
<P>
The subject did not come up Tuesday during Clinton's meeting
with the Black Leadership Forum, an umbrella group of the heads of
black organizations. The group's president said it was not
interested in talking about an apology.
</P>
<P>
However, individual members said they had made it clear to
Clinton they had not ruled out an apology, as long as it came with
something of more substance.
</P>
<P>
"An apology is in order," said Jesse Jackson, head of the
Rainbow PUSH Action Network. "But you must not only apologize with
your lips. Repent, repair and remedy go together."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in an interview on Monday that he would leave the
matter up to his race advisory board he set up in June.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a national apology was first raised by
Representative Tony Hall, who introduced legislation calling on
Congress to apologize to black Americans whose ancestors were
slaves.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Make Artificial Rain over Dry Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
intensifying the production of artificial rain in drought-hit
areas in Java and South Sulawesi, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works Radinal Moochtar said here Wednesday
the artificial rain-making effort would be coupled with the
building of dams to store the rain water until the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Rainy season usually starts in September or October.
</P>
<P>
Data at the Ministry of Public Works indicate that the current
drought is having a greater impact on rice fields than previously
predicted.

<P>
Up to this week, 112,889 hectares of rice fields have been
affected by drought, of which 5,870 were totally damaged.
</P>
<P>
The situation this year, however, is not as bad as in 1994 when
544,422 hectares of rice fields were hit by drought, the minister
said.

MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Two oxygen generators on board the
Mir space station have failed, a spokesman for the Russian ground
control center said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the craft's oxygen-producing electrolysis
equipment broke down a few days ago, but he described the incident
as routine.
</P>
<P>
It will not affect the program of work on board the craft, the
AFP quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The current three crew members, two Russian cosmonauts and
their American colleague Michael Foale, have been making repairs
and are now using back-up canisters to produce oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, two Russian cosmonauts blasted off frofrom the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to replace the current crew and
make vital repairs to the station.
</P>
<P>
Mir, which is in its 11th year in space, suffered serious
damage on June 25 when it collided with its resupply ship. The
station has been running on reduced power since then.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine-U.S. Naval Exercises to go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's Defense Minister, Alexander
Kuzmuk, says the Sea Breeze-97 naval exercises with the United
States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries will
begin on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk had expressed surprise at the amount of attention paid
to the maneuvers, saying they were routine military exercises,
local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sea Breeze-97, to be held from August 26 to 30, faces grim
opposition from the parliament. Some legislators called the
exercises unconstitutional because the constitution declared the
country to be a non-aligned state.
</P>
<P>
Residents, especially those in the city of Sevastopol, who are
mostly Russians, are angry about the exercise which involves the
United States. Russia refused to join the exercises.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk said the exercise would be launched in Donuzla as
planned. The exercise would start with a "mini-Olympiad" in
commemoration of Ukraine's Independence Day on August 24, the
national news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk said the Ukrainian Ministry of Emergency would also
participate in exercises involving the organization of field
hospitals and demonstration of rescue equipment.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Ukrainian navy vessels, two ships from the United
States and each of the other participating countries will join the
exercises which, organizers said, were aimed at rehearsing joint
operations for natural disasters and rescue operations.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern China Cooperating With Japan In Rice Seed Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, Aug 6 (Xinhua) -- After 15 years of joint research by
Chinese and Japanese agronomists as part of a Sino-Japanese
government agreement, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of
China's Yunnan Province has produced 42 new varieties of high
yields, high quality, cold- and disease-resistant rice seeds.
</P>
<P>
The co-operative work has included large-scale study and
evaluation of seed heredity information, breeding, and
utilization. Chinese and Japanese agronomists provided 1,376 types
of seeds for each other to examine and studied their
cold-resistant properties and rice blast resistance, as well as
quality and yield, then chose the best for hybridizing.
</P>
<P>
The new seeds have been sown on 11.6 million mu (about 773,300
hectares) of mountainous land in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and
western Hunan provinces in the southwestern part of China, where
freezing temperatures and rice blast caused by heavy rainfall are
common.
</P>
<P>
Per-hectare output of these new seeds was 897.3 kilograms more
than that of previously used seeds and total output increased 694
million kilograms. Half of the rice-growing areas in Yunnan have
used these new seeds this year and there has been no sign of frost
and rice-blast damage.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Justin Gimelstob earned his
first clash against Pete Sampras in a second-round match through a
6-3, 6-4 win over Byron Black at the 2.3 million U.S. dollars ATP
Championship Tuesday in Mason, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old American blew out 11 aces against Black in the
match.
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob, ranked 88th in the world, was noted for a win over
French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten in the first round of
Wimbledon this year and a defeat of Andre Agassi two weeks ago on
hardcourt in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, 26, has captured overall ten Grand Slam titles
including four Wimbledon trophies, only two crowns less than the
record of a dozen held by Australian Roy Emerson.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, a former world No. 1 but current ranked 33rd, faces
Kuerten Tuesday night in a first-round contest which the two-time
title holder must win if he wants to improve his embarrassing
match record of six wins and eight lose this year.

BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Technicians and workers in
State-owned firms are taking part in a sweeping programme to
improve efficiency by developing up-to-date technology, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Cui Jianping, an

<P>
The programme has concentrated on improving efficiency, saving
energy, reducing costs, improving product quality, introducing
high-tech procedures, developing new products, upgrading
traditional industrial processes and streamlining management.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Causes Floods, Two Deaths in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A powerful typhoon sweeping across
the Philippines brought in heavy floods and left two deaths at the
height of its fury Tuesday, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the typhoon, coded Huling and the country's
second typhoon this year, has been lashing the country over the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
Due to the heavy floods and strong winds it brought in, a
driver fell off a bridge before a 34-year-old woman drowned when
the ferry boat she was riding capsized Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report added that classes at elementary and secondary
schools in Manila were suspended while some colleges and
universities canceled scheduled exams. Traffic in parts of Manila
also came to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
The country's weather bureau said Huling is expected to move at
about 330 kilometers to China and Japan's Okinawa this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Finland Suspends Contacts With Bosnian Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Finland decided today to suspend
contacts with the Bosnian ambassador to Finland, Izet Serdarevic,
following the example of Western countries in toughening policy
towards Bosnia over its failure to meet peace treaty deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish decision followed a proposal by Luxembourg, which
holds the rotating presidency of the 15-nation European Union,
said a communique issued by the Finnish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The decision also requires Finnish diplomatic missions
stationed abroad to suspend contacts with Bonsnian ambassadors,
but allows them to maintain contacts with Bosnian embassies.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, a number of major Western states have
suspended contacts with Bosnian ambassadors because Bosnian
leaders failed to meet an August 1 deadline for the joint
Moslem-Serb-Croat presidency to agree on the appointment of
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Finland hopes its decision to suspend contacts with the Bosnian
ambassador will serve to prompt Bosnia's political leaders to make
an early decision on the issue, said the communique.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of persons who
survived the early morning crash of South Korean flight 801 bound
for Guam has so far reached 55, but rescue workers see little hope of
finding more, said a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747, carrying 231 passengers and 23 crew members,
crashed in a rugged jungle area at 2:35 a.m. local time Wednesday
just before landing at the Agana International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Low visibility and a driving rain have made rescue operations
difficult. So far there are no reports on the cause of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
A US rescue team rushed immediately to the crash site and began to
carve a path through the jungle for heavy rescue equipment.
</P>
<P>
The plane exploded into flaming pieces after striking an oil
pipeline, while heavy smoke shrouded the plane's wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers were reportedly on holiday, while some
were said to be honeymooners. No less than 13 Americans were
reported to be on board the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Guam, one of most popular destinations for South Korean tourists
and the largest of the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific, is
an unincorporated territory of the United States with a population
of about 144,000. A US military base covers one third of the
island.

<HEADLINE> Rain Comes to East China Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The rainfall between August 2 and 4
has helped to ease the serious drought on east China's Jiaodong
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The local meteorological department recorded 30 mm of
precipitation over a three day period in the northwestern part of
the peninsula, with 70 mm recorded in southeastern areas.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula, one of the country's major grain and edible oil
production bases, has been in the midst of serious drought over
the past two months, with Yantai recording total precipitation of
only 36 mm, a mere 10 percent compared to last year's same
period. As a result, some small reservoirs, ponds and rivers in
the area virtually dry.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the recent rainfall will help to save autumn
crops, but warn that the dry spell will most likely continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and the United States
cancelled their scheduled August meeting in Caracas for a
bilateral accord aimed to avoid double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock came after poor results from a Washington meeting
a week ago among representatives of American Tresury and
Venezuela National Integrated Service of Tax Administration
(SENIAT) Committee, according to a committee's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The August talks are expected to close the discussion on the
accord to avoid double taxation, to be signed October in Caracas,
during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the aborted meeting will be replaced
by written informal contacts to "interchange new ideas".
</P>
<P>
They claimed the cancellation leaves almost no chances to reach
a final accord to be signed during Clinton's visit.

<P>
The Australian
</P>

alcohol and petrol.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>

unemployment problem.

The Age
</P>
<P>
-- In an unprecedented move, the Victoria state government last

scheduled for today.

The Australian Financial Review
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan today highly appreciated Pakistan's unremitting
efforts in seeking improvement of its relations with India.
</P>
<P>
"We not only attach great importance to the relations between
Pakistan and India but also appreciate the long-standing and
unremitting efforts made by our Pakistani friends in seeking a
peaceful resolution of the Kashmir question," Tang told
journalists upon his arrival at the airport here tonight for a
two-day visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who is on his sixth visit to Pakistan, also lauded
Islamabad's efforts in the resumption of talks between Pakistan
and India at the level of foreign secretary and at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
"Recently there has been relaxation in the relations between
India and Pakistan to which we attach great importance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more exchanges of bilateral visit by
officials of Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
"Since Pakistan and China are close neighbors, officials of the
two countries should also pay more visits to each other just like
calling on relatives," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Every time I visit Pakistan, I feel like home-coming," he
said.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question, Tang said, "As a close neighbor of
Afghanistan's, China has great interest in the evolution of the
situation in that country."
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate the constructive efforts made by the
international community including Pakistan for the restoration of
peace in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad who greeted Tang at
the airport, said at the same brief news conference that the
relationship between Pakistan and China is based on solid
foundations.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of this 'all weather' friendship which has
withstood all tests of time," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Tang's current visit "will give another boost
to this relationship".
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, Tang Jiaxuan will hold extensive
talks with Pakistan's senior officials on bilateral, regional and
international issues of mutual interest. He will also call on
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Air Crash at Guam Kills More Than 200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean Air jumbo jet
with 254 people aboard crashed off Guam early Wednesday (local
time) when it was trying to land at Guam's A.B. Won Pat
International Airport, killing more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
Guam police said that about 30 people survived the crash that
happened five kilometers from the airport at about 1:50 a.m. local
time (11:50 p.m. EDT Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
The airline said the plane was carrying 254 people -- 231
passengers and 23 crewmen. Most of the passengers were Korean
tourists and honeymooners.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports from different sources had put the number on
board the Boeing 747 at between 231 and 331.
</P>
<P>
Flight 801 from Seoul, South Korea, to Guam was cleared to land
when contact was lost at the distance, the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration's Pacific officials in Honolulu said.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said that they saw flames or heard an explosion
before the plane went down in a rain storm in the hills.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report quoted a White House official as
saying that the pilot radioed the tower, declared an in-flight
emergency and said "there was a fire on board."
</P>
<P>
A landing system known as the glide slope, which leads planes
to the runway, had not been in service at the airport since last
month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team of
12 officials from Washington to investigate. U.S. military forces
at Guam took part in the rescue work, hoping to find more
survivors.
</P>
<P>
The plane ordinarily lands at Guam and then returns to Seoul as
Flight 802, according to the current International Passenger
Timetable.

<HEADLINE> White House to Study Recommendations on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The White House said today it
will "seriously" consider a federal advisory panel's
recommendations abolishing the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) and reassigning its duties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, in its fourth and
final report since its creation by Congress in 1990, was expected
to recommend the INS's duties be divided among the departments of
state, justice and labor.
</P>
<P>
The INS has been criticized for failing to cope with rapidly
growing requests for citizenship, and failing to crack down on
criminal aliens and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the commission's
report identified "not shortcomings in the personnel and people,
but structural impediments to them efficiently doing their job
because of overlapping jurisdictions of other departments."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the White House has not yet taken a position on
the report, saying, "It is clearly an agency that deals with some
of the most complex problems we face in our society, and at times
its performance falls short."
</P>
<P>
The commission planned to recommend that the Justice Department
take responsibility for border control and removal of illegal
immigrants, the State Department handle immigration services and
benefits, and the Labor Department enforce rules covering the
hiring of foreign workers, according to The New York Times.

<HEADLINE> US: Israel's Economic Weapon "Counterproductive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States today called
Israel's suspension of its reimbursement of taxes owed to the
Palestinian Authority "counterproductive" to the peace process in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley called on Israel to
resume the reimbursement in accordance with its agreements with
the Palestinians to transfer to the Palestinian Authority of
nearly 500 million dollars that it collects each year from
Palestinians who work or buy goods in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat "referred to the
hardships the Palestinians are undergoing under these
circumstances," when he conversed through telephone with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government unleashed the economic weapon by
suspending the reimbursement as part of its campaign to impose
pressure on the Palestinian Authority in the wake of last week's
bombings at a Jerusalem produce market, which killed 15 people
and injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Albright will speak to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu later today, but he did not said what they will
discuss.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Arafat offered his assurances in his
telephone conversations with Albright about his commitment to
security for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"He's been saying the right things," Foley said. And he said
the United States "wants to see sustained efforts" by the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Foley also said U.S. mediator Dennis Ross will travel to the
Middle East this weekend, where he will meet Arafat, Netanyahu
and possibly other Middle East leaders.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who has shunned the shuttle diplomacy strategy used
by her predecessors to push Middle East peaceful settlements,
will also go to the region soon after Ross's mission.
