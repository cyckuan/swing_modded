<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Attend Iran-hosted Conference on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will not attend the
conference on Afghanistan scheduled to be held in Tehran next week
due to "shortage of time and lack of clarity about the agenda and
proposed list of invitees," a foreign office spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Confirmed information about the proposed conference to be held
on next Tuesday and Wednesday was received from Tehran only last
Friday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan had already maintained that only those states which
were directly concerned with the welfare of Afghanistan should
attend any conferences of neighboring or regional countries and
such a conference should follow rather than precede an
intra-Afghan dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has invited foreign ministers from more than 10 countries
to the conference to discuss the situation in Afghanistan since
the Taliban religious militia took control of Kabul last month.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar has recently
shuttled among Afghan warring factions, trying to broker a
ceasefire among them.
</P>
<P>
However, a ceasefire agreement failed to be signed last week as
northern warlord Rashid Dostum demanded the Taliban leave Kabul as
a precondition for signing the agreement.

<HEADLINE> New York's Yankees Win World Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of fans erupted
into streets after the Yankees of New York won the World Series
title Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
In the third consecutive spine-tingling game, the Yankees
prevailed over the Atlanta Braves 3-2 to win the Series in six
games.
</P>
<P>
The Yankees hammered four-time Cy Young Award winner Greg
Maddux for four hits and three runs in the third inning then held
on behind a stalwart bullpen to win the game. It was the first
victory by a home team in the Series.
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to beat the world champions. We haven't been
intimidated by anybody. Every player on our 25-man roster helped
us win a game this year. I'm not sure how many teams can say
that," Yankees' manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
The Braves, last year's champions, did not give up their title
easily. They scored a run in the ninth and had the tying and
go-ahead runs on base when reliever John Wetteland retired Mark
Lemke on a foul pop to end the game.
</P>
<P>
A wild scene erupted on the pitcher's mound as the final out
was recorded. The entire Yankee team piled on top of Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of helmeted police and about 50 mounted police
surrounded the field to prevent fans from running onto the playing
surface. The loudspeaker then began blaring Frank Sinatra's "New
York, New York," and many in the crowd of 56,375 began singing
along.
</P>
<P>
It was the Yankees first World Series title since 1978 and they
accomplished it the same way, by winning four games in a row after
losing the first two. It was the club's 23rd world championship
overall in 34 trips to the Series.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Troops Attack Refugee Camps in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan troops have attacked at
least three refugee camps in eastern Zaire in 24 hours from Friday
night to Saturday night, forcing tens of thousands of refugees to
flee, Agence France Presse reported today.
</P>
<P>
International humanitarian sources in eastern Zaire and Geneva
said Rwandan troops Saturday night attacked with heavy artillery
the refugee camp of Katale, after attacking a refugee camp in
Kibumba Friday night. Both camps are situated in the North Kivu
province.
</P>
<P>
A humanitarian source in Geneva said today that the attack upon
the refugee camp of Kibumba, which lasted for nine hours, was
launched by the Seventh Battalion of the Rwandan Army based in
Kigali, capital of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The camp in Kibumba was totally empty today, and tens of
thousands of refugees from the camp arrived at Goma, the capital
of North Kivu province, in a tragic exodus under heavy rain this
morning, according to AFP report from Goma.
</P>
<P>
Zairean troops repelled the attack on the Katale refugee camp
early this morning, and the camp's 220,000 refugees were not
subjected to too much panic, said humanitarian sources.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports reaching here, a refugee camp in
Panzi, in South Kivu province, was also attacked Saturday night
and the 7,300 refugees inside have fled the camp in panic.
</P>
<P>
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said today that the camp in Panzi, which is situated near
Bukavu, the capital of the South Kivu province, was completely
deserted this morning.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, including the handicapped, the wounded in the
civil war in Rwanda in 1994, and their families, are fleeing
toward Bukavu, a UNHCR spokesman said in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based International Federation of Societies of Red
Cross said Saturday that an undetermined number of people were
killed and 57 others wounded in the attack on Kibumba refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zaire government closed the airport of Goma this
morning, blocking the takeoff a Nairobi-bound plane carrying the
staff of international humanitarian groups, said reports from Goma.
</P>
<P>
One Zairean soldier was killed and three wounded this morning
near the camp of Katale, which is 56 kilometers north of Goma.
The Kibumba refugee camp is only 300 meters from the Rwandan
border, and can be easily reached by gun fires from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Zairean town of Uvira, which is
close to the border with Burundi, seems to be controlled by the
Banyamulenge militias who have been fighting Zairean troops for
more than two months.
</P>
<P>
Zairean troops abandoned the town, which has a population of
150,000 and is 30 kilometers from the Burundian capital of
Bujumbura, without much resistance Friday evening, according to
UNHCR sources.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli Premier Ends Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres left here today at the end of several hours of talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held upon his arrival in
the Sinai Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh this morning.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also met with the Israeli press delegation
accompanying Peres. Egyptian Minister of Information Safwat
el-Sherif attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During Peres' visit, at the invitation of Mubarak, topics
under discussion covered the latest developments of the Middle
East peace process, in particular the faltering
Palestinian-Israeli talks on the implementation of the agreements
on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Peres, Israel's opposition Labour Party leader, a Nobel Peace
Prize laureate, is instrumental in making a historic peace deal
between the Israelis and the Palestinians, together with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his predecessor Yitzhak
Rabin, who was assassinated on November 4 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Rabin government had reached agreement with Palestine
under which Israeli soldiers should have left, by March this
year, the bulk of the West Bank town of Hebron, where 450 Jewish
settlers live among 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said he wanted better security arrangements for
the settlers before ordering the pullback.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat's cabinet Saturday blamed Israel for lack of
progress in redeployment talks, a day after Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said the Palestinians had yet to make
it clear whether they had abandoned violence and were committed
to peace.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-brokered talks on Hebron resumed Saturday evening,
overshadowed by fresh warnings that the Palestinian militant
group Islamic Jihad planned to carry out attacks in Israel to
mark the assassination of its leader, Fathi Shakaki.
</P>
<P>
Israel is widely believed to have had a hand in the killing.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Peres warned Netanyahu that the Israeli people
would not stand by and "let the deterioration which has taken
place in the state continue."
</P>
<P>
Peres' Labour Party has already lent its support to a
coalition of Jewish and Arab opposition parties whose sole
policy, activated after the confrontations, is to denounce
Netanyahu and promote the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Alliance Starts Second Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Forces of the anti-Taliban
alliance in Afghanistan today launched their second major
offensive on a key pass leading to Kabul, said reports from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Fighting at the Deh Sabz pass, 25 km northeast of Kabul, began
early this morning, said Commander Saeed Akbar, an officer in the
ousted government forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
The pass lies on New Road, one of the two roads running north
from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The first offensive on the pass failed on Wednesday and the
failure was blamed on a "lack of coordination" between forces of
Masood and those of northern warlord of Rashid Dostum, who are
fighting shoulder to shoulder against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Dostum's officers said two Dostum jets bombed Taliban
positions. A jet believed to be part of Dostum's force also
dropped two bombs on Kabul airport early today -- the third air
raid in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban jet today dropped a bomb near Dostum's command post,
but there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
But at Masood's headquarters in the town of Jabul Saraj, 77 km
north of Kabul, Taliban artillery fire injured five people.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was less intense on a second front about 12 km from
Kabul on the Old Road, another road leading to the north from
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Masood's forces are facing off the Taliban at a pass controlled
by the student militia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Dostum claimed the warlord's troops
had regained the upper hand in fighting in Badghis province, in
the northwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Taliban announced they had taken the province
and advanced into neighboring Faryab province.
</P>
<P>
But the Dostum spokesman, speaking in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif today, said Dostum's forces had pushed back the
Taliban from Badghis.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman admitted Dostam's troops were attacked in Badghis
on Friday by the Taliban, but he added that the attack was
repulsed.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed reports that a jet sent by the anti-Taliban
alliance dropped three bombs on Kabul airport early today in the
fourth air raid on the Afghan capital in 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> France Considers Evacuating Westerners from Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- France is contacting its European
partners and U.N. humanitarian groups over evacuation of their
nationals and staff from eastern Zaire to escape the escalating
fighting between Zairean forces and Banyamulenge militias.
</P>
<P>
"We are in contact with a certain number of European partners
and with the international agencies of the U.N. to facilitate the
departure," French foreign ministry vice-spokesman Jacques
Doutriaux said.
</P>
<P>
The number of French nationals who are still in the combat
area is small, he added.
</P>
<P>
France could use its military forces based in the neighboring
Central-African Republic to evacuate its nationals and those of
other European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Paris has not yet showed any intention to unilaterally
use its troops to evacuate some 100 French nationals most of whom
are in the Zairean town of Goma.
</P>
<P>
However, the French nationals, most of whom are aid workers and
religious missionaries, are reluctant to leave, according to
French official sources.
</P>
<P>
The French government on Saturday urged its citizens who are still
staying in eastern Zaire to leave the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign ministry set up a team which is going to
Zaire to assess the seriousness of the humanitarian disaster
caused by the exodus of hundreds of thousand of refugees who fled
their camps to avoid violences.
</P>
<P>
The situation in eastern Zaire remains very confusing today, as
international humanitarian sources have accused Rwandan troops of
attacking several refugee camps from Friday night to this morning.

According to a press release of the Nepali Foreign Ministry,
the Indian diplomatic mission in Dhaka has recently started
issuing double entry permits to tourist groups heading for Nepal
through several points on the eastern Indian border.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arabs Aim High in Oil Refinement Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The oil-rich Arab countries set
forth their aim to play a vital role in the international oil
refinement industry at a regional symposium here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, organized by the Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), focuses on the challenges
of the 21st century facing the refinement industry in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
OAPEC Secretary General Abdel Aziz al Abdalla al Turki told
the opening session today that the Arab countries, with oil
reserves accounting for 60 percent of the world total, will be
capable of meeting the needs of the refinement industry for the
coming decades.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Arab countries themselves are significantly
enhancing their oil-refining capability as billions of dollars
have been spent in technological research and development.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain have raised their refining
capability to 6 million barrels per day (bpd) from 2.7 million
bpd in 1972, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the oil refinement industry faces
serious challenge since many environment-conscious measures were
adopted.
</P>
<P>
"The widespread use of natural gas as means of environment
protection against pollution has increased the oil surplus and
lowered the demand for it," the OAPEC official said.
</P>
<P>
About 50 oil experts from 12 Arab countries and
representatives from 16 Arab and international oil corporations
are taking part in the three-day symposium, which examines the
investments and tendencies of the global refinement industry and
the future demand for transportation fuel.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Health Sector Needs Improvements for UN Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's health sector must
make drastic improvements if it is to achieve the United Nations'
goal of health care for all by the year 2000, the official RSS
news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there is one doctor for every 24,000
people in Nepal, while in the country's far west the rate is only
one for every 200,000, according to an RSS report.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey of the country's public health
condition, 63 percent of Nepalese children are undernourished and
the mortality rate of children under the age of five is 165 per
1,000.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 people die of gastroenteritis every year and the
same number of people die of respiratory diseases, the RSS said,
adding that the death toll caused by tuberculosis and leprosy in
Nepal is higher than that of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Patients in some areas of the country still face difficulties
finding a doctor although many health programs like vaccination,
family planning and AIDS control have been launched across the
country, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,200 doctors and 20,000 health workers in Nepal and
the number is inadequate for providing medical services for the
country's population of 20 million, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government has to take reform steps for implementing a new
health policy and opening health posts in all villages of the
country to overcome the weakness of the public health system, the
Nepal Public Health Association said.

LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Six men were arrested after
Irish police uncovered a suspected Irish Republic Army (IRA) arms
dump today in a remote part of the Irish Republic, according to a

Officers seized two rifles and an unspecified quantity of

Several arms caches belonging to the outlawed Irish Republican

</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army ended a 17-month ceasefire in
February with a series of deadly bomb attacks in England. Because
of this, Britain and Ireland have excluded the IRA's political

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Religious Party Fails to Stage Sit-in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani religious party,
Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), today failed to stage its planned sit-in
demonstration in front of the parliament house here.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Nasirullah Khan Baber told a press conference
that the JI's sit-in plan had fizzled out after failing to achieve
its objective of converging in front of the parliament house.
</P>
<P>
Baber said a few disturbances were reported near Islamabad,
"but the situation was now calm and under control."
</P>
<P>
The government deployed several thousand police troops in and
around Islamabad, setting up check posts on all roads leading to
the capital, to prevent JI activists from entering.
</P>
<P>
At a few checkpoints, the JI activists tried to break through
the barricades set up by the police and there were reports of
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas to disperse the JI demonstrators, who
planned to stage a sit-in to protest against the government's
policies.
</P>
<P>
No incident of firing was reported in Islamabad and its twin
city of Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
About 16 policemen were injured during the clashes with JI
activists at various places.
</P>
<P>
The JI said four of its activists sustained bullet injuries in
Punjab's provincial capital of Lahore during a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
A JI spokesman said a strong police contingent used tear gas
and opened fire to disperse the demonstrators, injuring four JI
activists.
</P>
<P>
On June 24, four people were killed in a clash in Rawalpindi
between JI activists and police when the government tried to stop
the JI's attempt to stage a sit-in demonstration in Islamabad.

<HEADLINE> GCC Meeting Fails to Reach Agreement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Finance and foreign
ministers of the six-state Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
concluded their joint meeting today in Riyadh, capital of Saudi
Arabia, without reaching a long discussed agreement on
unification of customs tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing final has been agreed" during the meeting which was
aimed at reaching a formula acceptable to all GCC member
countries regarding the issue, Omani Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Yusef Ben Alawi was quoted by the Kuwait News
Agency as telling reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers failed to reach an agreement concerning two
groups of commodities which were previously discussed by
technical sub-committees.
</P>
<P>
The two groups of commodities as suggested by GCC finance and
foreign ministers envisaged that commodities should be
classified as "taxable or tax-exempted."
</P>
<P>
But proposals put forth at the meeting stipulated that 95
percent of the commodities classified earlier be subject to 8
percent tax, while the remaining 5 percent of the commodities
would be exempted.
</P>
<P>
Ben Alawi said the ministers decided to assign GCC Secretary
General Jamil Al-Hujeilan to prepare a memo including all
possible options related to the unification of customs tariffs
and refer it to the coming foreign ministers meeting scheduled
for November 9.
</P>
<P>
He said there are several options which would be formulated
in a convenient way so that the GCC leaders could decide upon."
</P>
<P>
Oman is the current chairman of GCC which was established in
1981 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Customs tariffs unification is considered essential for the
long sought economic integrity of the regional important
political and economic body in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It is also a prerequisite for the signing of a free trade
agreement with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
During the 16th GCC summit in Muscat, Oman, in 1995, the Gulf
leaders underlined the importance of unifying customs tariffs
among the member states. In its final communique, the summit
assigned GCC finance and foreign Ministers for this delicate
task.
</P>
<P>
Despite long discussions of the issue, no progress has been
achieved yet in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Former Premier Refuses to Be Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former prime minister
Mir Hussein Mousavi announced here today that he will not stand
for presidential elections scheduled for early August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA published the statement by
Mousavi, who is regarded as one of the reputable, clean and
popular personalities in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the 55-year-old former prime minister
appreciated some political groups and associations calling for
his nomination in the next presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Mousavi had served as the prime minister of Iran for eight
years from 1981 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989 when he stepped down discontentedly due to the
changes in the Constitution and elimination of the prime
minister's post, he has not taken part in any political
activities and has chosen seclusion.
</P>
<P>
After stepping down, he was appointed as an advisor by
President Rafsanjani, but he never attended cabinet sessions,
thus indirectly exhibiting his opposition to the program of
Rafsanjani's government.
</P>
<P>
On account of his opposition to the present government, the
relative welfare people enjoyed during his premiership, and the
fact that inflation was curbed, Mousavi enjoyed a great deal of
popularity among Moslem youths and committed intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that his refusal to the nomination for
the next year's presidential elections is mostly due to his
disharmony with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei when he was
prime minister while the latter was president.
</P>
<P>
Some well-informed sources said that the two men had many
differences and could not have a good term because they were
prone to dispute or quarrel in the public or in front of late
spiritual leader Ruhullah Mousavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that if Mousavi declared to run for
the presidential elections next year, he would have much chance
of winning the elections. But he is wise enough not to run the
elections, because otherwise he would run into trouble in his
relation with Iran's present No. 1 man Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
They said that Mousavi's refusal to nomination would give a
lot of chance to hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri, who has been selected as a nominee for the
presidential elections by the right camp called the Society of
Combatant Clergymen (SCC).

<HEADLINE> US Withdraws Nuclear Weapons From Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- American nuclear weapons have
been withdrawn from Britain, which signals the ending of their
35-year presence on Britain's soil, the British paper The Sunday
Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
The secure compound used to store the bombs at Royal Air Force
(RAF) Lakenheath, Suffolk -- the only place in Britain where US
nuclear weapons are kept -- was last night deserted and unguarded,
with its gates lying open, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from
Lakenheath," said Stephen Young, nuclear analyst for the British
American Security Information Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is a continuing sign of the decreasing role for nuclear
weapons in security," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon refused to comment on the claim. "It is not our
policy to discuss the presence or absence of nuclear weapons,"
said a spokeswoman for the US Air Force.
</P>
<P>
However, military observers here believe that politically, any
pullout would be more significant. Symbolically the withdrawal
could be taken as an ill omen for efforts to keep America engaged
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Goncalves, one of the experts said, "If this is true, it
closes a very significant chapter in the history of Anglo-American
relations. Britain's role as America's unsinkable aircraft carrier
could be coming to an end."
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, the US has been engaged in a
global strategic rethinking. "European-based nuclear weapons may
not have the same role to play in policing the Middle East as they
did in defending against the Soviet Union," said Malcolm Spaven, a
defense analyst.
</P>
<P>
"There is clearly less need for them now," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ogata Urges Fighters to Spare Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) today called on combatants in eastern Zaire to
stop attacking refugees and open humanitarian corridors for those
caught in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"I have received reports from UNHCR's field officers that our
worst fears are again upon us. Fighting has spread to the camps
in Goma region and refugees are on the move in the area," High
Commissioner Sadako Ogata said in a statement reaching Xinhua
here.
</P>
<P>
"What hurts me most are reports that women and children are
again caught in this terrible tragedy. The first refugees to
reach the hospital in Goma after the attacks this weekend were
36 women and children -- all of them suffering from shrapnel
wounds. There was one report of a woman giving birth along the
road to Goma," Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now facing a situation similar to what we had in July
1994 when the Rwandan refugees first arrived in Goma. What's
worse, relief workers now are at risk, making it more difficult
for us. A catastrophe greater than the one we knew in 1994 is
what worries me most.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to the combatants: please spare the refugees and
local populations. While I have stressed that UNHCR will continue
to help refugees wherever they are in Zaire, I also urge
officials in the region to open humanitarian corridors for the
civilians and the safe passage of the refugees wishing to return
home to Rwanda and we will do everything to help them."
</P>
<P>
After Zairian soldiers tried to dispel Banyamulenge rebels in
eastern Zaire earlier this week, fighting broke out in the area,
caughting refugees in between.
</P>
<P>
Banyamulenge rebels -- an ethnic Tutsi group which came to
Zaire from Rwanda in late 18th century -- were reported to have
beaten the Zairian army, and at least taken two towns.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Zaire has been a powder keg since the 1994 civil
war in Rwanda and genocide sent more than a million Hutus
afraid of reprisals for the slaughter into the region and
fueled local rivalries.
</P>
<P>
Kibumba camp, the second largest in Goma region, was hit by a
barrage of artillery and mortar fire between 9 p.m. Friday and 6
a.m. Saturday, forcing about 200,000 Rwandan refugees to flee.
Joining them was about 20,000 Zairians from a nearby village.
Kibumba is located 25 kms north of Goma.
</P>
<P>
More then 4,000 Rwandan refugees and Zairians were reported to
have entered Rwanda through Mutura, which faces Kibumba. And
about 20,000 of the Kibumba refugees have arrived in Mugunga and
Lac Vert camps in western Goma.
</P>
<P>
One mortar round hit Kibumba hospital, killing at least four
refugees and wounding another 100 during the attack on Kibumba.
</P>
<P>
In Katale camp, 35 kms north of Kibumba, an attack by armed
men Saturday night left one Zairian dead and three others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
With 202,000 refugees, Katale is the biggest camp in eastern
Zaire, home to one million of the 1.6 million Rwandan refugees in
the Great Lakes region. Goma alone has 715,000 Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is continuing in Uvira and Bukavu regions. In Bukavu,
a camp just north of the town was reported burning today.
Fighting in eastern Zaire has prevented refugees from moving
toward the Rwandan and Burundi borders, which are officially
close.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israel Prepared For Any Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today that Israel "is prepared for any
development regarding Syria," according to an Israel Radio
report.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a tour of the Israeli navy
facilities in Haifa in northern Israel, Netanyahu said that
Israel's objectives are defensive, but "it would not let itself
caught by surprise."
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at the a time when situations along the
borders between Israel and Syria have intensified in the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli media reported that Israeli airplane
scrambled to quickly confront suspicious Syrian aircraft
movements over the Golan Heights earlier this month, which did
not turned out to be real.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense sources said they are closely monitoring the
Syrians, amid growing reports that they are not just saber
rattling, but preparing a military option against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The three Syrian mechanized divisions permanently stationed
along the Golan Heights are reportedly to conduct annual
maneuvers this week.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Israel has not reinforced its troops along
the front in order not to have this misinterpreted by the
Syrians. But reports said the Israeli army has continued to stage
"exercise" on the Golan as a way of keeping forces on hand for
any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said today that Israel has proposed renewing
the peace negotiations between the two countries, and is still
waiting for an answer from the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the strategic Golan Heights from Syria during
the Six Day War in 1967, and the renewal of Jewish settlements on
the heights began immediately after the war.
</P>
<P>
On 14 December 1981, the Knesset (Israel's parliament) passed
The Golan Law, announcing "The law, jurisdiction, and
administration of the state shall apply to the Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
At previous peace negotiations, Syria demanded a total
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, but Netanyahu
government rejected the idea, arguing that talks should be held
without pre-conditions.

NRP President Chande Kapundu said whether NRP participates in

Kaunda, who is also the leader of Zambia's biggest opposition

that Kaunda would not be allowed by the constitution to contest

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Hebron Agreement Possible Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today it is possible to reach an
agreement on Hebron redeployment tonight if the Palestinians are
ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
State-run Israel Television quoted Netanyahu as making the
statement this afternoon after his meeting with U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross in Haifa during an inspection tour of the
Israeli Navy.
</P>
<P>
Ross told reporters that the wide gap between Israelis and
Palestinians has been further narrowed although some differences
remained. He indicated that a meeting between Netanyhau and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is needed to finalize a deal.
</P>
<P>
Ross would meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat late today in
a bid to overcome the remaining obstacles, just before Arafat is
departing for a week long European tour tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy also confirmed
that Netanyahu is interested in meeting with Arafat tonight.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with visiting Italian
counterpart Lamberto Dini, Levy blamed Palestinians for the delay
in reaching a deal on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Rebuffing the Palestinian claim that the two sides in talks are
still far apart on an agreement, Levy insisted that the talks
could be wrapped up immediately from Israel's point of view.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly I could not speak for the other side, I think
it is possible now to sign the agreement if there is also
the desire on the other side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said earlier today that the two sides
remained split on four issues related to security arrangements in
Hebron. The sticking point, they said, is Israel's insistence on
its right to conduct hot pursuit of suspected terrorists in
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Levy went on to criticize Arafat for calling for renewed
armed struggle against Israel in recent speeches, saying it
was totally contradictory to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Italian Foreign Minister Dini downplayed the
desire of European Union (EU) to take part in the peace process,
saying EU does not suggest sending an envoy to play a substantial
role in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU hopes Israel and its neighbors would continue
dialogue and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has already rejected the EU's direct intervention in
the peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Sell Large Amounts of Shares in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Investment
Authority, the only official body managing state investments,
declared today that it would sell 220 million of its shares in
the Securities Group early next month.
</P>
<P>
The assistant director of local investments, Walid Al-Shamlan,
 told the official Kuwait News Agency that an agreement was being
worked out with the largest commercial bank in the country, the
National Bank of Kuwait, to undertake the issue of the shares
valued at 47 million Kuwait dinars (155 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The shares planned to be sold by auction constitute 67
percent of the Group's capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the tender was part of the program of
privatization aimed at privatizing Kuwaiti governmental
contributions to local companies.
</P>
<P>
On October 13, the Authority sold 80 million stocks at 20.4
million dinars (67.3 million dollars) in a public auction for a
group of entrepreneurs. A share was sold for 0.28 dinar (0.92
dollar). The price for the forthcoming auction is proposed to be
at 0.215 dinar (0.71 dollar) per share.
</P>
<P>
So far, Kuwait has raised 1.7 billion U.S. dollars from a
privatization drive following the latest public auction of
shares. The privatization program started two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Criticizes Netanyahu's Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition parties
today criticized Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's decision to
lift the settlement freeze imposed by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing
Meretz Party, as calling the decision "another example of what
poor timing Netanyahu has in making decisions."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly approved the sale of 3,000 housing
units in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, effectively lifting the
settlement freeze imposed by the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported this morning that among the housing
units on offer are 700 apartments in Ariel in the Gaza Strip and
others in Karni Shmoron and Kiryat Arba in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's move was welcomed by Aharon Domb, newly elected
director-general of the Council of Jewish Community in Judea,
Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Domb said it is time to expand the Jewish settlements and
revoke the previous Labor government's ban on new constructions
for the settlements.
</P>
<P>
Domb, a leading advocate of settlement in the West Bank town
of Hebron, was the architect of the settlement council's active
campaign on behalf of Netanyahu during the May 29 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's decision came after a series of meetings with
settlement officials last week to hammer out details that would
enable the selling of the government-owned housing units.
</P>
<P>
The meetings took place a week after Netanyahu promised
settlement leaders that he personally would ensure that a freeze
on selling these homes would be reversed.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the Knesset (Israel's parliament) Finance
Committee approved a 57-million-shekel (some 18.5 million US
dollars) allocation to the Housing Ministry for completing the
infrastructure for the homes.
</P>
<P>
The construction of these units was initiated by the former
Likud government, led by Yitzhak Shamir, but after the Labor
government began its settlement freeze, these units stood empty,
with the government refusing to market them.
</P>
<P>
One settlement council official pointed out that it is clear
that Netanyahu's involvement in the issue is meant to
counterbalance any Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron.

WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Sunday telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging both for progress in
negotiations on the redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Clinton talked with each leader for about 10 minutes, White
House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the calls were "to encourage them to do everything
they can to address the remaining issues related to Oslo
implementation, specifically, security-related issues and the
withdrawal from Hebron."
</P>
<P>
No further details were available.
</P>
<P>
The series of negotiations that has led to an autonomous
Palestinian government in Gaza and most of the West Bank began
with secret meetings in Oslo between representatives of Israel's
previous Labor government and the Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had appeared close to agreement on an
arrangement. After winning election as prime minister in May,
Netanyahu said he must have better security arrangements for the
450 Jewish settlers before redeploying his forces.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Peres Say Peace Never Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
joined former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres today in saying
that no one can undermine the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Mideast peace process is not dead and will
continue. He made the remark while speaking to reporters
following his two-hour meeting with Peres in Egypt's Red Sea
resort Sharm al-Sheikh today.
</P>
<P>
The two men, partners in the peace process when Peres was in
office, met in the same resort in March when Peres took part in a
summit of some countries' leaders on securing peace and combating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The peace process requires activation as all the peoples of
the region need peace for the development of their resources,
said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Peres said he discussed with Mubarak the Middle
East peace process, but gave no details of the meeting. Mubarak
did not appear with Peres after the session.
</P>
<P>
Peres arrived in Egypt today on a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is not dead, and I don't believe anybody can kill it,"
Peres said. "It can be postponed, it can encounter some
difficulties, but I am sure this is the real future."
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the former government's efforts to push forward
the peace talks on the Palestinian and Syrian tracks, the Israeli
opposition Labour Party leader urged the sides to "sit to the
negotiating table to reach a compromise."
</P>
<P>
He said the Likud party "cannot remain in their own
ideology.... They have to move as well."
</P>
<P>
"Only now they're beginning to understand that if you want
peace for nothing, you have nothing," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that peace would eventually prevail, Peres said the
negotiations were like "an advanced pregnancy." When asked when
the baby would arrive, he replied, "Not in nine months."
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by the Arabic daily Al-Hayat,
Peres accused Israel's present government for slowing down the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"A tortoise cannot participate in a horse race.... You cannot
say you want to be a tortoise and ask others to be tortoises," he
said. "My criticism of the government is that it chose to move
slowly while all the rest are hurrying up."
</P>
<P>
Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is instrumental in making
a historic peace deal between Israel and Palestine, together with
his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated a year ago,
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Expects Huge Loans From Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon expects its donors to
finance a series of projects with a total cost of five billion
U.S. dollars at a conference to be held in December, according to
the Financial Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Sinyoura, Lebanese minister of state for financial
affairs, announced here today that a "Conference of Lebanon's
Friends," or those countries who have promised to financially
help Lebanon, will be held on December 16 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state-run Lebanese National News
Agency, the minister said that the conference will be "held on
the level of foreign ministers and presided by U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher."
</P>
<P>
He did not name the donors, but said the United States will
play an "important and basic role" and France has already
expressed its readiness to help.
</P>
<P>
The conference was called for last April after a ceasefire
understanding between Lebanon and Israel was reached under the
auspices of the United States and France to end the 16-day Israel
military operations in Lebanon which claimed over 160 lives of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official added that the conference's aim is "to
help Lebanon to overcome negative effects of the April Israeli
aggression, and also help it in the process of reconstruction and
building."
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon wants the financial aid in grants and in loans
of low interest.
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura noted that Lebanon will be represented in the
conference by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was in Brussels and Washington last month to meet
European Union representatives and President Bill Clinton on how
to activate the conference. They reached an agreement on the date
of the conference.

TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati held talks with Jalal Talabani, the leader of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), an Iraqi Kurdish group, here
this evening, according to an official report today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB)
said in the evening English service that the meeting is still
going on between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no report from the official news
agency of IRNA so far.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the talks between the two sides
would focus on the latest development in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The rival Kurdish factions -- the PUK and the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) -- are implementing a cease-fire in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi government and the KDP have repeatedly
accused the PUK of receiving military backing from Tehran to
fight against the Baghdad-backed KDP led by Massoud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran government has denied any involvement in the
internal affairs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said Wednesday that the region could not be
administered by a specific Kurdish group, and that U.S. efforts
to broker peace in northern Iraq were self-seeking.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there was no military solution to the
problem and that Iran is ready to mediate.

<HEADLINE> Nationalists Claim Responsibility For Corsica Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The banned Corsican National
Liberation Front (FLNC) today claimed responsibility for a series
of attacks over the last few days, including one this morning on
the home of the mayor of Bastia, Agence France Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
The separatist movement, which has been fighting the French
government for independence for the Mediterranean island, bombed
the Bastia mayor's office at around 02:30 GMT this morning. The
building was seriously damaged, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The violence is the latest in a series of attacks on police and
official targets by the Corsican nationalists on the island since
the government began to hunt down attackers who bombed the mayoral
office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe in Bordeaux early this month.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent escalation of the campaign over the last week,
attackers armed with automatic weapons fired at a gendarmerie, a
French paramilitary police station, Sunday night in Vescovato,
Upper Corsica.
</P>
<P>
A hotel in Aregno, Upper Corsica, was also damaged by gun fire
and a grenade explosion Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The latest incidents followed two other attacks last week on
paramilitary police targets on the island launched by the
nationalists with automatic weapons and a Russian-made rocket. Two
members of the gendarmerie were injured.
</P>
<P>
The national daily Le Figaro said that the situation in Corsica
is at its most critical point since the government and the
FLNC-Canal Historique stopped talks a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A tentative truce called by the FLNC last January effectively
broke down in July and was followed by a series of attacks on
mainland France and on the island.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the French government today categorically
denied allegations by the leader of FLNC-Canal Historique,
Francois Santoni, that Paris is secretly seeking talks with the
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily L'Est Republicain, Santoni, who
is wanted by the government for trafficking and carrying illegal
arms, said that the nationalists have had negotiations with the
envoys of Prime Minister Alain Juppe and Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre.
</P>
<P>
Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere of the Paris Investigation Court,
who is in charge of anti-terrorism, last Thursday ordered police
to launch a nationwide hunt for the attackers on the Bordeaux city
hall on October 5, for which FLNC-Canal Historique claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen people were detained in the police operation in
Corsica, Bordeaux and Marseille. Most were released after
questioning, but a man named Jean-Jacques Cantara is to be tried
for arms trafficking, setting up an illegal organization and
associating with criminals.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Dispersed in Pakistan's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand activists of
Pakistan's religious party Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), trying to stage a
sit-in, managed to get close to the parliament house here this
afternoon in defiance of a heavy police force.
</P>
<P>
However, within about 10 minutes, they were dispersed by heavy
tear gassing by police.
</P>
<P>
The JI called for a sit-in protest against inflation,
corruption and the government's wrong policies in front of the
parliament house on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But heavy deployment of police and rangers in and around the
capital by the government prevented the JI from carrying out its
plan and JI activists failed to enter Islamabad on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, JI leaders expressed their determination that they
would achieve their objective at any cost and had been trying to
stage the sit-in today.
</P>
<P>
When JI Secretary General Syed Manawar Hasan was trying to
address the gathering, the police unleashed a barrage of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Tear-gas smoke was seen rising from the sit-in ground and the
adjoining streets.
</P>
<P>
The protesters retreated and pelted police with stones and
bricks.
</P>
<P>
Several protesters fainted due to the heavy tear gassing and a
number of arrests were also reported.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports of disturbances in Islamabad's twin
city, Rawalpindi, by JI workers who in different groups, tried to
march toward Islamabad from different places. However, police used
tear gas to disperse the protesters.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of major casualties from anywhere, except
some minor injuries to some policemen and protesters.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeni Primakov arrived here today in the first leg of his
Middle East tour with a mission to help reactivate the regional
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement released on his arrival at the airport,
Primakov said his current visit to Syria is of great importance
in view of the vital political role played by Syria in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Russia, being a co-sponsor of this process, wishes to play a
more active role in it, he said.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Syrian officials would focus on the Middle East
peace process, as well as ways of boosting the friendly relations
between the two countries, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Informed Syrian sources revealed the Russian minister would
make new proposals during his current Mideast tour, but they did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned from a Russian diplomat here that Russia is
realistic enought to expect its foreign minister to come across
some difficulties in stimulating the stalled peace process during
his current Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
"Russia attaches realistic and mild hopes in connection with
the outcome of its foreign minister's current Mideast tour," the
Russian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's current tour will also take him to Lebanon, Egypt,
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule territories and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> ILO: Globalization Reshapes Textile, Clothing, Shoe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of jobs have been
created in developing Asian countries as the textile, clothing and
footwear industries have undergone significant change over the
past 25 years, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This trend, said the ILO in a report, has been accompanied
by a parallel shift in production from the formal sector to the
informal sector -- home work and small shops -- in many countries.
</P>
<P>
The ILO report noted that in the two decades from 1970 to 1990,
the number of workers employed in the textile, clothing and
footwear (TCF) industries increased by 597 percent in Malaysia;
385 percent in Sri Lanka; 334 percent in Indonesia; 271 percent in
the Philippines; and 137 percent in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, the number of TCF workers fell by 58
percent in Germany; 55 percent in Britain; 49 percent in France;
and 31 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 60 percent of world clothing exports are
manufactured in developing countries. Asia is the largest
supplier, producing more than 32 percent of the world's clothing
exports.
</P>
<P>
China, which in under 10 years has become the biggest world
producer and supplier of clothing, generated almost 13 percent of
world supplies in 1992. The US is the leading purchaser of
clothing, importing 24 percent of the world's supply.
</P>
<P>
In the textile industry, despite the tendency towards
relocation of production, industrialized countries still lead
worldwide production due to their great strides in modernizing
production processes.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Germany was still the main world exporter of textiles,
producing 12 percent of world exports in value. Italy was second,
producing 8.6 percent of world exports. Belgium, France, Japan and the
US were also in the list of 10 major world exporters of textiles.
</P>
<P>
The other top ten textile exporters were all from developing
Asia where emphasis is increasingly being placed on quality, rapid
response to growing demand and innovation in fibers and high
value-added textiles.
</P>
<P>
As for the shoe industry, production has shifted largely to
developing countries capable of producing large shares of the world's
supply at far lower cost, according to the ILO report.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, 63.2 percent of the world's shoes were produced in
Asia and the Middle East, even though these regions accounted for
only 43.5 percent of shoe consumption.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, North and Central America, which produced only 6.4
percent of the world's shoes, consumed 20.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The countries of Western Europe produced 11.7 percent and
consumed 18.2 percent of global shoe production.

<HEADLINE> EU, South Korea Sign Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the European
Union, despite their dispute over European access to South Korea's
telecoms market, signed a five-year trade agreement here today to
boost economic and political ties.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both sides will grant each other
most-favored nation trading status and promote commercial,
scientific and technology links.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, signing the pact on the fringes of the EU Foreign
Ministers Council in Luxembourg, were careful to skirt around
their row over the EU's access to South Korea's telecoms market.
</P>
<P>
The EU has accused Seoul of loading government telecoms
purchases in favor of local suppliers or suppliers from the United
States -- with which it has a preferential trade agreement -- and
freezing out European companies.
</P>
<P>
The EU claims Europe's telecoms businesses lose some 900
million U.S. dollars a year because of South Korea's telecoms
procurement policies and has threatened to take the matter to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The dispute had delayed the signing of the new trade agreement
but the two sides still struck the accord earlier this year after
the EU decided there was no prospect of getting the South Koreans
to back down on the issue.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is an important trading partner for the EU. In 1995
the country was the EU's tenth biggest export market.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Deal Possible in Near Future: US Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
expressed the belief today that the Israelis and Palestinians
will possibly reach a deal on Hebron redeployment "in the very
near future."
</P>
<P>
Ross returned home empty-handed today after four weeks of
intensified mediation aimed at brokering an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement on Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement issued today, Ross said that
"substantial progress" had been made in the talks, which resumed
early this month in the wake of the bloodshed late September.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past three weeks, we have made substantial progress
in these negotiations on the very difficult issues involved in
redeployment. Agreement has been reached on civil affairs issues
related to Hebron redeployment and the parties have narrowed the
gaps significantly on security issues," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the progress had demonstrated that the Israeli
and Palestinians had begun to rebuild trust and confidence in
each other and to resolve the key differences blocking the
implementation of the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the U.S. would "continue to play its active
facilitating role." He added that, in his absence,
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk and Consul General Edward
Abington would represent him in the talks.
</P>
<P>
He promised he would return to help complete the negotiations
after consultations with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and other officials.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to finalize a deal, Ross held separate
meetings Sunday night with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
However, no breakthrough was announced and Arafat is expected
to depart as schedule today for Oslo, Norway, on the first leg
of his week-long European tour.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will continue holding
talks this evening. But it is widely believed that, in the
absence of Arafat, it is impossible for the Israelis and
Palestinians to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference today, Netanyahu blamed the
Palestinians for the delay on signing the Hebron agreement. He
also denied the claim that Israel was trying to renegotiate the
signed agreement on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The failure of reaching an agreement in the U.S.-mediated
talks amounts to be a diplomatic setback for U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who is facing reelection in 10 days' time. On Sunday
night, Clinton personally intervened by telephoning Netanyahu
and Arafat to press them to finalize "immediately" the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
After three weeks of intensive negotiations, the two sides
settled differences on civilian matters in Hebron, but remain
split over some security-related matters, mainly Israel's demand
for conducting "hot pursuit" of suspected "terrorists" in
Palestinian-controlled area in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo accords, Israel should have
redeployed its troops in Hebron by March, but it froze the plan
after a wave of suicide bombings by Islamic extremists killed
more than 60 people in Israel.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Opposition Leaders Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Pakistani opposition
leaders, Ejaz ul Haq and Qazi Hussain Ahmed, who participated in
anti-government demonstrations, were arrested today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz Group) Ejaz
ul Haq, son of former Pakistani President Zia ul Haq and member of
the National Assembly, was arrested early this morning at his
residence in Islamabad's twin city, Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
He was later transferred to the Rawalpindi Central Jail, the
local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said chief of the religious party
Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Qazi Hussain Ahmed was also arrested, in
Islamabad at the residence of a party leader, who was apprehended
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The JI called for a sit-in demonstration in front of the
parliament house here on Sunday to protest against inflation,
corruption and the government's wrong policies.
</P>
<P>
However, the government foiled the attempt by deploying
thousands of police personnel in and around the capital, setting
up check points on all roads leading to Islamabad to prevent
protesters from entering the city.
</P>
<P>
Failing to bring people in front of the parliament house on
Sunday, Qazi said Sunday evening that the JI would carry out its
sit-in at all costs and it would fight until the dissolution of
the government.
</P>
<P>
JI activists were still trying to enter the capital today and
several thousand JI activists managed to get close to the
parliament house.
</P>
<P>
However, they were dispersed by tear gas fired by police.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of clashes between police and demonstrators
during the past two days while police used tear gas to disperse
protesters. However, no major casualties have been reported so
far.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed on June 24 when JI activists tried to
break through the police blockade and enter Islamabad to stage a
sit-in demonstration.

<HEADLINE> Session Told to Boost Sino-Portuguese Co-operation on Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yingfan, vice-minister of
foreign affairs, said today that China and Portugal need to
further increase co-operation to ensure the smooth transfer of
power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a meeting with members of Chinese and
Portuguese delegations who are in Beijing for the 27th Plenary
Session of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group scheduled to
open tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that, over the past few years, friendly ties between
the two countries have grown and "we are satisfied with bilateral
co-operation on the question of Macao and the work of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint liaison Group."
</P>
<P>
As there remains a little over three years in Macao's
transition period, Wang noted, "we are faced with arduous tasks,
and it is necessary for the two sides to further co-operation and
accelerate the pace of work so as to ensure Macao's stable
transition and smooth transfer of power."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Carlos, who is heading the Portuguese delegation,
said that maintaining a stable transition is in the common
interest of both sides, and that he hopes the session will achieve
specific results.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Reiterates Backing For Cattle Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today reiterated his total support for cattle farmers over their
demand for European Union (EU) compensation for losses caused by
the so-called mad cow crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with cattle farmer representatives this morning,
Chirac, who is widely regarded by French farmers as a close ally,
said he is determined to get extra aid from the EU for cattle
breeders.
</P>
<P>
EU agriculture ministers began meeting today in Luxembourg to
discuss a series of agricultural policies, including whether to
provide extra aid to EU farmers who suffered heavy losses in the
mad cow crisis which erupted in March this year, after the British
government admitted a possible link between the fatal cattle
disease BSE, or mad-cow disease, and a similar disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
"The president agreed with us on the need to obtain from
Luxembourg an agreement to provide cattle farmers with extra aid
which will allow them to have a decent income this year," said
Jean-Franois Hervieu, president of the Permanent Assembly of
Chambers of Agriculture in France.
</P>
<P>
The farmers staged a spectacular protest last week along
several highways in the Massif Central mountain range in central
France to express their anger over the EU policy that restricts
the sale of cattle and beef products to contain the spread of
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease was first reported in Britain and later widely
reported in France, Switzerland and several other EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The price of beef has nosedived by more than a third this year
in France, while most importers of French beef, such as Russia,
have banned shipments over fears of contaminated meat
entering their countries.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Involvement in Saudi Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today denied press
reports that two Kuwaitis were arrested by the Saudi police in
connection with the truck bomb blast in a U.S. military compound
in Khobar, Saudi Arabia last June.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti authorities have contacted the security
authorities in Saudi Arabia, which said no Kuwaitis have been
arrested in this regard," official Kuwait News Agency quoted an
Interior Ministry official as saying in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local media quoted western diplomats as saying that
the Saudi authorities arrested two Kuwaitis, three Saudis and a
Lebanese in August for allegedly carrying out the truck bombing
which killed 19 U.S. soldiers and wounding hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials have estimated the bomb at around
2,270 kilograms of explosives and believed that it must have been
the work of an international terrorist organization rather than
Saudi dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Four Saudi militants were beheaded in May for a car bombing
that killed five Americans and two Indians at a U.S. army
training center in Riyadh on November 13, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Both the June and November bombings were claimed by militant
groups demanding the departure of U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 U.S. and allied military personnel are currently
stationed in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the bombings, the U.S. military personnel in
Saudi Arabia have moved to more secure facilities in the
kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Indonesia to Further Develop Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said here today that his government will further
develop economic, trade, cultural and technical cooperation with
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after a 90-minute talk with
Indonesian President Soeharto, Kohl said they discussed 25 trade
contracts and memorandum of understanding (MOUs) worth about 1
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived in Indonesia last Saturday with a 125-member
delegation, said his visit mainly aimed to enhance economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Indonesia are due to sign joint-venture contracts
worth 1.05 billion marks (691 million dollars) during Kohl's
visit, said German Economic Minister Guenther Rexrodt who is
accompanying Kohl on the visit.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Indonesia's largest market in Europe with an
estimated two-way trade value of 4.46 billion dollars in 1995, an
increase of 75 percent over 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany's investment in Indonesia reached only 5.6
billion dollars by the first half of 1996, relatively lower
compared with those of the United States, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I am interested in the development of Indonesia's economy with
the increase of per capita income from 50 U.S. dollars in the
1960s to more than 1,000 U.S. dollars," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Germany also speaks highly of Indonesia's diplomatic policy and
its important role in Southeast Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders also exchanged views on
regional and international situations.
</P>
<P>
This is Kohl's second visit to Indonesia. He last visited
Indonesia in 1993 but has since then met with Soeharto on a number
of occasions outside Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is to leave for Manila Tuesday before going to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Science Project Wins UNESCO/COMENIUS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Education Ministry's
Curriculum Development Unit (CDU) was today awarded the
UNESCO/COMENIUS medal for outstanding achievements in the field
of educational research and innovation.
</P>
<P>
The medal was awarded to the CDU for its development of the
Zimbabwe Science Project (ZIMSCI), which showed that science
could be taught effectively by untrained mentors, using low cost
simple apparatus and a carefully programmed sequential study
guide.
</P>
<P>
The award is jointly sponsored by UNESCO and the Comenius
Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Edmund Garwe said the ZIMSCI program had
been created in response to the teaching and learning of science
in a developing Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said soon after independence in 1980, there had been an
explosion in the number of secondary school pupils from 17,000 to
some 80,000.
</P>
<P>
''ZIMSCI program was created to provide science education for
more pupils in a situation of limited manpower, infrastructure
and financial resources. Most schools had no electricity,
laboratories, gas and water supply and all these prompted the
creation of the program in 1981,'' said Garwe.
</P>
<P>
The program involved the provision of low cost apparatus in
the form of kits, models and books, as well as the development of
sustainable materials for both pupils and teachers. enditem

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Bottom of British Office League: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Office workers in Northern
Ireland are the worst paid in Britain and are likely to receive
only a fraction of the benefits employees elsewhere take for
granted, an earnings survey published today reveals.
</P>
<P>
Office employees in Northern Ireland are typically paid between
10 percent and 40 percent less than the national average, according
to the study by recruitment agency Select Appointments.
</P>
<P>
But the regional gap can be more dramatic. A legal secretary
employed in central London can expect to earn an average wage of
19,100 pounds (28,650 U.S dollars), whereas a counterpart in
Northern Ireland would pick up 8,l00 pounds (12,150 U.S dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that only 10 percent of companies in Northern
Ireland provide private health plans for staff, compared with a
national average of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only five percent of employees in Northern Ireland are provided
with life assurance, against a mainland expectation of 61
percent. Benefits such as a staff cafeterias, luncheon vouchers
and career breaks are also unknown in Northern Ireland, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than a third of companies in the province provide
occupational pensions, compared with a national average of close
to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Select Appointments adds: "Even when it comes to falling ill,
employees from Northern Ireland are allowed only l0 days' paid
sickness leave, compared to a national average of 33 days."
</P>
<P>
The survey shows, however, that the national average allowance
for sick leave has fallen by 14 days from 47 last year, which
Select Appointments interprets as "symptomatic of companies
attempting to reduce costs in all areas despite possible
sensitivities".
</P>
<P>
But the study shows that it is not only workers with poor
health and those employed in Northern Ireland who are under
pressure. Although women now make up about a half of the
workforce, fewer than two percent of all companies in Britain
provide child-care vouchers or creche nursery facilities.
</P>
<P>
Only one in l0 firms offers career breaks, and only one in five
offers fathers paternity leave. In Scotland and Northern Ireland,
the birth of a child is not seen as an excuse for men to take any
time off.

<HEADLINE> China's New Plans For Civil Service Exams (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, and Hainan, Shaanxi and Fujian provinces have led the
country in allowing people from other provinces to participate in
the local exams.
</P>
<P>
The work of choosing civil servants publicly is now in a
critical period, and could suffer serious setbacks if steps are
not taken to improve it, Liu said. "The general quality of the
exams must be improved, while the scale of exams must be expanded."
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the importance of improving the objectivity of
the interview system for those candidates who have passed written
exams.
</P>
<P>
"The contents of the interviews should be enriched, and a
special team of skilled interviewers should be formed, to make the
interviews more scientific and more objective," he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Many central government departments have decided to add
psychological profiles to their interviews soon, and a videotape
of standard interview procedure is being prepared by the personnel
ministry to guide local departments.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that his ministry will not only urge all provincial
governments to recruit civil servants through the public exam
system, but also to extend the practice to all cities, counties,
and even townships.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we will work for recruiting civil servants from
college graduates, retired army officers, and people from other
parts of the society, instead of holding several exams at
different times," he added.

WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Seeking to insure a strong turnout from a crucial voting
bloc, President Bill Clinton made a special appeal to women Sunday
by highlighting governments efforts to fight breast cancer and
telling a rally audience in Virginia that the election "is not
about party, it's about you."
</P>
<P>
-- For strategic reason, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton stopped
visiting Pennsylvania, historically one of the crucial cockpits of
national politics, and pulled television advertising off the air,
leaving the state with mere glimpses of the campaign.
</P>

struggling to end talks over Hebron before the Palestinian leader,

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

supporters of Perot.

<HEADLINE> China's New Plans For Civil Service Exams (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China is planning on selecting
all civil servants through an open exam process by the end of next
year, according to a senior Ministry of Personnel official.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jialin, director of the ministry's Examination and
Recruitment Department, said recently that public selection of
civil servants through exams is of utmost importance in
establishing a civil service system, and for China's personnel
system reforms.
</P>
<P>
China started working on a civil service system in 1993 to
improve the quality of government employees and to get a cleaner,
more efficient government.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's cabinet, issued a Temporal
Regulation on Civil Service System in late 1993, which stated that
all new civil servants in China were to be recruited by means of
public exams.
</P>
<P>
The central government has held public exams for three
consecutive years, by now, to find new employees, while 21
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the different speed and progress in government
restructuring, there are still a number of provincial governments
that have not started the work yet," Liu conceded. "But I believe
the end of 1997 will be the deadline."
</P>
<P>
He said the public exams, held by both central and local
governments, have drawn wide attention and have attracted many
people who wanted to become a government worker through open and
fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 72,000 people have taken part in
the exams, vying for fewer than 6,000 positions at all levels.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Missions Abroad Urged To Work for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's 33 missions abroad
should be made to work hard for increased economic, investment
and trade gains, Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addredssing army officers attending a command staff course at
the Zimbabwe Staff College, Mudenge said: ''Zimbabwe's foreign
policy is increasingly being shaped by economic considerations.
This explains President Robert Mugabe's directive that all
diplomatic missions abroad will have to justify their existence
on economic grounds.''
</P>
<P>
Although geo-political considerations will continue to be
important in citing tasks for the missions abroad, increasing
emphasis is being put on economic, investment and trade
interests, the foreign minsiter said.
</P>
<P>
In southern Africa, Zimbabwe will continue to foster the
building of associations which will bring not only economic
benefit, but also peace to the countries in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stress the need for Zimbabwe to cooperate with
South Africa in promoting peace, security and economic
development of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
''Such cooperation can be achieved through the removal of
inhibitive barriers such as tariffs and visas so as to facilitate
the realisation of a regional development community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets With Egyptian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met in Beijing
today with visiting Egyptian Minister of Supply and Internal Trade
Ahmed Goweili, who is in China as a guest of Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
Li said that there is great potential in Sino-Egyptian trade,
and good prospects for increasing bilateral economic and trade
co-operation based on equality and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Egypt was one of the earliest African countries
and Arab states to establish diplomatic relations with China, and
that since diplomatic ties were forged in 1956, the two countries
have had smooth co-operation in the fields of politics, economics,
trade, and culture.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that in the past few years, leaders of the two
countries have increased the exchange of visits, something that has
not only consolidated and strengthened bilateral friendship, but
also pushed bilateral economic and trade co-operation forward.
</P>
<P>
China and Egypt share similar views on many major international
issues, and the two countries have the common task of safeguarding
the interests of the developing countries, Li said, adding that
strengthening bilateral co-operation is in the interest of both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Goweili said the peoples of Egypt and China have traditional
friendship, and that the friendship and co-operation between the
two countries have developed smoothly over the past several
decades.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation, which has a vast potential, can be
expanded, and Egypt is a reliable partner for co-operation with
China, Goweili said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to File Lawsuit Against US over Uranium Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran intends to file a
lawsuit against the U.S. government for accusation that Tehran
stole part of uranium sold by Kazakhstan to the United States
in 1994, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Jumhuri Islami published a statement by the
Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), which categorically
denied the allegation and termed it as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
AEOI reiterated that it keeps the option of filing the
lawsuit at the international legal forums against the U.S.
government if it does not provide evidence.
</P>
<P>
However, a U.S. government official claimed in Washington
recently that the alleged missing part of an enriched uranium
consignment purchased by the United States from the Central
Asian Republic of Kazakhstan was the result of either
clandestine purchase or theft by the Iranian "outlaw" government
to use for the manufacture of its own nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
AEOI said in the statement that the United States purchased
the consignment "secretly" from Kazakhstan in 1994, and it
could provide the necessary raw materials for manufacturing 21
nuclear warheads.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Trying to Provide Relief for Farmers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- People's courts in China have
helped protect the rights and interests of farmers by handling
cases of excessive charges, a senior judge said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some administrative offices randomly collect illegal fees,
undermining the farmers' enthusiasm, affecting the relations
between officials and the public, and causing extreme
dissatisfaction among farmers, Luo Haocai, vice-president of the
Supreme People's Court, told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The courts have corrected illegal administrative actions in
strict accordance with the country's laws, regulations and
policies, Luo explained.
</P>
<P>
"In few places, their actions even resulted in conflicts
between officials and the public, and appeals to higher
authorities by groups of farmers," he noted, "causing not only
social instability, but also unfavorable results in the
fundamental status of agriculture."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has been emphasizing the
burden farmers have, and in December 1991, the State Council, the
country's highest governing body, promulgated a regulation in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The regulation explicitly specifies the purpose and control of
various fees that farmers should pay.
</P>
<P>
The State Council then issued a series of important documents
on relieving the burden on the farmers and protecting their rights
and interests, following which the Supreme People's Court issued
circulars that urge the people's courts at various levels to look
into lawsuits involving excessive fees charged to farmers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Try to Provide Relief for Farmers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Courts in east China's Shandong province handled more than
2,700 first-ruling lawsuits involving fees for farmers and
Jiangsu, also in east China, handled 174 first-ruling lawsuits
between January of 1995 and June of this year.
</P>
<P>
Courts in central China's Hunan Province have handled more than
2,600 such lawsuits since 1993, and courts in southwest China's
Sichuan provinces, 614, from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo, plaintiffs are usually a group of farmers,
with township or town governments the defendants. Because the
problems of excessive fees for farmers are often related to
grassroots political offices, the courts sometimes have to deal
with attempts by the accused to intervene illegally, Luo explained.
</P>
<P>
"However, the people's courts have handled the problem of
interference with the lawsuits in strict accordance with the law,"
he said, noting that illegal charges have been repealed and
corrected, or farmers have been compensated.
</P>
<P>
In handling these cases, the courts have helped to create a
better legal order in the country's rural areas, Luo told
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Trade Minister on Trade with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Minister of
Supply and Internal Trade Ahmed Goweili expressed the hope at a
press conference here today that China will transfer to Egypt more
technologies, particularly those of textiles, medicine and
leather processing, while strengthening two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Goweili and his party arrived here at the invitation of
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, to
attend the third session of the Sino-Egyptian Economic and Trade
Joint Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed the possibility of
setting up a Chinese industrial zone in the Suez free zone of
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Goweili said that the joint committee's recent session and the
first Egyptian Products Exhibition in China helped advance
bilateral relations to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are willing to enhance co-operation in all fields by
various means, he said, adding that China is an important trade
partner of Egypt, while Egypt is a major bridge for China's trade
with the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Also, the minister said he is optimistic about the prospect of
bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Quoting last year's two-way trade volume of 450 million US
dollars, he said that bilateral trade relations can move to a new
stage, in keeping with the good political relations between the
two nations.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Financial Hub Broadens Students' Horizon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph, together with a schoolmate, came to be the first two
Wharton students to study at the School of Business and Management
(SBM) in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under
a student exchange program signed last May.
</P>
<P>
Here he met 20 overseas students who, under a variety of
collegiate exchange agreements with SBM, were brought together
from leading business schools in North America, Europe and Asia.
They joined the 700-some third-year undergraduates at the SBM for
the fall semester, taking required courses, choosing selectives
and going through examinations.
</P>
<P>
Having been on the campus for two or three months, they, though
born and brought up against different backgrounds, shared the same
belief that the tour to Hong Kong broadens their horizon. The
less-than-six-month experience here might be of value to their
life-long business career.
</P>
<P>
Joseph, whose parents are Chinese immigrants to the United
States, speaks fluent Chinese but thinks and acts as a typical
American. He made the decision himself to come to Hong Kong and
his parents were very supportive.
</P>
<P>
"It's important for business school students to know the way of
people's thinking in this fastest growing region since global
companies are on the rise," said the 20-year-old student, who
hoped to seek opportunities for development in Asia in the future.
</P>
<P>
Christopher McHardy, a student from the University of British
Columbia in Canada, wants to have his career based in Vancouver,
where he comes from. He said that Vancouver is on the Pacific Rim,
a region predicted to register the fastest economic growth in the
21st century. He came to Hong Kong because it is the commercial
center in the Pacific Rim, where he could gain a perspective of
the neighboring economies.
</P>
<P>
In Vancouver, 30 percent of the population are Chinese, with
most from Hong Kong. "My girlfriend is Chinese," the 25-year-old
said. That's a strong reason to be here, where he could get a
better understanding of the people and the community.
</P>
<P>
For 24-year-old Christine Wei-yen Chan, a schoolmate of
Christopher, the journey to Hong Kong is an extension of her
Chinese connection. "I came to find my root," said Chan, who was
born in Hong Kong and went to Canada with her family at the age of
three.
</P>
<P>
Daniela Fahrenkrog from the University of Limburg, the
Netherlands, cherishes a different feeling towards Hong Kong. For
her, the city is a melting point between the West and the East.
She can easily adapt herself to the society as a Westerner while
opening an eye to the Eastern culture.
</P>
<P>
Though coming for various reasons, the exchange students are
all impressed with the vibrant city -- the high density of
population in such a small place, the skyscrapers along the
Victoria Harbor, the modernized Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the New
Airport under construction at Chek Lap Kok, the highly efficient
mass transport facilities and so on.
</P>
<P>
They also plan to go on a week-long tour of Beijing, Shanghai
and Guilin to take a look at China -- an old country and a
potentially huge market for business.
</P>
<P>
Living in Hong Kong, they also find many differences between
themselves and their Chinese classmates, who are shy, kind and
helpful. "They work extremely hard, and it seems to me that study
is the most important thing in their lives," said Daniela. In her
Dutch school, students have to work two days a week to support
themselves financially, while here students rely on their parents.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yuk-Shee Chan, Dean of the SBM, spoke highly of the
entrepreneurial spirit of the overseas students, who earn the
tuition by doing part-time jobs in Hong Kong. He said Chinese
students could learn quite a lot of strong points from their
overseas classmates, such as self-independent and entrepreneurial
spirit.
</P>
<P>
As an exchange, 32 SBM undergraduates have been selected this
year to go on one-semester studies in the partner schools in the
United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Singapore and
South Korea. Nineteen students went out and one came in last year,
when the international exchange program was initiated.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Chan, who earned his Ph.D. from the University of
California, Berkeley, said: "The key objective of the exchange
program is to help the students develop an international
perspective either in the scope of knowledge, or in the way of
tackling problems and handling relations with other people."
</P>
<P>
As the first dean of the fledgling BSM which was founded five
years ago, Prof. Chan aimed to create one of the leading business
schools in Asia. The student exchange program is an important part
to fulfill the target. He hoped that ten percent of final-year
undergraduates at the SBM, or 70-odd students, can go overseas for
academic exchange each year; and a roughly same number of overseas
students can come to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Now the SBM has 15 partner schools for undergraduate exchange
programs, and half a dozen agreements are expected to be ready by
the end of this year. He also hopes to develop the partnership
with a prestigious university on the mainland in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Schoolbags Damage Spines, Warns HK Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The increasingly heavy burden
 of schoolbags could be damaging the spines of schoolchildren,
Hong Kong's Education Department warned.
</P>
<P>
The department is calling on teachers and parents to take
action to reduce the weight of schoolbags by teaching children to
pack their rack-sacks and satchels properly.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Chee-hing, a principal curriculum officer of the
department, said Sunday: "The department is very concerned about
overweight schoolbags, in particular their possible harmful
effects on the formation of the spines of primary and junior
secondary students."
</P>
<P>
The department recently issued a set of updated guidelines that
 included discouraging children from taking toys, magazines and
other unnecessary items to schools, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Among the guidelines was a proposal that schools provide
students with such facilities as lockers to store books,
stationery and personal items.
</P>
<P>
The department is also urging teachers to design timetables
that avoid the need for children to take large numbers of
textbooks, workbooks or exercise books.

<HEADLINE> International Marine Conference Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 marine
biologists gathered here today to share their insights into the
research and conservation work in the South China Sea, which is
regarded as one of the most biologically diverse oceans in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Third International Conference on the Marine Biology of the
South China Sea opened here Monday, which is a venue for
scientists to extend their cooperation on the physical and
biological study on the body of water. The South China Sea, with
an area of some 2.25 million sq km, has a high research value for
its floristic and faunistic diversity.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizer, this year's meeting is more
focusing on the ecological conservation and protection of the Sea
compared with the two previous conferences -- one was held in Hong
Kong in 1990 and the other in Guangzhou in 1993.
</P>
<P>
One of the main themes addressed at the current conference is
coastal zone management and conservation of the biological
resources of the South China Sea, said Professor Brian Morton,
chairman of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
He listed a number of problems facing marine biology in the
South China Sea, such as rising coastal population, coastal
pollution, over-exploitation of resources, habitat loss and
general degradation of water.
</P>
<P>
In his view, marine biologists should shoulder their
responsibilities -- do research, teach people, act as independent
advisors to governments and promote the concepts of conservation
and protection.
</P>
<P>
"The future is in our hands, not in our children's," said the
chairman, who is a professor of marine ecology from the Swire
Institute of Marine Science under the University of Hong Kong. He
was also organizer of the first conference on the South China Sea
held in Hong Kong in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting drew participants from 13 countries and
regions, including Australia, the United States, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Thailand, and China and its Hong Kong and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Peace to Prevails in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister and
current opposition Labor Party chief Shimon Peres voiced his hope
that peace would prevail in the region despite all current
obstacles blocking it.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the TV program "Good
Morning, Egypt" broadcast today, Peres said "we should not lose
hope because we know very well no one could halt the peace march."
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need to implement the signed agreements
between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his vision of the future if Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu does not implement the signed agreements with
the Palestinian side, Peres said he believed that at the end
peace would prevail.
</P>
<P>
"No one in or outside the (Israeli) government would be able to
halt the peace drive," he added. The peace march might be delayed
but it is impossible to stop it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he conferred with French President Jacques
Chirac on the issue during his recent Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he told Chirac that Europe could play two
roles, namely, to support the Palestinian Authority (PA)
economically and to work with the United States for the
realization of peace and economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans have decided to invest seven billion U.S dollars
in the Middle East within the coming five years, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli former premier held talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in south
Sinai early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party leader, a Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, is instrumental in making the historic peace deal
between Israel and the PA, together with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Peres' Labor Party has already lent its support to a coalition
of the Jewish and Arab opposition parties whose sole policy is to
denounce Netanyahu and promote the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Inland Revenue Authority Collects 2.1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Inland
Revenue Authority announced today that it collected 2.1 billion
Birr (about 328 million Dollars) during the previous fiscal year
ending July 7, 1996.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the authority Beyene Bekele was quoted by a
report of the Ethiopian News Agency as saying that the amount
collected has doubled as compared with two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Beyene said the taxman's plan was to collect 1.7 billion Birr
(about 265 million Dollars) in revenue from sales, service,
income and other types of taxes, adding that a record amount of
revenue in the 26 years history of the authority was collected
because the interest of the business community in paying taxes
increased, thanks to the conducive economic environment the
government created.
</P>
<P>
However, the general manager said business firms, mainly
government development institutions, owe the authority over 934
million Birr (about 146 million Dollars) in arrears over the past
27 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, this year's target of the
inland revenue authority is 2.2 billion Birr (about 343 million
Dollars), 0.1 billion Birr (about 15 million Dollars) more than
that of the previous year. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Peace Envoy to Return Home Without Deal on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross is to return home today after the failure to press Israel
and Palestine to finalize a deal on Israeli troop redeployment
from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Ross will leave here after a four-week stay, during which he
was directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
which resumed early this month in the wake of the bloodshed late
September.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted him as saying the recent negotiations had
proved that a deal on Hebron redeployment was possible in the
near future. He indicated he would return if necessary.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to finalize a deal Sunday night, Ross
held separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
However, no breakthrough was yielded and Arafat is expected
to depart today as scheduled for Oslo, Norway, on a European tour.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
would continue holding talks this evening. But it is widely
believed here that, in the absence of Arafat, it is impossible for
Israel and the PA to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference today, Netanyahu blamed the
Palestinians for the delay in signing the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
He denied Palestinian claim that Israel was trying to
renegotiate the signed agreement on Hebron redeployment. He
described the number of remaining differences as "less than a
finger on a hand."
</P>
<P>
The failure to reach the agreement in the U.S.-mediated talks
is viewed as a diplomatic setback for U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who is facing reelection in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Clinton personally intervened by telephoning
Netanyahu and Arafat to press them to finalize "immediately "
the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Clinton's spokesman Michael McCurry said
Clinton made the phone calls to "encourage them to do everything
they can to address the remaining issues related to Oslo
implementation, especially the security-related issues and the
withdrawal from Hebron."
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said that Arafat was frustrated that he could
not translate the international support into forcing Israel to
make more concessions and decided to hold on to exert more
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
After three weeks of intensive negotiations, the Israelis and
 Palestinians have settled differences on civilian matters in
Hebron. But there were several remaining gaps on
security-related matters, mainly the issue of Israel's demand
for conducting hot pursuit of suspected terrorists in
Palestinian-controlled area in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have redeployed its
troops from Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli
occupation, by late March, but it froze the plan after a wave of
suicide bombings by Islamic extremists killed 58 people in the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli new Likud government, which took power in June, is
demanding making security changes to the Hebron redeployment in
order to protect about 450 Jewish settlers living among 200,000
Palestinians in the town.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Business Ethics Studied at Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A former minister of commerce
called on business people in the country to study traditional
Chinese business ethics in the effort to build up a new set of
socialist commercial ethics.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the guidance of Marxism, socialist commercial
ethics should also imbibe the best of traditional Chinese
morality," former minister of commerce Hu Ping told an
international conference on business ethics in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Business ethics in China was traditionally based on Confucian
tents and developed into a system which emphasized the importance
of sincerity and honesty--traits which are crucial in any modern
society, said Hu, who is honorary chairman of the Chinese
Commercial Economy Society.
</P>
<P>
In a speech entitled "Ethical Issues in China's Business
Practices Today," he also pointed out that good socialist business
ethics must be based on a commercial perspective which accurately
reflects the times.
</P>
<P>
"To improve our business ethics, we need to establish a set of
criteria by which to measure our business practices, and ensure
that those criteria are observed in everyday commercial life. To
do so, we should study the dialectical relationship between
morality and interests, competition and service, profit and
sacrifice, self-reliance and self-discipline, competition and
unity," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruisheng, director of the Philosophy Department of
Beijing's Capital Teachers University, noted however that
Confucian ethics, characterized by being strongly
anti-utilitarianism, is hardly adaptable in the contemporary market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the moral values China needs today should be
adapted to its social conditions, in line with the socialist
market economic system, while Confucian ethics and Western
commercial morals, not to be copied, can only serve as reference.

NEW DELHI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) opened its ministerial
conference here today for the enhancement of infrastructure
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind in India, is aimed at
improving the transport, communications and tourism services and
other infrastructure facilities in developing countries, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda in his opening speech today
said infrastructure such as transport, power and communications
plays a crucial role as a prime intermediate input in economic
development. It is well recognized that there is an increasing
need for overall infrastructure development to promote social and
economic well-being in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said India has embarked on a series of economic reforms and
it needs substantial investment in new and existing infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
In his greeting message, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said today that the challenge is not simply to
increase the number of infrastructure projects. It is to ensure
that those projects continue to maintain high levels of quality
and efficiency for the benefit of all the people of the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference will debate on issues pertaining to
infrastructure development in Asia and the Pacific. The conference
is expected to adopt a declaration on and launch an action plan
for infrastructure development in the region.

<HEADLINE> More HK People Marry Late, Study Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people are getting
married later than what it was 10 years ago, according to the
Demographic Trends on Hong Kong 1986-95 report.
</P>
<P>
The average age of local men marrying for the first time in
1995 was 30 - two years older than 1986 and the average age of a
first marriage for local women was 26.9 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Rose Wu Lo-sai, general secretary of the Women's Christian
Council, said the trend was a positive sign as it meant that women
 had become more independent and spent more time on personal
development. Contrary to traditional ideas, marriage was no
longer the main priority in women's life.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the desirable age for marriage used to be linked to the
 age of fertility. But giving birth was not a major consideration
for women in a marriage now, she said.
</P>
<P>
Women have also become more selective in choosing their males,
she said, warning that the conventional perception that the
husband has to be more successful than the wife may have driven
some local men to find wives overseas.
</P>
<P>
The median age for remarriage is 39.1 for men and 40 for women,
 the report shows. The average remarriage age for widowers is 53
and 40 for widows.
</P>
<P>
The number of male divorcees remarrying rose from 70 to 106 per
 1,000 between 1986 and 1995, and that for female divorcees from
77 to 86, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate in recent years has been 1.2 children per
women.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 112 men per 1,000 and 79.5 women died of old age (70
and above), according to the report.

BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian
met with Admiral Jean-Charles Lefebvre, chief of staff of the
French navy, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing this
afternoon and expressed pleasure with the continued growth in
Sino-French ties.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission and a State Councillor, said that he hopes that
friendly and co-operative relations between China and France and
their armed forces will develop further.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange of high-level visits indicates that leaders of
both sides attach great importance to relations between the two
great nations," he noted. As permanent members of the UN Security
Council, China and France are complementary in many areas and
closer co-operation between the two countries, two peoples, and
two armed forces is in the interest of both sides and is good for
peace and stability in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Chi outlined China's independent foreign policy of peace, its
national defense policy, and its reform and opening-up program.
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre said that this is his first visit to China, and that
its purpose is to strengthen the friendly bonds and co-operation
between France and China, and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said France and China have many things in common -- that
they have long histories and old civilizations and pursue an
independent foreign policy. "We have common objectives in
conducting co-operation," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Economy Coming Back on Fast Track  (by Xu Xingtang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bullish stock market,
decreasing unemployment rate, recovering property prices, sharp
increase of tourist arrivals and other economic indicators are
pointing to a rosy picture of Hong Kong as the date of its return
to China is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
With eight months away from the handover of Hong Kong on July
1, 1997, the so-called "unclear 1997 factors" seem to have been
blown away and the alarming tune of "Death of Hong Kong" whipped
up by a Western magazine can find very little audience in Hong
Kong itself.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll shows that more Hong Kong people than
ever before are feeling happy about next year's return to China,
while many foreign business leaders also say that they have
confidence to continue their business in HK after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy experienced a slump period since the second
 half of 1994, when the local stock and property market, retail
sales and other industries suffered major setbacks. But things
began to change at the beginning of this year and the trend has
been accelerating month by month.
</P>
<P>
On October 9, the Hong Kong Stock Market made a history with
the Hang Seng Index closed at 12,250 points, surpassing the former
 peak of 12,201 points recorded on January 4, 1996. The bullish
sentiment has been continuing since then and new records have been
 set in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the bullish market reflects the recovering of
 the economy in general and the improving confidence of foreign
funds. They predict that share prices will remain at the present
high level for a long time, and there are chances for the market
to try new highs in the coming trading days.
</P>
<P>
As one of the pillar industries in Hong Kong's economic system,
 the property market has also been performing well this
year. Official statistics show that in the first half of this year
there were a total of 67,600 property deals, an increase of some
34 percent over the same period last year, with the total value
rising almost 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Property prices were at the lowest level towards the end of
1995, falling some 30 percent from the peak in 1993. Active
trading this year has pushed property prices up 15 to 20 percent,
and further rise is expected due to increasing property demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Tourist Association, foreign
exchange income of Hong Kong's tourism will hit a record 85
billion HK dollars (10.89 billion US dollars) this year, compared
with last year's 75 billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in the first half of this year grew 15.8
percent to 6.44 million, while income rose 17.6 percent to 40.9
billion HK dollars (5.24 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
What's more encouraging is that the unemployment rate has been
decreasing for five consecutive months. In the third season it was
 only 2.6 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in the last season of
 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the inflation rate for this year is estimated at a
 low of 6.2 percent, compared with last year's 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
People in economic circles generally hold that the economy is
coming back on the right track and will reach the high tide in the
 second half of 1997 or in 1998. Hong Kong's return to China in
mid-1997 will be a turning point for Hong Kong both politically
and economically.
</P>
<P>
Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council, said: "Like Hong Kong, the Council is entering a new era
with confidence. Our mandate is clear, our sights are set, our
network across the world is primed. It will be business as usual
for both Hong Kong and the Council after 1997. Only busier."
</P>
<P>
John Wadsworth, Asian chief of US financial firm Morgan
Stanley, expressed his confidence in Hong Kong's future when he
said: "Underlying the assumptions that we used to determine the
scale of the opportunity for our firm in Asia in the next five
years was an assumption that Hong Kong would remain a vibrant,
efficient center for doing business in the region."
</P>
<P>
Presently preparations for the handover are progressing
smoothly, including the selection of the first Chief Executive of
the future Special Administration Region, large infrastructure
projects such as the new airport, the airport railways, the
extension of the Convention and Exhibition Center. All these make
local people believe that Hong Kong's future is going to be
brighter and brighter.

KAMPALA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 480,000 Ugandans had
succumbed to aids by the end of 1995, reported the local
newspaper the Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf Nsubuga, Coordinator of Uganda Aids Commission (UAC) was

However, he disclosed that Uganda, with the exception of South
Africa, is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with a reliable
national blood bank.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank located here in Kampala and established with
European Union funding, serves the country with the safest blood
(hiv-free) on the continent.
</P>
<P>
''Blood transfusion in Ugandan hospitals has the least

<HEADLINE> Euro 96 Soccer Stars Face Tax Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The British Inland Revenue has
launched a wide-spread investigation to see whether the European
soccer stars who appeared in the European soccer championships
this summer in England had paid enough tax on their appearance
money and their bonues.
</P>
<P>
Some top European soccer stars including German players Jurgen
Kingsmann, Oliver Bierhod and Christian Ziege are facing fines of
up to 21,000 pounds (33,000 U.S. dollars), according to local
press reports.
</P>
<P>
Other players, which are probably involved in the tax evasion,
include Czech stars Patrick Berger, Karel Porborsky and some
French footballers.
</P>
<P>
The Inland Revenue is concerned that withholding tax, which is
routinely levied upon foreign athletes such as golf and soccer
players competing in Britain, was not paid by the footballers as
they were paid directly by their football associations.
</P>
<P>
Local analyts say that the clampdown on tax evasion may affect
Britain's chances of being the venue for future championships, not
only in football but also in other sports such as rugby and
athletics.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Confident of Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
expressed confidence that it can still attain a peaceful
settlement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) despite
reported hostilities between government and MILF forces in Basilan
province.
</P>
<P>
"I am still very confident that we can come out with it,"
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Although a government-MILF meeting on a comprehensive ceasefire
agreement has been delayed, Torres expressed optimism over
negotiations with the MILF, the breakaway faction of the Moro
National Liberation Front which is now at peace with the
government.
</P>
<P>
He said his meeting with MILF leaders, originally scheduled for
last Friday, has been postponed as the MILF Central Committee
still has many points to clarify in the proposed agreement.
</P>
<P>
Torres did not elaborate on the issues under consideration by
the MILF.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting is reportedly to lay down the rules,
regulations and conditions of the ceasefire agreement that would
expand the coverage of an existing informal truce from limited
areas to the whole Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The military has intensified its offensive in Basilan province
in the south of the country against the MILF, which has defied an
ultimatum to cease hostilities in the area and threatened to
kidnap teachers and local officials.
</P>
<P>
The violence has displaced some 2,000 families in Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have reportedly killed at least 50 rebels and
overrun a main camp of the MILF in the week-long operation.

Lagos, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shooting Stars of Nigeria has
threatened to boycott the final match of the African Champions Cup
against Sfax of Tunisia, if the match is not held in its home in
Ibadan City, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Sole Administrator of the club, Taiwo Ogunjobi was quoted

the match to be played "at the capital or a distance of 200
kilometers to the capital".
</P>
<P>
The Shooting Stars beat Algeria's JSK 1-0 on Saturday to
qualify for the final of the Champions Cup, the first leg of which
is to be played in Nigeria on November 30.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Nigerian Football Association Abdulmuni
Amin had said after the Saturday match that the match will be held
in the National Stadium in Lagos, the former capital, as the new
capital Abuja has not got a stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Shooting Stars will face a fine of 5,000 U.S. dollars if
their boycott comes to true.

<HEADLINE> Australian Prime Minister Defends Foreign Aid Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today accused independent MP Pauline Hanson of promoting
short-sighted and mistaken policies as he rejected key planks of
her agenda: ending foreign aid and introducing national service
for the country's youth.
</P>
<P>
Howard said in the parliament that the present level of foreign
aid was right "both in terms of Australia's national interest and
also in terms of the humanitarian obligations this country has as
a relatively wealthy country."
</P>
<P>
It would be to follow a "shortsighted, mistaken view" to end
the 1.5 billion Australian dollar (1.2 billion U.S. dollars)
annual foreign aid program because some of it was wasted, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the national service, Howard said, "I have never
believed it is appropriate to use the armed forces of Australia
for purposes other than the defense of Australia or as an aid to
the civilian power."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's comments completed his rejection of the
key demands of Hanson. Earlier he ruled out her calls for an end
to immigration and aboriginal funding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Howard continues to face criticism for his refusal
to unequivocally repudiate Hanson's comments on immigration, with
some critics accusing him of not showing national leadership on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser warned on ABC
radio today that the race debate sparked by Hanson was very
serious and potentially damaging for Australia's standing in the
Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Surges Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended at
a four-year high against the Japanese yen today.
</P>
<P>
The issue of a large amount of dual currency "Samurai" bond by
Canada drove the Australian dollar to 90.23 yen, the highest close
level against the Japanese currency since September 1992. It was
up from Friday's close of 89.78 yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar strengthened on the back of a U.S. dollar
that was nearing 114 yen. The U.S. dollar closed at 113.80 yen
from 113.09 yen in Sydney market on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian dollar was weaker against the U.S. dollar,
ending at 79.29 U.S. cents from 79.42 cents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said demand for the Australian dollar by Japanese
investors had been growing since the beginning of the Japanese
fiscal year in September. They expected the Australian dollar to
continue to strengthen on the back of the U.S. dollar-yen cross
rate.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that helped push the Australian currency higher
was the expectation that the Reserve Bank of Australia was likely
to ease the monetary policy after its board meeting on November 5.

CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
closed slightly lower today.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index dipped by 1.1 points to 2,334.1 under

companies.
</P>
<P>
BHP fell by 25 cents to 16.85 Australian dollars, while CRA
lost 17 cents to 19.35 Australian dollars.

Local dealers said the fall in BHP and CRA, the top two mining
giants in Australia, was unexpected following a strong rally of
copper prices last week.
</P>
<P>
They said the major uncertainty in the local market was whether
the Reserve Bank of Australia would cut short-term interest rates
as many economists expected.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index eased 8.6 points to 1,356, while the
all industrials index gained 7.4 points to reach 3,812.3.

ISLAMABAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of activists of
Pakistan's Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party clashed with police today on
a road linking Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
About 50 JI activists gathered in Rawalpindi, the twin city of
Islamabad at noon and started marching towards the Parliament
House in the capital for a sit-in protest.
</P>
<P>
When police stopped them on the road leading to the capital,
the activists threw stones at the police.

The police fired rounds of tear gas shells and dispersed the
crowd later.

No casualties on both sides were reported .

<HEADLINE> More Bodies Found After Building Collapse, Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Rescue teams this morning pulled
out two more bodies from under the rubble of an ill-fated
12-storey building nearly 18 hours after it collapsed in
Heliopolis, northeastern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The corpses of a Jordanian national and his son have brought
to nine the number of bodies so far recovered after an overnight
search, a security source said.
</P>
<P>
Two others, a woman and a man, were pulled out after having
their legs amputated.
</P>
<P>
Altogether nine have been killed, 19 survivors helped out from
beneath the debris and 17 injured taken to hospital, since rescue
started Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, Commander-in-Chief of the
country's Armed Forces, today inspected the rescue work at the
site of the building that crumbled around 18:25 local time (16:25
GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers, who plodded against time overnight, are still working
to lift debris and rubble, as relatives of the victims fidgeting
in despair.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the search will continue, maybe for at least two days
until we find everybody," said a rescue worker, who had heard
cries for help from beneath the debris.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Health and Population told
Xinhua Sunday night that civilian defense forces and fire fighters
rushed to the scene within minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It (the search) is difficult and so far 17 people under the
debris have been pulled out," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The building, which located in a plush but over-crowded
residence quarter, had been reduced to a 10-meter-high dump of
concrete and bricks.
</P>
<P>
As cranes and bulldozers pushed and shoved around, relatives of
the victims watched painfully, but in vain.
</P>
<P>
A woman praying in tears, told Xinhua that her 19-year-old
sister was working in the building when it fell apart.
</P>
<P>
"How can they treat people like this? I don't dare to hope,"
she sobbed.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said the building accommodated two clinics, an
X-ray center, a tourist company, an electrical contracting
company and an electrical sets company.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, who strongly blamed shoddy building
materials and sloppy construction work for the tragedy, the last
such accident in Heliopolis took place in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A decision was reportedly taken in 1973 to demolish the shaky
building, but nothing ensued afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The standing operation chamber in Cairo governorate has
designated a housing committee to investigate the collapse, as
well as the casualties.

</P>
<P>
Director of the software division Amiram Shor said that the

to the performance of the Israeli economy, rose by 0.4 percent in
September, according to a report by the Bank of Israel.

<P>
The rise followed a similar-sized decrease in the previous
month, and the September figure is close to those in April and
July, thereby indicating a degree of stability in the economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
Among the factors forming the index, there was an 11.5 percent

<P>
BANGKOK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II
and her husband Prince Philip arrived here today for a five-day
state visit to Thailand at the invitation of King Bhumibol
Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit.
</P>
<P>
King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit greeted the British royal
couple at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The British royal guests were given a red-carpet welcome, one
of the grandest in many years in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, mostly students, carrying British and Thai
national flags, were at the airport to greet the British royals.
</P>
<P>
The visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of King Bhumibol
Adulyadej's ascension to the throne and will highlight the
continuing bonds between the two royal monarchies for nearly four
centuries.

<P>
All Thai newspapers today gave prominence to the royal visit.
</P>
<P>
King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit made a state visit to Britain
in 1960 and a private one in 1966. During the last 30 years,
members of the two royal families have often exchanged visits.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the two countries jumped considerably
during the last two decades and more, from 50 million pounds (80
million U.S dollars) in 1972 to 1.949 billion pounds (3.12 billion
dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
British direct investment in Thailand rose from three million
pounds (4.8 million dollars) in 1972 to 35 million pounds (56
million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes European Role in Mideast: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to Egypt Edward
Walker has said that the U.S. welcomes the participation of its
European partners in the quest of a settlement for the
"complicated problem" of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, this depends on the wish of the Palestinian and
Israeli sides, but not the United States, he said in a statement
carried by the English language Egyptian Gazette today.
</P>
<P>
Walker denied that Washington plans to cancel the
U.S. assistance to Egypt. He said the U.S. aid to Egypt is not
linked to a certain period of time but rather to the economic
growth achieved by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Walker made the statement after signing three agreements on
boosting health services in the country. The agreements added 24
million dollars to U.S support for Egypt's health programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat also expressed his optimism over the success
of the forthcoming Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference and the American investments in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 100 companies will attend the conference,
which will be held on November 12-14, and their representation
include 40 chairmen of the companies.
</P>
<P>
He added that there will be more delegates than there were in
the Casablanca and Amman conferences, respectively held in 1994
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies wish to invest in the region and expand existing
projects, said the U.S. diplomat, noting that next year will
witness an increase in the U.S. investments in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in Building Collapse in Cairo, Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Nine people have been found dead
and 17 injured so far due to a building collapse in a plush
district of the Greater Cairo Sunday, and the rescue operation for
more survivors is still underway.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 others, dead or alive, are believed to be still
buried under the debris of the collapsed building. Rescuers
plodded against time overnight and continued today to comb the
rubbles.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when a 12-story apartment building that
collapsed in Heliopolis, northeastern Cairo, Sunday afternoon. An
armed forces rescue unit rushed to the scene within 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency said that this morning the
rescue teams pulled two more bodies from under the rubble of the
ill-fated building. Minister of Defense and Military Production
field marshal Hussein Tantawi today inspected the rescue work at
the site of the collapsed building.
</P>
<P>
The building, which located in a plush but over-crowded
residence quarter, had been reduced to a ten-meter-high dump of
concrete and bricks when it crumbled at about 18:30 local time
(1630 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As cranes and bulldozers pushed and shoved around, relatives of
the victims watched painfully, but in vain.
</P>
<P>
Sherya, resigned and praying in tears, told Xinhua that her
19-year-old son was working in the building when it fell apart.
</P>
<P>
"How can they treat people like this? I don't dare to hope,"
she sobbed.
</P>
<P>
According to local residents said the building accommodated a
number of institutions, including two clinics, an X-ray center, a
tourist company and an electrical contracting company.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, who strongly blamed the tragedy for
shoddy building materials and sloppy construction work, the last
such accident in Heliopolis, a district largely populated by the
rich, took place in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A decision was reportedly taken in 1973 to demolish the shaky
building, but nothing ensued.

<HEADLINE> Pupils Link Home with School via Computer in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,200 teenagers at the
Mor-Metro West High School in Ra'anana, near Tel Aviv, are
pioneering in a program linking their homes to the classroom via
computer, thus giving access to data bases for background
information and material for absent pupils.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post reported that the program was launched
this week by Communication Minister Limor Livnat, Ra'anana Mayor
Ze'ev Bielski, and Yitzhak Kaul, director-general of Bezeq, the
state-owned communication company.
</P>
<P>
Ra'anana schools already have one of the highest
computerization levels in Israel, and the Mor-Metro West High
School also boasts the second-highest success rate in
matriculation exams.
</P>
<P>
Before the program was introduced, 75 percent of Mor-Metro
West's pupils had a computer at home, and the remainder bought
modem-equipped personal computers in a deal arranged by the
parents' committee.
</P>
<P>
Through the new program, pupils can log on to the school
computer at any time to obtain study materials, submit
homework, check data banks for information.
</P>
<P>
They can also obtain extra details on subjects that
interest them, take messages from school administration, and
query their teachers, and even order books from the school
library.
</P>
<P>
In the future, pupils and schools around Israel that adopt the
Mor-Metro West model will be able to communicate among
themselves, and those who are interested in certain lessons given
by a teacher from another school will be able to participate in
them via computer.
</P>
<P>
According to Bielski, all Ra'anana high schools should be
linked to the program before the end of this school year in July
1997. By the year 2000, all educational institutions in Israel are
expected to be connected in the framework of a national project.

<HEADLINE> Urban Belt Taking Shape in Coastal Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A 420,000-square-kilometer urban
belt which includes five cities has taken shape along the coast of
east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Located opposite Taiwan, the area covering the cities of
Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, Xiamen and Zhangzhou has changed from a
major military region into a thriving economic belt.
</P>
<P>
The belt, with a population of 19 million, has a long coastal
line and deep-water berths. It is also the ancestral home to
overseas Chinese and an important passage to southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the economy in the coastal region has
maintained a strong momentum. Last year, the Gross National
Product of the region reached 158.2 billion yuan (about 19 billion
US dollars), accounting for 70 percent of the province's
total. Development of the region has improved the status of the
province in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The industrial structure in the region has also greatly
improved. Raw materials processing, energy and capital-intensive
projects are uplifting the industry sector of the entire province.
</P>
<P>
According to the Fujian Academy of Social Sciences, the urban
level of the coastal region has reached 35 percent, above the
national average level, which stands between 15 and 20
percent. But in 1978, the urban level of the region fell below the
national average level.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that China's opening-up policy is one of the
major driving forces behind the creation of the urban economic
belt. An open, multi-level framework, including special economic
zones, coastal cities, economic and technological development
zones, Taiwanese-invested zones and bonded zones, has been set up
in the coastal region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, the coastal region had actually used four
billion US dollars of investment from Taiwan. The establishment of
foreign-backed or Taiwanese-invested firms has not only brought in
huge amounts of capital, state-of-the-art technology and
management experiences, but also promoted the development of
financing, information and other industries.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of township enterprises has also given a
shot in the arm to the formation of the urban belt. There are
presently more than 1,000 industrial parks for township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Development of large tracts of land since 1990 has further
promoted the growth of the belt, analysts said. By the end of last
year, these areas had attracted 150 projects with 12 billion yuan
of capital. The development has in turn spurred the economic
growth of many surrounding poor areas.
</P>
<P>
The belt has become one of the country's most promising
regions, showing vitality and development potential, analysts
noted.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the end of this century, the
urbanization of the population in Fujian's coastal region will
approach 45 percent.

maintained a strong momentum. Last year, the Gross National
Product of the region reached 158.2 billion yuan (about 19 billion
US dollars), accounting for 70 percent of the province's
total. Development of the region has improved the status of the
province in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The industrial structure in the region has also greatly
improved. Raw materials processing, energy and capital-intensive
projects are uplifting the industry sector of the entire province.
</P>
<P>
According to the Fujian Academy of Social Sciences, the urban
level of the coastal region has reached 35 percent, above the
national average level, which stands between 15 and 20
percent. But in 1978, the urban level of the region fell below the
national average level.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that China's opening-up policy is one of the
major driving forces behind the creation of the urban economic
belt. An open, multi-level framework, including special economic
zones, coastal cities, economic and technological development
zones, Taiwanese-invested zones and bonded zones, has been set up
in the coastal region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, the coastal region had actually used four
billion US dollars of investment from Taiwan. The establishment of
foreign-backed or Taiwanese-invested firms has not only brought in
huge amounts of capital, state-of-the-art technology and
management experiences, but also promoted the development of
financing, information and other industries.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of township enterprises has also given a
shot in the arm to the formation of the urban belt. There are
presently more than 1,000 industrial parks for township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Development of large tracts of land since 1990 has further
promoted the growth of the belt, analysts said. By the end of last
year, these areas had attracted 150 projects with 12 billion yuan
of capital. The development has in turn spurred the economic
growth of many surrounding poor areas.
</P>
<P>
The belt has become one of the country's most promising
regions, showing vitality and development potential, analysts
noted.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the end of this century, the
urbanization of the population in Fujian's coastal region will
approach 45 percent.

<HEADLINE> Air Route from Shanghai to Kuala Lumpur Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A China Southern Airlines
passenger plane took off today from the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport
and headed for Kuala Lumpur, launching Shanghai's first air route
to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the China Southern Airlines,
scheduled flights between Shanghai and Malaysia will be available
every Monday and Thursday, with Boeing 757-200 planes to be used
for the air service.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines, which has ranked first among domestic
airways for 12 straight years for transporting the most
passengers, now has a fleet of 100, including 60 different types
of Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines has so far opened more than 250
domestic and international air routes, including 29 overseas
routes and some chartered flights. Last year, it transported 11
million passengers.
</P>
<P>
The company opened its air route from Guangzhou to Kuala Lumpur
in October of 1989, which has played an important role in
promoting economic and cultural cooperation and exchanges between
China and southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
This route encouraged the company to launch the Shanghai-Kuala
Lumpur air route, which will play a positive role in promoting
cooperation between the two cities in economic, cultural and
tourism areas, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that his company, which will buy 10 more Airbus-320
passenger planes and two more Boeing-777 passenger planes next
year, will offer new air routes to Europe, America and Oceania
toward the end of this year and early next year.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Freeze Visas for Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
decided that it will not grant any more visas to foreign
workers, while 500 illegal workers will be deported every
month, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 15.33 million shekels (some five
million U.S. dollars) will be set aside to examine the
credentials of workers and, if necessary, expel them.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by a ministerial committee comprising
Finance Minister Dan Meridor, Labor and Social Affairs Minister
Eli Ishai, Interior Minister Eli Suissa and Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani. The committee was formed in August to
deal with the issue of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which envisions to cope with larger numbers,
made it clear that 500 monthly deportations will eventually
increase to 1,000, saying 500 is an interim figure, which will run
until April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also request the cabinet to give the
committee permanent status so they can discuss other wider
implications of foreign worker population, which is numbered at
200,000 at least.
</P>
<P>
Four teams will be set up to examine the nature of relations
between employers and foreign workers, taxation, the legislation
required to implement various proposals, such as punishments for
employers hiring illegal workers, and the arrangements
for deportation.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign workers has largely coincided with
the eight-month long closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which has barred tens of thousands of Palestinians from
returning to their jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian treasury officials are reportedly
negotiating on increasing the numbers of workers allowed into
Israel from the Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
However, only some 40,000 Palestinians currently have
permission to enter Israel for work.

<HEADLINE> Japan and U.S. to Resume Insurance Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States will
resume talks in San Francisco on November 15 and 16 in a bid to
break the impasse over the bilateral insurance dispute, the
Finance Ministry announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be attended by Eisuke Sakakibara, director
general of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, and Ira
Shapiro, senior counsel and negotiator at the Office of the U.S.
Trade Representative, it said.
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on U.S. allegations that Japan is about to
go back on a 1994 bilateral insurance accord by opening up the
so-called third sector of its insurance market before
substantially deregulating its life and nonlife insurance
businesses, which are dominated by domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
Japan, however, has said that if the dispute is not resolved by
the December 15 deadline, it will let the subsidiaries enter the
third sector. The U.S. has responded that it would impose
sanctions if that happens.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A SOCOG spokesman rejected the
suggestion by world soccer's governing body of several games be
played before the opening ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Blatter, FIFA general secretary, said in an issue of World
Soccer magazine that soccer matches scheduled in two weeks in
Atlantic Olympics were too much for both the health of the
athletes and the quality of football.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that football tournament to start before September
15, the formal opening of Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that FIFA had not officially raised the
suggestion to them. Both SOCOG and IOC were not in favour of any
events being staged prior to the opening ceremory.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Olympics, four matches were held as a FIFA
experiment, the day before the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka May Seek 40,000 Cusec of Water from India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Water Resources
Minister Abdur Razzak leaves for New Delhi today in a bid to
determine the principles of the Ganges water sharing and reach an
agreement before the next dry season commencing in January.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi side may ask for 35,000 to 40,000 cusec of
water during the leanest period in the formal official talks
between Abdur Razzak and his Indian counterpart Janeswar Misra,
reliable sources said.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka will also seek a guarantee clause in the proposed
water-sharing agreement to ensure 80 percent of available flow of
the common river during the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Razzak is also expected to meet some other senior Indian
officials to discuss the crucial issue, which is considered as a
major irritant in the relationship of the two closest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
If an understanding can be reached by the two sides,
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Indian Prime Minister
Deve Gowda may sign an accord sometime in December, Razzak
disclosed on the eve of his New Delhi trip.
</P>
<P>
"We are negotiating the quantum of water on the basis of 1975
and 1977 water sharing agreements with India," he said, adding
that the amount would be fixed somewhere between the two accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1975 water accord, Bangladesh received 44,000 cusec
while it received 34,500 cusec under the 1977 agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no agreement whatsoever on the Ganges
water for the dry season since 1989 while the ever decreasing
water flow has caused significant damage to the agriculture
production around the Ganges area in Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The 110-year-old Beijing
Tongren Hospital has opened treatment centers for cataracts and
near-vision in a move to expand its medical services related to
eye disease.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the hospital's Ophthalmology Department
has emphasized the importance of curing eye diseases that lead to
blindness.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the department performs 3,000 operations on cataract
patients, 700 glaucoma surgeries, and 1,500 operations for other
eye diseases.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 patients with poor vision are treated each year at
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Tongren Eye Bank, established in the hospital in 1990, has
helped 2,000 patients regain their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has, in cooperation with a Taiwan company,
established an eye disease treatment center mainly for overseas
patients. The center has received more than 20,000 patients from
over 50 countries and regions since it opened three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Deserts in Northwest China Retreat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The desertification in
northwest China has been slowed down following several years of
local efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to a national survey in 1995, the desert area in
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region decreased from 19,500 sq km several
years ago to 12,600 sq km.
</P>
<P>
The central and northern part of Ningxia is surrounded by
deserts, and about 42 percent of the region's land was desertified.
</P>
<P>
To improve the ecological environment, local authorities have
stepped up efforts to curb the deserts on the one hand and set up
multibiology protection areas on the other, according to Sun
Changchun, deputy director of the Regional Forestry Department.
</P>
<P>
Shapotou, on the brink of the Tengger Desert, was awarded the
title of "Globe 500" by the United Nations Environment Program for
having effectively put the desert under control through setting up
artificial grass nets and planting trees.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, three national and four regional nature
reserves have been set up throughout the region.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Produces 220,000 Tons of Fish Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's fresh water bodies
produce 220,000 tons of fish per year, worth 110 million U.S.
Dollars, said Wagonda Muguli, the Permanent Secreatry of the
Agricultural Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The export of fisheries' products contribute 50 million U.S.
Dollars to Uganda's economy annually and the country's 10 fish
processing plants have made the export possible, said the local
newspaper "New Vision" today quoting Muguli.
</P>
<P>
Muguli said that in 1994, six percent of Uganda's Gross
Domestic Product came from the fishing industry and 50 percent
protein the Ugandan people need came from fish. Sixty thousand
people are now employed in the fishing industry and 500,000
others indirectly involved in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda has 10 fish processing plants and
altogether 300 fish species are available in Uganda's fresh water
bodies which account for 17 percent of the country's territory of
241,139 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
However, Muguli warned that fishing malpractices including the
exploitation of immature fish, use of illegal fishing methods and
over-growing of water hyacinth could lead to the extinction of
some species.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop fish production in the country, the Uganda
Cooperative Fishing Union grouping 30 registered societies with
50 members each, planned to build 1,000 fish ponds in each of the
country's 39 districts.
</P>
<P>
Last week a three-day fisheries show and trade fair was held
here with a view to improving fishing methods and better
technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Toyota Motor Corp. will launch
its strategic ''Asia car'' targeted at middle-class Thai families
beginning January 31, and start exporting the car from Thailand to
Singapore and Brunei in mid-1997, Kyodo News Service quoted an
industrial paper as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The car is a four-door sedan with an engine displacement of
1500 cc, based on the Tercel model, the Nihon Kogyo Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said Toyota plans to start production of the car
in Malaysia and Indonesia on a knockdown basis, with main
components supplied from Thailand and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Asia car is likely to carry price tags of 360,000 to
370,000 baht (14,100 to 14,500 dollars), or around 20,000 baht
lower than those for Honda Motor Co.'s Asiacar EK, called City.
</P>
<P>
Toyota, Japan's biggest auto producer, has already begun
production of the Asia car at its Thai manufacturing subsidiary,
Toyota Motor Thailand Co., with a monthly output of 3,000 vehicles
at present, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Toyota's overall output capacity of motor vehicles, including
commercial vehicles, in Thailand is expected to reach 240,000 in
1998, according to the daily.

<HEADLINE> US Embassy in Kuwait Delays Memorial Dedication in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Kuwait
has delayed the dedication ceremony for a Desert Storm memorial
monument, which was scheduled for today, after receiving a new
terrorist threat against U.S. interests in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Embassy sources said the monument commemorating the 384
American soldiers who died during the 1991 Gulf War, was scheduled
to be unveiled at the U.S. embassy this evening. But the threat
prompted the decision to postpone the ceremony until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
The monument in remembrance of the American solders was planned
to be erected at a site near the Consular's office of the
U.S. embassy. The three-meter-high monument is made from
terra-cotta in the shape of a triangular column with an American
eagle on top of it.
</P>
<P>
The names of the 384 solders who died during Desert Storm
have been stamped along the sides of the column.
</P>
<P>
An embassy spokesperson confirmed a "report of a threat"
was received, but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
A bomb threat was called into Camp Doha Sunday morning. Several
thousand military personnel and a large quantity of heavy
equipment sufficient for a full brigade of mechanized troops are
currently based in the camp, situated in eastern Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The embassy, in a message, urged all American citizens here
to exercise particular caution over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
The message warned the Americans to be alert to surveillance
and overtly inquisitive persons or callers. They are also advised
to inspect their vehicles for signs of tampering and avoid any
action that may draw undue attention.
</P>
<P>
A source from the embassy said "bomb threats are normal
here."
</P>
<P>
The embassy received bomb threat against Americans and
properties in Kuwait in the wake of the truck bomb blast
in Saudi Arabia killing 19 Americans in June. Since then,
calls of threat were frequently received by the embassy,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest Gulf crisis when the U.S. armed forces
launched missile attacks against Iraqi targets, the U.S. sent
eight F-117 stealth fighter planes and 3000 troops to Kuwait and
carried out a series of live ammunition training exercises
code-named "Intrinsic Action" near the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
A new joint military exercise between the American and Kuwait
armies is scheduled to begin today very near to the Iraqi border,
according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Uganda Strive to Beat Import Evaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan and Ugandan revenue
authorities are working out anti-dumping and anti-evasion
procedures to increase revenue collection from imports, the
East African newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the procedures, the paper said, importers would no
longer be allowed to store transit and duty-paid goods in the
same warehouses.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles carrying transit goods would also be required to
be covered to make them sealable by the Customs, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ugandan
Ministry of Trade and Industry S. Kagoda as saying that his
government later this year would introduce a system to monitor
goods destined for Uganda and other neighboring countries from
Kenya's Mombasa port.
</P>
<P>
The system was expected to start operating within two months#,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan official noted that the current system was prone
to abuse because unscrupulous importers who declared in Mombasa
that their consignments were destined for Zaire or Rwanda often
offloaded their goods in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Customs officers are expected to set up offices at the
Mombasa and Dar es Salaam ports to collect revenue due on goods
for Uganda.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the revenue authorities from Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania would meet in Mombasa next January to discuss
information exchange, maintenance of transit goods,
harmonization of taxes and tariffs and collection of import
duties.

TOKYO, October 28 (Xinhua ) -- Japan's domestic wholesale
prices in the mid-October period remained unchanged from the
preceding 10 days, despite marginal rises in export and import
wholesale prices, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Monday.

down 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic prices were unchanged due to price declines in farm
products such as eggs which absorbed rises in lumber and wood
products, it said.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Faction in Iraq Welcomes Iran's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- One of Iraq's two rival Kurdish
factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), has announced
that it welcomed Iran's mediation to bring an end to the
confrontation between two Kurdish factions in northern Iraq, it
was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
here Sunday night, PUK leader Jalal Talabani said his party had
full trust in Iran as a country which has always tried to help
establish peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
On a proposal made by the Turkish government on Tehran-Ankara
joint mediation efforts to resolve the Kurdish crisis in northern
Iraq, Talabani thanked Iran for having accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Iran-backed
PUK leader also praised the humanitarian assistance of the
Islamic country to the Iraqi Kurdish refugees.
</P>
<P>
Velayati stressed the need to end hostilities in northern
Iraq and find a peaceful solution to the problem. He also
expressed content that the leaders of the two groups had agreed
on a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he voiced Iran's readiness to continue talks until
the establishment of peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The rival Kurdish factions, the PUK and the Iraq-supported
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) have reportedly accepted a
U.S.-brokered cease-fire in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi government and the KDP have time and again
accused the PUK of receiving military backing from Tehran against
the Baghdad-backed KDP, which is headed by Massoud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes between the two rival groups erupted when
the KDP took over northern Iraq in a move which triggered
U.S. military strikes against Iraqi defense targets in early
September.

<HEADLINE> Search for Survivors in Building Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers plodded against time
overnight, and continued today to comb the rubbles for more
surviors buried under a 12-story apartment building that
collapsed in northeastern Cairo Sunday afternoon, as relatives of
the victims fidget in despair.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Health and Population(CHECK PLEASE) told
Xinhua reporter Sunday night that an armed forces rescue unit
rushed to the scene within 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It (the search) is difficult and so far three bodies and 17
people under the debris have been pulled out," said the official,
adding that the injured were sent to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The building, which located in a plush but over-crowded
residence quarter in Helipolis, had been reduced to a
ten-meter-high dump of concrete and bricks when it crumbled at
about 18:30 local time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the search will continue, maybe for at least two
days until we find everybody," said a rescue worker, adding that
he had heard cries for help from beneath the debris.
</P>
<P>
As the cranes and bulldozers pushed and shoved around,
relatives of the victims watched in pain and, in vain.
</P>
<P>
Sherya, resigned and praying in tears, told Xinhua that her
19-year-old son was working in the building when it fell apart.
</P>
<P>
"How can they treat people like this? I don't dare to hope,"
she sobbed.
</P>
<P>
A security source estimated there were from 60 to 80 people in
the building when it collapsed, according to the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said the building accommodated two clinics, an
X-ray center, a tourist company, an electrical contracting
company and another for electrical sets.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, who strongly blamed the tragedy for
shoddy building materials and sloppy construction work, the last
such accident in Helipolis took place in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A decision was reportedly taken in 1973 to demolish the fallen
building, but nothing ensued.
</P>
<P>
The standing operation chamber in Cairo governorate has
designated a housing committee to investigate the collapse, as
well as the casualties.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and several other
cabinet members expressed their sorry to the public for what had
happened.

scarce farmlands.
</P>
<P>
According to collected data, the coal ash storing grounds of
six power plants in Hebei alone have 23 million tons of powder
coal ash, occupying an area of 640 hectares.
</P>
<P>
To find a solution to the problem, experts in Hebei began to
eye the several expressways now under constrution. Could powder coal
ash be used to build road base for expressways? Experiments said
it's OK.
</P>
<P>
As a result, use of coal ash in building of the Hebei sections
of the two expressways become China's biggest project for
comprehensive use of powder coal ash, and close to 10
million tons of coal ash was buried underground.
</P>
<P>
The project has saved the precious farmlands: by getting less
soil from neighboring farming fields to build the road, and
reducing the acreage of the storing grounds of several power
plants. It also helped save expenses for the plants, which used to
pay local farmers to get the ash away.
</P>
<P>
Although replacing earth with coal ash increases the cost of
road building, it is undoubtedly of essential and long-term
benefit by its unmeasurable contribution to environmental
protection and preservation of farmlands.
</P>
<P>
Road builders plan to use powder coal ash in the building of
several other expressways, such as the one linking up Shijiazhuang
with Anyang in Henan province to its south, and another connecting
Tianjin, the north China port city, with Tangshan in Hebei.

BANGKOK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of chicken
meat next year are forecast to total 178,000 tons, an increase of
9.2 percent over this year's target of 163,000 tons, according to
the Thai Broiler Processing Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
The favorable outlook is attributed mainly to an increase in
imports by European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Concern about the Mad Cow disease in Europe has contributed to
a five percent increase in poultry consumption, according to a
Thai commercial office report from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's chicken exports to the EU next year are forecast at
20,000 tons, compared with the projected 18,000 tons for this
year.
</P>
<P>
To the Japanese market, Thailand is expected to export 95,000
tons next year, slightly up from the projected 93,000 tons for
this year, but far below the average level of 120,000 tons between
1990-1993.

Thai products have become less competitive than its competitors

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Production Declines As Many Lack Food: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The growth of agricultural
production across the world is slowing as people who have means to
buy food don't need more but those who need more cannot afford it,
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of world agricultural production was 3
percent in the 1960s, 2.3 percent in the 1970s, 2 percent in
1980-92, 1.8 percent at present and will continue to drop in the
period to the year 2000, a FAO report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Food, Agriculture and Food
Security: Developments Since the World Food Conference and
Prospects," was one of the 14 technical background documents
prepared for the World Food Summit to be held at the FAO
headquarters in Rome on November 13-17.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from nearly 200 countries are expected to
attend the summit to review their commitment to the goal of
universal food security and agree on an action plan that will
involve civil society and the private sector as well as
international and non-governmental organizations in a concerted
effort to end hunger and malnutrition throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The document, which reviews world agriculture and food security
situation from the early 1960s to the present with particular
reference to the period since the World Food Conference in 1974,
attributed the slowing growth rate of agricultural production to
the decline in effective demand for more food.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the decline in the growth rate of world
population and the fact that more and more countries have been
raising their per capita food consumption to levels where there is
limited scope for further increases.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO, most developed countries accounted for
some 50 percent of the world consumption of agricultural products,
and more and more developing countries are joining the force.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact, the report said that "a significant part of
the world population" remains undernourished because of inadequate
access to food.
</P>
<P>
Unless the world acts now to promote poverty-reducing growth
and sustainable agricultural development, the report warned, "many
of the food security problems of today will persist and some will
become worse."
</P>
<P>
The FAO report predicted that land in crop production in
developing countries, excluding China, may expand from the 760
million hectares in 1988-90 to 850 million hectares in 2010 - an
increase of 90 million hectares or about 5 percent of the world's
1.8 billion hectares of uncultivated land with cropping potential.
</P>
<P>
But the report said the harvested area could actually increase
by 124 million hectares through more intensive cropping and
shorter fallow periods, and higher yields are expected.

<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- For years, China's National
Library in Beijing has maintained its position as the fifth
largest in the world in terms of its annual acquisition of new
books.
</P>
<P>
The library, which takes in 600,000 to 700,000 volumes a year,
has increased its collection by over one million volumes in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
This means the capital's famous library, which opened in 1986,
has crammed a staggering 19.6 million books onto its shelves.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Chen Junqi, based in the library's general office,
said that the Chinese government has increased funds for the new
titles, from 10.6 million yuan in 1986 to 70 million yuan this
year.
</P>
<P>
The National Library ranks first in China in its collection of
books and materials in foreign languages, and annually spends a
large percentage of its budget to buy these books.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, it has purchased 26,000 foreign-printed books and
6,379 foreign periodicals.
</P>
<P>
For the past eight years, the library has held onto the honor
as the fifth largest internationally, and the largest in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Water Beautifies Teeth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- These days, people in Dezhou
City, in east China's Shandong Province, call the water of the
Yellow River the "water of beauty."
</P>
<P>
But just a decade ago, young women in the region were shy about
opening their mouths for fear of showing their yellow teeth, a
condition caused by the high content of fluorine minerals in the
local underground water -- the only source of water for people
there.
</P>
<P>
The poor water quality had an adverse effect on many of the
city's 220,000 citizens: many people suffered from broken bones,
and 80 percent of the local people were showing signs of yellowing
teeth.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Dezhou began to divert water from the Yellow River,
some 100 km away. Six years later, 90 percent of the city was free
of the bitter underground water.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River presently provides 90,000 cubic meters of
water to the city daily. A 50-million-cubic-meter reservoir has
also been built to hold water to offset springtime droughts in the
Yellow River region.
</P>
<P>
Now the soft water of the Yellow River, with its low salt
content and rich abundant organic matter, is suitable for drinking.
</P>
<P>
Local healthcare officials said that thanks to the improved
water, a new generation of Dezhou people will now have white
teeth.

<P>
SOFIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- No candidate had won an absolute
majority in the first round of Bulgaria's presidential election
held today, unofficial statistical results showed.
</P>
<P>
Petar Stoianov, candidate of the United Democratic Force, had

needs to win outright, the unofficial results released tonight by
some polling groups.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government candidate, Ivan Marazov, had 27
percent or so, with Zhorzh Ganchev, Chairman of the Bulgarian
Business Block, just a percentage point or two behind, according
to the results.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bulgarian Constitution, the two leading candidates in
the first round will fight it out in next weekend's run-off.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Province to Build First Local Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province is planning to build its first locally-operated railway
to accelerate exploration of its rich mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The railway, from the city of Liupanshui to Baiguo, will link
two major railway lines in southwest China, the Guiyang-Kunming
Railway and the unfinished Nanning-Kunming Line.
</P>
<P>
The 121-kilometer Liupanshui-Baiguo Railway will be built at a
total cost of 2.82 billion yuan (about 340 million US dollars). It
is designed to transport 18 million tons of goods annually.
</P>
<P>
Liupanshui, together with the city of Panzhihua in Sichuan
Province on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, is one of the
most resource-rich areas in China. Coal reserves in Liupanshui and
its nearby areas exceed 50 billion tons, equal to the total coal
reserves in the nine provinces south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the construction of the Liupanshui-Baiguo Railway
will boost the exploration of coal resources in Guizhou Province,
and further improve the railway transportation capacity in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The new line will be built jointly by Guizhou Province, the
Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of the Coal
Industry. Construction will begin later this year and is expected
to be completed in three years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Guizhou Shuibai Railway Co. Ltd, with a
registered capital of 725 million yuan, has been established. It
is responsible for raising funds, and the construction and
operation of the railway. It also plans to introduce 100 million
US dollars in foreign funds for building purposes.
</P>
<P>
Construction of railways was formerly monopolized by the
state. In order to accelerate the pace of such development, the
Chinese government has formulated a series of policies to
encourage the local governments and some other departments to
build railways jointly with the Ministry of Railways. Introduction
of foreign funds is also being encouraged, local officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Ruling Coalition Wins Municipal Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo
Frei's coalition won municipal elections by a wide margin on
Sunday, but an opposition alliance made major gains, early results
showed.
</P>
<P>
With 54 percent of the ballots counted, the four parties in the
governing coalition known as the Concertacion won 56 percent of
the vote, while the Union for Chile gained 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The results, announced by Deputy Interior Secretary Belisario
Velasco on live television, showed that Frei's Christian
Democratic Party won 25 percent of the vote, falling short of
expectations and down sharply from the 29 percent it won in
Chile's last municipal elections in 1992.
</P>
<P>
But its three coalition partners, including the Party for
Democracy and the Socialists, all raised their shares.
</P>
<P>
The Union for Chile, made up of two pro-business parties,
significantly raised its support in major cities like La Serena
and Vina del Mar and many large Santiago suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance won 28 percent of the vote in the last
municipal polls in 1992 and opinion polls had predicted it would
win only about 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's poll was the first direct election of mayors and
councillors in Chile's 341 cities and towns. Until now the mayors
had been chosen by the councillors.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Starts to Be Contained in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The environment of the Czech
Republic from 1992 to 1995 has markedly improved, with the
discharge of fumes decreasing by one third and of waste water by
13 percent, a report on the country's environment showed.
</P>
<P>
Long-time neglect of environmental protection has caused
serious pollution of the air and water in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years, the Czech authorities adopted a
series of measures to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the country established the Ministry of Environmental
Protection and passed 14 laws and regulations on environmental
conservation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government allocated more funds in the
environmental protection work.
</P>
<P>
The funds rate in the gross domestic production (GDP) rose from
0.69 percent in 1989 to 1.9 percent in 1992. It jumped to 2.7
percent in 1995, higher than most of European countries.
</P>
<P>
Facilities of environmental protection were mushrooming in the
country. More than 80 big stations of waste water purification
have been newly built nationwide.
</P>
<P>
This kind of facilities are also to be built in small cities
and towns with more than 10,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers in Tianjin Provide Community Service (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is why the principle has been accepted by most residents,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yunkang, director of the Sociology Institute of the Tianjin
Municipal Academy of Social Sciences, said: "On one hand, the
development of community service and the emergence of community
volunteers can alleviate the inconvenience caused by the
underdevelopment of the service sector."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he added, they can help promote
interpersonal exchanges and the sharing of ideas between the
Chinese people who are experiencing great changes resulting from
the modernization drive and effort to establish a market economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
"I think the co-existence of voluntary service and mutual
assistance in Heping District reflects the reality of
interpersonal exchanges under the condition of a market economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He believes that selfless community service should be
encouraged, but mutual help and benefit should become the
principal part of interpersonal relationships under the condition
of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"I think that is why so many people in Heping District have
become involved in community service," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that under a planned economic system, Chinese depended
on their employers or government departments for everything.
</P>
<P>
But with the increase in the reform, different needs of the
Chinese are met by different sectors of society, and the emergence
of community service will help improve Chinese people's social
security and quality of life, he added.

<HEADLINE> WFP Prepositions Food Supplies in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
begun prepositioning food supplies inside Rwanda along the border
with Zaire as thousands of refugees crossed into the country.
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the Rome-headquartered WFP reported that on
Sunday in the town of Gisenyi, about 4,500 people crossed over
from Goma, Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that 3,000 of them are Zairians and the rest
Rwandan refugees who fled to Zaire in 1994. Nine of the Zairian
refugees were wounded, five seriously.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if this sudden spurt of returnees will turn into
a growing trend," said WFP spokesman Trevor Rowe. "But we don't
want to be caught napping if it turns into a flood."
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 others are estimated to have massed on the
Goma side of the border where fighting continues north of the
town. In Cyangugu, across the river from the Zairian town of
Bukavu, an estimated 250 to 500 people have crossed into Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has already prepositioned 7,000 two-month rations in
Gisenyi and 10,000 rations in Cyangugu. It plans to immediately
preposition an additional 63,000 rations in the Rwandan capital
Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Overall, WFP estimates it has enough food in the region to feed
the over 1.2 million refugees in eastern Zaire as well as the
60,000 refugees in Tanzania for the next three months.

<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A 3.8-square-kilometer
fossilized forest has been discovered in a Junggar Basin gobi
desert in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists and archaeologists hold that it is the
world's second-largest fossilized forest; the largest is in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Geologists said that the area took shape some 150 million years
ago, when metasequoia glyptostrobides, ginkgos, birch and other
trees in a primeval forest were buried underground, and gradually
became hardened by groundwater that contained silicon elements.
</P>
<P>
The silicified forest emerged from underground the Junggar
Basin thousands and thousands years later, due to erosion caused
by wind and rains, they said.

<P>
CHANGSHA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Shu Songhua, a retired teacher
at his seventies in a small town in Xiangxiang City of central
China's Hunan Province, has walked 100,000 kilometers and sent
nearly 100 tons of various books to local farmers for the past 13

</P>
<P>
His mobile library has attracted a readership of more than
200,000 people.

cultural center, in charge of a total 500 copies of books.
</P>
<P>
Every day, he walks over 30 kilometers to send a load of 20
kilograms of the books to farmers in the nearby villages
</P>
<P>
In order to increase books for his library, he has spent a
total of more than 5,000 yuan and bought another 500 new books
over the past years. Farmers was deeply impressed by Shu's actions

<HEADLINE> China Carries Out New, Open Exam Plan to Choose Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A civil servant recruitment
system through open examination and merit appraisal will be set up
nationwide by the end of next year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jialin, director of the Examination and Employment
Department of the Ministry of Personnel, told a seminar last week
that an open, competitive system is one of the requirements to
enforce the Provisional Regulations on Civil Servants enated in
October 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Although officials of government departments in some cities
and counties still have a poor understanding of the new system,
the change in administrative recruitment has been welcomed by most
ordinary people because open exams offer a level playing field in
job competition," Liu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liu described open recruitment as central to China's efforts to
reform its obsolete personnel system. In the past, officials were
selected by seniority, by recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that provincial personnel departments which have used
competitive recruitment should draw up a database of questions to
improve the examination.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the recruitment is fair and objective, a
supervisory system, including inspectors to check procedures
governing oral and written examinations and physical checkups,
should be established as soon as possible, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, central government departments began to screen new
employees through open exams.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that central government departments hired
nearly 1,000 low-ranking civil servants through exams in 1994 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
This year, 61 government departments, Party organs and other
institutions plan to recruit 737 new staff from examinations held
last July.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in
China's inland areas, 21 have adopted the new methods to hire
nearly 6,000 law-ranking civil servants for provincial government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, such recruitment methods were tested in several
pilot cities, including Chongqing, to select local low-ranking
officials for the departments of finance, trade, politics and law.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has recruited 7,636 new staff below county level
since 1985 and improved the political and professional quality of
its officials.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers in Tianjin Provide Community Service (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Tianjin's first community service volunteers association with
400 members was set up in March 1989.
</P>
<P>
Heping District has established a community service network that
currently consists of 12 volunteers associations with a total of
50,000 members.
</P>
<P>
Every week, Canadians who are teaching in Nankai University
volunteer to provide guidance in the study of English to community
residents.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Tianjin Municipal Academy of
Social Sciences shows that the residents' greatest need for social
exchanges is assistance among neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed agreed that community service is essential to
preserving traditional virtues and forging good relations between
people.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Heping District government said that
community service is characterized by mutual assistance and
not-for-profit paid services.
</P>
<P>
The service thus caters to the need of various kinds of people
and embodies a give-and-take principle.
</P>
<P>
"This is why community service has been growing so rapidly and
why so many residents have become involved in the campaign to
provide it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the principle that "I serve everyone
else while everyone else also serves me" embodies the ethical
norms for exchanges between people under the condition of a
socialist market economy.

TIANJIN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A notice posted at the entrance
of an apartment building on Xinxing Street in Tianjin's Heping
District announces that the ten families living there provide a
variety of services to their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The services include repairing electrical appliances, taking
care of senior citizens and children, tutoring in English, hair
cutting, sewing and repairing gas ovens.
</P>
<P>
"We began to help each other eight years ago," said Shen Zhimin,
a 65-year-old woman living in the apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
Shen's 85-year-old mother is unable to go to the hospital, so a
doctor living in the same building regularly comes to her home to
treat her.
</P>
<P>
She said that almost all couples living in the building are wage
earners. "So, many of my neighbor's children come to my home after
school because their parent's work units are far away. I take care
of them."
</P>
<P>
"Here, while serving others, every family also receives help
from others. We get on very well with each other," she said.
</P>
<P>
To date, mutual-service relations have been forged in more than
50 percent of the apartment buildings in Heping District, which
has a population of half a million.
</P>
<P>
Heping District serves as a good illustration of the campaign to
provide community services that is being launched throughout urban
areas in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is spreading information about the
district's successful experience in various forms.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a number of volunteers in Heping advocated providing
community services. Thirteen volunteers on Xinxing Street set up a
volunteer group to take care of 13 old people who were childless
or handicapped.

"This is why the principle has been accepted by most residents,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yunkang, director of the Sociology Institute of the Tianjin
Municipal Academy of Social Sciences, said: "On one hand, the
development of community service and the emergence of community
volunteers can alleviate the inconvenience caused by the
underdevelopment of the service sector."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he added, they can help promote
interpersonal exchanges and the sharing of ideas between the
Chinese people who are experiencing great changes resulting from
the modernization drive and effort to establish a market economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
"I think the co-existence of voluntary service and mutual
assistance in Heping District reflects the reality of
interpersonal exchanges under the condition of a market economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He believes that selfless community service should be
encouraged, but mutual help and benefit should become the
principal part of interpersonal relationships under the condition
of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"I think that is why so many people in Heping District have
become involved in community service," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that under a planned economic system, Chinese depended
on their employers or government departments for everything.
</P>
<P>
But with the increase in the reform, different needs of the
Chinese are met by different sectors of society, and the emergence
of community service will help improve Chinese people's social
security and quality of life, he added.

HEFEI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A microscopic laser system has
been developed at the Chinese University of Science and Technology
in eastern Anhui Province as one of the first in the world,
Chinese experts report.
</P>
<P>
An Optical Trapping technique has been adopted for the system,
which can work with human cells without damaging them and
manipulate a single cell.
</P>
<P>
The university's Laser Laboratory established the system by
integrating the optical trapping technique with a laser scalpel
and adopting the computer graphic treatment technique.
</P>
<P>
The system has a broad range of possible applications in cell
biology, cell engineering, and genetic engineering and will prove
an effective means for the study of cells in China, scientists
here say.
