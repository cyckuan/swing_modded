<P>
ATHENS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece, along with Germany, U.S.
and the Netherlands, Thursday successfully test-fired the patriot
and hawk missiles in the southern Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
The eight trial firings, two patriots and six hawks, were made
in the context of the multinational anti-aircraft defense
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos described the
firings as "impressive and successful," saying that targets were
successfully struck, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he was pleased to see the efficiency of
the patriot missiles which Greece had just acquired for
operational training at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
He added that the new patriot-3 missile systems Greece was
slated to acquire in two years' time would have an even wider
range and effectiveness.

LUANDA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government Thursday
launched a 56-million-U.S. dollar emergency humanitarian program
to assist over three million victims of war, including two million
displaced people.

The funds will be allocated to resettle the homeless and buy
food, tents and kits as well as seeds for agricultural production.

Angolan Minister of Planning Ana Dias Lourenco said the program

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Defend ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday said it
supported Russia in its effort to defend the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty, which represents the cornerstone for
maintaining global strategic balance and stability in today's
world.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hu Xiaodi, Chinese delegate to the First Committee
of the 54th General Assembly, made the statement in a press
interview here at the U.N. headquarters in New York, voicing his
support to the Russian draft resolution, entitled "Preservation of
and Compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty."
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation introduced the draft to the First
Committee, in charge of disarmament and international security, on
Thursday morning at the plenary Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 30 years or so, it has helped bring about a
relative balance and stability among the state parties by limiting
the development and deployment of ABM systems for a defense of the
territory of the state parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Treaty is bilateral in nature, its important role
in maintaining global strategic stability, pushing forward nuclear
disarmament and promoting international security has been
recognized widely by countries around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
On May 26, 1972, the United States and the then Soviet Union
reached agreement on the Treaty on the Limitation of
Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, known as ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The ABM Treaty is, however, now confronted with grave
challenges as a result of some recent negative developments in the
international situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As an important state party to the Treaty, the United States,
in seeking its own absolute security and strategic advantage, is
now not only pursuing its own NMD (national missile defense
system) program, but also pressing rapidly ahead with its joint
TMD (theatre missile defense) development programs with some other
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such moves not only fly in the face of the purposes and
principles of the Treaty, but are also very much at odds with
the core provisions of the Treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To remove legal barriers to its development and deployment of
NMD system, the United States has repeatedly pressed for making
substantive amendments to the Treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Federation, as another important state party to
the ABM Treaty, has engaged in bilateral negotiations with the
U.S. for many years on the question of compliance with the Treaty,
but produced no results," he said. "It is against this backdrop
that Russia has now decided to take this issue to the General
Assembly."
</P>
<P>
"The draft resolution tabled by the Russian Federation is, in
my view, quite 'innocent'," he said. "It simply reiterates the
relevant provisions of the Treaty, i.e. no deployment of ABM
systems for a defense of the territory of the state parties and no
transfer by the state parties to other states of ABM systems or
their components limited by the Treaty."
</P>
<P>
China and Belarus are co-sponsors of the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the draft resolution calls for full and strict
compliance with the Treaty by all state parties," he said. "The
main purpose of the draft resolution is to call for preservation
of the integrity and effectiveness of the Treaty."

<HEADLINE> Israel Marks 4th Anniversary of Rabin's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Flags were flying on
half-mast and a series of memorial activities were held in Israel
Thursday to mark the fourth anniversary of the assassination of
late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
At a state memorial ceremony held at Rabin's grave site in
Jerusalem, Prime Minister Ehud Barak pledged to follow the path of
peace championed by Rabin, his commander and mentor.
</P>
<P>
"We are here as your soldiers on the march to peace...we'll
carry on from exactly the point where it all was stopped by three
bullets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was shot dead on November 4 by an ultra-nationalist Jew
who was opposed to the late prime minister's peacemaking with the
Palestinians. Israelis mark the date according to the Jewish
calendar.
</P>
<P>
Taking office in July, Barak vowed to revive the Mideast peace
process, which was kicked off under the Rabin administration in
early 1990s, but stalled under the hard-line Likud government
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, people lit candles at the site
of Rabin's assassination four years ago. Former Prime Minister
Shimon Peres will speak at a commemorative service later Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Several debate and discussion sessions were also held all over
the country with an aim of bridging the gap between the religious
and secular communities, which has split the Israeli society since
Rabin's murder.
</P>
<P>
But some Israelis fear the wounds have still not been healed
and there was still danger of violence within the society.
</P>
<P>
At an official memorial ceremony at the presidential office
Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman warned that "there are still
worrisome signs of violence" in the Israeli society. "We must
fight political violence with all means possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leah Rabin, widow of Rabin, also warned early this week that
the possibility could not be ruled out that a Jewish settler
extremist may carry out a suicide attack on Barak out of
desperation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, about 4,000 militant settlers demonstrated outside
Barak's office to protest his plans to dismantle 10 of 42 rogue
settlement outposts built without government approval. It was the
largest demonstration since Barak took office.
</P>
<P>
Since its beginning Tuesday, the evacuation has been resisted
by militant settlers, who blocked access roads to the hilltops
where makeshift equipment was to be removed. Only three outposts
have been dismantled over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
In a symbolic defiance, about 1,000 settlers erected a
makeshift synagogue Wednesday on a hilltop which is on the list to
be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the delay, Barak urged settler leaders Wednesday to
continue the evacuation as agreed upon in a compromise deal
reached last week.

</P>
<P>
Betty Boothroyd called on Jiang in the Buckingham Palace where

II.
</P>
<P>
The speaker firstly expressed her warm welcome to President
Jiang, who arrived here Monday for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
Recalling her recent visit to China, Boothroyd said she saw
with her own eyes the vitality of China as a great nation, which
she had never seen in the recent 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said she would try her utmost to promote the
development of Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Against Attempt to Amend ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday voiced
strong opposition to any attempt by the U.S. to amend the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which remains a cornerstone
for the maintenance of global strategic balance and stability in
the world today.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hu Xiaodi, the Chinese delegate to the First
Committee of the 54th General Assembly, made the statement in a
press interview here.
</P>
<P>
"For years, the United States has repeatedly called on other
countries to comply with existing international arms control
treaties," he said. "Moreover, it has, for many years, tabled
resolutions entitled 'Compliance with arms limitation and
disarmament agreements" at the General Assembly."
</P>
<P>
"Russia's draft resolution merely quotes certain provisions
from the Treaty and calls for full and strict compliance with the
Treaty by all state parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The draft resolution, I believe, is mild, reasonable and
factual," he said. "It has just laid bare the truth to the
international community."
</P>
<P>
China and Belarus are co-sponsors of the draft resolution,
entitled "Preservation of and Compliance with Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty," which Russia introduced to the First Committee on
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore cannot go along with the allegation that the
Russian Federation is seeking confrontation," he said. "Quite on
the contrary, we believe that the draft resolution is a necessary
step in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"If the atmosphere here at the General Assembly is to be
characterized as 'somewhat confrontational' during discussions, it
shows exactly that the pursuit by the U.S. of missile defense
programs has aroused the grave concern of the international
community as such a move goes against the general trend of the
times," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the Chinese side expresses its understanding
of the Russian Federation in tabling the draft resolution," he
said, "And as its co-sponsor, China will render all its support to
this draft resolution."

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Has Right to Discuss Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China said Thursday that
the General Assembly has both the right and the obligation to
discuss the draft resolution, raised by Russia, on the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hu Xiaodi, the Chinese delegate to the First
Committee of the 54th General Assembly session, made the statement
in an interview with the press here.
</P>
<P>
"The General Assembly each year reviews some issues or
resolutions that are bilateral in nature, but has a bearing on
international and regional security and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To amend the Treaty will disrupt global strategic stability
and balance with severe negative impact on nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, such a move will undermine the security interest
of not only the state parties to the Treaty but also that of the
entire international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community is thus obligated to take all the
necessary steps, including calling for full and strict compliance
with the Treaty so as to ensure that it remains the cornerstone
for maintaining global strategic stability and promoting nuclear
disarmament, he said.

<HEADLINE> IDB Supports Air Transport Sector Reform in Guyana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Thursday the approval of a soft
loan of 30 million U.S. dollars to support a comprehensive air
transport sector improvement program that includes regulatory and
institutional reforms, investments in infrastructure, and
institutional modernization.
</P>
<P>
The resources will assist the Ministry of Public Works and
Communications in undertaking a thorough review of the statutory,
regulatory, and institutional framework of the sector and in
taking steps to increase private sector participation in operating
air transport facilities and services, the Washington-based IDB
said.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure investments will be made in Cheddi Jagan
International Airport over the next three years to bring it under
full compliance of standards of the International Civil Aviation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Technical cooperation will be available to assist the
government in reforming governing statues, developing air
transport regulations, creating a Guyana Civil Aviation Authority,
converting the management of Cheddi Jagan airport into an
incentive-based corporation, and privatizing Ogle Airport near
Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
Policies will be adopted to improve aviation services and
facilities in the interior of the country in sectors such as
effective national search and rescue services, creation of
regional control centers, and greater supervision over small
official airports.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is 31.5 million dollars. Local
counterpart funds total 1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IDB loan from the Fund for Special Operations is for a
40-year term, with a 10-year grace period, at 1 percent annual
interest during the grace period and 2 percent thereafter.

LONDON, October (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
British Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday jointly cut ribbon at the
opening ceremony of a Chinese archaeological exhibition here.
</P>
<P>
When President Jiang as well as Queen Elizabeth and her husband
Prince Philip arrived, they were applauded by over 300 guests from
the cultural society of Britain.
</P>
<P>
After signing the museum visitors' book, the two leaders cut
the ribbon for the exhibition and viewed the objects with high
interest.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, titled "gilded dragons--buried treasures from
China' golden ages", was located at the British Museum with
objects loaned from China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which marks the first state visit ever by a
Chinese president, includes "treasures never before displayed
outside China, many being spectacular discoveries of the last
three decades", the British Museum said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits, mostly dated back to Tang Dynasty, are divided
into three sections, with the first one as an introduction
displaying gold,silver and gilded objects even manufactured before
the Tang Dynasty.

<P>
The two main sections show such treasures as gold and silver
artifacts and jewellery as well as Buddist figures, reflecting
advanced skills as well as sophiscated life of the ancient China.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Adverse Effects of Asian Economic Crisis on Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- As the stream of remittances has dired up, many rural
families have become completely destitute. Recent newspaper
reports from Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand document an
increasing number of causes of families in desperation who
have sold their daughters into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
-- Psychological stress, heightened during times of economic
crisis, places additional burdens particularly on women. Given
the shallow social safety nets in Asia, job losses and poverty
have led to increased reliance on the family, and that has, by
all indications, caused household distress. Children are all
reported to have gone up in the region.
</P>
<P>
-- According to the Thai Education Ministry, almost 6 percent
of school students or about 500,000 primary and secondary
children had been forced to drop out of school. Estimates for
Indonesia are even higher. A disproportionate number of
drop-outs are likely to be girls.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Angolans Hail Capture of UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- "Conquest of Andulo and Bailundo
means the dawn of peace for the Angolan people," Jose Carvalho, a
resident in Angolan capital, said on Thursday, one day after the
government troops claimed the capture of the rebel headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"We have been longing for an authentic peace in the past 30
years," said Carvalho, 43, who has been a driving coach for 14
years but can not afford a car himself.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the capital city of Luanda were immersed in a
frenzy of delight when they heard the news about the capture of
Bailundo and Andulo, long-term strongholds and the most important
headquarters for the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Along the Street 4th of February, the most beautiful street in
seaside Luanda , many people gathered around radio sets, listening
to the reports about the situation in the battle fields.
</P>
<P>
After a 38-day all-out offensive on the UNITA's strongholds in
Angola's central plateau, the Angolan authorities announced on
Wednesday that the government troops have taken over Bailundo and
Andulo, traditional political and military headquarters of UNITA
since 1994 when the rebels lost the city of Huambo.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of rebels" have been killed since the offensive
started on September 14, an official report said without giving
the exact casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here on Thursday from Bailundo,
the government troops have controlled the situation of the town.
There are no shots, no disorder, even no serious destruction to
the buildings in the town.
</P>
<P>
The last UNITA statement was made on Monday through the
Portuguese news agency Lusa, which said UNITA would not guarantee
the safety of the United Nations personnel in Angola, accusing
U.N. of ignoring the existence of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government on Thursday denied a UNITA report
accusing government troops of using napalm bombs and phosphorous
bombs in the town of Bailundo, saying there are no signs of
large-scale bombardments.
</P>
<P>
Angola, with a population of 11 million, has been ravaged by a
long-term civil war since its independence from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believe that Angola is of great potential of
economic development if the country could restore peace and focus
on reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps I can have my own car,...if Angola can pay more
attention to the economic construction. As you know, Angola is
rich in oil and diamonds. I hope that someday I don't have to
borrow cars from the driving school," said Carvalho, the driving
coach.

<HEADLINE> Former Greek Premier Warns Against Kosovo Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and European backed
plans for Kosovo to gain independence from Yugoslavia would bring
about a forced change of borders in the Balkan region and endanger
regional stability and peace, with Macedonia as the first victim,
former Greek Premier Constantine Mitsotakis said in a statement
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis, also honorary president of the main opposition New
Democracy Party (ND), said that despite the assurance given by
NATO on preservation of Kosovo's multinational nature and in
violation of the agreement the alliance itself had signed with
Yugoslavia, the murders, looting, arson and rapes that took place
under the noses of the multinational force and their apathy and
tolerance forced nearly the entire Serbs and other minority
populations to flee the region.
</P>
<P>
The next move clearly appearing on the horizon was the
independence of Kosovo, which apparently comprised the ulterior
plan of many circles in the U.S. and Europe from the outset, he
said, adding that this development, which leads with certainty to
the forced change of borders in the Balkans in favor of Albania,
would with certainty place in danger the stability and peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The former premier noted that beyond the fact that stability
and peace in the region were of direct concern to Greece, the
recent developments also substantially affected Greek economic
interests throughout all of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis urged Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis to take up
the issue with the U.S. President Bill Clinton during the latter's
visit to Greece next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday urged the warring parties in Afghanistan to
work with the United Nations in seeking peace.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is just back from a trip to Europe, was responding
to a decision made by his Special Envoy to Afghanistan Lakhdar
Brahimi who said at a press conference Wednesday that he would suspend
his active involvement in efforts to bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Brahimi has done a lot to try and bring peace in
Afghanistan. He has been very active working with the Six Plus
Two, but the Six Plus Two has not yielded any concrete results,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"He has given a lot of his time and energy in trying to bring
the parties together without much results. And he believes the
time has come for him to move on and to do something else," the
U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. and international community can be extremely
helpful in situations where the parties in conflict want to
resolve their differences. But where they are determined to find
a resolution on the battlefield, the U.N. can do very little,"
said Annan.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this also a wake-up call and a powerful message to the
people that the international community is not going to sit around
forever, running after them, and that they should wake up and
really work with us in seeking peace," added the Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been saddled with an unending 20-year
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. Discuss Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Defense Minister
Mohammed Tantawi Thursday held talks with visiting U.S. Secretary
of Defense William Cohen on military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with a wide range of issues of mutual
interest, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the closest allies of the U.S. in the Middle
East. The U.S. has granted Egypt an annual military assistance of
more than 1 billion U.S. dollars since 1979. It also sells
advanced weapons, including warplanes and tanks, to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here ealier in the day within a regional tour,
which has taken him to Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE). He will travel on to Kuwait, Jordan, Oman and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit in Egypt, Cohen is expected to observe
Friday a multi-national military exercise, code-named "Bright
Star '99" in northwestern Egypt, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The biennial military exercises were first launched by Egypt
and the U.S. in 1981. The participating countries have risen to 11
this year. They are the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Greece,
Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, the Netherlands, the UAE and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Restore Law in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government said
Thursday it would continue to "act decisively and toughly to fully
restore law and order in the entire territory of the Chechen
republic and free it from terrorist and other bandit formations."
</P>
<P>
"Chechnya won't remain an outpost of international terrorism
and extremism," the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops have secured control over one-third of the
breakaway republic and some units were just a dozen kilometers
from Grozny, the regional capital, but authorities have been vague
on whether to launch an all-out assault on Grozny. Such an attack
would risk large losses
</P>
<P>
The statement said the military action against the rebels "is a
legitimate response to the challenge that was thrown to the entire
Russian society and international community."
</P>
<P>
It was referring to Chechen rebels' armed incursions into
neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings that
killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native
known only by his last name, were accused of masterminding the
blasts.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has also blamed outside help to the rebels, citing data
from its spying agencies.
</P>
<P>
"Eradication of terrorism and military extremism in Russia is
its internal affair. It is also our duty to the international
community," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said "Russia's fight against terrorism and interception of
its transnational channels" has won understanding worldwide and
support from "an overwhelming majority of citizens, including
Chechen civilians."
</P>
<P>
The statement spelt out several conditions for the start of
negotiations with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is "open for dialogue with Chechnya's political forces
which are prepared to comply with the Constitution, Russia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, to denounce all expressions
of terrorism, to disarm illegal formations and hand over people
responsible for terrorist attacks, abduction and bandit actions to
the federal authorities," it said.
</P>
<P>
These forces should also "help release all hostages in Chechen
territory, and ensure a safe return of the people who had to flee
their residences," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"All issues of Chechen settlement will be attained at a
negotiating table. A path for this has been cleared."
</P>
<P>
"Federal authorities observe the interests of all Russia's
peoples and protect a unity of the multi-ethnic Russian
community," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Differences Between Greek and Turkish Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential envoy to
Cyprus Alfred Moses said Thursday the two Cypriot communities on
the Cyprus island still remained far in their stances on the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before his departure, Moses said that
finding a solution to the Cyprus issue is an ongoing process but
not a one-day or two-day undertaking.
</P>
<P>
The official, who arrived here Monday night accompanied by
U.S. State Department Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas
Weston, said he will return to the island if the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides indicate it will be useful.
</P>
<P>
Moses also said he will report to U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on his talks here.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to comment on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's
position that Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides should not
represent the Turkish Cypriots, Moses said that "each side has its
position on that, it's been articulated back and forth hundreds of
times."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Moses held talks with Clerides and Denktash in a bid to get the
two sides back to the negotiating table in search of a solution to
the Cyprus issue. The peace talks have been stalled since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side said it is ready to attend talks based
on U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, Denktash holds that talks can be resumed only when his
self-proclaimed breakaway republic in northern Cyprus is
recognized as a separate state.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Granny Spy May Face Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Melita Norwood, the 87-year-old
great-grandmother who had spied for Russia's KGB for more than 40
years, may still face prosecution for her treachery.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw Thursday told the parliament
that the case against Norwood was "currently being studied again
by the prosecuting authorities" following her recent media
statements confessing espionage and defiantly defending her
actions.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that four other cases were also being considered
for possible prosecution over the revelations made by KGB defector
Vasili Mitrokhin, which first brought Norwood's spying activities
to public attention in September.
</P>
<P>
According to Mitrokhin's revelations, Norwood was the source of
secrets passed to former Soviet Union enabling it to build its
first nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
A flood of similar stories then emerged as the results of
investigations based around information brought by Mitrokhin,
revealing a series of former spies living freely in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the news Thursday at her home in Bexleyheath, south
east London, Norwood said that she was "not altogether surprised"
that the authorities were re-examining her case.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian ex-Prime Minister,
leader of the Fatherland-All Russia bloc Yevgeny Primakov on
Thursday refused to meet with President Boris Yeltsin, said an
Itar-Tass report.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with NTV (Independent Television), Primakov
confirmed that "there was indeed a phone call from the Kremlin,
which said that the meeting had been scheduled," reported
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
"But I think that such a meeting is inexpedient when the
president's entourage is pursuing a policy with which I does not
want to associate myself and cannot share,"said Primakov.
</P>
<P>
In response to Primakov's statement, Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin later Thursday said that the former Prime Minister
"probably misunderstood" the source of the invitation.
</P>
<P>
It was Yeltsin who had invited him for the meeting rather than
"an inner circle", as Primakov might have thought, Yakushkin said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Primakov expressed a desire for such a meeting previously,"
Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
The Fatherland-All Russia electoral bloc, chaired by Primakov,
now is holding leading position in public surveys about upcoming
State Duma elections and will most likely win the parliamentary
elections.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Capital Hit by Plastic Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Littered plastic bags are
causing environmental pollution in the capital of Ethiopia Addis
Ababa and its environs, an environmental protection official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plastic pollution has been felt by the community, said
Zereu Girmay who is working in the Metropolis Environmental
Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said the metropolitans usually dump their garbage along
river basins, thus having polluted the areas.
</P>
<P>
Several heads of cattle have died of eating garbage, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the environmental official, plastic bags can stay
for over 100 years without getting decayed, which makes it
hazardous to habitants.
</P>
<P>
The trashes have been found one of the causes for soil
degradation and they affect the growth of plant by blocking air
circulation within the soil,
</P>
<P>
Zereu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to use bags made of paper, jute and clothes
in order to avoid further environmental pollution.

<HEADLINE> France Issues Arrest Warrant Against Papon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A French public prosecutor issued
on Thursday an arrest warrant against former Nazi collaborator
Maurice Papon, who is believed to be hiding in an unidentified
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general of Bordeaux, southwest France, also said
France has asked European states which have joined the Schengen
space to extradite Papon and member countries of the Interpol to
arrest him, in case he is found.
</P>
<P>
"The order has been given to the services of police and
gendarmerie to search for the condemned on all the national
territory, to arrest him...and to bring him to jail," said
Attorney General Marc Robert during a press conference in
Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued shortly after France's supreme
court, the Cour de Cassation, rejected an appeal of Papon against
a court ruling in 1998, condemning him to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 89, was a senior official under the Vichy collaboration
regime during the Nazi occupation and he was condemned for
complicity in crimes against humanity for the deportation of 1,560
Jews from the Bordeaux region to Nazi death camps from 1942 to
1944.
</P>
<P>
He refused to surrender to the judicial authorities on the eve
of the supreme court's ruling, knowing that his appeal would
surely be rejected, and fled abroad.
</P>
<P>
Papon issued a communique through his lawyers on Wednesday,
saying that he chose to go into exile rather than living the rest
of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
He has also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, asking the latter to overthrow the French court
ruling.

JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly's
watchdog Public Accounts Committee (PAC) will take strong measures
to crack down hard on financial mismanagement and ensure that
those responsible be punished.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Gavin Woods on Thursday outlined a new
strategy for his committee, aimed at boosting its status and
ensuring it was an effective brake to financial mismanagement in
the public service.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Parliament's Press Gallery Association, he said: "We
have to become a little bit more forceful, a bit more
intimidating; we have to start putting a little bit of humiliation
onto people -- especially at director-general level."
</P>
<P>
Woods said he had little doubt that billions were being
squandered every year because of poor performance and poor value
for taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
He was also critical of the department of state expenditure and
said he had told Finance Minister Trevor Manuel as much.
</P>
<P>
The department of state expenditure was not playing its role in
ensuring sound public financial management, according to the South

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said on Thursday that he was upbeat
about closer bilateral cooperation with China in the future.
</P>
<P>
Pahad was speaking in Pretoria after talks with his Chinese
counterpart Ji Peiding.
</P>
<P>
Pahad told reporters that two-way trade between South Africa
and China had jumped from 14 million U.S. dollars two years ago to
1.3 billion dollars at present. If South Africa's trade with Hong
Kong was added, the total stood at 4.5 billion dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is phenomenal in the time frame. We feel this potential
has to be developed further," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
Although diplomatic ties between the two countries were only
two years old, the relationship was flourishing, Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
Ji, citing the current momentum of relations between the two
countries, said that overall, the two countries were very
satisfied with what has been achieved over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties were set to grow and mutual visits would become
more frequent, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
"The views between our two countries are either identical or
similar," he said, adding that "we are both developing countries
and have common interests in international, regional and bilateral
affairs."
</P>
<P>
An exchange of state visits between South Africa and the
People's Republic of China might not be far off, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the two countries will make vigorous preparations
for the exchange of state visits," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Alliance Not to Take Part in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's alliance of six
political parties, the Setlamo Democratic Alliance, on Thursday
announced that it would not participate in the coming by-elections
in December, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The alliance consists of six parties -- the Basotholand
Congress Party (BCP), the Basotho National Party (BNP), the
Marematlou Freedom Party (MFP), the Lesotho Labor Party (LLP) and
the United Democratic Party (UDP).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Maseru, the leader of the BNP,
Major General Metsing Lekhanya, said the alliance would not
contest the by- elections, which he described as a "children's
play ground" since they would be based on the outcome of the
general elections which were aborted last year.
</P>
<P>
Lekhanya said it was questionable how the by-elections could be
held at this time when the nation had begun to gear itself for the
fresh general elections next year.
</P>
<P>
He said by-elections would "blur the vision of the planned
general elections next year which the entire Basotho nation is so
eagerly awaiting".
</P>
<P>
Lekhanya called on supporters of Setlamo to work hard to ensure
that their candidates won the elections, which he said should be
held on or about May 16 next year.
</P>
<P>
The alliance hailed the outcome of the arbitration tribunal
which decided on a general election model of 80 constituent seats
and 50 seats based on proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
The interim political authority has announced that consultants
have started work on the proposed amendment to the Lesotho
constitution and the electoral order to pave the way for general
elections.

<HEADLINE> French Supreme Court Rejects Appeal of Nazi Collaborator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- France's supreme court, the Court
de Cassation, rejected on Thursday the appeal of former Nazi
collaborator Maurice Papon, who has fled to an unidentified
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The court said in a ruling that since Papon refused to
surrender as a prisoner on the eve of the court ruling, his appeal
was automatically rejected.
</P>
<P>
Papon, who was until now a free man, is from now in a state of
escape and can be arrested at any moment.
</P>
<P>
The court did not issue an international warrant for his arrest
on Thursday, while French police have begun tracing the
whereabouts of Papon, who was convicted in April 1998 of
complicity in crimes against humanity by an Assize Court in
Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 89, was condemned to 10 years in jail for helping deport
1,560 Jews from France to Nazi death camps when he was a senior
official of the Vichy collaboration regime during World War II.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, he announced on Wednesday through his
lawyers that he chose to go into exile rather than spending the
last years of his life in jail.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that Papon fled on October 11 to
Switzerland where he applied for asylum, but his demand was
rejected on October 14 by the Swiss federal government.
</P>
<P>
The French intelligence service Renseignement Generaux was
informed of the presence of Papon in Switzerland on October 15,
said the daily quoting reliable sources.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Elysee presidential palace failed to make
public comments on the escape of Papon, but said privately that
this at least makes up "a guilty negligence" committed by the
judicial authorities.

<HEADLINE> China Voices Opposition to ABM Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday voiced
its strong opposition to any attempt to amend the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty, which remains a cornerstone for the
maintenance of the global strategic balance and stability in the
world today.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Chinese representative Hu Xiaodi was
taking the floor to support a draft resolution presented by the
Russian delegation. China and Belarus decided to co-sponsor with
Russia the draft for the global preservation of and compliance
with the Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"To amend the Treaty in pursuit of NMD (national missile
defense) will have wide and far-reaching adverse impact on a
global scale," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, such a move will have severe negative impact on
global strategic balance and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As the ABM Treaty has, since its conclusion, served as the
corner stone for the maintenance of global strategic balance and
stability, to amend this Treaty in pursuit of NMD will tip global
strategic balance, trigger a new round of arms race and put world
and regional stability in jeopardy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, such a move will seriously hinder the nuclear
disarmament process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The relative balance of forces among major powers in the world
and the global strategic stability based thereon represent the
precondition for nuclear disarmament," he said. "If such balance
and stability were shattered, the nuclear disarmament process
would come to a halt or even be reversed."
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, such a move will also disrupt international
non-proliferation efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear disarmament constitutes the prerequisite for the
non-nuclear states to honor their commitment to stay
non-nuclear," he said. "To amend the ABM Treaty will legitimize
the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missile
systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If such attempts were to prevail, the prerequisite and basis
for nuclear disarmament would no longer be there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, who can guarantee that yet some
other non-nuclear states will not go nuclear?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"The use of large quantities of missiles by some military
powers in Kosovo represents ample evidence of missiles'
effectiveness and military prowess in today's world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In short, "China maintains that it is the responsibility of the
international community to take every necessary step," including
"calling for full and strict compliance with the ABM Treaty by all
state parties, to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of ABM
Treaty and to ensure that the Treaty will remain as the
cornerstone for maintaining global strategic balance and stability
and promoting nuclear disarmament," he added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Pilots Urge for National Airline Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian pilots are urging the
federal government to commit to its policies on foreign ownership
and control of airlines in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian association of 2,200 pilots demanded Wednesday
federal regulators order American Airlines to pull their
investments out of Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are attacking the bid by American and its partner
Onex Corp. to merge Canada's two major airlines -- Air Canada and
Canadian Airlines International.
</P>
<P>
"We are attacking American, not only because they are American,
but because they are based outside of the country," said Jean-Marc
Belanger, who represents the Air Canada Association of Pilots.
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason for an outside agency controlling the
aviation industry in Canada," he added.
</P>
<P>
The pilots allege that Dallas-based American and its parent AMR
Corp exercise control over Canadian Airlines through its 25
percent of investment, as well as through software systems and
management appointments
</P>
<P>
The attack came one day after Air Canada offered its own bid of
about 626 million U.S. dollars Tuesday to counter an earlier bid
by Onex.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada promised to reduce job cuts to 2,500 in its own
version of merger, while Onex had previously expected the cuts to
be 5,000, arousing fears of Canadian pilots and other airline
staff.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada is teaming up with Lufthansa, United Airlines and
the Canadian Imperial Bank Commerce to seek 35 percent of its own
shares in preventing holders from voting for a merger proposed by
Onex.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Blair Attend Opening Ceremony of China-UK Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The first session of the China-
UK Forum opened here on Thursday. Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair attended the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said the Chinese and British governments
have established channels for exchanges and consultations in
various forms in order to promote the development of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
"The China-UK Forum is yet another channel for the two sides to
discuss ways to expand our cooperation. It has brought together
many VIPs in the political, economic, cultural and academic
communities of our two countries and will surely contribute
significantly to a better mutual understanding of the two peoples
and to the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two
countries in various fields," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he was much delighted that as part of the first
state visit by a Chinese head of state, President Jiang Zemin has
agreed to join with him to attend the opening ceremony of the UK-
China Forum.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and he announced the
establishment of the UK-China Forum one year ago during his visit
to China. He hoped the forum would help the people of Britain and
China know each other better.
</P>
<P>
"Direct contacts are important. We need to work together to
deepen the understanding between Britain and China," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was pleased to see the opening of the first
session of the forum during the historical state visit, a visit
which symbolizes the widening and deepening of Sino-British ties.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a high-level China-UK Forum was announced
during Blair's visit to China in October 1998. The co-chairmen of
the forum are the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference Vice-Chairman Song Jian and British former Deputy Prime
Minister Michael Heseltine.
</P>
<P>
The China-UK Forum has been the highest-level non-governmental
bilateral meeting between China and Britain in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The main activity of the forum is an annual conference held in
the two countries alternatively. The establishment of the forum is
aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation between
the countries through various channels.
</P>
<P>
The two-day first session of the forum is being held at
Lancaster House in London. Among the participants, 35 are from
China and 70 from Britain.

<HEADLINE> China Joins Russian Efforts to Uphold ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China announced Thursday
that it decided to join Russia as a co-sponsor of a draft
resolution for the preservation of and compliance with the
Anti-Ballistic (ABM) Treaty, which remains a cornerstone for the
maintenance of global strategic balance and stability in the world
today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Chinese representative Hu Xiaodi, who
attended the plenary meeting of the First Committee of the 54th
General Assembly, took the floor after Russia presented the draft
resolution before the committee, which is in charge of disarmament
and international security.
</P>
<P>
"Although the treaty is bilateral in nature, its important role
in maintaining global strategic stability, pushing forward nuclear
disarmament and promoting international security has been
universally recognized," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"The ABM Treaty is, however, now confronted with grave
challenges flowing from some recent negative developments in the
international situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In seeking its own absolute security and strategic advantage,
a state party to the Treaty is now not only vigorously pursuing
its own NMD(national missile defense) program, but also pressing
rapidly ahead with its joint TMD (theatre missile defense)
development programs with some other individual countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such moves not only fly in the face of the purposes and
principles of the Treaty, but are also very much at odds with
the core provision of the Treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is thus clear that the real motive behind the repeated
requests of the above-mentioned state party to amend the Treaty is
to remove the legal barriers to legitimize its development and
deployment of NMD system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that once an amendment is made to the Treaty,
there will be many more to come as a result of the so-called
changes in situation," he said. "And, ultimately, the Treaty will
be virtually rendered ineffective and become mere pieces of
paper."
</P>
<P>
"This should naturally arouse the vigilance and gave concern of
the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Belarus joined Russia in co-sponsoring the draft
resolution in a bid to uphold the ABM Treaty, push forward
nuclear disarmament process and promote international peace and
security.

<HEADLINE> About 100 Injured in Nationwide Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 people were injured
during the opposition-organized nationwide hartal (destructive
strike) in Bangladesh on Thursday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city, at least 15 people, including a policeman
and a photographer, received injuries in bomb blasts during the
dawn-to-dusk shutdown, organized by the opposition alliance to
protest "Indian aggression" and press their demand for immediate
resignation of the government and an early general election.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 people were wounded in clashes between pro- and
anti-hartal activists in Patuakhali district, 161 kilometers south
of here.
</P>
<P>
And in the southeastern port city of Chittagong, more than 50
people, including 11 policeman, were injured in sporadic clashes.
Activists of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) were locked in clashes with police at several places of the
city, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police detained 25 people in Dhaka and 26 opposition activists
in Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the BNP, the Jatiya Party,
the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ, Islamic
Solidarity Front), announced fresh anti-government programs after
the day-long strike, including a mass contact program from October
23 to 26, a road march on October 30 and demonstration day on
October 25.
</P>
<P>
The IOJ announced a two-day march towards northern Mymensingh
beginning October 30 and the BNP a two-day march towards
northeastern Sylhet beginning October 31.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,500 police and Bangladesh Rifles personnel were
deployed across the capital city for maintaining law and order
during the shutdown, and the ruling Awami League brought out
anti-hartal processions in Dhaka, accusing the opposition
activists of creating an anarchic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
A 30-year-old man was killed near the capital city Wednesday
night when the bus he was riding in came under a bomb attack. It
was not known who hurled the bomb, the reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 -- On current international situation and
norms of international relationship, Jiang said international
relationship has undergone important and deep changes at the turn
of the century, and many new issues have emerged.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the international situation is developing
toward detente. What makes people feel uneasy is that hegemonism
and power politics not only continue to exist, but have some new
development as well," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that the norms of international relations that
were established after the Second World War and have now been
widely accepted by the international community should be adhered
to, particularly, the principles of mutual respect of sovereignty
and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in
others' internal affairs, equality and peaceful settlement of
international conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"These principles have safeguarded world peace for 50 years,
which shows that they are effective," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the authority of the United Nations must be
strengthened. The U.N. role in safeguarding world peace and
security must be fully respected and played. No country or country
group is allowed to place itself above the UN, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis that broke out in the first half of this year
has drawn wide concern of the international community, Jiang said.
"The crisis, which involves many fundamental issues of how to
safeguard international security in the present world, needs
people to ponder over," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Britain could play an active and constructive role
on international issues and it is necessary for China and Britain
to strengthen consultation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Blair agreed with Jiang and held that major international
issues should be discussed and settled on the basis of
international norms.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that it has come to the period of
establishing a new order which is different from the past for the
norms of international relationship. During this period of time,
he said, China will play an important and key role. He added that
Britain hopes to make joint efforts and contributions with China
to this end.
</P>
<P>
Blair also expressed appreciation of the successful practice of
"one country, two systems" in Hong Kong and again hoped that
bilateral ties will enjoy more drastic development in wider fields
in the new century.

<HEADLINE> Arabs View Peace in Mideast as Strategic Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said here on Thursday that it is an
irreversible and strategic choice by the Arabs to realize a just
and durable peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with a peace delegation
from the United States, Abdel-Meguid said the hoped-for peace must
be based on relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions on the
Arab-Israeli conflict and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by U.S. historian John Wallash includes 15
university professors, scholars, politicians and businessmen, who
arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for talks with Arab officials
in a bid to get acquainted with Arabs' position on the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told the delegation that the right way to protect
and advance the Mideast peace process is for Israel to "candidly
and honestly commit to" the implementation of the signed
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum asserted the
importance of immediately re-starting negotiations on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations should lead to full Israeli pullout
from the Golan Heights and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were suspended in early 1996 due
to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights that Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War. Leaders of the two
countries have said they were interested in resuming the
negotiations, but they have yet to translate the pledges into
actions.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border strip in southern Lebanon as a
so-called security zone in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern
areas from attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas. Lebanon demands
that Israel pull out troops from its territories unconditionally.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Cleaners Suffer Internal Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Two workers at a nuclear plant
suffered "internal radioactive contamination" when they were
cleaning a cooling pond in Gwynedd, North Wales on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The men are believed to have swallowed or inhaled contaminated
dust while scraping the inner layer of the pool at the
decommissioned Trawsfynydd plant, according to the British Nuclear
Fuels Limited (BNFL).
</P>
<P>
"We think there must have been a gap in the seal on their
breathing apparatus which let some dust in," said David
Cartwright, spokesman for BNFL.
</P>
<P>
"There is no health risk to the men, but it should not have
happened."
</P>
<P>
Work on the cleaning the cooling pond has been stopped until a
new ventilation system is fitted on the site, which will reduce
the level of dust.
</P>
<P>
However, Cartwright said similar cleaning work in other nuclear
plants around the country will continue as normal.
</P>
<P>
The contaminated men, who have not been named, were part of a
team of eight cleaning the cooling pond. None of the other workers
was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
A full investigation into the incident is to be carried out by
the Nuclear Instillation Inspectorate, the regulators for the
nuclear industry.

JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
provided 4. 2 billion rand (700 million U.S. dollars) to fund 158
development projects in South Africa from 1994 to 1998, EU
Ambassador to South Africa Michael Laidler said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa received 75 to 80 percent of all development
assistance provided by the EU and its individual states. The funds
covered health, education, sports and democracy promotion
projects, Laidler told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is South Africa's largest foreign donor and largest
investor," he said.
</P>
<P>
During recent trade negotiations between Brussels and Pretoria,
the EU came under criticism for driving a hard bargain and seeking
unreasonable concession on the protection of intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
Laidler however said relations between the EU and South Africa
remained sound, and the EU was planning further development
assistance for at least the next six years.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Thursday that it has signed an
agreement to provide financing of 6 million U.S. dollars to West
African Cement S.A. (Wacem), a company in Togo, West Africa.
</P>
<P>
Incorporated in June 1996, Wacem acquired "Les Ciments de
l'Afrique de l'Quest" (Cimao), a clinker company developed by the
governments of Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo in the early 1980s
with a capacity of 1.2 million tons per annum. IFC's investment
will complete rehabilitation of the company's assest and expand
its activities.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing consists of a loan of 4.5 million dollars for
its own account and equity of 1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Guy Antoine, director of IFC's Regional Office for West
Africa, called the project an example of South-South cooperation.
He said it would promote regional economic integration in West
Africa and help the region secure clinker and cement at affordable
prices.
</P>
<P>
At full production, Wacem is expected to generate annual
foreign exchange revenues of about 33 million dollars and create
more than 400 permanent jobs, the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
The mission of IFC, part of the World Bank Group, is to promote
private sector investment in developing countries, which will
reduce poverty and improve people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Famous Columnist Killed in Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A prominent pro-secular
columnist was killed Thursday in Ankara when a bomb planted in his
car went off.
</P>
<P>
Ahmet Taner Kislali, a professor of political science and also
a columnist for the leftist daily Cumhuriyet (Republic), fell
victim to terrorism in front of his home in the Cayyolu suburb of
Ankara on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Kislali, also one of Turkey's leading secularists, is one of
several pro-secular academicians and journalists who have been
killed in this decade.
</P>
<P>
Two people suspected of involvement in the car bombing were
reportedly having been apprehended close to the scene.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old professor died on his way to the Bayindir
Medical Center as he lost his left arm in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nuri Ozgirgin said that "when he was brought to the
hospital his heart, respiratory system and brain had already
stopped functioning."
</P>
<P>
Kislali served as culture minister in the late 1970s. He was a
member of the parliament from 1977 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was in a plastic bag left on the wind shield of the
car, which was parked in front of his home.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police said that the bomb went off when he picked up
the bag and attempted to throw it.
</P>
<P>
Local private NTV reported that a radical Islamic group, the
Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front, had claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit rushed to the hospital and
expressed his condolences to Kislali's family members.
</P>
<P>
Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz canceled his trip to
Spain upon hearing the news.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Claims Rise Again Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. new claims for jobless
benefits rose by 9,000 last week after a sharp decline the
previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that 298,000 persons filed new
unemployment claims for the week ending Oct. 16 following a drop
of 25,000 the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The gain pushed the four-week moving average to 300,750, the
first time it has been above the 300,000-level in three months.
</P>
<P>
But even with the increase, the number of newly laid off
workers remains at historically low levels. The unemployment rate
in September remained at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent even though
the number of payroll jobs actually fell slightly during the
month, partly because of job losses blamed on Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
For the week ending Oct. 9, 46 states and territories reported
increases in applications for unemployment benefits and six
reported declines with one reporting no change. The state data lag
one week behind the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest increase was California, up 4,125,
while the state with the largest decline in benefit applications
for the week ending Oct. 9 was Sou th Carolina, down 1,605 because
of fewer layoffs in manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Fusion Generates Germany's Second Largest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 21 (Xinhua)--Two German electricity firms generate
concerns, the RWE AG in Essen and the VEW AG in Dortmund, Thursday
announced to tie up with each other, making up a new giant in this
sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the fusion plan that was passed by the supervisory boards
of the two companies, the new company will launch its major
business unit on Jan. 1, 2000, if the plan is accepted by the
shareholder sessions of RWE and VEW.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, we can take full advantage of our joint strength
in the fields of electricity and gas," said Dietmar Kuhnte, the
RWE chairman and designated leader of the new company.
</P>
<P>
Kuhnte's counterpart in VEW, Gert Maichel, stated more
ambitious goal:" A partnership between RWE and VEW will assure us
a top place in Europe in the branches of energy, water, and
environment."
</P>
<P>
The new firm will be Germany's second largest power
generator, listed behind VIAG-VEBA that announced to merge in
September.
</P>
<P>
RWE and VEW, both sited in Germany's heavy industrial region of
Ruhr, jointly produce 214 billion Kwh of electricity, and their
annual turnovers add up to 44 billion euros (47 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts project the new firm will further merge with a
European partner, possibly in the Great Britain or Italy. In
Germany, its possible goal of takeover may be the EnBW AG, the
electricity supplier in Baden-Wuerttemberg state.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Pays Tribute to Departed Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Ghanaian
Parliament Thursday paid tribute to the late Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere, describing him as "a rare gem and a great African
statesman", Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The parliament observed one minute's silence to Nyerere, who
died of leukaemia in London last Thursday, and whose funeral was
held in Tanzania Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"He was a shining example of total leadership, beloved by his
people. He was also a man who achieved the rare distinction of
being respected by the whole world," said Speaker of the
parliament Daniel Francis Annan.
</P>
<P>
 With his death, Africa has lost a great son who achieved
great heights as a world statesman and a spokesman for Africa when
he retired as president, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
 "On my own behalf and on behalf of the House, I wish to
extend our condolences to the family, the government and the
people of Tanzania and may his soul rest in a well deserved peace
in a world that he served," he added.
</P>
<P>
 Samuel K. Oppong, on behalf of the Parliamentary Committee,
commended Nyerere as a visionary and a man of integrity in the
true sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
He was one of those great African leaders and world statesmen
who knew the right time to exit for others to take over, he said.
</P>
<P>
 Oppong enumerated the various achievements made by Nyerere,
including his role in the liberation struggle in Tanzania, in
Pan-Africanism, in the Non-Aligned Movement and in the South
African Development Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
"His sincerity, selflessness and humility should be a lesson
to all. He was one of those elite whose footprints in the sands
of time would be difficult to tread," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy Thursday signed a
preliminary accord with Malta to help the Mediterranean island in
preparing itself for European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord signed Thursday in Valetta, Italy is expected
to send experts to Malta and to organize seminars for top
officials in the island's public administration.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to show the Maltese how an EU member incorporates
community law into its own legal system.
</P>
<P>
"Italy is in the front line of preparations for enlargement of
the European Union," said EU Affairs Minister Enrico Letta, who
signed the accord along with Maltese Foreign Minister Joe Borg.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a point where it is necessary to pass from words to
deeds," he said. "Today's accord was part of Italian efforts to
provide concrete help in integrating new countries into the
union."
</P>
<P>
The Italy-Malta accord was a first step in getting the island
to adapt its laws according to EU standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister also expressed satisfaction with the
European Commission's decision to launch membership negotiations
with Malta and other originally second-wave entrants from January
next year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Privatize More Parastatals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean government was urged
on Friday to speed up privatization of parastatals to help reduce
the country' s debt burden of 114 billion Zimbabwean dollars
(three billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Senior economist of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries
Bernard Mufute told a seminar that government projection to raise
five billion Zimbabwean dollars (131 million U.S. dollars) from
privatization within the next three years showed lack of
seriousness of purpose with the program.
</P>
<P>
He said if more companies were privatized it would reduce the
debt burden as the government would be able to utilize the
proceeds to write off some of the debts.
</P>
<P>
"This will help turn around the economy for the better as it
will also reduce the interest rate charges that are riling many
businesses," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far only five of 52 public enterprises have been privatized
in the southern African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A new passageway will soon be
built to facilitate passengers traveling between Hong Kong and
neighboring Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong Province, sources
with the Shenzhen Municipal Government said today.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under China's State
Council has already given the go ahead for the project, they said.
</P>
<P>
The planned passageway bridge between Shenzhen's Huanggang and
Hong Kong's Luomazhou will help ease the pressure of a mounting
passenger flow through the Luohu Entry Port, currently the largest
of its kind on land and the only land passageway between the two
cities.
</P>
<P>
Construction, to be conducted by Shenzhen's Subway Company, is
expected to be completed by the year 2003 and the cost will be
shared by Shenzhen and Hong Kong according to the length of the
passageway bridge in their respective sides.
</P>
<P>
The passageway bridge will be 16.5 meters wide and 216 meters
long, with 82 meters in Shenzhen and 134 meters in Hong Kong. It
will be linked to subways at both ends in the future.
</P>
<P>
The check-in terminal building at Shenzhen will cover a floor
space of 40,000 square meters and have a daily handling capacity
of 200,000 passengers.

<HEADLINE> Surging Number of Farm Animals in Canada Produces More Greenhouse Gases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Surging numbers of cows and pigs
are compromising Canada's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions
by 6 percent from their 1990 level by 2012.
</P>
<P>
Citing a two-year research on Canada's agriculture, the Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Friday that live stock production can
have a "dramatic effect" on greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Farm animals produce methane, a gas many times more powerful in
warming the Earth's atmosphere than carbon dioxide known as
greenhouse gas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Alberta and Manitoba alone can bring the Canadian agricultural
sector's emission up 22 percent from the 1990 level by 2010, if
hog and cattle numbers escalate as projected by the two major
provinces of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A dairy cow can produce about 500 liters of methane a day, the
report said, adding each unit of methane has the global-warming
potential of 21 units of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Excrement of pigs also produces methane, especially when pig
manure is piled up for decomposition.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture accounts for about 10 percent of the country's
greenhouse gas emissions, of which two thirds come from
fertilizers and one third from the methane caused by farm animals.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government has agreed to cut, by 2012, the
country's total emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 percent from
the 1990 level.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Subordinate to Elected President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
is completely subordinate to the leadership of the elected
president and must abide by his policies, chief of the TNI's
Information Service Maj. Gen. Sudradjat said.
</P>
<P>
"As a military institution, the TNI is completely subordinate
to the president's leadership in accordance with the accepted
constitutional norms and democratic values," Sudradjat said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the democratic way in which Abdurrahman Wahid and
Megawati Soekarnoputri had been elected as Indonesia's fourth
president and the country's eight vice president respectively was
something Indonesia could be proud of.
</P>
<P>
Now the entire nation had placed its hopes on them, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, it had to be realized that without
the support of the people and all segments of the nation it would
be difficult for the two national leaders to really usher the
country into a better future.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, all of the nation's components should render them
their assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the TNI's attitude, Sudradjat said, the TNI was
fully committed to helping Wahid and Megawati in the execution of
their tasks and to provide them with the best possible suggestions
on how problems should be solved, especially those relating to
defense and security.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI will give the best possible recommendations so that no
government policy will result in disturbances in the security and
defense realm," he said.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that the TNI commander was constitutionally
duty-bound to safeguard the positions of the president and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wahid met the TNI Commander General Wiranto and his
top aides here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto told reporters that he told the head of state that the
security situation in the country was improved gradually.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches New Securities Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation Limited (HKMC) Friday launched its guaranteed
mortgaged-backed securities (MBS) program, a new alternative for
banks to liquefy their residential mortgage loans in the market.
</P>
<P>
According to this program, the HKMC will buy about one billion
HK dollars (128 million U.S. dollars) of residential mortgage
loans from Dao Heng Bank Limited (DHB), the first bank joining the
program. The bank will in return acquire guaranteed notes issued
by a funding corporation of the same principal value, a HKMC
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The program provides a new alternative for banks in Hong Kong
to liquefy their residential mortgage loans in the market, thereby
providing them with a powerful new balance sheet management tool,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The mortgage-backed securities program holds special
attractions for participating banks, for investors, and for the
corporation itself." said Joseph Yam, deputy chairman of the HKMC
at the signing ceremony for the launch of the program.
</P>
<P>
The program allows the banks to keep a substantial portion of
the cash flow from mortgages while reducing the credit risk and
capital cost, he said.
</P>
<P>
For investors, Yam explained, the guarantee by the Mortgage
Corporation, with strong backing by the government, provides
protection from default, while for the corporation, the successful
launch of this new product will be useful experience for preparing
launches of more sophisticated mortgage-backed securities products
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Eyes Bond Flotation for Socialized Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday that he is eyeing the flotation of bonds to
help the government raise funds for its socialized housing
program.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the flotation of the bonds may be similar to the
successful issuance of the Economic Recovery through Agricultural
Productivity (ERAP) Bonds launched late last year, Philippine News
Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, the president authorized the National
Development Corp. to issue 50 billion pesos (1.25 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of long-term ERAP bonds to tap the support of
private banks in modernizing the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of these bonds served as an alternative for the
banking sector to comply with a law requiring them to earmark a
portion of their funds for agricultural credit.
</P>
<P>
"We have to float bonds. And this will show, like the ERAP
bonds, we were able to get more than what we expected. So that
shows the confidence of the people in my administration. So
there's no problem as far as funding is concerned," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He added this would complement his recent directives to speed
up his administration's mass shelter program, especially
socialized housing for the poor.
</P>
<P>
The president has designated mass housing as a centerpiece
program of his administration and ordered efforts accelerated to
provide the poor with decent, affordable shelter.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada ordered the lowering of interest rates for
socialized housing from 16 percent to nine percent for loans with
30-year terms covering housing units costing 180,000 pesos (4,500
dollars) or less.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was seriously wounded Friday in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
He was injured in a roadside bomb blast in the Bir Kalab on the
edge of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon and has
been transferred by helicopter to Israel for treatment, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the attack, which has raised to 60 the
number of the militia-men wounded in south Lebanon since the start
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen others were killed in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah has
since been fighting to oust Israeli troops and its ally SLA from
the country.

<HEADLINE> China to Regulate Government Intervention in Consulting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
is helping China develop a set of regulations to set the
consulting industry free from direct government intervention to
pay the way for foreign consulting firms to compete with their
Chinese counterparts on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese and international consulting companies have
jointly won a contract of the ADB program of "Regulatory Framework
for the Engagement of Consultants" in a bidding held by the
Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
They will formulate the country's first universal industry
policy and regulations on government procurement of consulting
services by August 2000.
</P>
<P>
China has prohibited all overseas individuals and entities to
directly conduct surveys in China in a bid to regulate the
consulting market.
</P>
<P>
The ADB program is designed to regulate the Chinese government'
s involvement in the selection and hiring of consultants.
</P>
<P>
Terry N. Woods, the British team leader of the ADB program,
said at a workshop in Beijing today that the program will provide
a unified framework for the fragmented consulting market in China
according to international practice, creating a fair, open and
just environment of competition for all enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Donald Mickelwait, team member and founding chairman (former)
of Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) of the United States, said
that China has promulgated the Bidding Law and is yet to draft a
set of regulations for the consulting industry. He noted that many
large international consulting companies such as Andersen
Consulting (AC) have entered China.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the consulting industry has been booming
in China, with more than 40,000 companies springing up around the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice-President of China International Economic
Consultants Co., Ltd. (CIEC) Dr. Gao Xiaosu said that there are
many problems in the fledging industry.
</P>
<P>
For example, government institutions usually award projects to
consulting organs within their own system, closing off other
consulting companies from outside the system.
</P>
<P>
She said that some bid appraisal committees consist of only
government officials and that the process of bid tendering often
lacks transparency and supervision.
</P>
<P>
Gao pointed out that excessive government intervention has led
to unreasonably low prices for consulting services, in many cases
lower than the cost, which are unmanageable for independent
consultants.
</P>
<P>
She said that the detailed bid-tendering regulations on
government procurement of consulting service will greatly promote
China's consulting market and industry.
</P>
<P>
The three consulting companies undertaking the ADB program are
CIEC, DAI and Landell Mills of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Volume of Retail Sales for August Up in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The volume of retail sales
continued to pick up in Hong Kong in August 1999, according to the
provisional figures on retail sales released today by the Hong
Kong Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total retail sales in the month was estimated at
15.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.93 billion U.S. dollars), or
eight percent lower than a year ago. Yet, after discounting the
effect of price changes over the period, the volume of total
retail sales increased by two percent in August over the same
month last year.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months of 1999 as a whole, total retail
sales decreased by 10 percent in value or four percent in volume
compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Total retail sales on a seasonally adjusted basis had an
increase of one percent in volume in the three months ending
August 1999 over the level in the three months ending May 1999.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman attributed the further pick-
up in the volume of retail sales in August 1999 to both a general
strengthening in local consumer demand and a continued revival in
inbound tourism.

<HEADLINE> China's First National Tea Culture Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The development path of China'
s tea culture in the 21st century was the theme of the National
Tea Culture Symposium, the first of its kind, which ended today in
the scenic city of Hangzhou, in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting brought together 30 organizations devoted
to tea culture from Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing municipalities
and Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guandong,
Shandong and Fujian provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiayang, director of China International Tea Culture
Research Institute, said that China's tea culture has prospered
since the reform and opening up, with more than 20 major tea
cultural societies all over the country and a large tea museum set
up in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that publications related to tea and tea culture are
popular and the media has helped revive people's interest in the
subject.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, numerous activities have been staged to spread
information about the tea culture. Between 1990 and 1998, the
International Tea Culture Symposium was held bi-annually, with
four of the meetings held in China and one in Seoul in the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the tea culture has greatly influenced the
growth of the tea industry. China recorded a tea output of 665,000
tons last year with 218,100 tons for export, up 8 percent and 7
percent on the previous year, respectively. The exports earning
grew 11.9 percent to 371 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
And a folk tea culture phenomenon is spreading with the
appearance of teahouses throughout China, Wang said. In Hangzhou
alone, more than 300 teahouses have opened in the past three years,
where people can enjoy Chinese cuisine and traditional beverages
while watching tea ceremonies.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' flag carrier,
Philippine Airlines (PAL), is looking to the United States market
to fill the possible revenue void, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
PAL president and chief operating officer Avelino Zapanta was
quoted as saying that PAL plans to increase to 10 flights a week
from the existing seven flights in order to cancel out any
possible revenue loss caused by the indefinite closure of PAL's
Taipei route.
</P>
<P>
Zapanta said three flights each will be added to the Manila-San
Francisco and Manila-Los Angeles routes, respectively, in a bid to
compensate for the revenues the PAL would have earned from its
two-flights-a-day operation in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to make it possible that there will be no
revenue loss because of what we lost from Taipei, we will gain
from the U.S. routes," Zapanta said.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, the Taiwanese civil aviation authorities issued a
resolution calling on Taiwanese airlines Eva Airways and China
Airlines to "cease and desist from flying to and from the
Philippines" due to bilateral disagreement on a new air pact.
</P>
<P>
PAL, likewise, called off all its flights to and from Taipei on
the same day.

The survey, conducted by Japan's National Police Agency, showed

<HEADLINE> Interest Tax Fails to Stimulate Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The newly-imposed tax on the
interest of savings deposits has failed to stimulate the slack
consumption market as Chinese residents are still saving instead
of spending their cash.
</P>
<P>
According to a monthly report on consumer confidence released
today by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), 60 percent of
the consumers surveyed said they would save their money when asked,
"How will you handle your extra income?"
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has begun to levy a 20 percent tax on
interest of savings deposits of Chinese and overseas residents in
China.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one percent of the consumers say that the interest tax
won't affect their tendency to save, because eight out of every
ten people are dissatisfied with their income over the past 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the low-income people are worried about the
interest tax. The poorest people felt less confident about their
future economic well-being, while the wealthiest said they are
comfortable with their current and future income.
</P>
<P>
The Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE) and the Index of
Current Economic Conditions (ICC) for the wealthiest people are
eight points higher than those for the poor.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of consumers who want to buy durable commodities fell
by five percentage points over August in September.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Consumers to Use Original Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Experts from government and
software companies today urged consumers to use original software
and improve intellectual property rights protection.
</P>
<P>
Zou Bian, secretary general of the China Software Alliance (CSA)
, said at a seminar here today that the widespread pirating of
software is mainly because of the huge market demand.
</P>
<P>
"If most of the consumers use original software, the pirating
will have no market, and then there will be no profit for pirates,
" said Zou.
</P>
<P>
Pirated software may be disastrous for consumers, noted an
official from the Beijing's WordStar, explaining that a computer
may lose important information because of a pirated software
database.
</P>
<P>
To promote the use of original software, Kingsoft recently
lowered the price of two of its new software products to 28 yuan,
which is just under wholesale cost.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to give our customers the opportunity to have
original software," said an official from the Chinese software
company.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the Chinese government and software
companies have successfully adopted a series of measures to crack
down on pirating.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar was sponsored by the Business Software Alliance
(BSA), a US-based organization of the world's leading software
manufacturers, including Intel and Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> Urgent Measures Needed to Help Zimbabwe's Poor: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa on Friday challenged participants at a meeting on
social protection to identify the most urgent actions that can be
incorporated into a program to assist the poor during the next
two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Opening the enhanced social protection program meeting in
Harare, Murerwa said the government, through the Poverty
Alleviation Action Program (PAAP), intended to embark on a
program to alleviate irreversible welfare losses for poor
households from the impact of the current macro-economic
hardships.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 62 percent of the 12.5 million
people in the country is considered poor and 46 percent is defined
as very poor.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the participants to examine possibilities of
expanding public works programs for employment creation in both
rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged them to reintroduce ways to enhance access
of the poor to basic health and education services.
</P>
<P>
"The government would need concrete proposals for consideration
 regarding interventions that are likely to benefit the poor
during this time of hardship," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Enhanced Social Protection Program was a component of the
PAAP which provided a launch pad to mobilize resources for
immediate application to arrest the negative impact of the
current harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said the participants should draw up a steering
committee which would be responsible for running this program and
to closely work with the visiting joint donor mission.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting drew participants from the donor community,
academic field and the government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Rebuild Nailless Ancient Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Using no nails, Chinese
experts have rebuilt a temple in Hebei Province to look just as it
did 1,000 years ago in the Song Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The project, which cost 33 million yuan (about four million US
dollars) and was completed in September after two years' work, is
China's second-biggest renovation of an ancient structure
following the overhaul of the Potala Palace in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Dabei Ge (pavilion) in Xinglong Temple in the province's
Zhengding County was refashioned with an ancient construction
technique that uses only bricks and wood.
</P>
<P>
Xinglong Temple is the most intact of the Song temples existing
in China today. Dabei Ge is its main building, which was
constructed in 971 and contains a 21.3-meter-high bronze statue of
the Dabei Buddha, the oldest and tallest bronze Buddha in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Dabei Ge had undergone facelifts in the Yuan (1271-1368), Ming
(1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. A 1944 remake of the
pavilion left it one-third smaller than the original, and did not
incorporate the construction techniques used during the Song
Dynasty. By the early 1990s, the deteriorating structure began to
threaten the safety of the Buddha statue and other cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Renovation of ancient buildings should preserve their
historical construction style, said Xie Fei, deputy-director of
the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
He said that there have been disagreements over whether the
current temple project should have been done with Song Dynasty
construction techniques, but in the end most of experts agreed
that it was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Beijing Institute of Ancient Structure Studies
have sketched what they believe the building first looked like
based on its foundation, size and the height of its pillars. They
also referred to a book on construction written during the Song
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The original building materials were also carefully examined.
Some 6,800 cubic meters of the original type of wood, including
Nanmu and Korean Pine, which are among the hardest woods, and also
some wood imported from Malaysia and the Philippines, were used to
replace the decayed wood.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the renovated structure can last for 200 years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Respect of Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMBRIDGE, Britain, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said Friday that diversity is the very reason why the
world is full of competition, vigor and innovation.
</P>
<P>
"In the 20th century, while mankind has created material and
spiritual wealth unmatched by any other time in history.
Regrettably, it is also in these 100 years that humanity has
experienced unprecedented hardships, particularly the havoc of the
two world wars," Jiang said in a speech at University of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
However, it is always the people of the world that make and
write world history and in this sense, justice will inevitably
prevail over evil, light over darkness and progress over
backwardness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mankind will undoubtedly keep on overcoming difficulties and
obstacles, blaze new trails and steadily move forward to a better
future, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the dawn of the 21st century, Jiang said, the people of the
world still face many tough challenges, but definitely they also
see enormous opportunities for development.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the people of the world work in unison and form a
strong force to tackle all challenges, mankind with its
civilization will continue to march forward at high speed against
all odds, like a ship braving the wind and the waves," the Chinese
president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the world is colorful and diversified and that
people of different countries have traversed different roads of
historical development.
</P>
<P>
Each nation with its own cultural background, social system and
value, will continue to lead life in its own way, said Jiang,
adding that this diversity is the very reason why the world is
full of competition, vigor and innovation.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should enhance exchanges and understanding, and move
ahead together on the basis of mutual respect and equality,
instead of allowing the diversity to be a barrier to their forward
march, still less should they deliberately provoke confrontation
and conflict," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
To respect and develop the diversity of world civilization and
identify therefrom common interests are a great driving force
propelling human society forward, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard world peace and promote common development, all
countries must comply with the universally recognized basic norms
governing international relations, including the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence and the purposes and principles of the UN
Charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The affairs of a country should be dealt with by the people of
that country, and international affairs should be settled through
consultation by all countries and regions concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to adhere to the principle of equality and
mutual benefit in conducting international economic exchanges, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In formulating new rules guiding international economic
activities and trade, the reasonable demands of the vast number of
developing countries should be fully reflected, as they are under-
developed in terms of economy and technology and at a disadvantage,
and attention should be paid to the protection of their legitimate
rights and interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the statesmen of all countries will pay
attention to the very urgent issue of gradually narrowing the
widening gap between North and South economically," he said. "This
problem, if not solved, is bound to inflict a big negative impact
on the steady growth of the global economy, and make it impossible
for mankind to achieve common development and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
To maintain international security, it is essential to discard
the Cold-war mentality and work to build a lasting peace for the
international community on the basis of a new security concept
featuring the promotion of mutual trust and common interests of
all countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential to build confidence through dialogue, seek
security through cooperation, respect each other's sovereignty and
settle dispute through peaceful means," the Chinese president said.

<P>
CAMBRIDGE, Britain, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Friday that it is absolutely necessary to
know the basic Chinese values in order to have a good
understanding of what has happened and what will happen in China.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the University of Cambridge, Jiang said that the
Chinese nation has always valued human dignity and value. Even in
the ancient days, Chinese ancestors came up with the idea of
people being most important, believing that "man is the most
valuable among all things that heaven fosters", he said.
</P>
<P>
The immense vitality displayed by China today is a vivid
reflection of the broad freedoms and democratic rights enjoyed by
the Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For several thousand years, to provide for the people's need
for food, clothing, housing and transport has all along been the
primary human rights challenge for successive governments in
Chinese history," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In today's China, top priority should still be given to
ensuring the greatest possible majority of its people the rights
to subsistence and development, he said, adding that otherwise
there would be no other rights to speak of.
</P>
<P>
While collective and individual human rights have to go hand in
hand and their coordinated development should be pursued, he said,
so do economic, social and cultural rights on the one hand and
civil and political rights on the other.
</P>
<P>
This is in keeping with China's specific national conditions
and is therefore the only way to progress in the human rights
cause in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has persistently pursued an independent
national spirit and road to development, said Jiang, adding that "
we, the Chinese people, regard independence as the foundation on
which to build the country".
</P>
<P>
Independence and self-reliance should not rule out learning
from other countries and drawing upon the fruits of world
civilization since the two are complementary to each other, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it must be pointed out that the absorption and
learning process is by no means one of simple imitation and China
can not copy the development model of Western capitalist countries,
nor can it mechanically follow other countries' models of building
socialism, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, it must take a road to development that is
suited to its national conditions, namely the road to building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, which we have found
through long-term practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese will move forward unswervingly along this road,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has always valued the great unity of all the
ethnic groups and the reunification of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since ancient times, people of 56 ethnic groups have toiled and
multiplied on the vast land of China. They have helped each other
and learned from each other over long years and thus formed a
unitary multi-ethnic country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The preservation of solidarity and unity of the Chinese nation
is the very foundation for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation and is where the fundamental interests of the people of all
ethnic groups lie, he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great forerunner of the Chinese
democratic revolution and the founder of the Kuomintang (the
Nationalist Party) as saying that "China is a unitary country.
This has already been deeply etched in its historical identity. It
is this identity that has kept us together as one nation."
</P>
<P>
It is the unshakable will of all the Chinese people to
ultimately resolve the Taiwan question under the principle of "
peaceful reunification, one country two systems" and accomplish
the great cause of national reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation always loves freedom and peace, said Jiang,
adding that "it is our hope that the people of all countries can
live in a world free from war and violence and free from
suppression, discrimination and bullying".
</P>
<P>
A developed, strong and prosperous China will pose no threat to
anyone, and it will only promote world peace, stability and
development. "China will never seek hegemony. This is a solemn
commitment of the Chinese people to the world", Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
As the road to socialist development and the basic domestic and
foreign policies chosen and followed by the Chinese people have
their origin in the logical development of modern China and in the
fine national tradition of the Chinese nation formed over
thousands of years, they are well founded and firmly grounded in
terms of both history and realities, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Judge Selection System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
According to the five-year reform plan, China is also
pushing for a new selection system for collegiate bench's chief
judge, who is to be held responsible for his own court rulings.
</P>
<P>
Until now, most judges in China have had to resort to court
presidents for approval of verdicts before they can be announced.
Under the reform, a court president has no right to change or veto
verdicts of collegiate benches, but the judicial committee of the
court does.
</P>
<P>
 "All these measures are aimed at creating competition among
judges and ensuring true justice," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Functionaries with overlapping roles inside courts will be
streamlined in the next five years and the unqualified will be
dismissed, accoding to the reform plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan also cover the reforms of trial procedure, court
documents, internal checks and balances, a people's jury system
and regulation of other court staff.
</P>
<P>
"These judicial reforms are an important part of China's
political restructuring," Zhu said, noting four guiding principles
must be adhered to: the leadership of the Communist Party of China,
the system of the people's congress, the unity of the state legal
system, and proceeding from the conditions in China and learning
from the experience of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"People's courts should become courts of the state after the
reform, instead of tools of local self-interest," Zhu said.

<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The world auto sports governing
body FIA on Friday held a hearing on the appeal made by the
Formula One team Ferrari over its disqualification from the
Malaysian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The team's British driver Eddie Irvine made a surprise
appearance at the hearing along with Ferrari sporting director
Jean Todt, technical director Ross Brawn and other team technical
experts.
</P>
<P>
The five judges named by FIA were chairman Jose Maceda e Cunha
of Portugal, Austrian Gerhard Nurscher, Philippe Roberti de Winghe
of Belgium, Greek Vassilis Koussis and Jan Van Rosmalen of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Irvine and Michael Schumacher made a 1-2 finish for Ferrari at
the Sepang track in Malaysia on Sunday but both were disqualified
for their cars' infringements on FIA technical regulations.
</P>
<P>
If the Ferrari team wins the appeal, Irvine would start the
last race in Japan four points ahead of McLaren driver Mika
Hakkinen with the title still undecided.
</P>
<P>
If they lose, Hakkinen will become the overall season winner
with the Japan leg remaining.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of university
students from Beijing, the national capital, will pay a visit to
Taiwan soon, according to the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC)
today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, known as the Capital University Students
Exchange Delegation, is composed of students from Beijing
University, Qinghua University, Beijing Normal University and the
Central Academy of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
Via the Taiwan Red Cross Society, the delegation will give a
donation of 100,000 HK dollars to a local Jinan University, whose
lab caught fire Friday morning following an aftershock from the
September 21 earthquake, a RCSC news release said.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross organizations from the two sides have exchanged
letters about the issue. In his letter, Taiwan's Red Cross leader
Guan Zhengqi thanked the students and expressed his gratitude for
the third 500,000 U.S. dollar donation from the RCSC.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC once again called on its Taiwan to send people to the
mainland to discuss about its relief efforts to Taiwan's quake
victims shortly after today's aftershocks in the island.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Judge Selection System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of a nationwide
reform to open trials to public scrutiny, China today took another
step in the overhaul of its judicial system by changing the way of
selecting judges and giving them more free rein in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, all the Chinese courts must adopt a
system which requires that higher court judges be selected from
among the most-qualified judges of lower courts, or high-
performance lawyers, or other high-level legal professionals.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Mingshan, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court,
China's highest court, announced the decision here today at a
press conference publicizing a "five-year reform package of the
people's courts."
</P>
<P>
The existing practice of choosing judges from a pool of
court staff employees will be completely abolished in five years,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The SPC also plans to select only a small number of the
existing 170,000 judges to be high-ranking, Zhu said, adding that
they must be highly proficient, experienced and capable of
independently adjudicating lawsuits. The others will be assistants
to the elite judges.
</P>
<P>
"This reform needs changes to the law and cannot be
accomplished only by courts," Zhu said.  This new system is very
similar to practices in many Western countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Lifts Ban on Foreign Exchange Remittance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Central Bank has lifted
a ban on foreign exchange remittance by non-Nigerians as a
demonstration of its commitment to a liberalized economy.
</P>
<P>
The ban was lifted on Thursday and took immediate effect in
order to encourage foreign investment, the Guardian newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has not allowed foreigners to repatriate their
interests, profits, dividends and capital proceeds for a minimum
period of between five and 10 years since the establishment of the
Debt Conversion Program (DCP) in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the amendment would boost foreigners'
confidence in the program, which is a veritable tool for reducing
the external debt estimated at 31 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They added that the policy change would further encourage those
affected to invest some of the proceeds in the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank said that the immediate repatriation
of dividend and interest incomes arising from investment under the
program would be subject to the laws of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Senate President has
called on professionals to give support to the government's
anti-corruption crusade, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Evan Enwerem said he was convinced that no fraud could be
committed if professionals, like accountants, refused to collude
with unscrupulous individuals.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking when he met with the President of the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria Adeboye Badejo on Thursday in
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"In view of their positions and responsibilities, professionals
have a responsibility to ensure that they don't collaborate or
collude with criminally minded people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professionals should lead in the anti-corruption crusade and
should live up to their duties and responsibilities in the effort
to raise moral standards in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ICAN president said besides the efforts to enact an
anti-corruption bill by the government, there was the need to put
in place mechanisms to ensure that the financial transactions of
government establishments were not only efficiently executed but
also promptly audited yearly.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- World-known auction house
Sotheby's announced today it will hold its Fall 1999 Asia Week
Hong Kong next week, following its successful spring auction here
in April.
</P>
<P>
A press briefing was held today to give the press a preview of
several highlights selected from the more than 1,900 lots to be
sold in Sotheby's upcoming Fall auction, which is to be held from
October 29 to December 2 at the Conrad International.
</P>
<P>
Works of art for auction include important classical Chinese
paintings and calligraphy, fine modern and contemporary Chinese
paintings, fine Chinese ceramics and works of art, important and
magnificent jewels and jadeite, and important watches.
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching piece is a blue-and-white porcelain flask
which dates back to the Yongle period (1403-1424) of the Ming
Dynasty. Because there are only two porcelain flasks of this
exotic design existing in the world, specialists valued it at
about 10 million HK dollars (1.28 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another important piece for auction is a rare work by popular
Chinese painter Zhang Daqian, whose hidden treasure masterpiece
Snow in the Spring Mountain has already received international
attention.
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's, the first international auction house in Asia,
conducted the first auction in the region in 1973. Today, regular
auctions in Asia are held twice a year (Spring and Autumn) in

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Students in Thailand to Be Resettled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will implement a
resettlement policy on Myanmar students staying in the kingdom,
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy will be implemented on a voluntary basis and
Thailand will not force all Myanmar students to resettle in a
third country.
</P>
<P>
Chuan's statement came after an announcement by the National
Security Council on Thursday that all Myanmar students in Thailand
were required to register their names with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) by November 21 so that they
would not face illegal entry charge and be eligible for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said the announcement is a new
cooperative policy with the UNHCR, aiming at helping the students
to have a chance to further their studies and develop themselves
in third countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra said
during an interview with local television station iTV on Friday
that it's time for the Thai government to take back the "generous
rights" previously granted to Myanmar students living in this
country.
</P>
<P>
He said some Myanmar students have misused the generosity,
causing incessant problems in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A group of heavily-armed Myanmar students recently seized the
Myanmar embassy to Bangkok, holding some 38 people hostage. The
Thai government then agreed to fly the students to the
Thai-Myanmar border in exchange for the hostages' freedom.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand offered himself to accompany the armed students to
board the helicopter, which took them to the border.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 3,000 Myanmar students in Thailand, some
2,700 of which have registered with the UNHCR, but most do not
stay in the designated site, the Maneeloy Holding Center in the
western Thai province of Rachaburi, bordering Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada, Australia and the European Union
have expressed willingness to resettle the Myanmar students.

HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong stock market
sharply gained 340.08 points or 2.72 percent at 12,863.08 today.
</P>
<P>
The index jumped in the last 45 minutes of trade in short-
covering, and it was helped by some bargain-hunting in a market
that had been under selling pressure ahead of the launch of the
government unit trust -- the Tracker Fund, according to the
analysts here.
</P>
<P>
The turnover also rose heavily to 9.171 billion HK dollars (1.
175 billion U.S. dollars), up 1.559 billion HK dollars (200
million U.S. dollars), from Thursday's 7.612 billion HK dollars (
975 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sub-indices of finance, utilities, properties and commerce and
industry increased by 1.81 percent, 2.90 percent, 3.54 percent and
3.24 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
China-related shares closed higher with the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index up 3.50 percent and Hang Seng China-Affiliated

<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Terry Fox Run, also known
as the "Marathon of Hope", will make its official debut in China
when Beijing hosts the event on November 6 to raise funds for
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 participants including 2,000 local cancer patients
will walk, run, cycle, use wheel chairs or roller blades during a
10-km journey starting from the Workers' Stadium to the Chinese
Cancer Institute (CCI) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Terry Fox, who lost his right leg to bone cancer, became the
Canadian national hero after he travelled crossed Canada on an
artificial leg to raise money for cancer research in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Following his death in 1981, volunteers began holding runs once
a year to commemorate his feat and raise funds for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that the Chinese capital hosts the
charity race on such a large scale with all the proceeds to go to
the CCI, who co-hosts the race with the Canadian Embassy to China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, in addition to the money raised by 4,500 runs in
Canada, 400 runs in 54 countries and regions have contributed more
than 5 million U.S. dollars, according to the embassy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Some cities in north China
reported better air quality earlier this week, which can be
attributed to strong winds that helped to disperse pollutants,
according to a report released today by the China Environment
Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
However, air quality in north China began to decline when the
weather turned sunny with gentle breezes late this week, the
report said.

From October 15-21, the six cities of Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Beihai,
Ningbo, Xiamen and Haikou reported excellent air quality. Changsha,
Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Yinchuan, Changchun and

<HEADLINE> China Discovers Big Pagoda Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have found a
group of 51 pagoda pedestals at an excavation site near the
mausoleum of the Xixia emperor in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The experts uncovered some small figures of Buddha and cone-
shaped pagoda forms from the clay pedestals, along with some
crushed bones and ashes, today's Guangming Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 3,000 square meters, the 51 pagoda
pedestals are situated on a hillside around Helan Mountains in
Ningxia where the Xixia emperor's mausoleum was located.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists' research, the pagodas were built
in different periods spanning from the Xixia to Yuan dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Xixia was established in the 11th century by a number of ethnic
groups in what is now Ningxia, and was conquered by the Yuan
Dynasty in 1227.
</P>
<P>
The pagoda group will be useful in the research of Tibetan
Buddhism and the communication and evolution of the Xixia culture,
said Du Yubing, deputy director of the Ningxia Archaeology
Research Institute.

<HEADLINE> London-Nigeria Air Route Lucrative, Says Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The London-Nigeria route has been
 described by a London-based private airline, Virgin Atlantic, as
"one of the most lucrative in the world."
</P>
<P>
The airline, which has repeatedly expressed its wish to operate
flights on the route, believes that travellers are currently
"paying too much for their flights." It attributed the situation
to British Airways (BA) monopoly on the route, reported the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Apparently reacting to the agreement signed by BA and Nigerian
Airways, the airline decried the absence of competition with BA
on the route from the United Kingdom, saying: "We would like to
fly to Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic, owned by Richard Branson, tried to secure an
agreement with Nigeria Airways before the advent of democratic
governance but staff and management of the national carrier
allegedly kicked against the move for fear that it could lead to
its takeover.
</P>
<P>
Following the subsisting agreement, BA announced that it will
double the number of flights it operates on behalf of Nigeria
Airways to six a week, bringing the total number from London to
Nigeria to 13 a week.

strategic arms race in the world.

In a speech to the Institute of High Studies of National

field of strategic armament.

Jospin said that France is concerned about the "reticence" of
the governments of numerous countries, including the U.S. Senate,
to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which bans all nuclear
tests in the world.
</P>

He also noted "a slow down in the implementation of the START

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The cholera is spreading from
Bossaso to Garoweh in Somalia's northeastern region known as
Puntland.
</P>
<P>
In Garoweh town, more than 15 cholera cases were reported
Friday alone with one fatality. According to the local health
authorities in Bossaso, more than 25 people fall for the disease
everyday in the northeastern town alone.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Saeed of the Bossaso hospital told reporters Friday
that the rampant disease affects mainly children, women and
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
Four people have died for the disease inside the quarantine
ward, while eight more died without any treatment in the
residential quarters of the town Thursday alone, according to the
hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors attributed the quick spread of Cholera to the
rainy season, which is affecting Puntland and Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
Another element facilitating the easy spread of the disease is
the movement of people from a town to another carrying the cholera
germ along with them.
</P>
<P>
The task force representing local authorities in collaboration
with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) is chlorinating the shallow water wells.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors have been informing the people not to eat any
uncovered food, which they said could be contaminated by the
cholera germ.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 people have so far been affected by the disease
since mid- August this year, with fatalities exceeding 60.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices fell marginally
on Singapore Stock Market Friday amid lingering market concerns
about signs of weakness on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dipped 0.12 points to
end at 2,017.38 points in quiet tradings.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 136.15 million units worth 329.28
million Singapore dollars (about 197.47 million U.S. dollars).
There were 157 falls against 104 rises with 188 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 15.43 million parcel by AFP which was
transacted at 0.52 U.S. dollars per share. It was followed by Gen
Int which had 6.69 million shares done. ST Engg was the next with
6.64 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH was the top mover of the day climbing by 50 cents to close
at 28.90 Singapore dollars. Asean and PacCent picked up 35 cents

</P>
<P>
The market opened firmer buoyed by the election of opposition
leader Megawati Sukarnopputri as Indonesia's vice president.
</P>
<P>
However, rising movement lasted only briefly as late
profit-taking quickly wiped out early gains amid the absence of
fresh buying incentives.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said concerns about signs of weakness on Wall Street
continued to weigh on market sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Completes Troops Pullout from Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Thursday withdrew its
last batch of troops in west Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
With the return of last batch of the Nigerian soldiers, Liberia
has no ECOMOG troops from other west African countries.
</P>
<P>
The 61 officers and soldiers were welcomed at the Nnamdi
Azikiwe International Airport in capital Abuja by Nigeria's Chief
of Defense Staff, Rear Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo will next Monday decorate
all former commanders and troops of the Nigerian contingent, the
Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Before their coming back, the troops were involved in security
operations in Liberia and guarding of the arms and ammunition
recovered during the disarmament of the former warring factions
there.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian contingent to the ECOMOG first arrived in Liberia
in August 1990. They were involved in full peace enforcement and
peace-keeping operations till the cessation of civil war and
subsequent election of President Charles Taylor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Defense Minister Theophilus Danjuma said last week
that the soldiers of his country would be pulled out of Sierra
Leone by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The initial pullout of troops from Sierra Leone was suspended
last month on the request of Sierra Leonean President Alhaji Tejan
Kabbah and the United Nations, Danjuma said. But he added that it
will resume next week.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian soldiers constitute the backbone of the 12,000 strong
ECOMOG force in Sierra Leone, which has been keeping President
Kabbah in power since early 1998.

published and distributed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in August, government departments helped to
transfer 1,000 figures of Buddha from Nepal to China to meet the

"Let's continue to pursue the enemy and fight them to the
finish," Chief of General Staff of the General Joao de Matos said
Thursday during his visits to Bailundo and Andulo, which have just
been taken over by the government troops in an all-out offensive
starting from September 14.
</P>
<P>
Bailundo, in Huambo Province, and Andulo, in Bie Province,
traditional bastions of the rebel National Union for Total

out, were conquered by the government troops respectively on
September 24 and at last weekend.

The visits to the two towns by Matos and other high-ranking

result of war, evaluate the combative preparations of the troops
and encourage the soldiers to keep their brave spirit until the
total defeat of the Savimbist forces.

<HEADLINE> France Asks Switzerland to Extradite Former Nazi Collaborator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- France has asked the Swiss
authorities to extradite as quickly as possible Maurice Papon, a
former Nazi collaborator who was arrested early Friday morning
near Berne.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has called President of the Swiss
Confederation Ruth Dreifuss, asking her to make sure that Maurice
Papon be repatriated to French soil as soon as possible," said a
source of the French government.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 89, was reportedly hospitalized in Berne shortly after
his arrest by Swiss federal police in a hotel in Gstaad near Berne.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement is also in
constant contact with his Swiss counterpart over Papon's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
Papon fled to Switzerland last week to escape a final judgment
by the French supreme court, the Cour de Cassation, which rejected
his appeal and made his condemnation definite on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was condemned in April 1998 by an Assize Court in Bordeaux
for complicity in crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Papon helped deport 1,560 Jews from the Gironde region in
southwest France to Nazi death camps, when he was a senior
official of the Vichy collaboration regime during World War II.

HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University (PolyU) inaugurated its school of Professional
Education and Executive Development (SPEED) Friday to expand its
professional and continuing education programs to meet the
increasing demand for lifelong education.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established SPEED embraces the University's former
Center for Professional and Continuing Education and all self-
financed programs offered by faculties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony for the inauguration of SPEED, PolyU
President Poon Chung-kwong emphasized the importance of lifelong
education as not only a means to self-fulfillment but also a
crucial factor to maintaining the competitiveness of Hong Kong as
"knowledge-based" economy.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anthony Tam, director of SPEED, said the PolyU observed a
consistent trend of steadily increasing demand for professional
and continuing education courses in the community, especially from
the workforce.
</P>
<P>
The PolyU said its professional and continuing education
courses have always proved to be popular among the workforce.
While the number of courses increased from 340 in 1993/1994 to 711
in 1998/99, the number of students enrolled in these programs also
increased from 8,687 to 17,365 during the same period.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: High Hopes on New Leadership to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The election of president and
vice president has generated hope that the new leadership can
usher in a new era in stability in Indonesia which has been
experiencing multidimensional difficulties for almost two years
since the outbreak of the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The combination of Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati Soekarnoputri
as president and vice president respectively will provide an
effective national leadership in the country, political observers
said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, general chairman of the country's largest Muslim
organization Nahdlatul Ulama (Council of Scholars) with around 30
million members, was elected the country's number one person on
October 20 by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). He is the
one who demonstrated an ability to work with virtually all the
other contenders and factions.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, eldest daughter of the country's late founding
president Soekarno, leads the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle, the House's largest political party which won the June
general election with about 34 percent votes.
</P>
<P>
Most observers here believed that Wahid and Megawati could get
along personally and politically and therefore they could lead
Indonesia out of its present crisis.
</P>
<P>
"They have forged a close personal relationship. Since their
parties encompass the Muslim and nationalist forces, they will be
able to accommodate the interests and aspirations of Indonesia's
two major political groups," said Arbi Sanit, a political observer
from the University of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Political stability is fundamental to Indonesia's economic
stability and growth. The world's fourth most populous country
suffered the worst fallout in Asia's financial crisis over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy contracted almost 14 percent in 1998 and
has been wracked by political and ethnic strife. A survey showed
that the economy could contract another one percent this year
before returning to a 3.3 percent expansion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I truly hope that the democratic presidential election will
give us political stability as a basic requirement for economic
recovery. Without political stability, it will be difficult for
anyone to make a success of this country's economic development,"
a prominent economic observer Didik Rachbini said.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge for the new government is how to preserve the
national unity.
</P>
<P>
Separatist movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya provinces have
become problems of Indonesian integration. The MPR has ordered the
government to pay special attention to problems in these two
regions and a similar one in Maluku province.
</P>
<P>
In his brief inaugural speech on Wednesday, Wahid emphasized
national unity while developing national self-esteem. Most
politicians expressed the hope that the new leadership will be
able to resolve problems of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Wahid had a brain surgery after experiencing a stroke in
January 1998. Some people worry about his poor health, thinking
his health will not permit him to govern energetically, to bring
about fundamental, enduring change in the government and political
systems.
</P>
<P>
But, most people hold that with a professional and strong
cabinet as well as free from the tradition of corruption, the new
president is able to lead the country out of the current political
and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In any case, so far it seems that the forces of reform are well
on the way to gaining a solid upper hand over the status quo. The
first task the new leadership must undertake is to work toward
true reconciliation among the various components of society, to
restore stability and mend the economy.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believed that the new government would pass
through the transition to a strong and democratic government in
the future.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Goods Market Gathering Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer goods market
has been gathering steam in recent months, with the price index
reversing its long-term downward trend and retail sales increasing.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts regard the changes as important signs of a better
overall economic situation, while others remain cautious, saying
that it is hard to draw a clear conclusion from the fluctuating
price index.
</P>
<P>
In some big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Qingdao
and Hangzhou, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Price
Index (RPI), two key indicators of market situation, climbed in
June to almost reach last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the National Bureau of Statistics also show that
the price index's declining trend was basically checked in June,
and it went up by 0.8 percentage point in July, the first time
after 25-month drop.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the positive change remained stable in
Beijing, Shanghai and a number of other big cities, and that the
price index is likely to go up further. But the nationwide
deflation is not likely to stop soon, they say.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figures show that the country's retail sales in
September reached 260 billion yuan, up 6.6 percent from the same
period last year. The market sales are growing with increasing
speed.
</P>
<P>
Expert attributed the change to government policies to
stimulate consumption, such as increasing income of the low and
medium-level income groups and levying interest tax. The two
traditional Chinese festivals, the Moon Festival and the 50th
anniversary celebration of the People's Republic in late September
and early October, also stimulate people to spend more money for
the week-long holidays.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Third National

and if the fund is approved, it would be submitted to the
Civil-Private Sector Council chaired by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad whose new vision is to make Malaysia a major food
producer.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the federal and state governments would
jointly develop food production and agriculture technology parks.
</P>
<P>

zones for long term food production.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says U.S. Needs Africa As Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States needs African
 countries as partners, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said here Friday after talking with Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
"I reiterate the importance of African countries," Albright
said. "It is in America's interest to help their democratization
process."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. official did not promise any aid to Kenya,
saying that U.S. has a stringent budget this year.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed her delight at Moi's efforts to revive the
economy, which included naming Richard Leaky as head of civil
service and other technocrats as senior officials in major
ministries.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that "the largest number of Kenyans" could
participate in the ongoing constitutional review in Kenya, which
is the controversial political issue in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said that America supported Kenya's leadership in
Inter- Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) process
towards resolving Sudan's civil war.
</P>
<P>
She pledged that America would continue to finance peace talks
sponsored by the IGAD.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Nairobi on Wednesday night, then flew to
Dar es Salaam to attend the state funeral of former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the last stop on her six-African-nation tour. In
Nairobi, Albright is believed to concentrate on issues of
governance and economy.

<HEADLINE> Rocketing Inflation Challenges Zimbabwean Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Inflation, which stands at 69.7
percent, has remained the biggest challenge facing the country's
economy in the fight against poverty and unemployment, Zimbabwean
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Year 2000 budget, the finance minister said the
spiral in the rate of inflation now requires the government,
labor, commerce and industry to come together and map out a social
contract to bring it down to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
As part of the social contract, the government will, on the one
hand, make a firm commitment that it would not overspend, while on
the other hand, industry and commerce would refrain from
increasing prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said there was no reason why Zimbabwe should fail to
arrest the inflationary spiral and bring it down to single-digit
levels.
</P>
<P>
He compared the inflation problem to the silent killer - high
blood pressure - and called for "total" and "immediate" response
to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
"The poor are getting poorer as their incomes are eroded by
very high inflation levels. Our response to this menace must be
total and immediate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe has great potential with all its diverse people,
mineral wealth, tourist attractions and as a breadbasket of this
region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has risen to 69.7 percent by September this year from
44.6 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
It is now difficult for the country to meet the 30 percent
target agreed between the Zimbabwean government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The increase in inflation has been attributed mainly to the
depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar, which resulted in the
soaring of prices of goods and services and the over-reliance on
domestic borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said the increase in inflation has also made it
difficult for the government to pursue the goal of socio-economic
transformation and sustainable growth.

<HEADLINE> China May Introduce New Rules for Non-IPO Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's securities market
watchdog is considering a new policy for non-initial public
offering (IPO) of A shares, if an experiment by the Shenzhen Konka
Group Co., Ltd succeeds, Xinhua learned here today.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Beijing-based China International
Capital Corporation (CICC), the company has started a revolution
in China's securities market by introducing the international
practice in underwriting Konka's 80 million new A shares.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous non-IPOs, in which the new shares were
allocated among prior shareholders at a price usually 40-50
percent lower than the market value, Konka's former shareholders
would not participate in the allocation. But they can bid on the
stock exchange as do the ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
A second difference relates to pricing. Instead of the usual
fixed price, the price of Konka's new shares will be negotiated
between the underwriter and institutional investors based on the
current market value of the Konka A Share listed on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange and at a discount of not higher than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of the these new stocks will be offered to general
investors on the stock exchange. Based on the bidding, the
underwriter will decide on the shares for institutional and
general investors.
</P>
<P>
The underwriter has been strictly following the international
practice of "China Wall" -- a system that restricts information in
order to prevent manipulation and misleading of investors by the
underwriter.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts here said if Konka's experiment succeeds,
it would be a major step by China in regulating its securities
market in accordance with the international standards and would
help find a better balance between the interests of issuers and
investors.

<P>
BEIRUT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese bank official has
assured that his country's banks, financial institutions, public
services and airport are fully prepared for the Y2K bug, the
Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I can confidently say that the country has passed the danger
point because most institutions have upgraded their systems in
anticipation of the millennium bug," said Samuellian Haroutuan,
the third vice-governor of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Banks have tested their systems and arranged for contingency
plans, while similar measures have been adopted by the state
electricity company, the Civil Aviation Department and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"Both the private and public sectors are aware of the
seriousness of the problem," Haroutuan said, adding the World Bank
has expressed its satisfaction with the measures adopted by banks
and other firms in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has asked banks and financial companies to
cancel the vacations of their computer technicians over the New
Year's holiday to ensure that computer systems operate normally.
</P>
<P>
There is a 3-5 percent probability of a breakdown in computer
systems, said Haroutuan.
</P>
<P>
"But this ratio is normal. All banks have prepared back-up
files in case of a failure," the official added.

WUHAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Wuhan Customs office in China
's Hubei Province has dealt with more than 80 smuggling cases
involving goods valued at 1.2 billion yuan (144 million U.S.
dollars) since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Customs officers deal with four open ports in the cities
of Wuhan, Hubei's capital, Huangshi, Yichang, and E'zhou, which
are important transportation centers on the Yangtze River. In the
past few years, smugglers have been using the Yangtze for
smuggling more goods.
</P>
<P>
An anti-smuggling bureau consisting of public security and
Customs personnel was established in late June this year to crack
down harder on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has handled 11 smuggling cases with goods worth 500
million yuan in the past three months and several dozen people
have been detained and 700 million yuan in unpaid taxes recovered.

<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A 70-year-old Chinese woman
will be the oldest student in the MBA program this fall semester
at China's University of International Business and Economics.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenhua, a retired director of the Beijing Forklift General
Plant, said she isn't as interested in getting a diploma as she is
in learning something completely new, according to today's China
Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
"I have been working in heavy industry for half a century, and
experienced the change from a planned economy to a market economy,
" she said. "My high school diploma hasn't helped me to thoroughly
understand what the market economy is."
</P>
<P>
At first, Wang thought her age might get in the way of
acceptance. However, the university not only admitted her, it also
waived her tuition of 17,050 yuan and supplied her books and other
materials for free.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 100 students in the program are office workers
between the ages of 25-45. Half of them have degrees from
technical schools, said an official with the university.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police are investigating threats received by
National Fraud Squad chief Miri Golan, in which callers threatened
to blown her up in her car if she continues the current
investigation of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and his wife Sara issued a statement Thursday night
condemning the threats, shortly after police had finished
questioning them for eight hours over dozens of valuables found at
their home and Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Council of Settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip completed the evacuation of five unpopulated outposts in the
West Bank Thursday as agreed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise deal, the settlement council has to
dismantle 10 of the 42 outposts set up without government approval
since the signing the Wye agreement in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak held a meeting Thursday
with several of his ministers to discuss the ways and means of
setting up a border fence between Israel and a future
Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, senior police officials presented alternate
possibilities for setting up such a fence system. Barak's
spokesman said that while no concrete decisions were taken, the
fact that the meeting took place was a sign that Barak was
beginning to translate his theoretical ideas about separation into
reality.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel held various memorial activities Thursday to mark the
fourth anniversary of the assassination of late prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin. Prime Minister Ehud Barak pledged to carry out

again lead to disaster.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Papon Arrested in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Papon, the former pro-
Nazi Vichy official who fled France to escape court trial for his
role in sending Jews to Nazi death camps, has been arrested in
Switzerland, Swiss federal police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 89, was arrested in the Swiss Bernese Oberland,
according to the Federal Police Office, which said it was acting
on an international arrest warrant issued the previous day in
Bordeaux, France, after Papon failed to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
More details would be reportedly announced later Friday.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman has said that should Papon be
found and detained in Switzerland, the Swiss government will very
likely approve extradition to France, where Papon was found guilty
of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that extradition would likely be approved
for political reasons since Swiss law does not cover crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of France in Paris ruled that Papon lost his
right of appeal by failing to report to prison as required before
Thursday's hearing. Under French law, the court ruling
automatically confirms the conviction and it can no longer be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
Papon was convicted in April 1998 for complicity in crimes
against humanity for his role in the deportation of 1,590 Jews
from the city of Bordeaux. Most of the deportees later perished at
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
The Bordeaux court freed Papon during his trial and appeals
process, a controversial decision that led to his flight and now
is widely criticized.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the court issued an arrest warrant for Papon, who
left France for Switzerland last week. His precise whereabouts had
been unknown.

<HEADLINE> UK Threatens to Suspend Aid to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
threatened to suspend its assistance to Uganda if the forthcoming
referendum in the east African country turns out flawed.
</P>
<P>
A flawed referendum would not only have negative implications
for future levels of his country's assistance to Uganda, but also
impede the development of bilateral relations,  British High
Commissioner to Uganda, Michael Cook, warned recently.
</P>
<P>
Britain is Uganda's top European trading partner and bilateral
trade was about 100 million U.S. dollars last year, the Monitor
newspaper said Friday. Britain's assistance to Uganda constitutes
a big part of all the donations from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that his office has prepared a set of benchmarks by
which they shall assess the fairness of the referendum slated for
June of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the sets of benchmarks have been given to the Ugandan
 government and the secretariat of the ruling National Resistance
Movement, the British envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Britain believes that multi-party democracy is
the political system which offers to a country the best guarantee
of transparent and accountable governance.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Ugandan opposition politicians in
Kampala last week, Peter Hain, British State Minister for African
Affairs and Commonwealth, said that Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni had promised to bring back multi-party system by the year
2007.
</P>
<P>
However, Museveni denied saying such thing in a letter
published in the New Vision, a leading daily in the land-locked
African country.

<HEADLINE> Five Officials Charged with Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Five officials charged with
corruption and accepting bribes in Hangzhou, capital of east China
's Zhejiang Province, have received jail terms ranging from seven
to 12 years on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The five officials who were overseeing the renovation of a
section of embankment on the Qiantang River, a major waterway in
the province, allegedly took money and gifts from contractors and
awarded the project to unqualified contractors who used mud
instead of concrete for the reinforcement of the embankment.
</P>
<P>
Charged with the crimes were Chen Yong, the general manager of
the Hangzhou Water Conservation Engineering and Construction
Cooperation, Qian Zhenzhong, the chief of the Hangzhou embankment
construction administration office, and three others.
</P>
<P>
The provincial water conservation department has stripped the
Hangzhou Water Conservation Engineering and Construction
Cooperation of its right to participate in any construction
bidding and fined the company 200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of supervising the construction also faced
administrative disciplinary action and the supervisors were
dismissed and the qualifications certificates of some of them
were revoked.
</P>
<P>
The project to reinforce the Qiantang River embankment began
last year. The work is expected to help prevent flooding in
Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain, the Ningbo-Shaoxing Plain, southern
Jiangsu province and Shanghai along the lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The GDP of the area concerned accounts for 40 percent of the
provincial total.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not Ready for Free Trade Area: Manufactures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Association of
Manufacturers has declared that Zambia is not ready for the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Free Trade Area
scheduled for October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
At an annual general meeting of the association in Lusaka
recently, some members said that there is no way local producers
who are disadvantaged in many ways are going to sustain their
operations if they would have to compete with goods which easily
get into the local market.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers have since cautioned the Zambian government
to seriously review the country's position before fully committing
itself to 100 percent zero rating.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Zambia's current crop of companies and growing
business houses cannot compete with the other stronger firms of
the region, Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A number of Zambian companies are experiencing big problems and
being threatened with closures because the market is flooded with
foreign goods, the manufacturers said, challenging: "What
situation are our manufactures going to find themselves in when
the market will be very open without any regulations?"
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that we're not ready for the FTA and as such the
government should seriously review the zero rating race," they
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development said in a recent statement that a decision on further
reductions to the current level of 60 percent of the COMESA tariff
preference is expected prior to the new fiscal year commencing
January 2000 when the new budget is to be presented.

<HEADLINE> Congo Given 9 Months to Prepare Case Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Court of
Justice has given the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) nine
months to prepare the case against Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uganda was given an equally long period of time to
prepare a reply to the pleadings from the DRC, Ugandan
Attorney-General Bart Katureebe said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The DRC had asked for eight months while Uganda asked for nine
to 12 months, the Uganda's top lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two countries met Tuesday at the court's
 headquarters in the Hague and agreed that each side be given nine
months to make preparations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The case, therefore, would be fixed for hearing after at least
18 months, the New Vision daily Friday quoted Katureebe as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda reserved the right to put in any preliminary
objection, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa took Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi to the court, saying
the three countries had committed acts of armed aggression in
flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter and the Charter of
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
In its applications filed on June 23, 1999, the DRC contends
that the invasion of its territory by the troops from the three
countries constitutes a violation of its sovereignty, as well as a
threat to peace and security in central Africa in general and the
Great Lakes region in particular.
</P>
<P>
The DRC filed separate applications against the three countries
and the cases against them will be heard separately.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the civil war broke out in the third largest African
country in early August 1998, Uganda and Rwanda sent troops to
the DRC to allegedly ensure security of their borders.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa has accused them of backing the rebels there, a charge
 categorically denied by both Kampala and Kigali. Burundi,
however, has never admitted sending troops to the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Report: Food Prices to Grow Slowly in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- With an economic recovery under
way in Southeast Asia, Food prices are expected to grow slowly in
the Asia-Pacific region in 1999-2000, according to a food outlook
report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
"General price growth in the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council (PECC) economies will moderate in 1999 and 2000 compared
with 1998. Food prices also are expected to grow more slowly
compared with 1998, primarily because of economic recovery in
Southeast Asia," said the "Pacific Food Outlook," which was
released at the on-going PPEC meeting in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The report said regional trade in agricultural commodities
should bottom out in 1999 as recovery begins to raise purchasing
power for food in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Overall, it said, global food supplies are forecast to remain
relatively stable in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
"Grain production will be stable worldwide and in the PECC
region in 1999, with Russian output recovering somewhat from a
very bad year in 1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
PECC, which was established in 1980, comprises 23 economies,
including Russia, China, the United States, Australia, the
Philippines, Peru, Mexico, Japan and other Asia-Pacific economies.
</P>
<P>
The report said a troubling impact of the financial crisis on
the PECC region's food system has been the scaling back of private
and public investment in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
While some economies use spending on infrastructure projects as
a way to jump-start economic expansion -- China and Japan are
recent examples -- infrastructure is often the first to be cut
when fortunes fall in developing countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the report said that with economic expansion accelerating
in the region in 1999-2000, and with interest rates and inflation
under better control, public and private infrastructure funds
should become increasingly available to the crisis economies.
</P>
<P>
An important objective of infrastructure development is
reducing transaction costs, which benefits both producers and
consumers, it said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day general assembly of the PECC began Thursday.
About 700 delegates from member economies are discussing a wide
range of economic issues, such as a new global economic
architecture, regional cooperation and information technology
development.

adding that "the new facilities also ensure safety and security to
the chanceries."
</P>
<P>
M. Azizul Huq, chairman of RAJUK previously known as the Dhaka
Improvement Trust, said the proposed diplomatic area would be
developed along with the development of the third phase of the
Uttara Residential Model Town by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
"We have planned to set up the new diplomatic enclave as the
existing areas for diplomatic missions in Dhaka have become too
small to meet the growing demand of the diplomatic missions in
Bangladesh," the RAJUK chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The present diplomatic enclave in the city's Gulshan and
Baridhara areas is located in an area of about 60 acres (242,820
square meters) of land, and the new zone will be established over
an area of about 200 acres (809,400 square meters), the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh earned 976.15 million
U.S. dollars from export during July and August, the first two
months of the current 1999-2000 financial year, 2.07 percent up
from the target and 3.38 percent higher than the corresponding
period of last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
While the unit prices of the major export items fell
drastically in the international market, only the apparel sector
helped the country to slightly exceed its export target during the
two-month period, The Daily Star Business reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Exports by the ready-made garments sector fetched 574.84
million dollars during the two months, 11.26 percent up from the
goal, and knitwear worth 206.41 million dollars was exported,
exceeding the target by 3.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the sharp decline of unit prices of the country's export
items -- frozen foods by 31.29 percent, leather by 31.3 percent,
tea by 13.16 percent and chemical products by 28.24 percent --
pulled down the income of those sectors despite a higher export
volume.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the targeted export earnings for agricultural
products, tea, engineering products, jute goods, primary products,
chemical products, handicrafts and electronic goods could not be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The country exported frozen foods worth 56.88 million dollars
during July-August, 15.31 percent up from the target and 6.15
percent less than that of the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Tea export showed a nose-dive with 1 million kilograms of tea
worth 1.66 million dollars exported, 75.11 percent less than the
targeted 6.67 million dollars and 83.32 percent lower than the
achievement during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The leather sector fetched 23.64 million dollars during the
period, 21.2 percent less than the target and 13.15 percent lower
than that of the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Raw jute worth 12.73 million dollars was exported during the
period against the target of 12 million dollars, while jute goods
worth 41.35 million dollars were exported against the targeted
51.67 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Traditional Nepalese Festival Losing Traditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- With the two-week long
Dashain Festival drawing to an end, the Kathmandu sky is still
empty of colorful kites which used to be flying during this
longest traditional festival for the Nepalese.
</P>
<P>
Kite flying, a popular game for both the old and the young
during Dashain, is disappearing nowadays. The sight of the blue
skies filled with beautiful kites and kids running after the
falling kites is now nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
What's more, many other traditions of this most traditional
festival in Nepal seems to be waning with the change of times.
</P>
<P>
"Dashain celebrations these days do not even seem like
Dashain," lamented 87-year-old Bhagwat Dutta Giri, who lives in a
village in Gorkha and has come to Kathmandu for Dashain.
</P>
<P>
The old man said he came to Kathmandu for Dashain because his
son and the son's family who are living here in Kathmandu did not
want to travel to Gorkha, a poor district in central Nepal.
</P>
<P>
However, the old man said if not for the reunion with his son,
he would not have come for the festival, as he "no longer feels
the same about Dashain as before."
</P>
<P>
"Dashain for the new generation is merely the occasion to
sacrifice goats and eat meat. The Malshri Raga ( a traditional
melody) which we used to sing during Dashain has lost its
identity," said Giri. "Many among the new generation do not even
know about the Malshri."
</P>
<P>
Typical features of Dashain, such as the sound of Malshri, the
unique smell of gokul dhup (a special incense), the sight of
people playing bamboo swings and flying kites, are missing these
days, said the old man, sorrows in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
Dashain means happiness, joy, fun and family reunion as well as
victory by the good over the evil for Nepalese, especially for
Hindus. People celebrate this traditional festival for 15 days,
which usually falls in October after the monsoon season. For this
year, the festival is from October 10 to 25.
</P>
<P>
During the festival, many families set up an altar at home,
where they worship Goddess Durga (the goddess of power and
strength in Hinduism) every morning and evening and grow jamara,
barley seeds planted in the sandy soil brought from the holy
river.
</P>
<P>
Durga temples in various places are crowded with devotees,
especially old people and women, who worship the Goddess and pray
for happiness and good luck.
</P>
<P>
People also receive from the elders Tika on their forehead, a
red mark of combination of rice, vermilion powder, curd and jamara
as a symbol of happiness, longevity, progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
But as more and more foreign tourists are pouring in and
Western culture finds its way in this remote and secluded
Himalayan kingdom, Dashain is losing its luster among the new
generation.
</P>
<P>
Most young people see Dashain more as holidays for fun than as
a religious festival. As there are more options for entertainment,
they are abandoning traditional ways of celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"The new generation does not know the value of Dashain and why
it is celebrated," Mohan Himsanshu Thapa was quoted as saying in
the Kathmandu Post.
</P>
<P>
"They are getting accustomed to cheap entertainments in the
name of festival," said Thapa, who is a writer.
</P>
<P>
Many people spend the festival playing cards, gambling,
watching TV, seeing relatives and friends, going out on
sight-seeing trips and other kinds of entertainments.
</P>
<P>
For many young people, disco is their favorite. The disco halls
in Kathmandu are more crowded during the festival than in normal
days.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer disco, because it is more exciting," said a girl in
one of the disco halls in the city. Her opinion was echoed by many
others who were enjoying the Western dance.
</P>
<P>
"The society is overlooking the main aspect of the festival,"
said Thapa.
</P>
<P>
In fact, people's lack of enthusiasm for Dashain is also
attributed to the economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has seen an economic slowdown for six years running.
Prices and unemployment are rising high, while the income of
ordinary people has been lagging far behind. The Nepalese currency
has also suffered several bouts of devaluation, further weakening
people's purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
"My business is not so good. People don't buy so many things as
they used to for Dashain," complained a grocer in downtown
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
"As the prices are so high and our income so low, I have to
refrain from buying," said a housewife shopping in the grocery.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Dashain has been celebrated by the Nepalese for
centuries and will continue to be celebrated year by year.
</P>
<P>
This is because the festival has a lot of positive implications
for the society, according to Dr. Dilli Ram Dahal, an
anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
"The festival provides us a reason to meet our seniors and
friends and take their blessings. For the poor, it is a time to
buy clothes and have hearty meal with meat," Dahal was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
So Dashain still produces a cohesive force to rejuvenate
relationships among people, he said.

measures but are being introduced to apply a structural scaling
back of fiscal pressure.

<HEADLINE> Berger Attacks "New Isolationism" in U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security Advisor
Sandy Berger on Thursday night lashed out at what he called "new
isolationism" in the U.S. congress, which he said has brought
about global criticism on the U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York,
Berger said that Republicans who control the Congress are pursuing
a path to "build a fortified fence around America, and retreat
behind it."
</P>
<P>
Because of the "new isolationism," "America finds itself today
being accused of both hegemony and isolationism at the same time,"
said Berger, who said it poses a threat to America's image around
the world.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, he referred "the new isolationism" specifically
to the Senate's recent vote against the Comprehensive Test-Ban
Treaty (CTBT), a huge cutback on the foreign aid bill, and the
opposition to playing a role in the post-war reconstruction in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, and the refusal to pay the U.N.
arrears and debts.
</P>
<P>
"It lies in the impulse to withdraw from the world in a way
that would squander our advantage, alienate our friends, diminish
our credibility, betray our values and discredit our example," he
said. "We cannot let that happen."
</P>
<P>
"The American people will choose as they have chosen so many
times before: to keep America engaged in a way that will benefit
our people and all people," he said. "That is a goal for which
this President and his Administration will work every single
remaining day of our term, a goal for which I solicit your active
support tonight."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his administration have only a
little bit more than one year to go before the end of the tenure.
The presidential election will take place next year.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Pearl River winds its
way to the South China Sea where it has a wide estuary, with Macao
on the southern coastline.
</P>
<P>
The 23.5-square-kilometer Macao consists of the Macao Peninsula,
Taipa Island, and Coloane Island. The peninsula formed slowly by
the mid-16th century and is connected with the mainland by a thin
sand dike. Macao lies just across from the city of Zhuhai in
Guangdong Province and to the west of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is about 2,800 kilometers from Tokyo and 2,600 kilometers
from Singapore, making it a good relay point between Southeast
Asia and the Northeast. It became an important port in the 16th
and 17th centuries.
</P>
<P>
Macao has a warm, humid subtropical climate. It has an average
annual temperature of 22.3 degrees. It has frequent typhoons and
tropical storms, with the typhoon season beginning in late May.
</P>
<P>
Its hills vary in elevation from a few meters to more than 100
meters. The tallest hill, on Coloane Island, is 174 meters high.
Taipa and Coloane Islands can be seen from the highest hill on the
peninsula. The 2,500-meter Macao-Taipa bridge and 4,380-meter
Friendship Bridge connect it with Taipa and a 2,225-meter causeway
connects Taipa with Coloane.
</P>
<P>
Macao does not have a long coastline, but has many bays, some
of which have been developed into harbors. a new harbour was
completed on Coloane Island in December 1991. It is over five
meters deep and can handle 5,000-dwt ships.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's New Leadership Expected to Ensure Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri would bring much-needed social and political
stability to the country, a senior official of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) said.
</P>
<P>
"Social and political stability will be more guaranteed," the
Jakarta Post Friday quoted MPR Deputy Chairman Kwik Kian Gie as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie, who is also Megawati's economic adviser, said
social and political stability would help the government lead the
nation out of its multidimensional crisis, because stability would
help restore badly-needed confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party legislator Ekky Syachruddin concurred, stressing
that both Wahid and Megawati were elected through a democratic
process.
</P>
<P>
He said he was convinced the rupiah and stocks would rise
following their election.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the rupiah flexed its muscles to break the 7,000
level to the U.S. dollar from 7,550/7,575 and the stock market
surged 32.07 points, or 5.5 percent, to close the day at 616.49
points.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange analyst Farial Anwar said the rupiah is
expected to continue strengthening because a major political
uncertainty that had overshadowed the market has been eliminated
with the formation of the new leadership "through such a
democratic, fair way."
</P>
<P>
Raden Pardede, a senior analyst at PT Danareksa Securities,
said the Wahid-Megawati team would ensure social and political
stability for longer than any other political pairing.
</P>
<P>
Analyst at an economic research institution Econit Arif Arryman
sees the Wahid-Megawati team as being able to end the country's
political and social instability given the broad grassroots
support they enjoy.
</P>
<P>
"But their credibility will depend on the quality of the
cabinet they form within the next few days," Arryman added.
</P>
<P>
A number of businessmen believe that if Wahid and Megawati are
capable of creating a sound investment climate in the country, at
least 70 billion rupiah (10 million U.S. dollars) in deposits in
Singapore are expected to flow into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A legal expert of the Bung Hatta University, Boy Yendra Tamin,
said the election of Wahid as president and Megawati as vice
president was a manifestation of national reconciliation which
could help accelerate the restoration of international confidence
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
This situation represents a good opportunity for Indonesia to
restore the confidence of the international community at a time
when there are a host of problems confronting the country,
especially in the framework of the restructuring of the economic,
political and legal sectors, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Main Opposition Vies For Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition the
United National Party (UNP) has selected its leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe to challenge President Chandrika Kumaratunga in the
forthcoming presidential election, UNP sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Wickremesinghe, a former prime minister, was
unanimously selected as the UNP nominee by the party's working
committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga said on Wednesday the presidential polls
will be held in two to three months, about 10 months ahead of the
schedule -- November 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe, who is an attorney at law, had his entire
education in Sri Lanka and entered politics at the age of 28 in
1977.
</P>
<P>
"The UNP nominated me as the candidate for the presidential
election... I will ensure victory," said Wickremesinghe at a
meeting following his nomination.
</P>
<P>
He said his main priority was to bring lasting peace, ensure
economic prosperity and improve the living conditions of people.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old ethnic conflict
between the Sinhalese majority-dominated government and Tamil
minority rebels who demand a separate homeland in the country's
north and east.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe said he would take meaningful steps to protect
the country's judiciary and media freedom irrespective of party
politics.
</P>
<P>
He said a snap election had been called as the government
feared its budget for next year would be defeated in Parliament as
the president did not have confidence in her own ministers.

<HEADLINE> New Measures to Speed up Sydney Olympic Visa Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to the 2000 Sydney
Olympics will find it easier to come to Australia under new visa-
processing measures, which was announced Friday by Australian
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
The measures include allowing overseas media representatives,
sports people and other visiting professionals to enter Australia
as business visitors.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said this meant those intending to stay here less than
three months would not have to go through a formal sponsorship
process.
</P>
<P>
"Given the significant numbers of people who will be coming to
Australia in the lead-up to the Olympics, it is essential that
visa issue processes for these people are as streamlined as
possible," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Currently the sponsorship and visa issues process for these
visits can take as much time as these people actually spend in
Australia, which is often only a few weeks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said a network of immigration officers would be
established to liaise between organisers of international events
in Australia and overseas posts to speed up the processing of visa
applications.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock encouraged organisers of international events to
contact his department as early as possible to ensure entry
arrangements running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "the existence of this network does not
mean that all applicants indicating an intention to attend an
international event will be visaed."

<HEADLINE> SFOR to Continue Hunting Down War Crimes Suspects: NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The multinational Stabilization
Force in Bosnia (SFOR) will continue its action in hunting down
indicted war crimes suspects, George Robertson, NATO's new
secretary general, said in the Bosnian capital of Sarayevo
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Croatia Television, Robertson made
the statement at a press conference after a meeting with members
of the collective Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, SFOR has detained 12 war crimes suspects in the
former Yugoslavia, but more time is needed to hunt down all the
others to tribunal to answer war crimes charges, Robertson added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Bosnia-Herzegovina government to honor their
obligations as defined in the Dayton agreement to help the
repatriation of refugees and hand out war crimes suspects.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accord ended Bosnia's 43-month
ethnic war by establishing a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat
federation within a single state. The Bosnian presidency
consisted of three members, with each from one ethnic group and
the top vote-winner being the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Robertson arrived in Bosnia Thursday, accompanied by
ambassadors of the 19 NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Carla Del Ponte, new chief prosecutor of
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
will visit the country next week.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia-Herzegovina has always stressed that war criminals
should be punished, but all related issues should be settled by
cooperation between all factions in Bosnia and the international
tribunal under international law.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Warn of Killer Flu Within Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- About 51,000 Canadians could be
killed by a global flu pandemic if the country fails to mass-
produce a vaccine against flu within the next decade, Canadian
media said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If there's not a vaccine available, the next pandemic flu will
cause between 9,000 and 51,000 deaths in Canada," Health Canada
was quoted as warning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is based on data showing that three to four flu
pandemics hit the world each century, with each pandemic carrying
a brand-new virus to which no one has immunity.
</P>
<P>
Out of the most recent outbreaks in 1892, 1918, 1957 and 1968,
the Spanish flu pandemic between 1918 and 1919 killed 20 million
to 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the 1968 pandemic caused an estimated 4,000 deaths,
three to four times higher than those in usual years.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Wildlife Protected in Shanxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A number of endangered birds
and animals in north China's Shanxi Province have steadily
increased due to new protective measures.
</P>
<P>
The province has established a number of regulations to stamp
out illegal hunting and logging activities. Eleven nature reserves
have been established. The province has also organized campaigns
to increase public awareness of protecting wildlife such as "Love
Birds Week" and "Wildlife Month".
</P>
<P>
Due to these public awareness campaigns, the number of brown
pheasants, classified as one of the most endangered animals in the
province, has increased from 2,000 to 4,200 in two nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to successful artificial breeding of the rhesus monkey,
the animal has increased from 200 to 500 in the Manghe reserve at
an annual rate of 15 percent. A special reserve has also been set
up to attract migratory birds such as white swans, grey cranes and
yellow-beaked egrets.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, Shanxi province has rescued 15 different species
totaling some 115 animals. According to statistics, there are 418
species of wild animals in the province. More than 60 of these
species including the golden eagle, black stork, leopard and giant
salamander are under state protection.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Lyon, City With Historical Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, France, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin will arrive Friday in Lyon, a French city with historical
ties with China, in the first stop of his state visit to France.
</P>
<P>
Lyon, the country's third largest city with more than 3,000
years of history, stands at the confluence of the Rhone and the
Saone, two great rivers of France.
</P>
<P>
Famous for its foggy and rainy weather and deep cultural
sophistication of its residents, the city is also widely known as
an international center with advanced metallurgical,
pharmaceutical and energy industries.
</P>
<P>
Among all French cities, Lyon feels most familiar with China
because of its Chinese silk trade dating back to Roman times and a
Chinese school where young Chinese revolutionaries met regularly
during their stay in Europe, particularly in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
As a witness of the silk trade, Lyon has a Museum of Tissues
and Decorative Arts, which displays an album of Chinese silk
samples brought home by the Chamber of Commerce of Lyon during a
mission to China in 1844.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 19th century, another mission consisting of
13 Lyonnese businessmen visited China to learn about silk arts in
many provinces.
</P>
<P>
By that time, half of the 70,000 balls of silk products shipped
each year from Shanghai headed for France, most of them for Lyon.
</P>
<P>
Out of 350 tons of silk products imported last year by the
region of Rhone-Alpes, where Lyon is located, 155 tons came from
China and the rest from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Another monument marking the historical ties between Lyon and
China is the French-Chinese Institute which was jointly set up in
1921 by Peking (Beijing) University and the University of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
It is accounted that about 450 Chinese students studied in the
school. In the early 1920s, the school became a place of
rendezvous for young Chinese revolutionaries like Zhou Enlai, Deng
Xiaoping, Chen Yi and Li Lisan, who were on work-study programs in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
These revolutionaries later became leading members of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Dramatic event took place in 1922 when 100 Chinese staged a
protest in Lyon against the refusal of the institute to enroll
Chinese students without scholarships from the government in
Peking.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, among them Chen Yi and Li Lisan, were arrested
and deported.
</P>
<P>
After World War II broke out, the school was taken back by the
French government but the Chinese characters "Zhong Fa Da Xue"
inscribed on the stone above the gate is still clearly visible
today.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Teak Export Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported 194,562 cubic
meters of teak in the first half of this year, earning 99 million
U.S. dollars, according to the latest figures published by the
country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
The export volume and earnings respectively increased by 158.45
percent and 104.33 percent compared with the same period of last
year, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar also exported 226,824 cubic meters of
hardwood in the half-year period, earning 15.48 million dollars of
foreign exchange. The export volume and earnings rose by 273.65
percent and 123.37 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The figures also indicate that Myanmar exported 133,717.5 cubic
meters of teak in 1998, earning 94.65 million dollars, and 235,739
cubic meters of hardwood in exchange for 29.38 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures of the Myanmar Ministry of Forestry show that the
country's forest area is shrinking year by year. The percentage of
coverage by forest in the country dropped to 50 percent at the end
of 1998, compared with 57 percent 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The forest depletion is attributed to indiscriminate felling
and cutting of trees including firewood plantations for fuel and
burning of charcoal.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out projects for greening the arid districts
under which revival of firewood plantations is among the measures
being taken.

"It's still the No.1 killer among Canadians, accounting for 36
percent of deaths," said the country's Heart and Stroke Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation also forecasts an increasing heart problem over
the next 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The projection is based on facts that young people are more
obese, smoking has been picking up since 1991 and the population
is aging.
</P>
<P>
During the last 20 years, the incidence of obesity among boys
has risen to 22 percent from the previous record of 16 percent,
while the rate for girls has jumped to 26 percent from 15 percent,
according to Canadian cardiologists.
</P>
<P>
The foundation called for regular physical activity and healthy
nutrition, but less or non-smoking among young Canadians.

YANGON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced a total of
159,588 tons of cement in the first half of this year, a drop of
22.65 percent compared with the same period of last year,
according to the latest figures of the Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that in the whole of 1998, Myanmar
produced a total of 364,959 tons of cement.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar has speeded up the pace of
infrastructural construction of roads, bridges and dams, resulting
in a shortage of cement.
</P>
<P>
To meet the rising demand for cement, Myanmar plans to build
more cement plants. It is learnt that Myanmar is trying to get a
foreign loan of 150 million U.S. dollars to build a
4,000-ton-capacity cement plant.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Myanmar is spending a large sum of foreign
exchange to buy in cement. In fiscal 1998-99 which ended in March,
Myanmar imported a total of 65.55 million dollars' worth of
cement.
</P>
<P>
The country mainly imports cement from China and Indonesia.

<P>
XINING, October 22 (Xinhua)-- Three well-preserved pieces of
paper money printed in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) were recently
exhibited in northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Measuring sixteen-mo, the money is made of mulberry bark and in
the denominations of one-guan (a string of 1,000 copper cash), two-
guan and 500-wen (one copper cash), according to Yang Suqin, an
official at the local Cultural Bureau.
</P>
<P>
After 700 years, the currency is still in good condition, and
Chinese characters along with governmental stamps written on the
coarse surface are still legible.
</P>
<P>
In the autumn of 1955, some workers at a farm in Golmud of
Qinghai discovered a small parcel containing more than 400 bills
of ancient paper money. The bills were confirmed as precious
currency from the Yuan Dynasty. This discovery was the biggest
find of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
After decades of storage in the local cultural relics
department, three pieces of the rare currency were sent for
display in a new museum in the city of Golmud.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese began to use money made of sea shells some 4,
000 years ago. China's earliest paper money, "jiaozi," was printed
in the Song Dynasty (960-1279).

<HEADLINE> Panama Rejects U.S. Military Presence After 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 21 (Xinhua)-- Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso said Thursday her government will not permit U.S. military
bases to remain on Panamanian soil after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The president made the comment at Tocumen International Airport
after a four-day official tour of the United States, where she met
with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We were emphatic about telling Clinton we don't want military
bases or a multilateral anti-drug center (CMA) in our country, and
he understood me," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Moscoso, during her meeting with Clinton, they
discussed cleaning up weapon's firing ranges, which were
contaminated by U.S. military forces during their half-century
presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso said she also demanded that the United States clean all
military installations occupied by its troops.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton was at all times attentive to these requests
and agreed to follow them up, as well as grant support to my
government's social agenda," she said.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso said that during her meeting with Clinton, both
governments decided to establish new relations of mutual respect
after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso said that both leaders had committed themselves to
create a common consultation mechanism to solve old problems and
draw guidelines for a "special relationship," after the
transference of the Panama Canal at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaties, the United
States will have to return the canal to Panamanian sovereignty by
noon on December 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts Investigation Into FIFA Rule On Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, October 21 (Xinhua) -- European Commission said
Thursday that it has undertaken a detailed investigation into the
FIFA (Federation Interantionale de Football Association) rules
concerning players' agents.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive branch said its decision
was in response to a number of complaints and two petitions from
the European Parliament and it has officially informed FIFA that
world's football body considers the rules ammount to anti-
competitive agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has sent a statement of objections to FIFA,
considering that the relevant FIFA rules infringe basic laws of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"They prevent or restrict natural or legal persons with the
necessary skills and qualifications from having access to this
activity," the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said in a statement that it also takes the
view at this stage that the benefits of the rules identified by
FIFA are not sufficient to offset the anti-competitive effects.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for competition Mario Monti said this is merely
the start of the procedure. "However, if this initial opinion is
confirmed, FIFA will have to amend its rules on players' agents. I
am not against the establishment of rules applicable to players'
agents, but they must be proportionate and non-discriminatory," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU procedural rules, FIFA can reply to the Commission
's statement of objections in writing and can request a hearing to
be attended by the complainants and representatives of the
national competition authorities of all EU member states.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Team Begins Inspection to England World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair promised the government's support of England's bid for the
2006 World Cup when he met the FIFA inspection team here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said:"We have put all this effort and energy
into this (bid) because we feel we can offer something to the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
"Our stadiums now are in really good shape so we are proud with
what we have done and we think we can do it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, part of the six-day fact-finding trip by FIFA
delegates, also included FA officials, England's 1966 World Cup
hero Sir Bobby Charlton and the prime minister's special envoy
charged with bringing the World Cup to England, Tony Banks.
</P>
<P>
As part of their visit, the FIFA officials will be introduced
to celebrity backers of England's bid, including Hollywood star
Hugh Grant and singer Chris De Burgh.
</P>
<P>
The six delegates, led by Alan Rothenberg - the man who
organised the United States' successful 1994 World Cup - arrived
in London on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They are to visit six of the 15 stadiums included in England's
bid - believed to be Old Trafford in Manchester, Derby's Pride
Park, Villa Park in Birmingham, Sunderland's Stadium of Light,
Liverpool's Anfield and Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA team will also scrutinise the technical details of the
bid during their visit.
</P>
<P>
Alec McGivan, director of England's bid, said: "The visit of
the FIFA inspectorate represents another key milestone in our bid
to host the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important week for us to show FIFA our facilities and
the fact that we are capable of hosting the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I am very confident of success. We have the best bid and we
intend to prove that this week."
</P>
<P>
England is competing with Germany, South Africa and Morocco for
the right to host the event in seven years' time.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's 24-member executive committee will base their nomination
of the host country of the 2006 championships on the Rothenberg
committee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
A decision is due a week after the Euro 2000 championship final
next July.

<HEADLINE> F1 Former Winner Says Ferrari Disqualification Valid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Niki Lauda, the former Formula One
driver who won two world titles with Ferrari, Friday came out
firmly against his old team in the controversy over its
disqualification from the Malaysian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, Lauda, who spoke in an
interview with the German daily, said that rules governing body-
work specifications for Formula One cars had to be obeyed just
like any other rules and an infringement inevitably brought
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's two cars were disqualified from the Malaysian Grand
Prix on last Sunday after a one-two victory that seemed to put the
Italian cars and drivers within grasp of victory in the Formula
One drivers' and constructors' championships.
</P>
<P>
The disqualification was ordered by the race stewards because
of the upper part of the two cars' deflector panels were 10mm
outside the limits set for the body-work by the sport's technical
regulations.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed on appeal, the decision would hand the McLaren-
Mercedes team's defending champion.
</P>
<P>
"Any decision which deprived Mika Hakkinen of the title would
be a farce," said Lauda, whose first two titles, in 1975 and 1977,
were with Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Lauda said the image of motor-racing would be dangerously
compromised if the judges allowed themselves to be influenced by
Bernie Ecclestone, the millionaire business man and Formula One
owner.
</P>
<P>
Ecclestone has defended the Ferrari team, calling the
disqualification "stupid" and saying the extra centimeter had not
helped the cars go any faster.
</P>
<P>
"(Formula One) must remain a sport with clear rules that are
respected," Lauda countered.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Worries Over Upstairs Role for Ferguson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United chairman
Martin Edwards has doubts about whether manager Sir Alex Ferguson
should stay on at the end of his contract in three years' time,
according to local reports on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has said he would like to stay at Old Trafford in an '
upstairs role' but Edwards is not convinced that would be workable.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson may be the club's most successful manager but Edwards
has misgivings about whether his successor would welcome such an
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said: "It's a difficult one because there are a number
of things to consider.
</P>
<P>
"If he is still there in the background with all the success he
has had, is that going to be a comfort or a hindrance to any
successor? Secondly, is that something Sir Alex wants?
</P>
<P>
"It would be very difficult for him to be there without
actually feeling a need to be involved.
</P>
<P>
"He is a hands-on person and I think it would be difficult for
him to resist that - but we have got three years to think about it
and he will have a view on it, and we will have a view on it
nearer the time."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edwards has revealed the truth behind two world
stars who have been linked with United.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive confirmed the club wanted to sign Rivaldo
in the summer but could not afford Barcelona's Brazilian superstar,
while he insisted there was never any attempt to buy Edgar Davids
from Juventus.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There is no doubt at all, that we would have loved to
have had the Brazilian here, but the problem was that Barcelona
don't want to sell him. If they did what would the transfer fee be?
</P>
<P>
"They paid 18 million pounds for him so they are going to want
20 million pounds plus, and on top of that his personal terms are
at least three times above what we pay our top player at the
moment," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Former French Open champions
Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Gustavo Kuerten both advanced into the
quarter-finals of the Lyon Grand Prix tennis tournament on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, the top seed and second ranked player in the world,
battled past Sweden's Magnus Larsson 7-5, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, seeded third, overcame a listless start to move past
1995 champion Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seeded Vincent Spadea of the United States, the player
Kafelnikov will meet in the quarter-finals, made two impressive
recoveries to defeat compatriot Jim Courier 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champion, has reached a career-
high fifth in the world rankings. Bidding for his third title of
the season and the sixth of his career, the Brazilian star will
take on sixth-seeded Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Lapentti snuffed out the home crowd's hopes when he posted a 4-
6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Sebastien Grosjean, the last French
player remaining in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In other third-round play, Australia's Lleyton Hewitt, seeded
13th, defeated 65th-ranked Chris Woodruff of the United States 6-4,
6-3, and will meet Sweden's Mikael Tillstrom, who beat 11th-seeded
Mariano Zabaleta.
</P>
<P>
Another Swedish player, Magnus Gustafsson, swept past Rainer
Schuttler of Germany to reach the final eight, where he will take
on American Jeff Tarango. Tarango overcame French wildcard Nicolas
Escude 6-2, 1-6, 6-1.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's President Announces Ministerial Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's President Tejan
Kabbah Thursday announced the appointment of four rebel ministers
to his cabinet in a bid to form a new national unity government as
stipulated by the July 7 Lome peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial portfolios with the ministries of the trade and
industry; land, housing and central planning; energy and power as
well as tourism and culture will go to the former rebels' hands,
according to the country's state radio.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Armed
Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) will also net in four deputy
ministerial positions.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels have failed to get any of the three key
ministries: finance, foreign affairs and justice, which the Lome
peace deal had suggested they would be offered.
</P>
<P>
Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, said he would respond to the
announcement later while keeping reservations about the cabinet
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh has been given powers equivalent to a vice-president and
is due to head a commission overseeing the reconstruction of the
mineral resources industry.
</P>
<P>
The trade portfolio was offered to the RUF's Mike Lamin, the
energy post to AFRC's Pallo Bangura while the RUF's Peter Vandy
was suggested for land and Jomo-Jalloh, also of the RUF, would get
tourism, according to the presidential statement read by the
radio.
</P>
<P>
Former army ruler and AFRC leader Johnny Paul Koroma, who
returned home with Sankoh on October 3, was not among Thursday's
nominations. Political sources say he had earlier made clear that
he was not interested in a ministerial post.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet proposals, which still need to be approved by the
country's parliament, came a day after the country officially
launched its long- delayed disarmament program.
</P>
<P>
Some 45,000 fighters in towns and dense jungles throughout the
country would be disarmed and demobilized in the months to come.
The eight-year civil war has taken at least 30,000 lives of the
West Africa country with a population less than 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is widely expected to send a peace-keeping
force to aid the country's fragile peace process, especially at a
time when Nigeria, a sub-regional power, intends to withdraw its
military presence in the country on economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council is to vote on Friday for
such a move, which, if approved, would lead to a 6,000-strong
U.N. peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keeping task in Sierra Leone was traditionally
shouldered by the Nigeria-led West Africa Peacekeeping force.

<P>
Foley said Indonesia faced many challenges, "but we believe
that the election of Mrs. Megawati, whose party won the most votes
in the June elections, will result in a government that is well
placed" to deal with these challenges.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon also described as
"encouraging signs" Indonesia's presidential election, which chose
Abdurrahman Wahid as its president and Megawati as its vice
president over the last two days, and the endorsement of
independence for East Timor by Indonesian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
But he said these encouraging signs were not enough to prompt
Washington to immediately resume military ties with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see how events there unfold," Bacon told reporters.
"But obviously its our goal to improve relations with Indonesia
across the spectrum -- military, economic, diplomatic, political."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches New Budget for Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa Thursday unveiled a budget of 109.2 billion
Zimbabwean dollars (2. 87 billion U.S. dollars) for the year 2000
to boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the new budget, the Ministry of Education and High
 Education received 19.3 billion Zimbabwean dollars (500 million
U.S. dollars), the largest share of the cake.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry, as usual, took the second largest share
of the recurrent expenditure with an allocation of 8.2 billion
Zimbabwean dollars (215 million U.S. dollars) while the Health
Ministry got 6.2 billion Zimbabwean dollars (163 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new budget is focused on reducing poverty, inflation and
interest rates, the minister said, adding that it also aims to
encourage exports and cut budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the government meets its target of reducing the
budget deficit to 3.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Product from
the current 10 percent, then Zimbabwe's future will virtually be
assured of coming out of the current economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has currently an inflation rate of 70 percent. About
62 percent of the population is considered poor and 46 percent is
defined as very poor.
</P>
<P>
"Let me hasten to say that the 2000 budget should launch the
economy into the next millennium where challenges of poverty
reduction are going to take centre stage. The measures I am
proposing in the budget should therefore achieve a stable
macro-economic environment with low inflation and interest rates,
and stimulate investment and savings,!1 Murerwa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the budget proposal should also foster a stable and
healthy balance of payments through enhanced exports and create
opportunities for employment.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Thursday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling amid
pessimism about International Business Machines Corp.'s hardware
sales in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 94.67 at 10,297.69, rebounding from a steep
drop of 213 points during the session due to the IBM's
disappointing forecast. IBM is Dow's component.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 5.82 at 1,283.61 but the technology heavy
Nasdaq index rose 13.82 at 2,801.95.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged initiately in the trading today because IBM
reported late Wednesday that strong demand for software and
systems support drove its third-quarter profits up 14 percent but
revenues from its network and database servers dropped 40 percent
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
IBM said the drop was caused by postponing purchases of its
hardware by users until after the start of the new year, when
concerns over Year 2000 computer bugs are fully resolved,
therefore, the sales weakness is expected to continue through the
fourth quarter and into January.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 2.50 at 591.29 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.34 at 786.09. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 0.33 at 414.27.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,892 down, 1,160 up and 479
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 984.66 million shares from 917.51
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Reduce Tax Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Finance Minister Vincenzo
Visco said Thursday that Italian taxpayers will begin as of
January 1, 2000, seeing levies lightened by more than ten trillion
lire (about 5.56 billion U.S. dollars) in the year and in excess
of 45 trillion (about 25 billion U.S. dollars) through to the end
of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Visco said that tax reductions written into the fiscal
amendment to attach to the new budget bill are not one-off
measures but are being introduced to apply a structural scaling
back of fiscal pressure.
</P>
<P>
His plans, he affirmed, go well beyond "enacting the pact
signed in December last year" by the government, trade union
representatives and business and industry.
</P>
<P>
"This is a structural reduction which will be increased year
after year. The government intends, with these measures, to start
up a process for progressively improving the living conditions of
the Italians, beginning with the families and people in greatest
need, those the fiscal intervention is especially attentive to,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Mannesmann Offers Record Price for Orange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 21 (Xinhua)--In a bid to take leading pole in
Europe, the Mannesmann AG, Germany's largest mobile phone network,
Thursday announced to take over the Orange Plc of Britain with an
offer of 34 billion euros (66.5 billion marks).
</P>
<P>
The acquisition plan, which is by now the most expensive one in
European telecommunication market, was announced simultaneously
London and Duesseldorf, the headquarters site of Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
"We must be active in the most prosperous branches and link
ourselves with the strongest enterprises," Klaus Esser, the chairman
of Mannesmann, told German ZDF television in London.
</P>
<P>
"We paid a high cost," added Esser. Mannesmann financed the
takeover with a credit loan of 12 billion euros, the highest sum
for any single European enterprise.
</P>
<P>
But with its D-2 network in Germany, Omnitel in Italy, and
Orange in Britain, Mannesmann will assure its place in three of
Eurpe's five largest mobile phone markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the announced plan, Mannesmann will pay 30 billion
euros in cash and stock, and plans to absorb Orange's
3-billion-euro debt.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the offer is unlikely to be challenged by a
counter-bid, despite earlier speculation of an auction process for
the U.K.'s third-largest cellular operator.
</P>
<P>
Orange management has recommended the offer to shareholders and
its its major shareholder, Hutchison Whampoa, has agreed to
accept Mannesmann's offer.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the offer - 0.0965 new Mannesmann shares and
640 pence in cash - Orange shareholders will own 23 percent of the
enlarged Mannesmann. And Hutchison,a Hong Kong-based investment
group,will be the German firm's largest single shareholder with 10
percent of its capital.
</P>
<P>
With Orange's 3.5 million British subscribers, Mannesmann will
have more than 20 million mobile phone customers in Europe as a
leading role.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, Mannesmann is already the largest player with its
D-2 network, and in Italy the second with Omnitel unit.
</P>
<P>
The Mannesmann/Orange deal marks the second acquisition of a
U.K. cellular company by a German firm. Mannesmann's chief
domestic rival, Deutsche Telekom, took over fourth-placed
One-2-One for 12 billion euros in August.
