<HEADLINE> Primakov: Yeltsin Should Not Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Saturday reiterated his opposition to the idea that
President Boris Yeltsin step down before his term expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin should remain in the post to ensure social
stability and smooth parliamentary elections this year.
</P>
<P>
After attending the seventh conference of the non-government
Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, Primakov told reporters
that there were people intent on creating discord between the
presidential staff and the government and between the government
and the president.
</P>
<P>
He said ulterior motives were behind such attempts.
</P>
<P>
Primakov defended his crusade against economic crimes, saying
crackdown on crimes would strengthen social unity rather than
result in social division.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting of the Council on Foreign and Defense
Policy was held at Lesnye Dali, a resort about 30 kilometers west
of Moscow and situated on the banks of the Moskva River.
</P>
<P>
Participants discussed measures to drag the country out of the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Karaganov, the council's chief, said his organization
was also against Yeltsin' resignation.

<HEADLINE> Trip to Beijing Useful: Elsie Leung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Elsie Leung Oi-sie,
secretary of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), described her trip to Beijing as necessary and very
useful, upon her return here from Beijing Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Leung went to Beijing on Friday on behalf of Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa to brief relevant central departments and law
experts on the recent judgment of the Court of Final Appeal
concerning the right of abode of some Hong Kong residents'
children living in the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the matter in detail; we had free and useful
exchanges," she said, adding that "this sort of communication is
necessary and also very useful."
</P>
<P>
Relevant central departments expressed the view that there were
passages in the Court of Final Appeal judgment relating to the
status and power of the National People's Congress and its
Standing Committee, and they are of the opinion that this is
contradictory to the principles in the Constitution and in the
Basic Law, and they feel that that should be rectified, she said.
</P>
<P>
"On the fact that as a result of the judgment of the Court of
Final Appeal, the number of people entitled to right of abode in
Hong Kong has been increased tremendously, and that there would be
a burden on our resources, a burden on our society, and also that
Hong Kong people are very concerned about this, they expressed
understanding on the matter," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that in dealing with the matter, the central
authorities will adhere strictly to the principle of "one country,
two systems" and also to the Basic Law. They will also take into
consideration the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 months very good relationship has been
established between China's inland areas and Hong Kong, she said,
and "since this is a problem within one country, they are
confident that the matter will be resolved satisfactorily, and I
must agree with that," she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her hope that a satisfactory solution will be
resolved with the co-operation and constructive participation of
all the parties and all the people in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Sending of U.S. Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Saturday announced sending of as many as 4,000 American troops to
join a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo if Serbs and ethnic
Albanians reach a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio broadcast from the Oval Office, Clinton
said he would order the deployment of U.S. ground troops only
after "close consultation with Congress" and only if a peace
agreement is reached in talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
now underway in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"There are serious obstacles to overcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is increasingly clear that this effort can only succeed if
it includes a NATO-led peace implementation force that gives both
sides the confidence to lay down their arms," Clinton said. "It's
also clear that if there is a real peace, American participation
in the force can provide such confidence, particularly for
Kosovo's Albanians."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said both sides in the conflict would have to agree to
a NATO peacekeeping force to which the Europeans would provide the
bulk of personnel -- about 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Our share would amount to a little less than 4,000 personnel,"
the president said. And the mission must be designed with a "clear
and realistic strategy to allow us to bring our forces home when
their work is done."

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Saturday announced sending of as many as 4,000 American troops to
join a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo if Serbs and ethnic
Albanians reach a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio broadcast from the Oval Office, Clinton
said he made the decision because "Bosnia taught us a lesson."
</P>
<P>
"In this volatile region, violence we fail to oppose leads to
even greater violence we will have to oppose later at greater
cost," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must heed that lesson in Kosovo," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would order the deployment of U.S. ground
troops only after "close consultation with Congress" and only if a
peace agreement is reached in talks between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians now underway in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating resistance in Congress and public opinion, Clinton
argued a case for American participation, saying: "World War II
taught us that America could never be secure if Europe's future
was in doubt."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said the United States would send 2,200
Marines to Kosovo in the first stage of any peacekeeping mission
if there's a need to move quickly and U.S. troops are involved.
</P>
<P>
Army soldiers and heavy equipment, which sometimes take weeks
to deploy, would follow Marines to Kosovo as part of a long-term
NATO peacekeeping operation, a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit are already
deployed near Kosovo as part of an amphibious ready group in the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Army troops could come from Europe, Asia or U.S. bases,
depending on what type of units are needed.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is heading for Paris
Saturday to assess progress between the two warring sides. The
parties have an informal deadline of Feb. 20 for reaching an
accord.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. American Airlines Scrubs More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Swarms of anxious holiday
travelers were left stranded Saturday when U.S. American Airlines
again scrubbed more than a thousand flights after its pilots
defied a court order and continued their mass sickout.
</P>
<P>
About one in four American pilots called in sick Friday at the
nation's second-largest airline, which in turn canceled several
hundred more flights planned for the long Presidents Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
"A federal judge ordered them back to work," said Edwin Amaya
after learning his flight from Boston to Miami had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall -- the author of that order --
asked the same question of the Allied Pilots Association during a
contempt hearing in Dallas Friday.
</P>
<P>
American had asked Kendall to impose a "coercive fine" against
the union for failing to comply with the order he issued
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
American canceled 1,102 flights Friday -- nearly half of its
daily total -- a day after it canceled 1,170. The carrier also
scrapped 845 flights for Saturday and 209 for Sunday, with
additional cancellations possible. The airline estimated Friday
that 450,000 passengers have been affected since the job action
began on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Apparently in response to the judge's comments, union President
Rich LaVoy changed his hot line message late Friday to exhort
pilots to return to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
There were signs pilots may be taking heed. According to an
updated message Saturday on American's hot line, about 2,100 of
the airline's 9,400 pilots were on the sick list Saturday, down
from 2,443 Friday. Although they are barred by federal law from
striking over the issue, federal regulations require pilots to
call in sick if they are experiencing emotional stress.
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on how quickly American should integrate
the pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into its own roster.
</P>
<P>
Pilots in both groups stand to make more money once they all
fall under American's existing contract. Many American pilots
would advance up the seniority chart, while Reno pilots would get
pay raises compared to their old carrier.
</P>
<P>
The airline and the pilots union both said American could
return to normal operations in three days if the mass sick calls
end. However, no negotiations over the dispute were held Friday
and none were set for Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Train Young Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
launch a pilot project to train young commercial farmers at the
Kushinga Pikelela Agricultural Center near the capital Harare, a
cabinet minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said the program was
expected to raise interest in farming among young people in view
of the current lack of interest in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, was the only way to empower the young to
effectively participate in the economic development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kangai was addressing Mashonaland West commercial farmers at a
meeting organized by the 21st February Movement, which
commemorates the birthday of President Robert Mugabe through
various programs aimed at the youth.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there was need to incorporate the needs and
aspirations of children in the national economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
He said children constituted 43 percent of the population and
yet their needs in the areas of education, health and
communication were often not fully resolved.
</P>
<P>
One way of doing, Kangai said, this was to invest in the land.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would ensure that there was land and
adequate technical support and financial assistance available to
young people so that they could work on the land productively.

<HEADLINE> Libya Asks U.N. to Put Lockerbie Guarantees in Writing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Libya had asked U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to prepare in writing details on any
handover of the two suspects in the 1988 airliner bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland, before any surrender could take place, a U.N.
diplomat said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the message was conveyed to the U.N. chief by
Rihab Massoud, the deputy chief of mission of the Saudi Arabian
embassy in Washington, at a meeting between the two at the U.N.
headquarters in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
Annan was drawing up papers he would show to U.S. and British
officials before submitting them to Libya, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the secretary-general was
encouraged "by the important progress" on the Lockerbie issue. "He
is now looking forward to the speedy conclusion of this matter,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Saudi Arabia and South Africa announced Saturday that a
breakthrough had been achieved on the handover of the two Libyans,
accused of placing a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in
December 1988. A total of 270 people, mostly Americans, died.

<HEADLINE> UK Retailers Press Government for Action on Genetic Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Some of Britain's biggest shops
and stores Saturday urged the government to take actions
reassuring consumers the safety of genetically modified (GM) food.
</P>
<P>
They warned that consumer confidence in GM food could be
shattered unless the government makes a clear and unequivocal
statement that it is safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has written to Agriculture
Secretary Nick Brown, asking him to "put consumers' minds at rest"
with a clear statement about GM food, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The BRC, which represents around 90 percent of British
retailers, said shops could lose billions of pounds if consumers
lose confidence.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Federation of Small Businesses also warned that
continued indecision by the government could end in bankruptcy for
thousands of companies.
</P>
<P>
The moves by retailers to press government for action follows
Friday's public statement of 20 scientists from 13 different
countries backing a British colleague who said that rats fed
genetically-modified potatoes suffered health damage.
</P>
<P>
The scientists called the British government to impose
immediately a moratorium on the GM foods.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Job Seekers Lack Required Skills: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is experiencing a high
rate of unemployment of about 50 percent because job seekers do
not have skills relevant to the economy, a senior education
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a career guidance day at Checheche growth point in
East Zimbabwe, regional education director Rodgers Sisimayi said
most of the skills being acquired were oversubscribed.
</P>
<P>
"A closer look at unemployment reveals that some people are
unemployed not because there are no jobs, but because they trained
in skills which are not required by the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said small-scale enterprises offered better employment
opportunities than established companies.
</P>
<P>
He called upon teachers to encourage pupils to take practical
subjects such as building, carpentry, metal and technical graphics
to prepare themselves for self employment.
</P>
<P>
Sisimayi said some scored good points at high school but took
up irrelevant professions because of poor combination of subjects.
</P>
<P>
The director said sport should also be considered as a career.
</P>
<P>
He said a lot of young men and women were earning a living from
various sporting activities.

supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>

TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry

about the escalation of border clashes between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.

<P>
Asefi expressed hope that the two sides can patch up their
differences through peaceful channels and negotiations, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the two Horn of Africa countries resumed
earlier this month following the failure of diplomatic efforts to
resolve their disputes, with each side accusing the other of
instigating the bloody confrontation.

The Iranian spokesman lauded the initiatives taken by the
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity to restore
peace and stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
killed and several others injured on Saturday when U.S.-British
warplanes attacked civilian targets in southern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 3:05 p.m. (1205 GMT), 14 formations
of U.S.-British warplanes from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated
Iraq's southern airspace and launched missiles at Iraqi air
defense sites in Basra, Missan, Dhi-Qar and Najaf provinces.
</P>
<P>
The jets, supported by early warning planes, also fired
missiles at civilian targets on a harbor in Fao district and
another residential quarter in Basra, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi anti-aircraft units counter-attacked those
warplanes and forced them to flee.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, a total of even Iraqi civilians were killed
and dozens injured in U.S.-British air attacks on civilian targets
in the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain air-raided Iraq in mid-December to
retaliate what they claimed Iraq's non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has announced that it does not recognize the no-fly zones
and would fire at any jets patrolling the zones. Clashes between
Iraqi air defense units and U.S.-British warplanes have almost
become daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. and British warplanes bombed three residential
quarters in southern Iraq, killing dozens of civilians and
injuring nearly 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said earlier this week
that Iraq would go on confronting U.S.-British warplanes
violating Iraqi airspace regardless of the sacrifices and
consequences.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Protests Contacts Between Russian Regions, Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian Foreign Ministry
has lodged a strong protest against some Russian regions'
establishment of direct ties with Abkhazia, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
In a note sent to Moscow, the ministry said Russian regions and
federal structures "obstinately continue to establish direct
business contacts with the separatist leadership of Abkhazia"
despite numerous protests from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Kostroma region of Russia signed a deal on
trade and economic cooperation with Abkhazia. The Rostov region
and the Stavropoi Territory are also preparing similar agreements
with Abkhazia, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry said "cooperation with the
separatists in any form and in any field is a violation of the
Alma Ata Memorandum on the Maintenance of Peace and Stability in
the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) of February 10, 1995,
and of the decision on measures to settle the conflict in
Abkhazia, approved by the Council of the CIS heads of state under
the chairmanship of the president of Russia on January 19, 1996."
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi also protested the invitation, without consultation
with and consent of the Georgian government, of Abkhazian
President Vladisiav Ardzinba and South Ossetia leader Lyudvig
Chibirov to the February 6-8 meeting of the Russian association
North Caucasus in Sochi.
</P>
<P>
That meeting was also attended by Russian First Vice-Prime
Ministry Vadim Gustov, which "lent an official state status to the
event," Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The fact that "the leaders of separatist authorities from
Abkhazia and South Ossetia were invited" to Russia's internal
event is an "obvious act of connivance for anti-constitutional
regimes," Georgia said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting in Sochi as an "interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign Georgia," the Georgian Foreign
Ministry said participants at the meeting "turned it into a forum
to provocative statements against Georgian authorities, into some
sort of a trial for Georgia's policy."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Clinton Turns to Rebuilding His </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton, after a year of scandal and shame, will try to rebuild
his tarnished presidency. Surprisingly, he may discover some
unlikely allies among the Republicans who tried to force him from
office.
</P>
<P>
No matter what, Clinton will go into the history books with the
humiliating distinction of being only the second president ever
impeached. His challenge is to make historians write in the next
paragraph that he was a successful president nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are in trouble, too. Their zest for impeachment
backfired and angered voters, who concluded the Republican Party
was more interested in lynching Clinton than in fixing Social
Security and Medicare. Republicans sagged in the polls as Clinton
soared.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial against
Clinton and declared acquittal of his perjury and obstruction of
justice, thus ending a 13-month drama starting by disclosure of
the president's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his Republican adversaries share a common need to
persuade voters that they can get things done. The president wants
to repair his legacy; the Republicans want to save their political
skins. Both sides are angling for advantage in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
Clinton steered his way through the impeachment minefield by
proclaiming himself dedicated to the people's business and
championing politically popular causes such as education and
health care.
</P>
<P>
He will stick with that successful formula, frequently
reminding Americans they are living through the longest economic
expansion in U.S. history. Look for more foreign travel as well, a
traditional avenue of success for American presidents.
</P>
<P>
About two hours after the impeachment votes Friday, Clinton
pledged to "rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation
and building our future."
</P>
<P>
There is a good chance Clinton and Congress could come together
on two or three big issues such as Social Security, a big defense
buildup and perhaps a tax cut, said Reed, former director of the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "will feel enormous pressure to succeed in the last two
years," but at the same time he won't want to make the Republican
Congress look good, said Democratic consultant Dane Strother.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president is in a very strong position," White
House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed said. "He has a strong
centrist agenda and overwhelming public support."
</P>
<P>
"Congress needs to put the past year behind it and listen to
the pleas of the American people to stop playing politics and
start getting things done," Reed said.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign policy front, victories have proven elusive for
Clinton. He was instrumental in promoting the Good Friday peace
agreement in Northern Ireland, but its eventual success is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The president's peacemaking efforts in the Middle East have
been stalled, too. In Bosnia, the bloodshed has stopped, only to
be replaced by conflicts in Kosovo. Clinton hopes to demonstrate
"strong leadership" on both fronts in April when leaders of 44
nations gather in Washington for a NATO summit. He was flying to
Mexico Sunday to underscore his commitment to a troubled neighbor.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that domestically and overseas there will be a
greater tendency to question motives than there would be
otherwise," said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy studies
at Brookings.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will conduct four-week
training courses aimed at enhancing investigative and management
skills of the Tanzania police starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the United State Information Service (USIS) made
 available in Dar es Salaam Saturday said the courses will be run
by four FBI agents from Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
The course in the first two weeks will focus on Collection and
Preservation of Crime Scene Evidence, while the course in the
following two weeks will lay emphasis on Major Case Management.
</P>
<P>
The FBI will be teaching crime scene administration and
management, crime scene sketching and photography, collection of
trace evidence, serological evidence, firearms and tool mark
evidence and how to handle a bombing crime scene.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the students will participate in practicals whose
purpose is to refine the skills being taught.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Home Affairs John Mgeja and U.S. Ambassador
to Tanzania Charles Stith, are expected to attend the opening
ceremony for the courses to be held at the Police College in Dar
es Salaam Monday.
</P>
<P>
The courses are in response to a promise made by the FBI
Director, Louis Freech, when he visited Kenya and Tanzania,
following bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
which occurred simultaneously on August 7 last year.

Hayat newspaper quoted sources coming from the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the PNA decided to sell and buy 0.715
Jordanian dinar for one dollar, which is a little higher than the

1.2 billion dollars in each phases averagely after paying
compensations to the Gulf war victims.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Paris for Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Paris Saturday evening to attend a
meeting of Contact Group foreign ministers Sunday over the
deadlocked peace talks on Kosovo in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry officials said that Albright will go to
Rambouillet Sunday morning with French Foreign Minister Vedrine
and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the two co-chairmen of
the Rambouillet talks, to pressure the Serbs and Albanians to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived soon after U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced that Washington will send 4,000 troops to join a
European-led NATO force in Kosovo if Serbs and Albanians reach a
deal on ending the conflict in the province.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state will meet with the U.S. negotiator
in the Rambouillet talks, Christopher Hill, Saturday evening in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the six member countries of the
Contact Group will meet in Paris Sunday to evaluate the primary
results of the talks in Rambouillet in the past week, and are
expected to extend the talks for another week.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that the foreign ministers "will concert themselves for evaluating
the talks in course in Rambouillet, and decide the following
step."
</P>
<P>
The talks remained deadlocked by Saturday as both the Serb side
and the Albanian side stick to their original stands.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have rejected a deployment of NATO forces in Kosovo,
while the Albanians insist on holding a referendum on the future
of the province after a three-year period and the participation of
NATO in the process to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 Albanians demonstrated Saturday in Rambouillet in
support of the Albanian separatist guerrilla group, the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Implement Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to implement the second phase of its privatization program
involving its energy and telecommunications sectors in order to
reduce the size of its public sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at this year's budget dinner here late Friday, Hamza
Zayyad, head of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, said the
government would earn 2.12 billion U.S. Dollars from the
divestiture with the sale of 2.1 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bureau had prepared the guidelines for the
divestiture of 40 percent of government share-holdings, which
would be administered by consultants, investment bankers and stock
brokers.
</P>
<P>
The divestiture involves Nigeria Telecommunication Corporation,
National Electricity Power Authority, the National Fertilizer
Company, nine cement companies and four refineries in the west
African country, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the dinner, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar said diagnostic studies of the affected
companies would be conducted by technical and financial advisers
to pave way for negotiations for the sale.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that preparatory work had reached an advanced
stage for other companies slated for full privatization which were
awaiting the appointment of floating consultants who would take
them to the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader assured that the shares would go to those
with the "right technical and managerial abilities" to make
companies more efficient and reduce wastes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- New chief of the German carmaker
company BMW Joachim Milberg dismissed Saturday the speculation
about a possible takeover of his company as completely unfounded,
said media reports here.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing, absolutely nothing to it," Milberg said
during a meeting with Bavarian state Prime Minister Edmund
Stoiber, sources close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
In two hours' talks with Stoiber, Milberg insisted that "BMW is
and will remain independent." He said speculation about the future
was deliberatedly circulated by certain people.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the denial, speculation about the future of
the automobile manufacturer was fueled again by reports that the
U.S. carmaker General Motors (GM) wanted to acquire a stake in BMW
and that Germany's VW was also interested.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper Die Welt, quoting sources at GM
headquarters in Detroit, reported that GM would make an offer in
the next few days. And German carmaker VW was considering buying a
stake in BMW AG, according to a report of the German news magazine
Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
Milberg, former BMW production head, was appointed as new
managing board chairman earlier this month to succeed Bernd
Pischetsrieder, who has been blamed for the losses of the group's
British subsidiary, Rover.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Clarifies Pull-out of Troops from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar had clarified Nigeria's decision to pull out
all its troops in the west African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG
before the date of power hand-over to a civilian government on May
29.
</P>
<P>
"During a military regime, it is easy to move troops, but this
is not so under a democratic setting," he told reporters on the
flight home Saturday from the just concluded G-15 meeting in
Montago Bay, Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria provides the bulk of the 15,000 ECOMOG troops fighting
the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone and
anchored the sub-regional seven-year peace-keeping efforts which
ended with the restoration of democracy in neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader acknowledged that the objective could only
be realized through hard work and the assistance of friends
outside the sub- region, an obvious reference to the need for
international logistic and financial support for the ECOMOG
peace-keeping efforts in Sierra leone.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar noted that France had agreed to assist Niger and Togo,
two of the four ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States)
members that had pledged to contribute troops to the latest
regional peace-keeping efforts in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
France provided a vessel for the deployment of the 600 troops
from Benin, Niger and Togo who are already in the country and the
number of the troops was described as a "joke" by President Joao
Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Vieira noted that he was promised between 4,000 and 5,000
ECOMOG troops which would provide security and deploy along the
border with Senegal and Guinea ahead of legislative and
presidential elections scheduled before the end of March under the
November 1 Abuja accord.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,450 troops were pledged and they are expected to replace
about 2,900 Senegalese and Guinean troops due to leave at the end
of February and the troops were invited by President Vieira after
the rebellion by sacked army chief Gen. Ansumane Mane broke out on
June 7 last year.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar justified his frequent foreign trips as
necessary to find solutions to the country's economic problems and
sub-regional problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam planned to promote
development of tea industry, Vietnam News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will put 4,000 more ha under tea cultivation in 1999,
bringing the total tea acreage to 74,000 ha, according to the
Vietnam Tea Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's tea sector plans to invest 100 million U.S. dollars
in developing processing workshops to raise the processing
capacity to 2,300 tons of fresh tea buds per day by the year 2000
from 1,000 tons at present.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam produced only 50,000 tons of tea last year, 20 percent
lower than 1997, due to droughts. It exported about 35,360 tons of
dried tea buds posting a 12.4 percent year-on-year increase, for
more than 50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese tea, according to the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization, makes up about 3.5 percent of the world
tea market. The Middle East and Eastern Europe are the main
importers of Vietnamese tea, accounting for 40-50 percent and 31.5
percent of the country's total export, respectively.

ANKARA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz arrived here Sunday for talks on strained bilateral
ties as a result of attacks on Iraqi air defense sites by the
U.S. planes based on Turkish soil.
</P>
<P>
Aziz came to Habur Border Gate from Baghdad through the region

Incirlik base in Adana, southern Turkey, to conduct patrol missions
in the no-fly zone over northern Iraq, which was imposed by the
U.S. and its allies after the 1991 Gulf War with a declared aim of
protecting the Kurds there from alleged Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Strikes by the U.S.-British warplanes at the Iraqi air defense
sites in the zone have been repeatedly reported in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has, on several occasions, voiced its displeasure with
Ankara for allowing the base to be used by U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Thursday in Baghdad that he will ask Turkey to
terminate the U.S.-British mandate to use Incirlik and halt their
attacks on Iraqi military facilities in the north.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Sunday "the use
of Incirlik was the decision of the Turkish parliament," which has
renewed permission for the Incirlik-based Operation Northern Watch
since the end of the Gulf War, set off by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, Cem said Turkey will not allow the U.S. to
launch attacks on Iraq by using warplanes based in Turkey, saying
the base was solely commissioned with reconnaissance flights over
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The goal of U.S.-British patrol over the no-fly zone is to
deter Iraqi forces from attacking Kurds and creating another
refugee exodus to Turkey similar to the one that followed the Gulf
War, added Cem.
</P>
<P>
But regional analysts said Turkey is unlikely to seriously
cross its main diplomatic backers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said Thursday he will raise several "constructive"
proposals regarding the problems Iraq is facing during Aziz's
visit in Turkey. But he did not give details of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a news
briefing Thursday that "we don't understand Prime Minister
Ecevit's decision to host Tariq Aziz at this time. Obviously we
will be in diplomatic contact with the Turkish government on this
matter."
</P>
<P>
"We expect the Turkish government will make it clear to Tariq
Aziz that the roots of the current confrontation with Iraq are
Baghdad's eight-year-long refusal to meet its U.N. obligations and
more recently its challenges to the no-fly zones, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Gains Observer Status in OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A press release from the Singapore Trade Development Board
(TDB) Sunday said that TDB's Chief Executive Barry Desker will
lead a Singapore delegation to the Trade Committee's 124th session
due to be held in Paris on February 16 to 17, 1999, to make
Singapore's maiden appearance as an observer at the OECD.
</P>
<P>
In the press release, Desker clarified that "observer status in
the OECD Committees is not a step towards membership in the OECD.
Singapore is still a developing economy and remains committed to
the G77."
</P>
<P>
Desker also commented that Singapore's interest in the OECD
stems essentially from its "fruitful experience" as a member of
the Dynamic Non-Member Economies and Singapore has participated
actively in policy dialogues with OECD members and benefited
"enormously" from these activities.
</P>
<P>
"By being an OECD observer," Desker said, "Singapore can keep
abreast of the latest thinking on various economic issues."
</P>
<P>
"This in turn would help us in formulating our own thinking and
policies," Desker added.
</P>
<P>
The OECD is a Paris-based intergovernmental organization
comprising 29 members and serves as a forum for governments to
compare experiences, discuss economic and social problems and seek
and design solutions.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, 1998, Singapore formally applied for observer
status in three OECD Committees and their respective working
parties, namely the Trade Committee and its Working Party, the
Committee on Financial Markets, and the Committee on Information,
Computer and Communications Policy (ICCP) and its Working Parties
on the Information Economy and on Information, Security and
Privacy.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, Singapore's application for observer status in
the Trade Committee and the ICCP Committee was approved by the
OECD Council and was invited to participate as an observer in the
Trade Committee.
</P>
<P>
The press release said Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Hong Kong,
all of them are developing economies, are already observers in the
Trade Committee of the OECD.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Fighting in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Insecurity is a major
problem that worries the people of the Somali capital Mogadishu
despite the presence of Islamic militiamen and thousands of
trained police force.
</P>
<P>
Innocent people die everyday as a result of the prolonged
lawlessness in the chaotic capital.
</P>
<P>
Four people have died and at least five others were wounded in
separate shoot-outs Sunday in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In one of the incidents, two men were killed and three others
were wounded when unidentified gunmen attacked three Islamic
militiamen near Al-Baraka junction of South Mogadishu. The
perpetrators who drove a Landcruiser pickup also collected four
guns from the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
The other terrifying incident took place in the very populated
market of Manopolio in North Mogadishu controlled by faction
leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed. A young woman was killed and two others
were wounded when gunmen attacked a food store in the center of
the market.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, elements from the encamped militiamen who
are acting as the police force of the capital, were involved in
both incidents.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said some of the gunmen in Manopolio attack
and those at Al-Baraka junction were identified as belonging to
the recently demobilized militiamen by the disputed administration
of Mogadishu. The sources attributed the incidents to the delayed
payment of the police force wages since December last year.
</P>
<P>
The encampment of the 3,000-strong former police and militiamen
was one of the successes achieved by the administration of
Mogadishu announced jointly by Ali Mahdi and Hussein Aidid.
However, the delay of their payments has created some doubts as
how far they can exist or may remain loyal to their
administration.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Warns of Crisis in NIreland Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) --The Sinn Fein's party warned
Sunday of a "real crisis" in the Northern Ireland peace process
after Irish Premier Bertie Ahern said it won't be part of Belfast'
s assembly unless the Irish Republican Army (IRA) gives up arms.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking an urgent clarification from Dublin," Mitchel
McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, told the British Broadcasting
Corporation's Frost.
</P>
<P>
"That would be a very serious development indeed particularly
as we are about to meet tomorrow morning to vote on determination
on the number of department and the ministerial council," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ahern told Sunday Times: "Our view is that
decommissioning in one form or another has to happen."
</P>
<P>
"It is not compatible with being a part of a government and
part of an executive if there is not at least a commencement of
decommissioning," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said Ahern's remarks
were not a surprise, and accused Sinn Fein of living in denial.
</P>
<P>
"I think the moment of truth is now arriving for the republican
movement, they have played games with this process for so long,"
he also told the BBC's Frost.
</P>
<P>
Monday the 108 members of the Northern Ireland assembly are to
vote how the body should proceed and to discuss a report by David
Trimble, also Northern Ireland First Minister, and his deputy
Seamus Mallon, which paved the way for transferring power from
London to Belfast.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Oscar De La Hoya passed
what he called the toughest test of his career, getting up from a
knockdown and twice knocking down Ike Quartey to retain the WBC
welterweight championship on a split decision last night in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
De La Hoya clinched the victory by storming out in the 12th
round to knock down Quartey in just 12 seconds. The champion then
pummerled Quartey for the next minute before tiring in front of a
crowd of about 12,000.
</P>
<P>
Both fighters went down in the sixth round of a tremendous bout,
one that compares with the welterweight showdown between Sugar Ray
Leonard and Thomas Hearns, which Leonard and Hearns were at
ringside.
</P>
<P>
Judge Larry O'Connelll of England scored it for Quartey 115-114.
Judge John Keane of England scored it 115-113 and Ken Marika
scored it 115-112, both for De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old De La Hoya, now 30-0 with 24 knockouts, showed
that he could get up from a knockdown and win. He also showed
tremendous determination, especially in the last round.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Macao Residents Eager to Enter Selection Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Over the past 20 days, Macao
residents have been showing unprecedented enthusiasm about being
picked to be members of the Selection Committee which will produce
the first chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Up to 7:00 p.m. on Sunday, 2,952 application forms were issued
and 2,291 were collected. In another word, 77.6 percent of those
who had asked for application forms turned in the papers.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from January 26, Macao people had been flocking to
the Macao Office of the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee
for the Macao SAR. Among them were people of both Chinese and
Portuguese origins who have permanent residence in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that Macao residents, particularly those of Chinese
origin, feel a strong sense of attachment to the motherland and
are anxious for return," said a staff member working in the Macao
Office.
</P>
<P>
Following more than 400 years of Portuguese rule, Macao people
have nurtured more vehement affection for being part of the
Chinese nation. Growing strength of the motherland in turn boosted
their pride and confidence.
</P>
<P>
The principles of "one country, two systems" and "Macao people
governing Macao" have aroused their enthusiasm about being masters
of their own fate. As a promising prospect of Macao is being
unveiled, Macao people will surely display their initiative to
exert their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
What's important, Hong Kong's successful return to the
motherland has set a good example for Macao.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Macao people's eagerness for being members
of the Selection Committee indicates that they pay close attention
to what the first chief executive of the Macao SAR will be like
and that they want to participate with their own activities.
</P>
<P>
If you ask an applicant why he or she wants to be a Selection
Committee member, the most common answer is something like "to
elect a satisfying chief executive who is able to lead Macao to
prosperity and stability."
</P>
<P>
In another sense, improvement in public security and better
economic development are the hot topics which are widely talked
about among Macao residents, who enjoy the right to participate in
the democratic election for the first time in Macao's history.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ultra-Orthodox Jews Hold Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police braced for
possible violence Sunday as hundreds of thousands of
ultra-orthodox Jews took to the streets of Jerusalem over recent
controversial Supreme Court rulings.
</P>
<P>
The Ultra-orthodox Jews in black coats, known as Haredim or
God-fearing Jews, started their demonstration at 2:30 p.m. local
time near the western entrance of the city against the Supreme
Court's judgments that have favored civil rights above the
religious law, including one allowing some shops to open on
the Shabat, the Jewish day of rest.
</P>
<P>
A simultaneous counter-demonstration by tens of thousands of
Supreme Court supporters is going on near the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 policemen were deployed in "Operation Static
Electricity" to keep protesters away from the Supreme Court
building and keep the two rival demonstrations apart, police
said.
</P>
<P>
Police closed off all roads leading to the old bus
station near the western entrance to the city, where the
Ultra-Orthodox Jews coming from the whole country are
demonstrating.
</P>
<P>
Several police helicopters are circling over Jerusalem as
part of the police operation for preventing possible violence.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman, for fear of bloodshed, held several
round of meetings with the spiritual leaders of the religious
parties and demonstration organizers earlier this week and asked
them to cancel the demonstration, but his efforts failed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also did the same, but
his requests have also been rejected.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told his cabinet Sunday morning that he had
failed in his last-ditch attempt Saturday night to persuade
Ultra-Orthodox rabbis, some of them his own coalition partners,
to cancel the mass demonstration.
</P>
<P>
"We are organizing, in my opinion, a million people...who
will pray to the blessed holy one to bring the spirit of
light into the hearts of the judges so that we can live in
Israel according to our belifs," said Ultra-Orthodox organizer
Menachem Porush, acting chairman of the Agudat Israel party.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party chairman Ehud Barak and the
newly formed Centrist party leader Yitzhak Mordechai Sunday
criticized Netanyahu for not doing enough to prevent the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen civil right groups, political parties and
liberal religious organizations, ranging from the Labor party,
the Centrist party, Meretz and the movement for progressive
Judaism, joined efforts to organize the counter-demonstration to
the Ultra-Orthodox rally.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Ultra-Orthodox has no right to attack
the Supreme Court, its president Aharon Barak and other judges,
because the country's legal system is the pillar of democracy.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said there was a
heavy artillery exchange fire between the Ethiopian Defense Forces
and the Eritrean Army at 06:30 a.m. Sunday morning on the Bure
front.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Office of Ethiopian Government
Spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said Ethiopian air force "participated
in the counter offensive causing the the enemy heavy losses by
bombing enemy positions."
</P>
<P>
"Two enemy tanks have been destroyed and a large reserve water
tank has been demolished," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"As the area is without water supplies, the destruction of this
enemy water reserve is particularly significant. The reserve army
as well as the front line suffered heavy human and military
losses."
</P>
<P>
"In the course of destroying the Eritrean Army, one Ethiopian
helicopter was shot down by Eritrean ground forces," the statement
said. "The rest of Ethiopia's fighter planes and helicopters have
returned," it added.
</P>
<P>
The over nine-month border dispute resumed full-scale fighting
on February 6. But fighting has eased over the past four days
with only sporadic shelling.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea refused to accept an Organization of African Unity
(OAU) peace plan which called on it to withdraw from the contested
Badme area.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Wen Jiabao sent
new year's greetings to members of China's 15th South Pole
Exploration Team via satellite today on behalf of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and
the Chinese People.
</P>
<P>
Wen praised their achievements and said they have completed
their tasks and have contributed to polar exploration through
their strenuous efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's polar exploration has shown the
improvements in China's power and science and technology and has
increased international exchanges and co-operation and China's
international status.
</P>
<P>
The team of explorers left for the South Pole in two groups on
November 5 and December 10, 1998 and plans to return later this
month. They have traveled 1,100 km toward the polar ice cap,
reaching the pole's highest part, and have drilled ice samples
more than 600 year old.
</P>
<P>
The team has also gone to the Grove Mountains where they found
four meteorites and have found an anchorage for their ships on the
southeastern part of the pole.
</P>
<P>
To protect the environment of the pole, they plan to carry more
than 200 tons of garbage that has accumulated over the past decade
when they return to China.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The city of Guangzhou, a
major transportation hub in southern China, has been keeping the
movement of passengers smooth by adding temporary trains, flights,
and long-distance buses as the Spring Festival approaches.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival, China's lunar new year which starts February
16 this year, is the most important Chinese festival and a time
for family reunion.
</P>
<P>
A city transportation official at an office established
specially for the Spring Festival, said that they have added 178
temporary trains for the period.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 additional buses going to other provinces have been
added together with 469 flights for the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
He said that the railway, airlines, and highway transport have
carried more than 3.48 million people so far this month and that
18 million people are expected to leave Guangdong to go home
during the festival period and the city is trying to guarantee on-
time and safe transportation.
</P>
<P>
This figure is slightly higher than that for last year, when a
large number of people got stranded in Guangzhou for several days.

<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Sunday visited orphans and caretakers of the orphanage in
Manila which was razed by fire in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Attending a ceremony for a formal handover of the new building
that replaced the decrepit and wooden structures in the orphanage,
Estrada also released a fund of 2 million pesos (50,000 U.S.
dollars) for the operation of the orphanage.
</P>
<P>
"With this new building, we can once again provide a temporary
shelter to children whose families cannot provide for their
needs," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The orphans, most of them children, greeted Estrada and other
guests with love songs.
</P>
<P>
Estrada commended private sector donors for their financial
assistance which, he said, proves Filipinos' readiness to assist
less fortunate in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Estrada pledged to lead all efforts in
rebuilding the 85-year-old house settlement which was razed in a
pre-dawn fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire killed 24 children and three caretakers.

<HEADLINE> Confusion Prevailing at APP Party Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The failure of the All People's
Party (APP) to have its presidential aspirants screened for
Sunday's national convention in Kaduna has thrown the party
members into confusion.
</P>
<P>
The aspirants who arrived in capital Abuja Thursday to obtain
nomination forms were still waiting for the screening of the
party's screening committee on Saturday, local media reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of delegates from all over the country converging for
the national convention scheduled for Sunday have not been
allocated accommodation by the organizing committee with some
sleeping in the open space.
</P>
<P>
APP National Chairman Senator Hahmud Wazini ran into hiding
Saturday to avoid the agitations by party members who sort for an
amendment to the order of the three-point agenda of the national
convention.
</P>
<P>
The agenda drawn for the convention is referred to
constitutional amendment, nomination of flag bearer and election
of the National Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates said they preferred to deal with the election of
national offices first before anything else, but the national
executive was not comfortable with the demand.
</P>
<P>
Barely hours before the national convention, a legal question
still hangs on the APP party on Saturday evening, affecting the
fate of the convention.
</P>
<P>
Although APP Chairman Waziri maintained last Friday the party's
decision, members of the APP National Executive Council were said
to have arrived at a decision to open the contest to all the
aspirants including Olusola Saraki.
</P>
<P>
Going by the party's decision, the trio of Saraki, Alhaji Lema
Jibril and Senator Andrawu Sawa were excluded from Sunday contest
as they are from the North of the country.

while many mainlanders come to Hong Kong for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
This makes Lo Wu checkpoint, a major land boundary checkpoint
linking to the mainland's Shenzhen city, busier than ever before.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the number of departing passengers through Lo Wu
reached a peak of 170,000. This brought the total number of
departing travelers via Hong Kong's land boundary checkpoints on
that day to 297,400.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated by the Immigration Department that about 5.2
million people will cross the land boundary checkpoints to and
from the mainland before and during the holiday period,
representing a 30 percent increase as compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 4.5 million people will cross the boundary via
the Lo Wu checkpoint, up 32 percent as compared to that of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Local shops are crowded with people and store shelves full of
traditional gifts such as rabbit toys, wrapped delicacies and
clothing especially prepared for students, couples and friends.
</P>
<P>
Many people including foreigners are carefully choosing
traditional Chinese clothes for their children or themselves in a
bid to seek good lucks in the coming Year of Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ng Fung Hong Limited in Hong Kong, the largest
food supplier in Hong Kong, the three express freight trains
starting from Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Wuhan of the mainland, as
usual, supply adequate fresh and frozen foods as well as livestock
to the Hong Kong market around the holidays.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 pigs, more than 200 head of cattle, and 200,000
chickens are entering Hong Kong in a steady stream everyday. As Ng
Fung Hong Limited has told Xinhua that in order to enable the Hong
Kong people to spend holidays in a healthy and joyful manner, the
company will make every effort to ensure the quality and quantity
of goods.
</P>
<P>
In addition, varied and colorful activities for celebrating the
festival are in full swing.
</P>
<P>
A lightening up ceremony for a Lunar New year fair was held in
Victoria Park on Saturday evening. Another eight fairs in the
Provisional Regional Council area on and before the Lunar New Year
eve add the festive atmosphere to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To greet the second traditional Chinese Spring Festival after
Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997, people will pour into
the streets to watch the Lunar New Year Parade and Fiesta on
February 16.
</P>
<P>
This will be followed by new types of fireworks lightening up
in the Victoria Harbor on February 17, the second day of the Lunar
New Year.
</P>
<P>
A record number of 31,388 fireworks will be discharged and will
be the biggest and the most spectacular Lunar New Year fireworks
show ever displayed.
</P>
<P>
People can enjoy the fireworks display either on site or at
home as the show will be live broadcast on television and radio,
accompanied by magnificent music.
</P>
<P>
The Year of Tiger will be soon over amid the jubilant
atmosphere. The people in Hong Kong sincerely hope that the Year
of Rabbit will bring them new hope and more happiness.

<P>
TOKYO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Gert Thys of South African set
the second fastest marathon time in history on Sunday when he
clocked two hours six minutes 33 seconds to win the Tokyo Marathon.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old was just 28 seconds outside the world best
recorded by Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in Berlin last September.
</P>
<P>
Da Costa's time of 2:06:05 shattered the 10-year-old mark of
Ethiopian Belayneh Dinsamo by 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Thys burst ahead from the 31-km mark to finish one minute 32
seconds ahead of Japan's Hiroshi Miki. Another Japanese, Koji
Shimizu, was third in 2:09:00.
</P>
<P>
Thys, who appeared comfortable throughout the race from the
National Stadium to Omori Beach, near Tokyo's main domestic Haneda
airport, and back again, said of his time: "It's a personal best,
so I'm delighted.
</P>
<P>
Miki, who shaved almost two seconds off his own personal best,
paid tribute to Thys's strength in the final few kilometers.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Taliban Tries to Walk Out of Osama Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The announcement from the
Taliban militia on Saturday that Osama bin Laden went missing has
left a big question mark on the status of the Saudi dissident.
</P>
<P>
Speculations of all variety have been aroused: could he still
be in Afghanistan? If he already moved out of the country, where
has he gone?
</P>
<P>
Despite such speculations, a perception easier to reach is that
the Taliban have adjusted their policy on Osama to avoid another
phase of military strikes by the U.S., this time likely on their
headquarters of Kandahar, the southern Afghan city, where the
Saudi dissident had been sheltered for the last several months.
</P>
<P>
The threat of the American strikes on Afghanistan has been
looming large for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
During his recent talks with the Taliban and Pakistani
officials, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian
Affairs Karl Inderfruth is reported to have strongly made the
point to the Taliban to extradite Osama or hand him over to the
U.S., suggesting the U.S. will keep all its options open,
including the option of further strikes.
</P>
<P>
Military observers believe that if the Taliban failed to meet
Washington's demand, the militia would be under imminent strikes
far more decisive and deadly than the missile attacks last August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missile strikes last August on the eastern
Afghan town of Khost, aiming at smashing the "terrorist base" of
the Saudi dissident who was accused by Washington of masterminding
the bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7
last year which killed more than 200 people including 12
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Osama, however, managed to survive the strike by reportedly
leaving the town timely.
</P>
<P>
Osama, along with other Arab nationals came to Afghanistan in
the late 1970s to take part in Hehhad (holy fight) against troops
of the former Soviet Union. He left Afghanistan after the
withdrawal of the Soviet forces and returned to that country in
May 1996 from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Osama had rejected Washington's accusations, saying that he had
no links with the blasts at the two U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of fresh attacks gained more weight when
Richard Clarke from the U.S. National Security Council issued a
statement that Washington would use force on countries which
provide sanctuary to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan was believed to be on the top of the U.S. hit list
for the Taliban's hospitality to Osama and refusal to hand over
the Saudi dissident after the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
Demanding proof for Osama's involvement in terrorist
activities, the Taliban had been kept saying, "unless proven a
terrorist, Osama will enjoy all freedom on the Afghan soil."
</P>
<P>
However, the militia controlling over 80 percent of the Afghan
territory showed flexibility under the buildup of pressure by
issuing a statement on Wednesday saying that they had imposed
fresh restrictions on Osama.
</P>
<P>
Osama was reported to be banned to receive visitors and no
longer have any facilities to communicate with anyone. Besides, a
special team had been set up to monitor the Saudi dissident's
activities.
</P>
<P>
But this was obviously inadequate for falling short of the
demand of Washington to extradite Osama or hand him over directly
to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban tacitly made a hint to the later development when
they declared the restrictions on Osama's activities by saying
that the Saudi dissident has the option of leaving Afghanistan out
of his own volition.
</P>
<P>
The latest statement on Osama's disappearance from Taliban
supreme leader Mulla Omar showed that the Taliban increasingly
find the man who once helped them through difficult times and to
whom they feel greatly indebted has become a national problem for
them.
</P>
<P>
His continued presence in the war-ravaged country had raised
local fears of another phase of U.S. military strikes and hampered
efforts by foreign aid groups and the United Nations to return
after their evacuation following the U.S. missile strikes last
August.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the Taliban's choice is probably the best
under current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
It deprived the U.S. of the reason for fresh strikes on
Afghanistan, at least for the time being, and meanwhile gave Osama
options to consider other hide-outs, no matter in Afghanistan or
any other country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Terms Peace Strategic Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon said on Sunday that
peace is "a strategic choice" for Lebanon in dealing with its
relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio over telephone
from Beirut, Lebanese Information Minister Anwar Khalil said that
his country sticks to the peace option.
</P>
<P>
Khalil, in the meantime, said that the Middle East peace should
be based on the land-for-peace principle, adding that it must be
comprehensive and durable, the Cairo-based radio said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Lebanon and Israel have been in a
stalemate since the two sides kicked off the process in 1991
alongside other Arab countries due to Israel's failure to pull
back troops from south Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state proposed last year to withdraw from the
self-styled security zone if the Lebanese government agrees on
Israel's security arrangements for the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal
be unconditional under the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 425 adopted in 1982 after Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Terming the relations between Lebanon and Syria "very
distinguished," Khalil said the trip of Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud to Damascus on Friday is "most appropriate and well-timed."
</P>
<P>
The close ties linking Lebanon to Syria "have propelled Lahoud
to pay this visit to congratulate Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
on his re-election for a fifth seven-year term in office."
</P>
<P>
Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon as
peacekeepers, has agreed to coordinate stances on key issues with
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Five Schools Ordered to Close in Lusaka due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of pupils have been
turned away in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, after five schools
in Chawama and Kanyama townships were ordered to close down
because of a outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
A medical officer at New Kanyama Health Centre expressed fear
Saturday that patients being treated of cholera at the center may
all die due to lack of drugs, Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kanyama, where one of the five schools is
located, is alarming, the medical officer said.
</P>
<P>
Another government newspaper, Sunday Times of Zambia, quoted
acting Lusaka District director of health, Bvulani Malumo, as
saying that the closure of the schools was meant to prevent
cholera from spreading further.
</P>
<P>
"Some pupils suffered from severe diarrhoea and vomiting in
some schools thereby putting others at risk. To prevent the
further spread of the disease, the Ministry of Health decided to
close all the schools in the area as cholera cases are increasing
everyday," Malumbo said.
</P>
<P>
Since the cholera broke out in the country last month, at least
50 people have died of the epidemic, of which over 20 died in
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Mail said in its editorial that while people may have
the personal hygiene, it is common knowledge that few people care
about their surrounding, especially those in squatters that have
mushroomed around Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
It is time people learn that they should not leave everything
to the government. Prevention of cholera is not something that an
institution should make a sole occupation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia said in its comment that the country's
health ministry will demand the local authorities to clean up
public places such as markets and schools and educate the people
on the causes of cholera.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper urged the local authorities to remove the
mountains of garbage that litter towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
Closing down schools merely serves to transfer the problem from
the school to the children's homes most of which lack clean
drinking water and proper sanitation, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's PDP Party to Pick Presidential Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Democratic Party of
Nigeria is scheduled to choose its presidential candidate Sunday
at its special national convention in Jos, Plateau State, for the
February 27 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday in Jos, seven presidential aspirants of the
Nigeria's dominant party intensified their campaign, struggling to
win delegates over to their sides, local media reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Who can finally win the party's presidential flagbearer ticket
remained a mystery as two main contenders of former Head of State
General Olusegun Obasanjo and former Vice-President Alex Ekwueme
were still running neck to neck.
</P>
<P>
The camps of Obasanjo and Ekwueme were not leaving anything to
chance as they made last minute efforts to woo delegates to their
sides, according to a Sunday Times report.
</P>
<P>
At the Jos stadium, venue of the convention, the Ekwueme group
had a musical stand where a group of musicians had been treating
delegates to some sonorous tunes while imploring them to vote
Ekwueme.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Obasanjo group of supporters had been
singing and dancing around the stadium singing the praises of
General Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Given the tension that has built up in the city between the two
major camps, it was feared Saturday that the supporters of
Obasanjo and Ekwueme might clash, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A large contingent of mobile police was stationed at all
entrances to the stadium to forestall the breakdown of law and
order while a police tank was stationed at the manned entrance to
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Former Head of State General Ibrahim Babangida arrived in Jos
Saturday at the head of several retired generals to garner support
for his predecessor General Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the two camps confirmed that Babangida had
secretly and separately reached out to both Obasanjo and Ekwueme
in a bid to influence the outcome of the party's convention.
</P>
<P>
The PDP has been labelled a party of "military generals"
because of its high membership of retired generals, a factor
likely to work in Obasanjo's favour at the convention.
</P>
<P>
Ekwueme is mostly appealed to anti-military sentiments in the
West African country which had been uninterruptedly ruled by the
military for the past 15 years, asking people not to vote a
retired general.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official Insists on Death Sentence on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The death sentence on British
writer Salman Rushdie remains valid and will be carried out, local
daily Jomhuri Eslami (Islamic Republic) Sunday quoted a senior
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran is strongly firm in defending the death sentence on
Rushdie, said Ayatollah Sheikh Hassan Sanai, representative of
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an interview with
the daily on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the death
sentence on Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Sanai, also head of the hard-line Khordad 15 Foundation, said
that Iran has never changed its stance on the Rushdie issue and it
is totally wrong to think that Iran has changed its policy.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Musavi Khomeini issued a religious decree against Rushdie's life
on the charge that his book "the Satanic Verses" has insulted
Islamic prophet Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
The Khordad 15 Foundation, a charity organization, has offered
an award of 2.8 million U.S. dollars to those who kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
On September 24 last year, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said in New York that the Iranian government would not
take or support any action to threaten the life of Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the award offered by the Khordad 15
Foundation had nothing to do with the Iranian government which
would not support it.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's remarks were seen by western countries as Iran's
retreat from its policy on the Rushdie issue since the moderate
government of President Mohammad Khatami has been trying to
improve Tehran's relations with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Iran also agreed to upgrade their ties to the
ambassadorial level by putting aside the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
While denying any change in Iran's stance towards Rushdie,
senior Iranian officials said later that it was London that
changed its policy on the issue, which blocked a rapprochement
between the two countries in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's German Tour to Focus on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The stalled Mideast peace
process will dominate the talks President Hosni Mubarak is to hold
with German leaders during his upcoming visit to the country,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has said.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his German counterpart
Joschka Fischer after a meeting here late Saturday night, Moussa
said that Mubarak's talks would be part of Egypt's consultations
with the Europe Union (EU), Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will travel to Germany on February 22, MENA said,
adding that he had conferred with French President Jacques Chirac
on the Mideast peace march early this month in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Egypt is preparing a new initiative to break the
current logjam in the peace process, Moussa said Egypt is doing
its best to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
But he said that such an overture would be necessary should
"the noose is kept tightened" around the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel are
deadlocked due to Israel's failure to carry out the Wye peace
accord signed last October in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel should pull back troops from another
13 percent of the West Bank in three phases. But after the first
phase of withdrawal in early December, Israel suspended the
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate of the peace process also figured high in Moussa's
talks with Fischer, whose country holds EU's rotating presidency
of the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived here Saturday night on a Mideast tour, which
has taken him to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Lebanon,
Syria and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming visit by Mubarak to Germany will "certainly
have positive impact on" various issues of mutual concern, Fischer
said, adding that the trip "will likely promote" the Egyptian-EU
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and Germany "share deep concern over" the deadlock
of the peace process, Fischer said, adding that the two countries
are working along with the world community to help advance the
process.
</P>
<P>
The EU and its member states, which hope to play a key role in
resolving issues in the Middle East, keep close contacts with
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
and an active mediator in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Modern Science Needed to Develop Traditional Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of scientists recently
called for using modern high technology to develop traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) in order to help improve healthcare and
establish an international market for related products.
</P>
<P>
China imported traditional medicine valued at 100 million US
dollars from Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) in 1998, with
the volume of imports far exceeding the level for exports,
according to a recent report in Science Times.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration of Traditional
Chinese Medicine said that the nation's 77 TCM research institutes
operate without state-level laboratories.
</P>
<P>
He noted that entry of TCM products into the international
market has been hindered by the small scale and low technological
level of research efforts.
</P>
<P>
Basic TCM research is attracting increasing attention in
neighboring countries, as well as in the United States, Britain
and Germany, according to Xiao Peigen, an academician with the
Chinese Academy of Engineering. He added that Japan and the
Republic of Korea have established special research institutes.
</P>
<P>
Xiao noted that various traditional medicines developed in
Japan and the ROK have gained a foothold in the international
market, with China lagging far behind in terms of annual exports
of related products.
</P>
<P>
U.S. sales of herbal medicines hit 10 billion US dollars in
1996, with China accounting for a mere one percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said the development of traditional Chinese medicine
requires extensive scientific data and strict research measures to
ensure the safety and efficacy of related products.
</P>
<P>
Experts stress that China should establish a modern TCM
research system within five years in order to strengthen the
industry's competitiveness in the international market.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Tighten Control on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to draft
legislation to tighten control on guns, which are a major
contributing factor to the country's spiralling crime wave, Sunday
Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The measures will include banning fully automatic weapons,
forcing the public to re-apply for firearm licenses, and banning
the sale of toy guns that look like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
A task team appointed by Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi is to meet in Pretoria Monday to begin drafting the
legislation, the paper quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police are expected to amend the Arms and Ammunition Act during
this session of parliament to severely restrict gun owners'
ability to lend their firearms to others.
</P>
<P>
The blanket ban proposed in the new legislation will outlaw
fully automatic weapons such as AK-47s and R1s, R4s and R5s, all
of which are commonly used in bank and cash-in-transit robberies
and in acts of political violence.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to include a ban on bullets and handguns, such
as the Russian-made Tokarev pistol, that are capable of piercing
bullet-proof vests.
</P>
<P>
The task team will be led by Peter Gastrow of the Institute for
Security Studies, who last year drafted the tough new Prevention
of Organized Crime Act.
</P>
<P>
The tough measures they are expected to come up with include:
</P>
<P>
-- forcing all gun owners to re-apply for licenses, and to
re-apply every five years;
</P>
<P>
-- more thorough screening of applications for firearm
licenses;
</P>
<P>
-- scrapping legislation that allows license holders to lend
their firearms to another person for a period of 14 days;
</P>
<P>
-- increasing the gun licensing fee;
</P>
<P>
-- excluding those convicted of violent crimes such as robbery
and murder from having gun licenses; and
</P>
<P>
-- refusing licenses to those who abuse alcohol and narcotics
and those who have committed acts of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said in reply to a question in parliament this week
that 20,000 South Africans with criminal records had firearm
licenses that had not been revoked.
</P>
<P>
An investigation of 891 cases found that 138 of these people
had been convicted of serious crimes, including assault, treason
and murder, the paper said.

MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said he is going to Mindanao to fulfill his promise to
bring peace and prosperity to the south, the Philippines News
Agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying in his weekly radio-TV program
that he is ready to visit Mindanao even if there is no guarantee
that he could meet with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
Chairman Hashim Salamat.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he would be happy to meet Salamat as a way to
speed up the full restoration of peace and order in Mindanao
because economic development cannot thrive in an environment of
hostilities.

<P>
Estrada is scheduled to go to Mindanao from February 25 to 28.
He would visit several provinces in the area and see for himself
the progress of ongoing projects there.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls for Care for Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 14 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has urged parents to take care of their children
and keep them from roaming the streets.
</P>
<P>
Opening the national conference of the Tanzania Parents
Association (WAZAZI) in central town of Dodoma Saturday, Mkapa
said parents should observe family planning methods and avoid
giving birth by "accidents."
</P>
<P>
He noted that as streets do not give birth, the street children
were born as a result of unplanned births and the effect of
decaying morals in society particularly on children, local
newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president challenged parents to act as models of better
behavior in words and deeds for children to emulate.
</P>
<P>
"Ethics are not only taught by words, but also by deeds. It is
nonsense to restrain a child from lying or hurling insults to
others when the parent is leading in committing such immoral
actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we like it or not, a child's behavior is a reflection
of its parents and a society in which they live."
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said even the rate of crimes among the youth like
banditry, theft and drug abuse was an indication that they
imitated from either their parents or relatives.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned failure of parents to allocate enough time to
stay with their children as another cause for moral decay among
the children.
</P>
<P>
"Street children are a vivid indication of disintegration of
better upbringing of children, and bearing children without the
ability to keep them and educate them," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He called on WAZAZI, a long-term wing of the ruling Chama Cha
Mapinduzi party, to help in improving the quality of education
through its secondary schools by equipping them with necessary
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa stressed that the quality of teachers was a crucial
factor in offering children better education.

NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The national census will start

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Reform Parliamentary Committee System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
embarked on a reform program to make the committee system of the
National Assembly transparent and accountable to the people.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop on parliamentary committee reforms held here
Saturday, Vice-President Christon Tembo said the program was
important because the current system had been found totally
wanting.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Sunday quoted Tembo as saying that
despite the phenomenal development of the committee system in the
National Assembly and its significant impact in overseeing
executive action, the general development of committees, their
powers, facilities and method of work have been found wanting.
</P>
<P>
"It is envisaged that the reformed committee system will be
able to capture and scrutinize activities of all government
ministries and departments on a wider scale and in a more
transparent manner than was the case in the past," Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the committee has been divided into four
categories which include the general purpose committee, the house
keeping committee, select committee and departmentally related
committees.
</P>
<P>
Tembo explained that in the departmentally related committees,
all ministries and government departments had been attached to at
least one parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
The function of parliament was to oversee government action and
 activities to ensure efficiency and accountability.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of the reasons for reforming the committees
were to allow for public participation in the legislation process
and in the scrutiny of the activities and policies of the
executive.

<HEADLINE> China's Satellite Launching Service Successful(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China has made a record in
commercial launching in 1998 in terms of both the number of
launches and the number of satellites carried.
</P>
<P>
The six launches of the year, four in Taiyuan, Shanxi, by the
upgraded version of Long March 2C (LM 2C) carriers and two in
Xichang, Sichuan, by LM 3B, carried a total of 10 foreign
satellites into the predetermined orbits.
</P>
<P>
"Eight of the satellites were made by Motorola, one by Lockheed-
Martin and one by a French company," said Zhang Xinxia, president
of China Great Wall Industrial Corporation (CGWIC), the country's
sole contractor for foreign satellite launching.
</P>
<P>
CGWIC started commercial satellite launching service 13 years
ago. It had been successful until 1996 when two launch failures
concerning the LM rockets occurred.
</P>
<P>
"The accidents aroused suspicion of our ability to offer
satellite launching service,' Zhang said. "We had no way but to
face our problems squarely and improve ourselves for a comeback on
the international market."
</P>
<P>
Using carrier rockets of the same LM family, the company
launched one satellite in October 1996, two months after the
second accident in the year, then in 1997, eight more in six
launches.
</P>
<P>
"LM rockets did all the six launches in 1998," said Zhang. "
That means we have shaken off the ghost of the previous failures."
</P>
<P>
CGWIC has so far conducted 55 launches over the past 28 years,
nearly 90 percent of which were successful.
</P>
<P>
Collectively, these satellites obtained a wealth of high-
resolution images, by means of which valuable and varied
information was gleaned by specialists in many disciplines
including petroleum geology, land surveying, civil engineering,
seismology and archeology.

<TEXT>
<P>
At present, China has put eight types of rockets into
international commercial service. They are able to launch
satellites into low-earth orbits, solar-synchronous and geo-
synchronous transfer orbits.
</P>
<P>
CGWIC is now executing its contracts signed with Hughs Space
and Communications to launch 13 satellites before the end of 2001,
12 of them to low orbits and one to geo-synchronous transfer
orbits.
</P>
<P>
In line with an agreement signed with the Asian and Aerospace
Technology and Equipment Exhibition held in Zhuhai, south China in
late 1998, CGWIC will use the LM 3 carrier rocket to launch the
AsiaSat3 at Xichang Satellite Launching Center.
</P>
<P>
Also under a long-term contract signed with Hughs, China will
launch 10 more satellites for the U.S. corporation before the end
of 2006, five of them being confirmed and the other half
alternative.
</P>
<P>
China has also joined several Asian nations in developing a
satellite system to provide mobile telecom services for as many as
1.3 billion people. Total investment in the Asian-Pacific Mobile
Telecommunications Satellite System is expected to be 650 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's space industry now takes eight or nine percent of the
world's commercial satellite launching market, while facing even
fiercer competition from its international counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiyuan, president of China Aerospace Corporation (CAC),
said, "we'll keep on improving the carrying capacity and
reliability of the Long March series rocket, focusing on the
development of communication satellites, meteorological satellites
and execute our manned space program."
</P>
<P>
Researchers are working hard to develop new types of fuels for
greater power motors and upgrade the LM 3B carrier rocket to
increase its load-bearing capacity, according to Zhang Xinxia,
president of CGWIC.

<HEADLINE> Reduced Yields Facing Zimbabwean Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean indigenous
commercial farmers have been adversely affected by the non-stop
rains that have been pounding most parts of the country, to an
extent that most farmers are now expecting drastically reduced
yields.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Indigenous Commercial Farmers' Union Nokwazi
Moyo Saturday said reports from their members indicate that most
of the farmers were now expecting less than 30 percent of their
projected yields from the current season.
</P>
<P>
"The rains have affected most of our members. Most of the
farmers now expect to produce not more than a third of their
1998/99 crop yield projections," the Sunday Mail quoted Moyo as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said most farmers were experiencing a difficult season
due to the high input costs and the rising interest rates which
were being compounded by the incessant rains that have been
falling in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the rains had also negatively affected the farmers'
livestock production programs. The readiness of the livestock to
marketing has been delayed because the nutritive value of grazing
has been lowered by the excessive rains, he added.

<HEADLINE> Osama May Have Fled to Iran for Iraq: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The billionaire Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden has left Afghanistan for neighboring
Iran, said a report here Sunday, citing anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Osama had crossed the Afghan-Iran border
at Torghundi in Herat province of Afghanistan previous Friday
morning, reported the Pakistani newspaper The Nation.
</P>
<P>
Neither Taliban nor the Iranian government, however, has
confirmed such reports.
</P>
<P>
From Iran, Osama was most likely to settle down in Iraq which
had offered him a safe heaven against the U.S. pressure, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban militia announced on Saturday that Osama has
disappeared and they have no information as to whether he has left
Afghanistan or not.
</P>
<P>
"Bin Laden is missing. We have not asked him to leave
Afghanistan," said a statement issued from the Taliban's
headquarters in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was read out on phone from Kandahar by
Syed Muhammad Tayyeb, a senior Taliban official, said that "we
have not forced him to leave Afghanistan and if he leaves
Afghanistan, it would be his own decision."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Taliban official sources said Osama had left
Afghanistan but they didn't know where he has gone.
</P>
<P>
Osama, along with other Arab nationals came to Afghanistan in
late 70s to take part in Hehhad (holy fight) against troops of the
former Soviet Union. He left Afghanistan after the withdrawal of
the Soviet forces and returned to that country in May 1996 from
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Osama was accused by the U.S. of masterminding the bombings of
its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7 last year, which
killed more than 200 people including 12 American nations.
</P>
<P>
Osama, however, had rejected Washington's accusations, saying
that he had no links with the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated demands from Washington, the Taliban refused
to hand over Osama after the embassy bombings, demanding proof of
his involvement in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
In their recent meetings with senior Taliban officials, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfirth and British Minister
of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek Fetchett had
renewed their pressure on the Taliban to expel the Saudi
dissident.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban did not expel him. They imposed
restrictions on Osama on Wednesday by withdrawing all
communication facilities from him.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Launches Housing Project for Elderly Distressed People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
launched a project to build houses for the elderly distressed
people in all the six divisions of the country, the Bangladesh
Observer newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by the Directorate of Social Welfare, the project
styled as "Shantinibas" (housing for peace) will cost about 100
million taka (2.1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the project, which has been approved by the Executive
Committee of the National Economic Council and will be implemented
by 2001, the houses will be built in coordination with the
government and the children homes at divisional level.
</P>
<P>
The elderly distressed people who have crossed 60 years will be
rehabilitated in six Shantinibas abodes.
</P>
<P>
One micro bus and a bicycle will be provided to each center and
besides, there will be arrangements for books, newspapers,
magazines, television and radio to ensure entertainment of the
residents.
</P>
<P>
The residents will also be imparted training and necessary
education so that they could become efficient manpower.
</P>
<P>
The Shantinibas housings will be coordinated with the children
homes and children families so that the elderly distressed people
can get rid of their monotonous and isolated lives in old age and
the children can also grow up with love and affection of the
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
At present, the life expectancy at birth is 59.5 in Bangladesh.

WARSAW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Poland, Germany and France have
discussed possible developments in Kosovo and corresponding
reactions they will take, said Polish Defense Minister Janusz
Onyszkiewicz in Poland's southern city of Krakow Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If the Kosovo peace talks being held in the chateau of
Rambouillet outside Paris can progress smoothly and come to a
political compromise, such compromise will be under the monitoring
of NATO, the Polish News Agency quoted Onyszkiewicz as saying.
</P>
<P>
But if the talks break, the next scenario will be to find out
which side should be held responsible for the failure of the talks
and thus pressure will be exerted to bring it back to the
negotiation table, said Onyszkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
Onyszkiewicz made the remarks after talks with German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping and French Defense Minister Alain
Richard.
</P>
<P>
The ministers met in Krakow as part of the so-called Weimar
triangle initiative, under which top officials of the three
countries regularly discuss cooperation and security issues in an
informal atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Weimar was the first German town that hosted a meeting of the
countries' foreign ministers in 1991.

<HEADLINE> IMF Ends Primary Negotiation With Bangladeshi Government on Ground Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has ended its primary negotiation with the Bangladeshi
government on making available the enhanced structural adjustment
fund (ESAF) loan, an English daily newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Article 4 mission of the IMF, which is meant to oversee the
progress of the economy and reforms, left here Thursday after a
series of meetings with the Bangladeshi side, and another mission
will arrive here in next August to finalize the quantum of loan to
be made available for Bangladesh, the Daily Star quoted sources in
the Finance Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the mission asked Bangladesh to expedite
the pace of privatization, called for greater autonomy for the
central bank and asked the government to further liberalize trade,
follow a flexible exchange control mechanism and carry out
required reforms of the public administration.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the mission also reiterated its call upon the
government to avoid any program that would mar the on-going
development activities, they said.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Bangladeshi government expects ESAF loan worth
three to four million dollars to back its week balance of payment
(BOP) situation.
</P>
<P>
The IMF would consider the extent of the pain for Bangladesh in
abiding by the reform agenda and its BOP situation, they added.
</P>
<P>
The government received 345 million U.S. dollar loans from the
IMF in 1992, and the IMF also lent a 138 million dollar emergency
flood aid last year.

Golmard's next two service games. But the Frenchman held off the
threat and broke Moya at the fourth attempt to claim the set.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Rodman Agrees to Sign with Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Rebounding king Dennis
Rodman apparently has found a team ready to tolerate his antics --
the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Rodman reportedly met with Lakers officials Thursday and has
decided to join the team for the veteran's minimum of 1 million
dollars, pro-rated to 600,000 dollars for the shortened season,
the Los Angeles Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The forward also would receive another 3 million dollars from
an endorsement contract with Converse.
</P>
<P>
The report said Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman, has been
negotiating with the Lakers for almost two weeks and that Rodman
has received a personal invitation to join the Lakers from owner
Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
The report made no mention of a time frame for Rodman's signing.
The report also said that Chaseman has discussed possible movie
deals for Rodman with Fox, which holds an option to buy into the
Lakers as a limited partner.
</P>
<P>
Lakers spokeman John Black refused to comment on the report,
but said today that no announcement regarding Rodman is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal said after practice when asked
if he knew what was going on with Rodman. "We mentioned many, many
times that we wanted him. I think it's up to him. The situation is
very close."
</P>
<P>
Rodman didn't attend practice with the Lakers. He turns 38 in
May, has played on five of the last 10 NBA champions, and won the
league's last seven straight rebounding titles with averages
between 14.9 and 18.7 per game.

To his delight Tanino was appointed as Japanese ambassador to
China last year. Walking on the booming and bustling streets of
Beijing today Tanino is no more sized up by curious eyes as in the
past. "The ordinary Chinese have become open-minded towards
foreigners and this make me and my colleagues pretty happy when
shopping and traveling around the country", he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanino expressed his admiration for the historic progress made
by China over the past two decades. He mentioned China's
persevering flood-control effort last year, during which Chinese
leaders were often seen among local farmers and soldiers,
commanding at the front. "The successful flood-control campaign
reflected China's material base and the capability of the Chinese
leaders," Tanino said.

Despite having read many books and watched films about China,
Duarte was still quite shocked when his car entered downtown
Beijing along the spacious and broad airport expressway. "It's far
more modern than I imagined, and yet much more beautiful, orderly
and charming." he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital stimulates the zeal in the South American
diplomat. "It's an ancient city enclosed with modern glamour," he
commented.
</P>
<P>
"The city, where the new and the old meet, is capable of
stirring the imagination of anyone who sees it," Duarte said.
</P>
<P>
Duarte possesses the vigor and vitality usually absent in a 65-
year old. During the two years since he assumed the post, he has
traveled extensively in China, whose hospitable northwestern town
of Kashgar is one of his favorite destinations.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever I go, I see a positive and optimistic mood among
Chinese people," said Duarte who has over 30 years of diplomatic
life. "To my understanding, they have seen the opportunities for a
wealthier and more comfortable life, and understand that means of
improving their lives is in their own hands."

"From being a businessman to an ambassador, I've witnessed the
most exciting 20 years in China's history," Sigg said with pride.
</P>
<P>
In March 1980, Sigg, then about 30, set up Schindler Elevator (
China) Corporation Ltd. on behalf of the Swiss government. Today
Schindler (China) stands out among more than 320,000 foreign-
funded enterprises in China, with its elevators located everywhere
in shopping centers and office buildings. What the company earns a
year today could have founded two companies in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"All my Swiss colleagues admonished me about investing in China,
insisting that I would not earn a penny. They thought that I was
crazy," Sigg recalled. "But today I receive calls from Switzerland
everyday asking for my advice on investing in China."
</P>
<P>
When Sigg first came to the "distant" China in 1978 and sat
down with his Chinese counterparts to negotiate the establishment
of Schindler, he discovered that everyone dressed anonymously in
grey clothes and had absolutely no idea of what an independent
enterprise was, let alone the concept of joint ventures and
shareholding.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, however, as Sigg is about to pick up his
business career again, he describes his potential business
partners in China as much more sophisticated about business,
flexible and fully aware of the world outside China. "But they are
now on average 10 years younger than those I met 20 years ago,
which gives them a definite advantage over me." he added with a
chuckle.

<HEADLINE> Germany Gets Nazi Gold Back Home, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The German federal government
had secretly transported Nazi gold from Turkey back to Germany in
1961, the latest issue of the Der Spiegel weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The gold, including 12 bars and 12,799 coins owned by Nazi
Germany's embassy in Turkey and private belongings of Nazi
diplomats, made their way home on two military airplanes in 1961,
said a report carried by the weekly to be published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The gold, most of which had been originally seized by Nazi
forces in occupied countries during the war, was left in Turkey
when Turkey ceased diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany in 1944,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Der Spiegel said the report was based on files of the
German Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
So far it was only known that the federal government in 1965
assisted the Dresdner Bank, a leading private bank in Germany, in
transporting home Nazi gold kept in the bank's branch in Istanbul,
Turkey.

WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley of the
Houston Rocket will have surgery Sunday to repair torn cartilage
in his left knee and will miss three to four weeks, leaving the
Rockets without their leading score and rebounder.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Barkley underwent a check that revealed a torn
medial meniscus in the joint. At the time, he said he would not
have surgery and rehabilitate the injury through treatment and
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Barkley turns 36 in one week. He had 16 points and 16 rebounds
in Wednesday's 92-82 home win over Sacramento and 15 and 16 in
Thursday's 105-95 win at Dallas.

Barkley, Pippen and Olajuwon all are among the NBA's Greatest
Players and make up one of the best frontcourts in history. The
Rockets have won four in a row since a season-opening loss to the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Still looking for an elusive championship ring, Barkley entered
this season with career averages of 22.5 points and 11.7 rebounds
in 1,011 games. He missed 14 games last season with a variety of

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Crisis May Be Over Soon, UK Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Saturday that
the impasse over the trial of two Libyan suspects in the 1988
airliner bombing over Lockerbie is approaching "end game."
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to let out any sigh of relief until the two
suspects land in the Netherlands. However, I am more encouraged
than before that we could see justice done in a court trial,"
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It has been seven months of hard effort, but at last it looks
as if we could be approaching the end game," Cook added.
</P>
<P>
Cook's statement follows claims by South African and Saudi
mediators, who had been in talks this week with Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi, that they had made a breakthrough over trying the
men accused of bombing the Pan American flight 103.
</P>
<P>
In December of 1988, the Pan AM flight was bombed over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he met the South African and Saudi envoys last Monday
before they left for Tripoli and told them that Britain and the
United States would not compromise on insisting that the suspects
should serve their sentences in a Scottish prison if they were
found guilty.
</P>
<P>
The two envoys reported on Thursday that this could be the
basis of agreement, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The official Libyan news agency carried a statement from Libya'
s Foreign Ministry on Saturday saying a breakthrough in the
diplomatic standoff had been reached.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Foreign Office said on Friday the U.N. could monitor
the treatment of the two Libyan suspects if they were jailed in
Scotland.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Are Sleepy Heads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Women in China sleep an
average of six minutes longer than men according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
The research, conducted by the People's University of China
among approximately 5,000 residents in 40 cities, found that
Chinese female urbanites have an average sleep pattern of eight
hours and 40 minutes every day.
</P>
<P>
"The survey result tallies with most other countries where
women sleep between five to 20 minutes longer than men, except in
a few countries like Japan and the Republic of Korea," said Wang
Qiyan, who was in charge of the study.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang said that Chinese women and men have notable
differences in their sleeping habits. Chinese men like staying up
late, while women prefer to go to bed early and get up early.
</P>
<P>
On work days, Chinese men sleep ten minutes shorter than women,
but during holidays men tend to sleep two minutes longer than
women, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
Biologists say sleep has close connections with people's health
and life span, and people should form good sleeping habits.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau show that
male residents of the city had a life expectancy of 72.65 years in
1992, compared with a female's 76.41 years.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Foreign Trade Faces Challenge in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's foreign trade
is facing a serious challenge this year because of the Brazilian
financial crisis and the deceleration of the world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The country suffered a four-year high of 5.58 billion U.S.
dollars in trade deficit in 1998, as reported by the Ministry of
Economy.
</P>
<P>
Imports totaled 31.43 billion dollars in the year, up 3 percent
against 1997, while exports dipped 2 percent to 25.85 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Argentina maintained a trade surplus of 1.29 billion
dollars with its trade partners in Mercosur, which is the largest
commercial bloc in the region grouping Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay
and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the
real, will cause a flow of Brazilian products to the Argentine
market, exerting great pressure on Argentine trade balance this
year.
</P>
<P>
In consequence, some industrial sectors, such as textile, oil,
agriculture and livestock and car manufacturing, are under the
direct threat of massive influx of Brazilian products.
</P>
<P>
One of them is the motor vehicle sector, whose exports dropped
53 percent last month, compared to the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
First estimations show that Argentine exports to Brazil will
drop this year by 2.5 billion dollars, and the trade surplus that
Argentina has had during many years with Mercosur will be reverted.
</P>
<P>
Argentina had a deficit with the North America Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and with the European Union (EU) last year, and
at the same time it had its first deficit with the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for 1.93 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that taking into account the impacts of the
South East Asian financial crisis and the consequent deceleration
of the economy this year in Asia and in all the world, it is seen
as impossible a big advance in the trade exchanges of Argentina
with NAFTA, the EU and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is an agricultural country, whose agriculture and
livestock products are the pillar of its exports, and although the
structure of its exports have been diversified since the 1980s,
they are still more than 60 percent of the total value of its
exports.
</P>
<P>
The low prices in the international markets this year, the
reduction in grains production and the Brazilian crisis have
already caused a drop in Argentine exports of agricultural
products, according to local media reports. According to
preliminary estimates, the income from the agricultural products
exports will diminish two billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The most outstanding example is wheat, of which the exports
will hardly reach five million dollars this year, which will mean
a decline of 50 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government has taken preventive measures before
the possibility of a five billion dollar trade deficit, such as
reducing the rights to import capital goods, increasing subsidies
to exports to the countries out of Mercosur, with which it expects
to reduce this year's trade deficit.

<P>
-- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said in Beijing yesterday
that the Chinese government welcomes more foreign experts to work
in China to share their advanced science and technology,
management expertise and all outstanding qualities that enhance
the civilization of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
-- The fight against corruption and improving education are
some of the major topics that Chinese non-Communist party leaders
are proposing for government work in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, chairwoman of the Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that the
Communist Party's victory last year was unforgettable, but this
year the country needs a tougher fight against corruption among
officials.
</P>
<P>
-- Ding Shisun, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Democratic League, said that developing non-government backed
education programs should be given a higher position, and the most
important thing is drafting laws and regulations to encourage
private schools.
</P>
<P>
-- Wan Guoquan, the honorary chairman of the China Democratic
National Construction Association's Central Committee, said that
since China is becoming an aging society, the government must pay
attention to senior citizens and give retirement pensions to them
on time.
</P>
<P>
-- Neither the financial crisis in Asia and Brazil nor turmoil
anywhere else in the world has had any effect on the spirit in
which 1.2 billion Chinese are welcoming in the Chinese Lunar New
Year, known here as the Spring Festival. According to ancient
Chinese astrology, February 16 will mark the end of the Year of
the Tiger and usher in the Year of the Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
 "Business Weekly of Chinese Daily"
</P>

<P>
-- China's fledging automotive industry is expected to undergo
massive restructuring to increase its viability in the competitive
auto market of the 21st century.

anticipated rise in demand and help balance the refined oil market.

medium-sized enterprises to conduct foreign trade and economic co-
operation, a senior trade official said.

<HEADLINE> Most of Thai Disabled Children Fail to Attend Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Most of disabled children in
Thailand still have no change of access to education, according to
the Office of the National Primary Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Kasama Worawan na Ayutthaya, secretary-general of the office,
was quoted Sunday by the Bangkok Post as saying that her office
had recently surveyed the number of disabled children nationwide
and recorded 678,103 children.
</P>
<P>
Most of the children have no change of access to education as
state-run primary schools can enroll only 18,517 disabled children
for the time being, she said.
</P>
<P>
To expand educational chances for disabled children, the
primary education office plans to open more schools, train more
teachers and procure more special teaching instruments for them,
Kasama said.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, all 38 state-run primary schools in Bangkok will
accept disabled pupils to the same classes of ordinary children
for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Education Ministry plans to seek the cabinet's
approval to declare 1999 as the education year for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The declaration would urged agencies concerned to support the
access of the disabled to all levels of education.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snowstorm Leaves 13 Frozen to Death in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A heavy snowstorm has killed
13 people in Hungary by Saturday as it swept most of the country
for the past several days.
</P>
<P>
The snowstorm, which began on February 9, swept nearly the
whole country. The snowfall in the Kisvarad area in Szabolcs-
Szatmar-Bereg Megye county, northeastern Hungary, hit a record
high of 69 centimeters ever reported in this century. The snow
piled up between 30 to 40 centimeters in most of other areas.
</P>
<P>
The snowstorm has cut off communication links to more than 400
villages. The lack of food and medicine is threatening the
villagers, especially patients.
</P>
<P>
Road and rail traffic was also paralyzed in some areas. The
snowdrift in some roads has accumulated up to two to three meters,
leaving many vehicles stranded on road.
</P>
<P>
Some schools have been forced to shut down because of the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has set up an emergency commission to deal with the
blizzards. About 6,000 people, with 1,000 vehicles, have been
mobilized to remove snow from major roads day and night.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian army have also been involved in the move.
Military helicopters were sent to drop food and medicine to
victims stranded in snow-blocked areas.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecast has predicted more snowfalls in the coming
days. The government urges the besieged people to stay home and
wait for rescue.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 civilians were
injured Saturday in a blast in south Kosovo, the media center in
Kosovo's provincial capital of Pristina said.
</P>
<P>
A powerful time bomb went off in downtown Urosevac early
afternoon, damaging over 20 buildings and some vehicles, said the
Serbian-run center.
</P>
<P>
Serbian officials blamed ethnic Albanian separatists for the
blast, which took place when peace talks on Kosovo continued at
Rambouillet, southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The observer mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent an expert team to the site, and
condemned the blast as "terror against civilians and an obstacle
to the peace process."

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges NATO to Admit Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In view of his official visit next week to Hungary and the
Czech Republic, D'Alema told the press that Italy is strongly in
favor of bringing Romania, Slovenia and Bulgaria into NATO.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only a question of making a contribution to security
in the areas under the alliance's southern command," he said, "but
the more ample participation of the area, especially the southeast,
in the Euro-Atlantic family."
</P>
<P>
Since full-fledged NATO enlargement talks began a couple of
years ago, Italy has systematically argued that the alliance's
southeast wing was the one most in need of strengthening by
extending the NATO umbrella to Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
NATO has accepted last year the admission of Hungary, Poland
and the Czech Republic which are former members of hostile Warsaw
Pact countries, and the organization has confirmed that the
ceremony of admission will be held in March in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> China to Stress on Supervision of Trade: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China's trade sector will
shift its focus to the supervision of foreign trade activities and
be less rigorous in approving applications for foreign trade
rights, the "Business Weekly" of China Daily said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongjiu, deputy director of the general office of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), told
the newspaper that the change is intended to support small and
medium-sized enterprises to conduct foreign trade and economic
cooperation, which is faced with an increasingly challenging
situation.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC announced on Friday that five trade companies from
northwest China's Qinghai Province have had their import licenses
revoked because they have defrauded large amounts of foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
The decision is part of the nation's effort to crack down on
fraud in foreign exchange and was intended to punish trade
companies that have made illegal payments in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more qualified companies will be granted with
foreign trade rights in a bid to boost China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
By last week, the Ministry has approved a total of 61 private
firms with the privilege of import and export. China's foreign
trade was monopolized by State trading companies until 1991.
</P>
<P>
The report said that private and other small and medium-sized
enterprises can adopt more flexible trading means and reduce
operational costs, and therefore are more competitive on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Asian financial crisis, China's exports slumped from
a 20.9 percent growth in 1997 to 0.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As the repercussions of the crisis continue this year and the
financial turmoil in Brazil adds new destabilizing elements to the
world economy, China's foreign trade sector is faced with more
severe challenges, the report quotes an expert as saying.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade of Farm Produce Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Both imports and exports of
agricultural products declined in 1998 in China, the "Business
Weekly" reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The value of agricultural products entering and leaving the
country last year totaled 22.2 billion U.S. dollars, down 10.9
percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
While exports decreased 7.3 percent to 13.8 billion U.S.
dollars, imports plunged 16.3 percent to 8.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of agricultural trade in China's overall foreign
trade dropped 0.8 percentage points to stand at 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the decline of imports was mainly the
result of a slide in imports of grains and cotton. The setback in
exports was attributed to the slump in demand from Asian markets
and worldwide declines in prices of agricultural products.

"There is no controversy between Colombia and its neighboring
countries about the militarization of the borders," said Military
Forces Commander General Fernando Tapias, rejecting that his
country is being "isolated."
</P>
<P>
Neighboring countries like Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil and

Tapias explained that the reinforcement is aimed at preventing
those areas from being used by outlawed elements to commit crimes.

<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori announced last week that he
would militarize the 1,626-kilometer long border with Colombia, to
bar the entrance to its territory of Colombian guerrillas and drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian government announced this week to increase the
manpower in its military posts along the 586 kilometers of its

A decision is due in the next few days and caretaker coach

</P>

But the Sunday Telegraph said that O'Neill, the former Northern

Keegan, a popular choice among both fans and the media, has
ruled himself out because of his commitment to Fulham, although
the Sunday Mirror said the club's owner Mohamed Al Fayed had

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (
CCB), one of the country's four state commercial banks, plans to
launch a variety of new banking services this year to cater for
the increasing demand from Chinese customers, according to Sunday'
s China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Xin Shusen, general manager of CCB's retail banking department,
said that the bank is appraising the feasibility of opening basic
(current) accounts for individual clients.
</P>
<P>
"Individual basic accounts are sure to prosper once the use of
pseudonyms is ended in personal bank accounts," she said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, has
decided to bring an end to pseudonym accounts and mandate real
names in applying for personal accounts in an effort to stop the
sheltering of illegally obtained money.
</P>
<P>
The CCB is also considering extending the scope of consumer
credit from automobile and housing loans to cover consumer
durables.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to develop the fund-raising sector into a
financial supermarket, which breaks the traditional boundaries of
collecting savings deposits and granting loans to provide a wide
range of financial services for individuals," said Xin.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also strive to enhance the quality of the
services it offers in addition to creating new types of services,
according to the Xin.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Reports Economic Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan economy
diminished 8.2 percent during the fourth quarter of 1998 from the
same period of 1997, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela (
CBV) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The oil sector, the backbone of the country's economy,
registered an 8.5 percent contraction of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter, while the non-oil sectors
diminished 7.92 percent in total.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices collapse, which forced the country to
reduce its crude output in a failed effort to shore up oil prices,
forced the government to make budget cuts in 1998 that affected
the overall operation of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan economy had grown 1.7 percent during the second
quarter of 1998, which meant a deceleration with respect to the
robust growth of 9.7 percent registered in the first three months
of the year, according to revised CBV figures.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan economy diminished an average of 0.7 percent in
1998, with the oil sector dropping one point and the non-oil
sectors 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new government foresees for 1999 an scenario of economic
slump as the adverse oil scenario continues.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there will be 1.2 billion dollars less in
the oil income, after the revision of the price, which will
generate a recession, but the private economy will grow, according
to the CBV.

LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Double champions Arsenal, which
defeated first division Sheffield United on Saturday, will replay
their FA Cup fifth round tie with the rivals.
</P>
<P>
Manager Arsene Wenger had offered to replay the game after a 76
th minute highly controversial winner from Marc Overmars. The
offer was accepted by United and agreed to by the English Football
Association (F.A.) within an hour of the tie ending.
</P>
<P>
F.A. spokesman Steve Double said: "Within minutes of Arsene
Wenger making his offer known, (acting chief executive) David
Davies and (chairman of Challenge Cup committee) Terry Annable
discussed it and agreed to Wenger's request.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously an unprecedented situation but one we could
not ignore. Everybody in football will welcome Wenger's sporting
gesture and he should be congratulated for it."
</P>
<P>
The winner by Overmars came as Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu had failed
to return the ball to United after they had kicked it out of play
so an injured player could receive attention.
</P>
<P>
Conventionally, teams throw the ball back to the side who
kicked it out, but Arsenal kept it and, with United taken by
surprise, Overmars scored, prompting furious protests.

LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The reconstruction of Wembley
Stadium would not be finished in time to host the 2003 World
Athletics Championships, according to local reports on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Britain is bidding for the championships and the 2006 World Cup
soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Wembley, the north London ground built in the 1920s, is to be
sold by Wembley Plc to a consortium that includes England's
Football Association and Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
Bob Stubbs, chief executive of the English National Stadium
Trust, told the Sunday Times that demolition of the stadium might
not start until April 2000.
</P>
<P>
"That leads you to believe that the new stadium won't be ready
until the very end of 2002. Already, that means that staging any
rehearsal events ahead of a 2003 (championships) is unlikely," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"And if we get any slippage in the process there will very soon
come a point when you have to start to reconsider whether we will
be able to stage a major event in 2003 at all."
</P>
<P>
The search for planning permission for the stadium has not yet
begun and Wembley sources said demolition might not actually begin
until after the F.A. Cup final in May 2000.

former Soviet Union. He left Afghanistan after the withdrawal of
the Soviet forces and returned to that country in May 1996 from
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Osama was accused by the U.S. of masterminding the bombings of
its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7 last year, which
killed more than 200 people including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
Osama, however, had rejected Washington's accusations, saying
that he had no links with the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated demands from Washington, the Taliban refused
to hand over Osama after the embassy bombings, demanding proof of
his involvement in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
In their recent meetings with senior Taliban officials, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfirth and British Minister
of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek Fetchett had
renewed their pressure on the Taliban to expel the Saudi
dissident.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban did not expel him. They imposed
restrictions on Osama on Wednesday by withdrawing all
communication facilities from him.
</P>
<P>
Saeed ur Rehman, chief Taliban representative based in
Islamabad, told Xinhua Saturday evening that "he (Osama) might
have left Afghanistan due to the restrictions imposed on him by
the Taliban."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Judge Holds Pilots Union in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal District Judge
Joe Kendall held a pilots union and two of its board members in
contempt Saturday for defying his court order.
</P>
<P>
Kendall said that they did not do enough to encourage
disgruntled American Airlines pilots to return to work and end
flight cancellations that have snarled travel plans for more than
a half-million people.
</P>
<P>
About one in four American pilots called in sick Friday at the
nation's second-largest airline, which in turn canceled several
hundred more flights planned for the long Presidents Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
Kendall said he would decide on February 17 how much to fine
the Allied Pilots Association, union President Rich LaVoy and
union Vice President Brian Mayhew.
</P>
<P>
The judge indicated the fine would be in the "eight figures"
and ordered that the union set aside 10 million U.S. dollars in a
bond to pay it. He ordered LaVoy to set aside 10,000 dollars and
Mayhew 5,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Union members have been calling in sick and refusing to accept
overtime since February 6 in a dispute concerning how quickly
American should integrate the pilots from recently purchased Reno
Air into its own roster.
</P>
<P>
American officials said Saturday that 5,600 flights have been
canceled since the work action began, affecting more than a
half-million travelers. The cancellations have cost American
between 67 million dollars and 90 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
American canceled 1,102 flights Friday -- nearly half of its
daily total -- a day after it canceled 1,170. The carrier also
scrapped 845 flights for Saturday and 209 for Sunday, with
additional cancellations possible.
</P>
<P>
American pilots and those formerly with Reno Air stand to make
more money once they all fall under American's existing contract.
Many American pilots would advance up the seniority chart, while
Reno pilots would get pay raises compared to their old carrier.
</P>
<P>
AMR Corporation, the airline's parent company, said the process
of integrating the companies and pilots will take a year to 18
months. That, according to the pilots, is too long.
</P>
<P>
No negotiations were scheduled for Saturday between the union
and the airline.
