<P>
   ROMEO, Mich. _ Declaring ``it's time to elect people who say
what they mean,'' Gov. George W. Bush swept through two hotly
contested states Monday and derided Vice President Al Gore for
rejecting his proposal for three handpicked debates.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential campaign entered the critical period that
begins on Labor Day, Bush hammered at Gore's honesty and
credibility, tying him to some of the evasions of the Clinton
years. Before a pompom and placard waving crowd in the Chicago
suburbs, Bush reminded enthusiastic throngs of Gore's defense for
making fund-raising calls from his White House office in 1996: that
``no controlling legal authority'' barred such activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get rid of all those words like `no controlling
legal authority,''' Bush said, campaigning in shirt sleeves with
his running mate, Dick Cheney, at his side. ``We need plain-spoken
Americans in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after Bush rebuffed a schedule set up by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has sponsored debates
since 1988, and put forth a plan of his own, he recounted how Gore
had once said he would debate ``anytime, anywhere,'' and then
rejected Bush's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, the words about anytime, anywhere don't mean
anything,'' Bush said, calling Gore's rejection of his debate
proposal ``an interesting example of kind of the Washington
doublespeak.'' Bush repeated like a mantra, ``It's time to get some
plain-spoken folks in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The throngs gathered in a schoolyard in Naperville, Ill., began
chanting, ``No more Gore. No more Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``When we tell you something, we mean it. When we say
we're going to do something, we're going to do what we say. That's
what America hungers for. America wants leadership that lifts its
spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his aides flatly rejected Bush's proposal on Sunday,
saying the Republican nominee was trying to limit viewers, instead
of accepting the three 90-minute debates proposed by the
commission, which would be broadcast by all three major television
networks. Two of Bush's suggested hourlong appearances would be on
talk shows that rival networks have said they would not broadcast.
Bush did agree to one presidential debate sponsored by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's camp, of course, has a different view of the debate
issue. Gore has frequently said he would debate anytime, anywhere,
and his campaign has boasted that he has accepted more than 40
debate offers, without qualification.
</P>
<P>
   But on Air Force Two early Monday, Gore said he had accepted the
debates only on the condition that Bush accept the three debates
sponsored by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said some time ago, the condition is we have to have the
commission debates,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday morning on NBC's ``Today'' show,'' Matt Lauer, the
co-host, said to Gore that he had not set such a condition in July
when he accepted a debate offer from Tim Russert of ``Meet the
Press,'' a program that Bush has also agreed to debate on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Gore replied, ``back in March I suggested we debate
twice a week and get rid of all the TV commercials, but he's turned
all that down. But here's the point, Matt. This is not about what
is best for George W. Bush or what is best for Al Gore. It's about
what's best for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush started off the day with the rally at Naperville North High
School. While waiting to speak, he leaned over to his running mate,
Dick Cheney, and used an obscenity to describe a New York Times
correspondent, Adam Clymer, who was in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, his aides said, thought he was speaking privately. But his
words were picked up by a television microphone, though they were
barely audible to the crowd. Asked later about the comment, Bush
said, ``Well, I regret that a private comment I made to the
vice-presidential candidate made it to the public airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he wanted to apologize, Bush repeated that he was
sorry the comment had been heard. Bush's director of
communications, Karen P. Hughes, said of Clymer, ``There's been a
series of articles that the governor has felt have been very
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the paper's executive editor, said: ``This is
at least Adam's eighth campaign. He knows what he is doing. His
work is both fair and accurate. The Times has never heard from the
Bush campaign about Adam. If they have a complaint, they should
convey it to us and we will review it as we do all serious
complaints about our coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign pounced on the incident to portray Bush as
mean-spirited. A spokesman for Gore, Mark Fabiani, said that Bush
had ``portrayed himself as a person who wants to change the tone
and has broken his promise twice, with negative ads and by using an
expletive in referring to a New York Times reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rally on the grounds of the Naperville North High School
began a Labor Day swing that carried him through Illinois, Michigan
and Pennsylvania, all states that President Clinton carried four
years ago. Recent polls have shown Gore pulling ahead in all three.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush's rally, a spirited crowd hoisted placards like
``Hunters for Bush'' or ``Gore in Hand is Worth Half of a Bush.''
Bush then marched in a Labor Day parade that was led by fire trucks
and emergency vehicles with sirens wailing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he spoke at the peach festival here in Romeo, once again
needling Gore for refusing to debate ``anytime, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, that must depend on what the definition of `anytime'
is,'' Bush said, in an allusion to Clinton's evasive use of the
word ``is'' when questioned about his affair with a White House
intern. ``Or maybe that depends on what the definition of
`anywhere' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush was off to Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday he plans to give out more details of a prescription
drug plan while barnstorming across Pennsylvania. Karen Hughes,
Bush's communications director, said he was focusing on swing
voters and noted that Romeo was in Macomb County, the original home
of the so-called Reagan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again Monday, Bush tied his Democratic rival to
Washington and to big government. ``My opponent and the folks up in
Washington want to empower bureaucrats and make the health
decisions for America,'' he said. ``They want more power in
Washington. They want the planners and deciders, the folks that are
telling you how to think, in power.''
</P>
<P>
   He also contrasted the two men's approaches to tax cutting and
the federal surplus. ``We understand the surplus is not the
government's money,'' he said. ``The surplus is the people's
money.'' Bush has proposed a sweeping tax cut of $1.3 trillion
across 10 years while Gore has called for tax cuts of less than
half that and more spending on social programs like college
education and home health care.
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize his points, Bush held up four dollar bills as he
spoke, and ticked off how he would use a projected federal surplus
of about $4 trillion over a decade. Just two weeks ago, Bush
stumbled over his explanation as he made similar remarks. Monday,
too, he initially seemed uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would devote $2 trillion to Social Security and he
took away two dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Next he said that he would allot $1 trillion to ``making sure
that our defense is strong,'' even though he has called in the past
for roughly $45 billion of the surplus to go to the military over a
decade. But then after talking about defense for a few more
sentences he caught himself and said that the $1 trillion covered
both military and domestic priorities like education and a Medicare
prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bush got to his tax cut, he handed one of the dollars
to a man in the crowd. ``I want 1 trillion, roughly a quarter of
the surplus, to go back to the people that pay the bill,'' Bush
said. ``I want the working families to put their money in their
pockets.''

DODGERS' STARTERS GOOD, FOR THE MOST PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Steve Dilbeck  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anyway, the Dodgers really had been getting
outstanding starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Until Darren Dreifort ran into quick trouble Monday, the
Dodgers' recent surge easily could have been traced to an old team
stable _ strong starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   If you toss out the fifth spot in the rotation _ Carlos Perez,
are you listening? _ the Dodgers had been receiving consistently
impressive outings.
</P>
<P>
   Perez aside, in their last seven starts entering Monday, the
rotation's ERA was a combined 1.40.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the fifth spot (including Matt Herges' last start),
over their last 13 games, the team starting pitchers' ERA was 1.98,
which includes an Ismael Valdes start in which he gave up five runs
in four innings. Yet, they won that game, and 10 of the 13.
</P>
<P>
   In the three games they just completed against the Phillies, the
rotation did not allow an earned run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phillies offense has been sputtering, but we did pitch
good,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall staff ERA is 4.23, which, although disappointing by
Dodgers' traditional standards, is still third in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   GET READY FOR SOME OFFENSE: Perez is scheduled to make his third
start since going back into the rotation tonight.
</P>
<P>
   He has been hanging on all season, but the Dodgers have been
unable to find a decent replacement. In his last start, Perez (5-7,
5.39 ERA) gave up five runs in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez can find encouragement tonight from an opponent whose
struggles have been even more severe.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates right-hander Jose Silva (8-9, 5.58) has lost five of his
past six decisions and failed to last at least six innings in any
of them. He gave up eight runs in 3 innings in his last start
against the Giants. In five career appearances against the Dodgers,
Silva is 0-3 with an 11.37 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   OUTFIELD STILL THIN: With outfielders Devon White (strained left
quad) and Bruce Aven (strained left oblique) both still a week away
from returning, Johnson has no true reserve outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing he has is backup catcher Paul Loduca.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good athlete, but he's not really someone to send out
as a defensive replacement,'' Johnson said. ``I like to rest Sheff
(Gary Sheffield), give him a blow at the end. He's not 100 percent
(from the flu).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we got talking the other day about (Loduca
playing) second base, third base, left field. He's a good athlete
and can get by, but I mean, that ain't my idea of a comfort zone,
having him at second base turning two with the game on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: For those who have flashed on the unthinkable, if
inevitable, veteran broadcaster Vin Scully's current contract with
the Dodgers has another season left to run. The Dodgers, however,
still expect to sign the 72-year-old icon to another contract. ...
Shortstop Kevin Elster, on the disabled list since Aug. 23 with a
strained left hamstring, will be activated today. ... Johnson said
relievers Mike Fetters (sore back) and Terry Adams (stiff shoulder)
were both available. ... Sheffield's pursuit of Duke Snider's team
home-run record of 43 has been stalled. Including the 11 games he
missed with the flu, the slugger has gone a season-high 17 games
since hitting home run No.40. His previous high was 11 games,
although he played in each.

   Dick Cheney danced the polka with a Polish beauty queen, spoke a
little Polish and dished out a few plates of kielbasa and stuffed
cabbage in Chicago Monday. Cheney, whose campaign style has
sometimes been described as aloof in recent weeks, shed his
motorcade and rode the El to the Taste of Polonia festival. At the
festival, he greeted the crowd in Polish. ``Sto lat,'' Cheney said,
or ``May you live 100 years.'' Then he spoke about his role as the
secretary of defense under President Bush. ``We were proud to work
with all of you to help bring down the wall and free the peoples of
Eastern Europe,'' he said, to applause.

PEYTON'S PLACE IS WITH ALL-TIME GREATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ How good is Peyton Manning?
</P>
<P>
   This is a rhetorical question.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is as good as there is in the NFL these days. He is the
best third-year quarterback ever.
</P>
<P>
   Manning has become so Montana-esque good that his performances
sometimes are under appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sunday in Kansas City. Manning completed 22 of 32 passes
for 273 yards with one touchdown and one interception against the
Chiefs. He handled the heat, the pressure and the noise to win his
first start at Arrowhead Stadium, 27-14.
</P>
<P>
   So what, you say, it was only the Chiefs?
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Troy Aikman, Dan Marino, John Elway, Drew Bledsoe,
Brett Favre and Steve Young are among the quarterbacks who lost
their first trip to Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It is the loudest stadium in the NFL. The Chiefs have led the
NFL in attendance for six consecutive seasons, including 1999 when
they averaged 78,693. Kansas City's 12th man makes it hard on
opponents, who lost 78.8 percent of the time at Arrowhead Stadium
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs had 78,357 crazies on their side Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With Arrowhead Stadium in mind, the Colts practiced using a
silent snap count during their exhibition game against the
Pittsburgh Steelers in Mexico City. Against the Chiefs, it was as
easy as 1-2-3 as Indianapolis had only two false-start penalties
and no delay of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That takes a lot of poise and composure and execution by the
offense, and you know, Peyton running the show there makes a big
difference,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   Manning comes as close as any quarterback in the league to
calling his own plays. He calls a play in the huddle, but he then
has two additional options after he gets to the line of scrimmage
and assesses the defense. He can check off to a running play or to
a passing play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handles that extremely well,'' Mora said. ``He's unique. We
can do those kind of things with Peyton Manning. He can go in there
and recognize the best play to call and call it at the line of
scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning burned up the 45-second clock Sunday, walking up and
down the line yelling out the play to the other 10 players. On a
second-and-7 from the Kansas City 27 in the third quarter, Manning
switched to a screen pass after reading the linebacker blitz, and
Edgerrin James scored to give the Colts a 14-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Offensive coordinator) Tom (Moore) gives me some freedom, but
everything is kind of what we worked on during practice,'' Manning,
24, said. ``In other words, I'm not going to call a play at the
line that the offensive line is going to be surprised by. That's
kind of what Tom says, `Don't surprise me. Go with what the game
plan is.' ... For the most part, I thought we handled the crowd
noise and executed on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   There were those who thought Ryan Leaf was the better
quarterback in the 1998 draft when the Colts took Manning with the
No. 1 choice and the San Diego Chargers traded five players,
counting three draft picks, to move up to take Leaf second overall.
That comparison is laughable now.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf is 3-7 in his 10 starts, having completed 128 of 284 passes
for 1,469 yards with two touchdowns and 18 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is 17-16, having gone 679-for-1,140 for 8,147 yards with
53 touchdowns and 44 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Leaf didn't do in his first two seasons was ruin
his career. The only thing Manning didn't do in his first two
seasons was win the Super Bowl, and the Colts might take care of
that this season.
</P>
<P>
   So just how good can Peyton Manning be?
</P>
<P>
   He looks like a pimply faced teen-ager. He plays like a future
Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   He has intelligence, size, arm strength and a quick release.
Now, he has experience to go with playmakers James and Marvin
Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   We just might be watching the greatest ever.
GRADING THE NFL Duce Staley: A Staley had only one carry _ for 60
yards _ in the fourth quarter against the Cowboys. He finished with
201 rushing yards, which was four yards short of Steve Van Buren's
team record and 74 behind Walter Payton's NFL record. If Buddy Ryan
still was the Eagles coach, Staley would have run straight into the
record books. Buffalo Bills: A Revenge never tasted so sweet.
Stephen Davis: C Is he the best running back in the NFL? No, but
he's now the highest paid. The $90 Million Man better have a
record-setting season for the Redskins. Fred Beasley: F They might
want to test the water in San Francisco. After rushing for 10 yards
on five carries in the 49ers' 36-28 loss to Atlanta, Beasley said
San Francisco was capable of reeling off 13 or 14 victories in a
row on its way to the Super Bowl.

DON'T JINX DAVIS, OR WINNING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
CHICAGO _ Don't change the underwear. Don't wash the
champagne-soaked socks. Have the same thing for breakfast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any deviation from normal routine would only blow it for
everybody. The Rangers are on a roll, and this is no time to jinx
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Getting another encouraging performance from one of their young
starters, the Rangers beat the Chicago White Sox, 5-4, Monday at
Comiskey Park, giving them an actual two-game winning streak for
the first time in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit different now,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``Unfortunately for us, this is just another game in early
September watching young kids perform and do well. If there was one
game to go and needed a win to clinch, then you'd have to check
more than my underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates will have to settle for continued progress from two young
pitchers. Doug Davis followed Ryan Glynn's performance in Detroit
on Sunday by holding the American League's highest-scoring offense
to two runs on eight hits through six innings. He is 2-1 with a
1.52 earned-run average in his past four starts and is showing
Oates he belongs in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Oates was wondering before Davis got on this roll. Put Davis
together with Glynn, and the Rangers might salvage something out of
this wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is hard to find, and to have a left-hander (Davis)
and a right-hander (Glynn) to come around at the same time with
their future ahead of them, that's exciting,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   If Glynn and Davis continue to pitch well, the Rangers could
have be set with their rotation for next season. They could go into
spring training with Rick Helling and Kenny Rogers back at the top,
Glynn and Davis right behind and Justin Thompson and Darren Oliver
battling for the final spot. That would allow the Rangers to devote
more resources _ through trade or free agency _ to their many other
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' previous three starts were against some pretty good
competition: Boston, New York and Toronto. But the White Sox lead
the majors with 845 runs scored, including 35 in their three
previous games.
</P>
<P>
   They also threw an all right-handed lineup against Davis, but he
foiled that strategy with his newly revived cut fastball. When
thrown by a left-hander, the cut fastball moves in hard on
right-handed hitters. Andy Pettitte of the New York Yankees uses it
effectively and so did Davis on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jammed a lot of us, and we're not used to that,'' White Sox
center fielder Jeff Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I broke about four or five bats,'' Davis said. ``I was
able to establish inside, and that opened the outer half of the
plate. I definitely need to keep that pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got a couple runs off him early. Ray Durham
doubled and Frank Thomas singled for one run in the first, and the
White Sox opened the second with singles from Carlos Lee, Herbert
Perry and Paul Konerko to take a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis got out of the jam by getting Abbott to ground out,
striking out Charles Johnson and getting Durham on a grounder.
Starting with those three hitters, the White Sox were hitless in
their last eight at-bats against Davis with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got starter stuff,'' Oates said. ``I'd much rather have
him start than pitch in relief. He's more valuable there. I'm glad
to see these last four starts. I wasn't sure what I was seeing
before.'' nn

everybody. The Rangers are on a roll, and this is no time to jinx
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Getting another encouraging performance from one of their young
starters, the Rangers beat the Chicago White Sox, 5-4, Monday at
Comiskey Park, giving them an actual two-game winning streak for
the first time in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit different now,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``Unfortunately for us, this is just another game in early
September watching young kids perform and do well. If there was one
game to go and needed a win to clinch, then you'd have to check
more than my underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates will have to settle for continued progress from two young
pitchers. Doug Davis followed Ryan Glynn's performance in Detroit
on Sunday by holding the American League's highest-scoring offense
to two runs on eight hits through six innings. He is 2-1 with a
1.52 earned-run average in his past four starts and is showing
Oates he belongs in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Oates was wondering before Davis got on this roll. Put Davis
together with Glynn, and the Rangers might salvage something out of
this wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is hard to find, and to have a left-hander (Davis)
and a right-hander (Glynn) to come around at the same time with
their future ahead of them, that's exciting,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   If Glynn and Davis continue to pitch well, the Rangers could
have be set with their rotation for next season. They could go into
spring training with Rick Helling and Kenny Rogers back at the top,
Glynn and Davis right behind and Justin Thompson and Darren Oliver
battling for the final spot. That would allow the Rangers to devote
more resources _ through trade or free agency _ to their many other
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' previous three starts were against some pretty good
competition: Boston, New York and Toronto. But the White Sox lead
the majors with 845 runs scored, including 35 in their three
previous games.
</P>
<P>
   They also threw an all right-handed lineup against Davis, but he
foiled that strategy with his newly revived cut fastball. When
thrown by a left-hander, the cut fastball moves in hard on
right-handed hitters. Andy Pettitte of the New York Yankees uses it
effectively and so did Davis on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jammed a lot of us, and we're not used to that,'' White Sox
center fielder Jeff Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I broke about four or five bats,'' Davis said. ``I was
able to establish inside, and that opened the outer half of the
plate. I definitely need to keep that pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got a couple runs off him early. Ray Durham
doubled and Frank Thomas singled for one run in the first, and the
White Sox opened the second with singles from Carlos Lee, Herbert
Perry and Paul Konerko to take a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis got out of the jam by getting Abbott to ground out,
striking out Charles Johnson and getting Durham on a grounder.
Starting with those three hitters, the White Sox were hitless in
their last eight at-bats against Davis with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got starter stuff,'' Oates said. ``I'd much rather have
him start than pitch in relief. He's more valuable there. I'm glad
to see these last four starts. I wasn't sure what I was seeing
before.'' nn

BRITISH POWER COMPANY IS SAID TO ACQUIRE NIAGRA MOHAWK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to make adjustments in figures and company names in 1st, 5th,
6th and 7th grafs.)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ National Grid Group, a British energy company, is
expected to announce on Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire
Niagara Mohawk Holdings, an upstate New York power company, for
about $3 billion in cash and stock, according to executives close
to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The move would catapult National Grid into the role of a major
player in the energy market in the United States, where it has
steadily been building a beachhead in the Northeast by making
acquisitions. The deal will allow National Grid to leverage Niagara
Mohawk's business with its other units _ New England Electric
Systems and Eastern Utilities Association _ creating one of the
largest power companies in the region, and the ninth largest power
company in the country. Niagara Mohawk has 1.6 million electric
customers and serves 540,000 gas customers. It also is a major
employer in upstate New York, employing more than 7,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction comes amid rampant consolidation in the energy
sector, sparked by deregulation of the industry. In early August,
the FLP Group merged with the Entergy Corp., to become the largest
electricity company in the country, serving 6.3 million customers.
That deal was followed by FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU Inc. for
$4.5 billion, just two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   At $3 billion, National Grid is paying about a 25 percent
premium for Niagara Mohawk, which has a market capitalization of
$2.4 billion. National Grid will also be assuming about $5 billion
in debt, according to the executives. National Grid will make
two-thirds of its payment in stock and the rest in cash, the
executives added.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk has become an attractive takeover target because
of its underperforming stock price, which has remained stagnant in
the last 12 months, hovering around $14 a share, despite a 23
percent rise in Standard &AMP; Poor's electricity index. Shares of
Niagara Mohawk closed up 7.6 percent to $13.88 on Friday, but still
remain off their 12-month high of $16.19. U.S. markets were closed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In London, shares of National Grid fell 2.8 percent Monday to
557 pence, or $8.13, in London after The Wall Street Journal Europe
reported that the two companies were in talks. Both companies
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk has been pushing to increase its share price
through a massive restructuring program that included the sale of
its hydroelectric and coal-fired power station last year for $860
million as well as a separate sale of its gas-fired plant in Albany
to PSEG Power for $47.5 million. The company also announced a deal
in June 1999 to sell its nuclear plants to AmerGen Energy, a joint
venture of Pesco Energy and British Energy, for about $135 million.
</P>
<P>
   For National Grid, the acquisition marks a major milestone in
its effort to gain a meaningful foothold in the United States,
bringing its U.S. earnings even with earnings generated in Britain.
The company has long sought to increase it presence in the United
States, especially since margins in the energy business in Britain
have recently been squeezed. National Grid had considered acquiring
GPU, executives close to National Grid said, though FirstEnergy
sealed its deal first.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executives, Niagara Mohawk will retain its
headquarters in Syracuse, N.Y., and keep its name. No major layoffs
are expected, the executives said, though National Grid expects to
achieve savings through natural attrition, a practice it employed
successfully when it acquired New England Electric Systems and
Eastern Utilities Association. The companies plan to create a joint
committee to shepherd the integration of the two concerns.

McCANN LOOKS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS OPPORTUNITY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Billy Witz  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first full day of the Ryan McCann era began
appropriately enough. He drove from his West L.A. apartment complex
Sunday to his parents' home in Westlake Village and, after watching
the afternoon NFL games, headed down the street for the 5 o'clock
Mass at St. Jude's Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needed time to reflect and say a few hosannas it was
McCann.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, McCann went from baseball-cap-wearing,
clipboard-toting cheerleader to the man who will hold UCLA's future
_ as well as his own _ in his hands when he lines up as starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He held onto both quite nicely Saturday, taking over when Cory
Paus was sidelined with a separated right (throwing) shoulder and
leading the Bruins to a stunning 35-24 upset of then-No.3-ranked
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Paus expected to miss the next three games, McCann
will have the opportunity to do what he couldn't do at the end of
last season or in fall camp: win the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason Paus beat out McCann last month _ he threw
more accurately, made fewer mistakes and had better command of the
offense. But if the Bruins beat Fresno State, No.3 Michigan and
Oregon with McCann at the helm, even UCLA coach Bob Toledo conceded
it would be hard to take the sophomore from Agoura Hills High out
of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do everything I can to help the team win,'' McCann
said. ``Whatever they ask of me I'm going to do. I'm going to do my
best. I'm going to try to keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cory's going to be like a bad cold he's always going to come
back. He'll be there, so I've got to stay on top of my game. ...
Coach Toledo told me I had to be patient and be ready for your
opportunity when it comes. When it did happen, he told me, `Here's
your chance. You wanted an opportunity, here it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is here, McCann plans to go at it with the same
determination he's shown since he came to UCLA. He began last
season as the Bruins No.4 quarterback but ended up starting against
USC when Drew Bennett was moved to receiver, Paus was injured and
he beat out Scott McEwan.
</P>
<P>
   After Toledo cut short this year's competition two days earlier
than he planned because Paus was clearly ahead, McCann lived up to
his vow to continue working. He is the last person off the practice
field virtually every day, working an extra 15 to 20 minutes with
freshman receiver Tab Perry. He was out there again after practice
ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the majority of the reps in practice this week will
help, but what will help McCann the most, he says, is the game
experience.
</P>
<P>
   He's taken significant snaps in just three games, but they were
all big ones. He relieved the injured Paus and led UCLA to an
overtime win over Washington and threw three interceptions in a
loss to USC last season. Against Alabama, he overcame a critical
mistake _ a 91-yard interception return for a go-ahead touchdown by
Reggie Myles _ by responding with the game-winning score, a 46-yard
touchdown pass, the first of his career, to Freddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt mentally prepared, but I didn't know how physically
prepared I'd be,'' McCann said of the Alabama game. ``You actually
have to do it, you have to play. That's the thing I need the most
to mature as a QB is the experience, the playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo made it clear that while he's handing McCann the keys to
the car, McCann needs to do a better job driving it. McCann's
numbers against Alabama looked solid (14 of 24 for 187 yards with
one TD and one interception), but he took some unnecessary sacks
and didn't throw the long ball accurately. In fact, he was lucky
not to have two more balls picked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan needs to continue to improve,'' Toledo said. ``He needs
to work on some accuracy. He needs to complete some balls that are
there, and he needs to pull the trigger. He has a tendency to get
sacked sometimes when guys are open because he wants them more
open. They're not always going to be that open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a couple of mistakes operating the offense. He still
has to learn some things, but we'll continue to coach him hard.
He's a very coachable kid. He needs to continue to improve. It's
going to be on-the-job training. He does have an awful lot of
potential and athletic ability. Sometimes he looks like a Heisman
trophy candidate and other times he struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann downplayed his situation Monday, saying he didn't want to
overemphasize the importance of each play and each game. However,
he does remember that Cade McNown became the starting quarterback
midway through his freshman season and never returned to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a big window for him,'' said receiver Jon
Dubravac, McCann's roommate since they were freshmen. ``It comes up
in my conversations with him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible way to get the job, but you're not going to
complain. If (Brian) Poli(-Dixon) got hurt, it would be terrible
but I'd have to show I can fill his shoes. It's a huge door that's
opened for Ryan and he realizes it. It's a second chance for him to
do something for himself and shine.''

PAUS TO MISS NEXT THREE GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Billy Witz  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cory Paus, his right arm in a sling, stood on the
sidelines in shorts, a T-shirt and a baseball cap and watched
practice Monday. The quarterback felt just as he did when he
separated his throwing shoulder on the first play Saturday against
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a pansy,'' Paus said. ``It looks like I'm
fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus is expected to miss the next three games for UCLA with what
doctors determined was a 1- to second-degree shoulder separation.
It is the fourth time in 12 games at UCLA that he has been knocked
from the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Paus suffered bruised ribs, a separated left shoulder and a
broken collarbone last season. Then, on the first play of this
season, Alabama defensive end Jarret Johnson blew into the
backfield and hit Paus from behind. Johnson drove Paus into the
turf after he released the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another test for me,'' Paus said. ``I'll have to work
extra hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus is in an uncomfortable position: He wants the Bruins to do
well, although he is well aware that success under Ryan McCann
could cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I want the team to be undefeated,'' Paus said.
``The rest is up to the coaches. I don't have any control over
that. I can't lose any confidence in myself. I just have to keep
doing what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo had plenty of empathy for Paus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel for him,'' the coach said. ``He got hurt (last
season), worked so hard and it happens again. He's got to be
asking, `Why me?' I keep stroking him and tell him it's going to
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   LATE HIT: Toledo filed a complaint with Verle Sorgen, the
Pac-10's coordinator of football officials, over Johnson's hit. He
claimed it should have been called a late hit with a penalty
assessed.
</P>
<P>
   POLLING DATA: UCLA was ranked 16th by the writers and 17th by
the coaches, but in both polls the Bruins were behind Alabama
something that miffed Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   However, one voter tickled Toledo: Jake Curtis of the San
Francisco Chronicle, who voted the Bruins No. 1. It was the only
such vote among the 71 writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I phoned in my Top 25 (to Associated Press headquarters),
the guy said, `You've got UCLA No. 1? Are you sure you want to do
that?''' Curtis said. ``(But) who's had better results this season?
I don't understand why so much weight is put on preseason polls.
They're nothing but speculation. I wipe the slate clean every week.
If Alabama loses to Podunk U. next week the whole thing could
change.''
</P>
<P>
   COMINGS AND GOINGS: Paul Nelson, a receiver who quit the team
two weeks ago over concerns about playing time, plans to enroll and
begin practicing today at San Diego State. Nelson, who also
considered UNLV, will be a junior next season.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Santi Hall, who was dismissed from the team three
weeks ago, is at Sacramento State and receiver Ryan Smith, who left
the team, has returned. Also, defensive tackle Doug Whiting, who
didn't figure to play this season, was dismissed for violating team
policy, according to Toledo.

CBS AND ABC OBJECT TO BUSH'S PROPOSAL FOR DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two television networks that were left out of Gov. George W.
Bush's plan to impose his own schedule of debates declared Monday
that they had no intention of carrying presidential debates
sponsored by rival networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush proposal, announced on Sunday after intense
negotiations with officials of six cable and broadcast networks,
has thrown into turmoil the work of the Commission on Presidential
Debates, the panel created in 1987 by the Democrats and the
Republicans to avoid squabbling over the debates. Since the
creation of the panel, no candidate has gone so far as Bush has
gone to circumvent its work.
</P>
<P>
   But on the campaign trail Monday, Bush said that by rejecting
his proposal, Gore was ducking debates and going back on his word
to face off with him at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp countered that Mr. Bush was trying to tailor the
debates to his own liking, then blame Mr. Gore for rejecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, the commission's executive director, said that the
panel has asked officials of both the Bush and Gore campaigns to
meet in Washington this week to work out an agreement under which
Bush would consent to the commission's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe our proposal is the best one,'' Brown
said. ``I believe the campaigns when they say they want to debate
in a way that reaches the maximum number of people, and the way to
do that is to implement the commission's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the commission announced its plans for three
90-minute debates in October on college campuses in Boston,
Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis, a plan that Vice President Al
Gore quickly endorsed. On Sunday, Bush unveiled his own proposal,
which would include the commission-sponsored debate in St. Louis,
but would substitute the others with two one-hour encounters, one
next week on a prime-time edition of ``Meet the Press'' with Tim
Russert on NBC, and the other on Oct. 3 on CNN's ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission was established not only to eliminate this sort
of jockeying, but also to ensure that the debates could be seen by
the most viewers across as many channels as possible. In one debate
in 1992, for instance, 92 million viewers tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   But executives of networks that were turned down by Bush made it
clear that they would not devote air time to what they viewed
chiefly as promotional opportunities for Russert and King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it might be in the interest of some of the
parties involved to call them debates, but these are basically
versions of existing talk shows, and we don't normally air other
people's talk shows,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS
News.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, the executive vice president of ABC News, echoed
Heyward, saying, ``It's very unlikely we would cover other
networks' programs, and that is essentially what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC News and CNN said Monday that they would make their
debates available to competing networks in what is known as a
``clean feed'' _ a transmission that leaves off the originating
network's identifying symbol in the corner of the screen. In
addition, NBC and CNN said they would carry each other's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush continued to batter each other with the debate
issue Monday. While aides to Gore called Bush arrogant for his
rejection of the commission plan, the Bush camp reminded reporters
that the vice president had agreed to debate the governor anywhere,
anytime. Gore has said he would do the debates on ``Meet the
Press'' and ``Larry King Live'' if Bush agrees to the commission
debates.
</P>
<P>
   And though Gore insisted he would never agree to Bush's
conditions, aides to Bush said they remain convinced that if
pressure were brought to bear on the vice president to appear with
Bush on the two programs, other networks would be compelled to put
the debates on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do suspect that if Al Gore were to show up on `Meet the
Press,''' said one top Bush official who demanded anonymity, ``all
the networks, with their dedication to public service, would be
hard-pressed not to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, however, that many of the networks were feeling
slightly uncomfortable over any role they might be playing in
subverting the work of the debate commission. Privately, some
broadcast journalists expressed outrage at what they viewed as the
networks allowing themselves to be used by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here is a maneuvering for position, and
journalists should be very wary of getting roped into that,'' said
Heyward of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, CBS was among the networks that made a pitch to
Bush for a debate on ``Face the Nation.'' Heyward explained,
however, that he made it a condition that such a debate could only
happen if the commission's plan fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get drawn into where the network broadcasts
were used as bargaining chips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its offer letter, CNN wrote both campaigns that its debate
would ``encompass a typical `Larry King Live' format.'' The network
proposed two coin tosses _ ``one for seat preference and one for
question order'' _ and asserted that the program would not take
viewer calls or use video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wheatley, vice president of NBC News, said his network had
long ago made an offer to both camps for a ``Meet the Press''
debate. ``And in recent weeks,'' he added, ``as it became clear
that there was going to be further discussion on the nature of the
debates, we pressed home that request, saying that `you could have
a `Meet the Press' in prime time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, NBC found itself in the position of being championed by
the Bush campaign over the debate issue. In an e-mail message to
reporters Monday, Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said Gore was
now ``backpedaling'' from a commitment made months ago to debate on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes the first debate should allow for more
than just sound bites; it should feature an in-depth discussion of
the issues and have tough questioning,'' Fleischer wrote. ``Having
the first debate on `Meet the Press' will allow such an exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley, however, brushed aside any suggestion that the Bush
campaign was using NBC as a means of undoing the commission. He
added that scheduling the program in September would be a service
to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our proposal gives the public an opportunity
to give these men a chance to debate a month earlier,'' he said.
``Otherwise, the commission debates don't begin until October.''
</P>
<P>
   For the debate commission, the Bush plan is a potentially
serious disruption of its mission. ``All the debates have been in
communities, on campuses, or in towns,'' Brown said. ``These are
the single set of political events that the public still thinks
belongs to them. We believe taking them to communities where
thousands of young people can participate is a very good thing that
can't take place if you do two debates in television studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she hopes to be able to convince Bush's aides that
the commission plan is an enhanced version of the proposal they
have offered. ``We think campuses are preferable to studios,'' she
said, ``and we belive that six networks are preferable to one or
two.''

   The Gore camp countered that Bush was trying to tailor the
debates to his own liking, then blame Gore for rejecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, the commission's executive director, said that the
panel has asked officials of both the Bush and Gore campaigns to
meet in Washington this week to work out an agreement under which
Bush would consent to the commission's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe our proposal is the best one,'' Brown
said. ``I believe the campaigns when they say they want to debate
in a way that reaches the maximum number of people, and the way to
do that is to implement the commission's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the commission announced its plans for three
90-minute debates in October on college campuses in Boston,
Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis, a plan that Vice President Al
Gore quickly endorsed. On Sunday, Bush unveiled his own proposal,
which would include the commission-sponsored debate in St. Louis,
but would substitute the others with two one-hour encounters, one
next week on a prime-time edition of ``Meet the Press'' with Tim
Russert on NBC, and the other on Oct. 3 on CNN's ``Larry King
Live.'' Bush's plan calls for 60-minute forums.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was established not only to eliminate this sort
of jockeying, but also to ensure that the debates could be seen by
the most viewers across as many channels as possible. In one debate
in 1992, for instance, 92 million viewers tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   But executives of networks that were turned down by Bush made it
clear that they would not devote air time to what they viewed
chiefly as promotional opportunities for Russert and King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it might be in the interest of some of the
parties involved to call them debates, but these are basically
versions of existing talk shows, and we don't normally air other
people's talk shows,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS
News.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, the executive vice president of ABC News, echoed
Heyward, saying, ``It's very unlikely we would cover other
networks' programs, and that is essentially what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC News and CNN said Monday that they would make their
debates available to competing networks in what is known as a
``clean feed'' _ a transmission that leaves off the originating
network's identifying symbol in the corner of the screen. In
addition, NBC and CNN said they would carry each other's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush continued to batter each other with the debate
issue Monday. While aides to Gore called Bush arrogant for his
rejection of the commission plan, the Bush camp reminded reporters
that the vice president had agreed to debate the governor anywhere,
anytime. Gore has said he would do the debates on ``Meet the
Press'' and ``Larry King Live'' if Bush agrees to the commission
debates.
</P>
<P>
   And though Gore insisted he would never agree to Bush's
conditions, aides to Bush said they remain convinced that if
pressure were brought to bear on the vice president to appear with
Bush on the two programs, other networks would be compelled to put
the debates on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do suspect that if Al Gore were to show up on `Meet the
Press,''' said one top Bush official who demanded anonymity, ``all
the networks, with their dedication to public service, would be
hard-pressed not to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, however, that many of the networks were feeling
slightly uncomfortable over any role they might be playing in
subverting the work of the debate commission. Privately, some
broadcast journalists expressed outrage at what they viewed as the
networks allowing themselves to be used by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here is a maneuvering for position, and
journalists should be very wary of getting roped into that,'' said
Heyward of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, CBS was among the networks that made a pitch to
Bush for a debate on ``Face the Nation.'' Heyward explained,
however, that he made it a condition that such a debate could only
happen if the commission's plan fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get drawn into where the network broadcasts
were used as bargaining chips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its offer letter, CNN wrote both campaigns that its debate
would ``encompass a typical `Larry King Live' format.'' The network
proposed two coin tosses _ ``one for seat preference and one for
question order'' _ and asserted that the program would not take
viewer calls or use video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wheatley, vice president of NBC News, said his network had
long ago made an offer to both camps for a ``Meet the Press''
debate. ``And in recent weeks,'' he added, ``as it became clear
that there was going to be further discussion on the nature of the
debates, we pressed home that request, saying that `you could have
a `Meet the Press' in prime time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, NBC found itself in the position of being campioned by
the Bush campaign over the debate issue. In an e-mail message to
reporters Monday, Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said Gore was
now ``backpedaling'' from a commitment made months ago to debate on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes the first debate should allow for more
than just sound bites; it should feature an in-depth discussion of
the issues and have tough questioning,'' Fleischer wrote. ``Having
the first debate on `Meet the Press' will allow such an exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley, however, brushed aside any suggestion that the Bush
campaign was using NBC as a means of undoing the commission. He
added that scheduling the program in September would be a service
to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our proposal gives the public an opportunity
to give these men a chance to debate a month earlier,'' he said.
``Otherwise, the commission debates don't begin until October.''
</P>
<P>
   For the debate commission, the Bush plan is a potentially
serious disruption of its mission. ``All the debates have been in
communities, on campuses, or in towns,'' Brown said. ``These are
the single set of political events that the public still thinks
belongs to them. We believe taking them to communities where
thousands of young people can participate is a very good thing that
can't take place if you do two debates in television studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she hopes to be able to convince Bush's aides that
the commission plan is an enhanced version of the proposal they
have offered. ``We think campuses are preferable to studios,'' she
said, ``and we belive that six networks are preferable to one or
two.''

FOR POWERFUL BROTHERS, POLITICS CAN BE THICKER THAN BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT PEAR and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politics can sometimes turn brother against
brother.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Podesta, chief of staff at the White House, is trying to
enhance President Clinton's legacy by adding prescription drug
benefits to Medicare and by persuading Congress to enact a bill of
rights for patients.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Anthony T. Podesta, represents the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, lobbying
against the president's Medicare plan. In fact, Clinton complained
the other day, ``the pharmaceutical industry has unleashed a
shameless, scorched-earth campaign'' to block his plan.
</P>
<P>
   One of Tony Podesta's partners in his lobbying firm, which he
calls podesta.com, Jeffrey Ricchetti, represents the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association in the insurance industry's effort to kill
patients' rights legislation. But John Podesta has his own ally in
pushing the bill: his White House deputy, Steven J. Ricchetti,
Jeff's older brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medicis controlled everything,'' Tony Podesta said in an
interview, referring to the merchant family that ruled Renaissance
Florence. ``We have it split into two families.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Tony Podesta are two of the most influential people in
Washington, playing opposite sides of the fence that is supposed to
separate policy-making from special pleading. But their
relationship _ brothers, former business partners, spokesmen for
people who hold a large share of the power and money in America _
can be seen as emblematic of the way Washington works in the age of
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying is serious business, but the best of the breed do not
take it too seriously because they know that today's enemies may be
allies on another issue tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, 51, has served as staff secretary, scandal handler
and chief of staff in the Clinton White House. He is needle-thin,
intense, moody at times, but with a wicked sense of humor. He is an
aficionado of roller coasters, working in a White House that often
resembles one.
</P>
<P>
   When he was staff secretary, responsible for the flow of paper
to the Oval Office, Podesta was particularly annoyed by
intelligence bureaucrats who dressed up routine memorandums with
``top secret'' designations to get the president's attention. When
the CIA or the National Security Council submitted a classified
report that Podesta had already seen on CNN, he stamped it
``EMBARRASSING'' in big green letters before sending it to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta, 56, a big, barrel-chested man, is more flamboyant
than his brother. He collects funky contemporary art and wears a
tie only when he has to. Like his brother, he is full of kinetic
energy. ``They're cranked up all the time,'' said their 82-year-old
mother, Mary K. Podesta, who lives here.
</P>
<P>
   The company now known as podesta.com was founded by the Podesta
brothers in 1988. For the first few years, the lobbyists were all
Democrats, but since 1991, the company has become more bipartisan.
Of the 30 professional employees, a third are now Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists include people who have worked for Democrats like
Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut; for Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House
Democratic whip; and for the AFL-CIO and the United Mine Workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the lobbying corps at podesta.com also includes people who
have worked for Republicans like Newt Gingrich, the former speaker;
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader; Rep. J.C.
Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Republican
Conference; and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another podesta.com associate is Heather Barbour, daughter of
the former chairman of the Republican Party and adviser to Gov.
George W. Bush, Haley Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta insists he never calls his brother or Steve
Ricchetti to obtain favors for clients, which include biotechnology
companies and drug companies like Eli Lilly and Novartis, as well
as Dow Chemical, Viacom, CBS, General Electric, Time Warner and the
Motion Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But his clients say he has opened doors for them elsewhere in
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta is a facilitator, a broker, a translator, who helps
businesses understand the ways of Washington. As a liberal
Democrat, he intuitively understands how Clinton administration
officials are thinking. Clients say they value his insights and use
him to send messages to the White House and Democrats in Congress.
Podesta said his company had billings of $8.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a civil liberties group, said: ``Tony is a political
operator, a political networker, with tremendous reach. There are
many connections between the White House and his firm, that's
clear. They know how to keep those lines separated, but it's a
high-wire act.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although clients or potential clients might hope that Tony
Podesta offers entree to the White House, the Podestas say they
never talk policy. It would be wrong ethically and suicidal
politically, they say. ``He doesn't lobby me, I don't lobby him,''
John Podesta says.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime client called Tony Podesta not too long ago and asked
him to contact his brother on a policy matter of concern to his
employer, a big media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said no,'' the client said, insisting he not be identified
for fear of alienating one of the Podesta brothers. ``I said, `Come
on, call him.' He said no. I said, `Tony, no one's been with you
longer than me _ call him.' He said no; he just wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary B. Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association
of America and a podesta.com client, said she had never known Tony
Podesta to lean on his brother on behalf of a client. ``It would be
stupid, and Tony's not stupid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, other lobbyists, competitors of Tony Podesta's company,
said the relationship had helped generate business and had given
Tony Podesta added clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, when you're an assistant secretary of something
and you have a bunch of phone calls after lunch and one has
Podesta's name on it, that slip gets to the top of the stack pretty
quick,'' said one competitor, a prominent Republican lobbyist.
``You know it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ricchetti, 43, has spun through the revolving door several
times. He headed the political department of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association from 1987 to 1989 and led the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee from 1990 to 1992. He worked in the
Clinton White House as the top Senate lobbyist from 1993 to 1996
and returned to the private sector to lobby for corporate clients
before going back to the White House in September 1998. Steve
Ricchetti's chief assignment in late 1998 was to keep Congressional
Democrats from voting to impeach or convict the president. In
January 1999, he became deputy chief of staff, with many additional
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Following in his brother's footsteps, Jeff Ricchetti worked at
Blue Cross and Blue Shield, as director of Congressional relations
from 1993 to 1996. The Ricchetti brothers, who grew up in
Cleveland, created a lobbying firm here in 1998. They sold it to
podesta.com early last year, after Steve went back to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ricchetti, 40, said he provided ``the full gamut of
lobbying on behalf of Blue Cross and Blue Shield.'' As a senior
strategist at podesta.com, he follows every twitch of activity on
legislation to define patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   William A. Pierce, a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield,
said: ``In the patients' bill of rights debate, we do not support
passage of any federal legislation. We oppose all the legislation
in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which provide managed health
care for 53 million people, are particularly opposed to giving
patients any new right to sue their health plans. Clinton says that
right is essential. But Pierce said it would be ``bad for consumers
because it would increase costs without solving the patients'
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta.com boasts of its ability to build coalitions uniting
Republicans and Democrats, corporations and consumer groups, and
competing companies in the same industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta has enhanced his lobbying power by raising money
for politicians including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta refers to his fund-raising operation, built around
fine meals at his northwest Washington home, as the ``Pesto PAC.''
His mother, Mary Podesta, cooks Italian food for guests at these
political dinners. ``I'm the pesto lady,'' Podesta said in an
interview. ``The funny part is, I'm Greek.''

PENELOPE RUSSIANOFF, 82, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, WRITER
</HEADLINE>
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Penelope Russianoff, a psychotherapist, writer and
lecturer who advised women on how to assert themselves, died on
Aug. 28 at her home in Manhattan. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff maintained that women must unlearn the helplessness
they learned at an early age. Helplessness, she held, can lead to
serious problems like depression, overeating, battering,
alcoholism, drugs and sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage and male companionship are fine, she asserted, but a
woman must be able to do without them. It is good for a woman to
have a man's attention, she said, but self-esteem must not depend
on it. She tried to show her clients how to communicate with
themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   Her practice always included some celebrity clientele, and she
became a bit of a celebrity herself after the director Paul
Mazursky cast her as a therapist in his 1978 film ``An Unmarried
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance in the movie, filmed in her Manhattan penthouse
office, drew much criticism from colleagues. It also increased her
practice and earned her a book contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Do I Think I Am Nothing Without a Man?'' became a national
best seller in 1982. A second book, ``When Am I Going to Be
Happy?'' (1989) was reissued by Bantam in 1997 and remains in
print.
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff, whose maiden name was Pearl, was born in Baltimore.
She graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1939
with honors in psychology and philosophy, and received a master's
degree in clinical psychology in 1941. She received a doctorate in
that discipline at Northwestern University in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of the faculty of the New School for Social
Research from 1960 until the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Leon Russianoff, a noted clarinetist and teacher,
died in 1990. She is survived by a daughter, Sylvia Linguiti of
Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE SCOURGE OF GUNS  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept. 5: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We live in a nation awash in guns where more than 30,000
Americans die annually by gunfire, a toll that includes about 4,000
children and teenagers. Yet despite these horrible statistics,
Americans are allowed, as in few other industrialized countries, to
buy and keep an unlimited arsenal of firearms with very few
restrictions and little government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre at Columbine High School and multiple killings in
schools, workplaces, restaurants and other public places have
brought home to voters the need for stricter, more consistent gun
control laws. Yet Congress has been shamelessly servile to the
demands of the National Rifle Association, refusing to approve even
the most modest measures that might help curb gun violence. On this
central public safety issue the two presidential candidates, Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, have very different
records and agendas that will determine whether meaningful controls
are achieved in the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   There are now some 190 million firearms in civilian hands, about
three-quarters of which are owned by only 10 percent of the adult
population. About 65 million of those firearms are handguns, which
are responsible for most gun-related deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world, a central agency would oversee the
manufacture and distribution of guns in the way that government
regulates other potentially hazardous products, like drugs and
pesticides. But in the absence of a truly comprehensive regulatory
regime, there are several important steps that can be taken to
prevent the death toll from rising.
</P>
<P>
   One key improvement would be a law establishing nationwide
licensing of gun owners and registration for the tens of millions
of firearms now in circulation. Such a system would ensure that gun
owners pass safety training tests and enable law enforcement
agencies to track weapons to their owners. The Brady law requiring
background checks of gun purchasers has stopped tens of thousands
of felons from buying handguns from licensed dealers. But in 1998,
the five-day waiting period for handgun purchasers under that law
expired and was replaced by a national instant check system.
Congress should approve at least a mandatory three-day waiting
period to allow for more thorough background checks of non-felony
records on mental health and domestic violence charges.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also needs to close the loophole in the law that allows
criminals and other unqualified individuals to buy guns at gun
shows without having to undergo a background check. This is a huge
problem. There are more than 4,000 gun shows held annually around
the country, and these events have become a major source of guns
that are illegally trafficked and end up in criminal hands.
Congress' refusal to close this deadly loophole is an
unconscionable concession to the pro-gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide one-gun-a-month purchase limit for individuals
would help reduce the number of guns on the street. Raising the
minimum age for possession of handguns and assault weapons from 18
to 21 and requiring mandatory child safety locks on handguns could
help prevent some gun deaths and injuries to children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has embraced many of these proposals _ pushing strongly for
licensing for gun owners, closing the gun show loophole, banning
the sale of cheap ``junk guns'' that are so often used in crimes,
enacting a three-day waiting period, a one-gun-a-month rule and
various child safety provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems to be softening his pro-gun stance, but his record in
Texas has been one to gladden Charlton Heston's heart. In 1995 he
signed a law that made it legal for Texas residents to carry
concealed weapons, and in 1997 he expanded that law to allow
concealed weapons in churches and hospitals unless those
institutions expressly prohibit weapons on their premises. Last
year Bush signed a law making it extremely difficult for cities in
Texas to bring lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Such suits by
many cities around the country have been instrumental in putting
pressure on Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun manufacturer,
to agree to alter the way it makes and markets guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes licensing and registration, a three-day waiting
period on purchases, and limiting purchases to one gun a month. On
the campaign trail and in his literature, he emphasizes tougher
enforcement of existing laws, although he does say he will not push
for a nationwide version of Texas' concealed weapons law. He says
he would accept some type of background check at gun shows, and
that he would sign a mandatory trigger lock requirement if Congress
put such a measure on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   But relying on Congress to take the lead means nothing will be
done. Presidential leadership and passion will be crucial if there
is any hope of enacting new forms of gun control.

CINCINNATI BEATS ARMY, 23-17 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ They had something old _ an 0-4 record in season
openers away from West Point. They had a bunch of new stuff _ a
head coach for one, Todd Berry, who brought a one-back,
multiple-spread offense to put the ball in the air. They had
something borrowed _ a gray stripe added to each jersey sleeve to
represent the U.S. Corps of Cadets, as well as the uniforms worn by
its championship teams of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the new-look Army Black Knights had something to be
blue about, though, as their multiweapon attack came up short
against their Conference USA rival Cincinnati, 23-17, before 23,311
here at Nippert Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While the Black Knights were intent on showing the new wrinkles
in their offense, the Bearcats, behind running backs Ray Jackson
and DeMarco McCleskey, rolled up a ground game like the Army of
old. The twosome combined for 198 yards, and Jackson blew threw the
middle of the Black Knight defense for a 37-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Cincinnati's quarterback, Deontey Kenner, who undid
Army with a time-killing nine-play, 78-yard drive that ended with
his rolling right and slinging a 12-yard pass to a wide-open Jason
Collins Baker in the end zone to give the Bearcats a 20-17 lead
with six minutes left in the game. Kenner, a senior, was 18 of 29
for 239 yards as he continued his pursuit of virtually all of
Cincinnati's career passing records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense was rolling,'' said Army linebacker Brian
Zickefoose, who had 10 tackles. ``We just didn't get it done on
defense. Those two big backs wore us down late, and their passer
picked us apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Army Athletic Association, after a
marketing study, unveiled a new logo _ a sleek knight on horseback
over the word Army _ and a plan to build a consistent brand image.
The Army athletic teams would always be called the Black Knights,
and the once preferred use of the ``Cadets'' discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change, however, was made the previous year, when
coach Bob Sutton was replaced after back-to-back 3-8 seasons. In
came Berry, who in 1999 had taken Illinois State to the best finish
in school history, 11-3, and the semifinals of the DivisionI-AA
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the 39-year-old Berry did was scrap the
earthbound wishbone offense that had rolled Army to four national
rushing titles. Despite the cosmetic homage to history _ the gray
stripe worn by the Heisman Trophy winners Doc Blanchard and Glenn
Davis and the jerseys without names _ Army started its 111th season
a thoroughly modern team.
</P>
<P>
   Its first two plays of the game were passes, though quarterback
Chad Jenkins failed to connect with receivers. And, after
Cincinnati place-kicker Jonathan Ruffin booted his third field goal
of the day, a 26-yarder with 31 seconds to play, the Black Knights
tried a cross-field, backward pass on the ensuing kickoff return.
The play went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fired every bullet we had and didn't leave anything in our
bag,'' Berry said. ``At times, you could tell our guys weren't
completely comfortable with everything we were doing. I've got very
bright young men out there, and they're going to get better. I
think you could see that they were having fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also many encouraging performances turned in by Army
players, though the team's 243 yards of total offense was far below
the 323 rushing yards they averaged last year in the wishbone.
After a 2-of-8 first half, Jenkins, a junior, went 12 of 21 and led
scoring drives of 80 and 95 yards. He spread the ball to four
receivers and showed a deft touch when he found the junior Omari
Thompson on a 31-yard crossing pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins even gave Army a 17-13 lead early in the first quarter
when he rolled right and tossed a swing pass to running back
Michael Wallace, who rushed for 894 yards last year but had never
caught a pass in his career at Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' Wallace, a senior, said after his first
reception turned out to be a touchdown. ``I like running the ball,
but it's nice to be swung out wide and have a chance to get it and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, tight end Clint Dodson smiled. He had a reason to. He
had six catches for 44 yards _ five more than he had all of last
season. The new logo, new uniform and especially the new offense is
fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost today, and it hurts,'' he said, ``but once we figure
this all out I think we're going to be a dangerous team.''

YANKEES BEAT ROYALS, 4-3, WITHOUT WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ An inning or two passed before all of Bernie
Williams' teammates realized that he had been removed from Monday
night's game after he strained his rib cage again. They will all be
fully aware of his status, however, if the injury lingers into next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees believe he will recover before the postseason, but
rib-cage injuries are delicate and another setback could be
serious. They won without Williams Monday night, 4-3, barely
holding their slim lead against the Kansas City Royals through
anxious moments in the eighth and ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte improved his record to 17-7, Jorge Posada had
three hits and increased his batting average to .301, and David
Justice drove in a run, his 100th of the season. But the Yankees
(77-57) tend to think big picture _ as in the playoffs and the
World Series _ and Williams' status seemed to dominate the thoughts
of manager Joe Torre after the game. ``At this time,'' Torre said,
he does not think Williams' injury will linger. ``If it goes a week
and he's still hurting, then you wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Williams initially strained the right side of
his rib cage on Aug. 18 and missed little more than a week before
returning to the lineup _ primarily as a right-handed hitter,
because the strain bothered him more while batting from the left
side. Williams said Monday night that when he returned, he felt
strong and he was swinging hard; Torre wondered aloud after the
game if Williams might have been more sore than he was letting on.
</P>
<P>
   Batting in the first inning, Williams swung at and missed Mac
Suzuki's first pitch, a split-finger fastball, and felt a pain in
his side. Torre did not notice Williams' physical reaction to the
discomfort, but the trainer Gene Monahan did, and when Williams
returned to the dugout after playing defense in the bottom of the
first inning, Torre cornered Williams and essentially forced him
into confessing his pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' Williams said. ``It's certainly very
bad timing. We'll see how I feel tomorrow. I'm taking it on a daily
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams figures to miss at least the next five games, when the
Yankees face right-handed starters, and probably more, in light of
the Yankees' six-game lead over Boston in the American League East
and Torre's dedication to getting the team prepared for the
postseason. He has stressed to all his players that they must be
honest about their ailments now. ``We don't have time to get
something well, if we have a major problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said it ``would be a huge blow to us'' to lose Williams
for a long time, ``banged up as it is in the outfield.'' Right
fielder Paul O'Neill is limping with a hip pointer, and Justice,
the left fielder, is playing despite a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' injury will almost certainly end his bid to surpass
one of Mickey Mantle's notable achievements. Mantle drove in 130
runs in 1956, setting a major league season record by a
switch-hitter, and San Diego's Ken Caminiti tied that mark in 1996.
Williams had 80 runs batted in over 83 games at the All-Star Game
break, and now he has 111 RBIs with 28 games to play _ and he will
miss some or most of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte can still reach a personal milestone, now that he is
within three victories of 20 for the season, but Monday night's
victory did not come easily. Working quickly, Pettitte allowed
eight hits in seven innings, six of those to the No. 3 and No. 4
batters for Kansas City, Mike Sweeney and Jermaine Dye.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 4-2, in the eighth. Johnny Damon doubled to
lead off, however, and after Pettitte struck out Carlos Beltran,
Sweeney and Dye were due to hit again. Torre went to the mound.
``What are the odds?'' Pettitte asked about the chances of allowing
more hits to Sweeney and Dye, but Torre was unimpressed, calling on
Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, one of those chastised by George Steinbrenner last week,
allowed Damon to score on Sweeney's infield single and prompted
separate meetings with Posada and the pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre before striking out Joe Randa to end the eighth. Nelson
lurched off the mound happily, waving his arms; Nelson needed that
outing, Torre mused.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera took over for the ninth, and his relative
vulnerability was apparent again. There were a leadoff single and a
two-out walk, and the pinch-hitter Wilson Delgado _ formerly with
the Yankees this season _ beat out an infield hit. Bases loaded,
Sweeney at the plate. Rivera opened with a high fastball, and
Sweeney hacked confidently at it, fouling it off, an
uncharacteristically aggressive swing against the Yankees' closer.
With two strikes, Sweeney smashed a liner to center, directly at
Clay Bellinger, who had replaced Williams in center.

UT's BROWN TO DELAY MAKING A CHOICE AT QB (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram AUSTIN _ In an effort to minimize distractions and prolong the
evaluation process, Texas football coach Mack Brown said he does
not plan to select a starting quarterback until minutes before
Saturday's 11:30 a.m. kickoff against Louisiana-Lafayette.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We'll make the decision some time before game time and we
probably won't tell anybody except the two quarterbacks. I don't
think the team will know until they run out on the field,'' Brown
said Monday during a news conference. ``There's absolutely no
reason for me to do this'' before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Following a different course of action, Brown said, ``would be
disruptive to me and the players this week,'' because it would
trigger more questions from the media.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's decision to delay a decision on whether Chris Simms or
Major Applewhite will open at quarterback for the sixth-ranked
Longhorns will allow Texas fans to continue an eight-month debate
on the merits of the respective players.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, the 1999 Big 12 offensive player of the year,
underwent reconstructive knee surgery in January. Since reporting
for fall drills, the junior has not experienced swelling in his
knee. But he has not been exposed to contact since tearing his
anterior cruciate ligament Jan. 1 in the Southwestern Bell Cotton
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Simms, a sophomore, was the nation's top-rated quarterback
signee in 1999 and was the star of spring drills while running the
first-team offense. The son of former New York Giants quarterback
Phil Simms, the 6-foot-5, 222-pound left-hander has worked
exclusively with the first-team offense during fall drills.
Applewhite has split snaps with the first and second units.
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterbacks said they expect to play Saturday and will
accept whatever decision Brown makes about dividing playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, who threw for a school-record 3,357 yards and 21
touchdowns last season, said he has had mixed emotions about
working primarily with the second unit during the fall. On one
hand, he said it's ``a tough pill to swallow'' for an incumbent. On
the other, he said practicing against the Longhorns' No. 1 defense
on a daily basis has made him a better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, you have to prepare yourself as if you'll be
the starter,'' Applewhite said. ``It wouldn't surprise me if he
(Simms) starts. It wouldn't surprise me if I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms said he has no problem waiting to learn of his status
until Saturday, but hinted that Texas coaches mightbe close to
reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they have a little idea in their mind,'' Simms said.
``They let us know the deal. I think we're both comfortable right
now with everything and that's all that matters. The coaches have
done a real good job of making us both feel good. Coach Brown is
real cool under this kind of pressure. I trust that he'll do the
right thing.'' nn

KNEE INJURY SHELVES GALLOWAY FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
IRVING _ The Cowboys found out Monday it can get worse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding injury to insult, the aftermath of the Cowboys'
confidence-rattling, season-opening 41-14 loss to the Philadelphia
Eagles at Texas Stadium on Sunday came with the grimmest of news:
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Joey Galloway will miss the remainder of the
season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The
much-anticipated, new timing-based offense was to be centered
around Galloway, who instead saw his season end on a play with less
than three minutes left in a 27-point blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman is listed as ``questionable'' as well as
``day-to-day'' with what has been diagnosed as a ``mild
concussion,'' after a four-sack, 0-for-5 passing game in which
Aikman was on the field for 15 plays _ and on his back no fewer
than eight times.
</P>
<P>
   The concern for Aikman, 33, heightens because of his history
with concussions (eight with the Cowboys, including three in his
past 10 games) and the fact that Sunday's head injury didn't
involve a helmet-to-helmet or open-field hit.
</P>
<P>
   The results of a CT scan administered at a hospital Sunday were
negative. Aikman will be monitored closely for the next several
days, according to team officials.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Randall Cunningham, who is expected to be
Sunday night's starter at Arizona if Aikman is not cleared to play,
has a sprained thumb on his throwing hand. The last time
Cunningham, 37, started a game was Oct. 17 at Detroit as a member
of the Minnesota Vikings. The key to success will be Cunningham's
grasp of an offense in which he has little game experience, as well
as his grasp on the ball because of the thumb injury.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, no one could remember the last time there has been this
much carnage, devastation and uncertainty circling Valley Ranch,
all of which took place within a span of about 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But stiff upper lips and reminders that there still is a season
to play were in full force at the complex on ``Black Monday.''
Personal concerns for Aikman were mixed with positive wishes for
Galloway to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Among those still standing was Emmitt Smith, who had exactly as
many carries as rookie Micah Knorr had punts Sunday (seven apiece).
</P>
<P>
   When Galloway awkwardly fell out of bounds after a hard tackle
by Eagles cornerback Al Harris, Smith recalled watching from the
sideline: ``I was kind of in disbelief when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones, while speaking of injuries being part of the
game and the Cowboys having depth at wide receiver, was visibly
shaken when Galloway's MRI results became known Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the cost (two first-round draft picks and $12.5 million
in up-front money on Galloway's seven-year, $42 million contract)
and the loss, Jones said, ``I don't know how to describe to you how
disappointed I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily, words got stuck in Jones' throat as he explained
that he might take a few days ``to dwell'' on the loss of Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have made the commitment we made to bring Joey here and the
type of impact that we all felt he could have on this offense, I
don't know that I've ever had to make the kind of adjustment we're
trying to make (so immediately after) such a commitment,'' said
Jones, who added that he did not have a problem with the decision
to leave Galloway in the game late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Aikman's concussion was ``not to the degree'' of his
Oct. 31 concussion in Indianapolis, which was followed eight days
later by a concussion in Minnesota. Aikman sat out the next two
games after visiting two neurosurgeons.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was concerned about the cumulative effect of
concussions on his teammate and friend, Smith said, ``My concern is
more for his protection. We, as players, have to do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he phoned Aikman on Monday morning and left a
voice-mail to the effect that he deeply cares about and fully
supports his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs some time to get away and think,'' Smith said. ``Troy
is astute enough, smart enough, to know whether or not he can get
back on the field and perform at his best, and whether or not he's
willing to take the risk.''

RAMS OUTLAST BRONCOS, 41-36 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The St. Louis Rams threw a pregame party Monday
night. It featured eight cannon shots, each one sounding like a
stick of dynamite being detonated. There were fireworks, rock music
and the St. Louis owner, Georgia Frontiere, raising the Lombardi
Trophy above her head and giving it a smooch.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful scene for the sellout crowd at the Trans
World Dome until Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan nearly ruined
everything with a masterful game plan of aggressive offense and
relentless, ball-hawking defense.
</P>
<P>
   Led by quarterback Brian Griese, the Broncos took a 1-point lead
with six minutes left. But the speed of the Rams _ overpowering and
practically unstoppable _ helped them avoid an embarrassing
season-opening loss. St. Louis beat Denver, 41-36, in one of the
most exciting regular-season games in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis looked as if it might cruise after a gorgeous 72-yard
touchdown run by Marshall Faulk and a dazzling 80-yard touchdown
catch by wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim. The score was 35-20 with 4
minutes 2 seconds remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Griese showed why he might do just fine in his second year
as John Elway's replacement. He threw a 7-yard score to Desmond
Clark to make the score 35-27, and then Denver managed a 36-yard
field goal by Jason Elam to cut the score to 35-30.
</P>
<P>
   Then disaster struck for the Rams. Kurt Warner, last season's
most valuable player, tried to squeeze a pass on the left sideline
to Torry Holt. The throw was intercepted by cornerback Terrell
Buckley, who returned it untouched 32 yards for a touchdown. Denver
led by 36-35.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk made another spectacular run, this time for 30 yards,
which put St. Louis at the Denver 1-yard line. Fullback Robert
Holcombe ran it in from there and, after a failed 2-point
conversion, the Rams led by 41-36 with 2:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Griese finally ran out of miracles. On third-and-21 at Denver's
27-yard line, he was sacked by defensive lineman Kevin Carter for a
12-yard loss. Then on fourth down, Griese was hit in the back by
defensive end Grant Wistrom, which rocked Griese so hard the ball
went fluttering into the air and landed harmlessly on the ground.
Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Warner completed 25 of 35 passes for 441 yards and three
touchdowns, two of them covering 152 yards in the third quarter on
throws in the flat.
</P>
<P>
   Griese was 19 of 28 for 307 yards, throwing for two touchdowns
and running for a third.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, who missed 12 games games last season with a knee
injury, rushed for 34 yards on nine carries before leaving the game
in the second quarter with a twisted left knee. His replacement,
Olandis Gary, rumbled for 80 yards on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   For a defending champion, the Rams have received surprisingly
little respect. Many in football, and the news media, believe
Washington and Tampa Bay might be better than St. Louis and are
picking one of those teams as top candidates to reach the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The early part of the game showed how difficult it is for a team
to defend its title. Defensively, Denver used a mixture of
secondary coverages, including a healthy dose of man-to-man, always
dangerous against the game's fastest fleet of wide receivers. The
Broncos did not seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Denver was even more aggressive. On its first
touchdown drive, there was a lot of Davis, but Shanahan also took
the shackles off Griese, allowing him to throw deep. The Broncos
took a 7-0 lead when Griese scored on an 8-yard bootleg with 10:05
left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That trend continued later in the game when Griese launched a
perfect long pass to wide receiver Rod Smith for 47 yards after
Smith had beaten double coverage. The play led to a 32-yard field
goal by Elam, which was important, because on the previous series,
Hakim scored on a blistering 86-yard punt return that was keyed by
terrific blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Last year during the Rams' championship run, such a play would
have deflated most teams and started a St. Louis point-scoring
buffet. The Broncos, however, refused to be intimidated, even with
Davis on the sideline with a twisted left ankle. When St. Louis
scored on an 89-yard drive that ended in a Faulk 5-yard touchdown
run, making the score 14-10, Griese countered with his best set of
plays of the night. On a third-and-8, he kept the offense on the
field with a 26-yard scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the drive, with the Denver churning along smoothly, St.
Louis went with an all-out blitz to disrupt Griese's timing. Griese
read it the way the man he replaced _ Elway _ would have. He made
the correct hot read to Smith, who caught the quick pass at the
20-yard line and then burst up the middle for the 25-yard touchdown
and 17-14 Denver lead.

MAVERICKS' ROOKIES FADE TO BACKGROUND (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram DALLAS _ This summer was hailed as the Mavericks' greatest draft
since they plucked Mark Aguirre, Rolando Blackman, Jay Vincent and
Elston Turner out of the 1981 NBA Draft pool.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time, the Mavericks drafted power forward Etan Thomas,
shooting guard Courtney Alexander and power forward Donnell Harvey
in the first round and small forward Eduardo Najera in the second
round. Many national publications gave the Mavericks an `A' grade
for their choices.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the wave of quality veterans the Mavericks have
acquired in trades this summer, how much playing time the four
rookies receive this season remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our rookies,'' Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson said. ``But like any rookie, it takes time for rookies to
develop and understand what's going on. We like the skills of our
rookies, but I've got a good veteran team. I've got enough veteran
players where I don't have to worry about playing rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas comes into training camp Oct. 3 as a backup to Gary
Trent, while Alexander backs up Michael Finley and Hubert Davis.
Harvey is no better than third on the power-forward depth chart,
and Najera backs up Dirk Nowitzki at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Alexander and Harvey are in Los Angeles working out with
Mavericks developmental coach Kiki Vandeweghe.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has reason to be enthusiastic that the Mavericks were
able to trade for veterans Howard Eisley, Christian Laettner, Terry
Mills, Dana Barros and Bill Curley. He explained that those
additions allow him to bring his rookies along at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my team, and if (rookies) can help me, then I'm going
to play them,'' Nelson said. ``If not, then we'll develop them in
the practice setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson likened the Mavericks' situation to the Boston Celtics of
the 1960's, who used to have a nice mix of young and veteran
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deep at every position to where we have a lot of
talented good young players and veteran experienced players,'' he
said. ``By the time these veterans get too old, these rookies will
be ready to take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's similar to what Boston had when they had the Jones boys
(K.C. and Sam) backing up Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman. They had
these young guys step right in and they never missed a beat, and
that's kind of what we hope will happen to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rookies are able to help us win games, then I'm playing
them. We need to win and we need to get to the playoffs, so that's
what we're going to do.''  &LR; subheds:Spotlight returns With the
Rangers fading fast and the Cowboys' immediate future not looking
too bright, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hoping local fan
attention turns to his team.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the wheeling and dealing Cuban did over the
summer, the Mavericks have stayed in the national news since the
NBA Draft on June 28. That's certainly unheard of for a team that
was the NBA's worst during the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Cuban said. ``Dallas is really a basketball town.
We just needed to give them something to talk about and have some
fun doing it.''  &LR; subheds:Plenty of interest With the tremendous
amount of wealth he has accumulated, Mark Cuban was asked how much
interest does he earn on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' said Cuban, who earned $1.5 billion when he
sold his portion of Broadcast.com last summer. ``Maybe $200k if I
were to guess.''

PIERCE'S BID FOR ANOTHER GRAND SLAM WIN ENDS (For use by NYTimes

   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Mary Pierce's bid to win her second
Grand Slam event of the year ended Monday because of a shoulder
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, the French Open winner, was forced to withdraw because
of rotator-cuff irritation after dropping the first set against
Anke Huber, 4-6. The No. 4 seed called it quits after
double-faulting twice to give the set away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sore from the first serve I hit,'' Pierce said. ``With
each one, it just kept getting worse. I started compensating with
other areas and other muscles in my shoulder, and other things
started hurting. I didn't feel like I had control over my arm. I
hit a lot of double faults because I just couldn't control my arm
to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury gave the 10th-seeded Huber an excellent chance to
advance to the semifinals of a major for the first time since the
1998 Australian Open. Her quarterfinal opponent is unseeded Elena
Dementieva, who advanced with a three-set victory against Lilia
Osterloh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity, but I'd better not think about it,''
Huber said. ``If I think it's a good draw, and it's a good
opportunity, I won't put the ball in.'' Dokic gracious in defeat
Jelena Dokic had a chance to gain an early edge against Serena
Williams when she held a set point in the first-set tiebreaker, but
lost it when a backhand down the line that she thought was a winner
was called out.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic questioned the call and the crowd jeered, but there was no
overrule. She went on to lose the tiebreaker and the match.
</P>
<P>
   But Dokic graciously refused to blame the loss on the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``That linesperson was closer to it than I was, but it was very
close,'' she said. ``It could have gone either way. It was a very
close call at 6-5 in the tiebreaker. But it was something that was
called, and you have to go on to the next point. It was still
6-all. I still had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, on the other hand, professed ignorance when asked
about the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember getting a bad call in the tiebreak when the ball
was out,'' she said. ``Is that the one you're referring to? There
was a ball she hit that I was sure was out. You win some, you lose
some, and that's the way it is.'' Hingis unhappy with boyfriend
Martina Hingis was tempted to root against her boyfriend, Magnus
Norman, when the men's No. 3 seed fell behind Max Mirnyi by two
sets Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rain delays had backed up the schedule, and Hingis couldn't
begin her fourth-round match against Sandrine Testud until Norman
and Mirnyi were finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to win, but he was two sets down,'' Hingis said.
``In a way I was like, `Finish this match up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, though, came back to win in a long five-setter. Hingis
didn't get on the court until after 10 p.m. New York time, and
didn't get a chance to finish the match before more rains came.
Weather report After four consecutive days of rain delays, today's
schedule should proceed as planned. The weather forecast calls for
sunny, but windy, conditions, with a high of about 70.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's 70, as in 30-plus degrees cooler than in Texas.

WILLIAMS SISTERS ON COLLISION COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN WOMEN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ A United States Tennis Association
official provided confirmation of the ruling order of the women's
game Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the postmatch interview, Mary Pierce, the fourth seed at the
U.S. Open, was discussing the shoulder injury that forced her to
default her match to Anke Huber after dropping the first set.
Serena Williams was due in the room, and Pierce was about to
intrude on her time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to wait before,'' Pierce lamented. ``That's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Right or not, that's the way it is in women's tennis these days.
No one slows down the Williams sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams defeated Jelena Dokic, 7-6 (7), 6-0, Monday to
join older sister Venus in the quarterfinals and remain on a
collision course to meet in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four matches down, three to go,'' the defending champion said.
``I just hope to make it there. I think I have a great chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two women seem to have any kind of chance to prevent a
Williams family reunion Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Martina Hingis is one. She finished off Sandrine
Testud, 6-2, 6-1, in a completion of a match that was suspended
from Sunday night because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport is the other. The No. 2 seed defeated Justine
Henin, 6-0, 6-4, to advance to the quarterfinals against Serena
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis is on top of her game. She has lost only 10 games in her
four matches so far. Davenport is the only one of the Big Four to
drop a set in the tournament, but she's one of the few women with
the power to hit with the sisters and looked on top of her game in
beating Henin.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the sisters are seeded third (Venus) and fifth
(Serena).
</P>
<P>
   Seeds, though, mean little. The Williams sisters went into the
tournament as the players to beat, and nothing has happened in the
first eight days to change that perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus and I have definitely raised the bar in tennis,'' Serena
said. ``Everyone wants to beat a Williams sister now. We're the
ones to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Dokic looked as if she had a chance to do just that for a while,
holding two set points in the tiebreaker in the first set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams saved the first one with a forehand volley. She saved
the second when Dokic ripped a backhand down the line that was
called out. Williams cruised from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd won the first set, maybe I'd have won the match in two
sets,'' Dokic said. ``You get on a roll, and the pressure would be
on her because she's the defending champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not. Williams raised the level of her game in
the second set, making only two unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never give up,'' she said. ``If I had lost the tiebreak, I
would have come out even stronger in the second set. I tend to play
better when I'm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis didn't need to raise the level of her game against
Testud. She held a 6-2, 1-0 lead when play was halted Sunday and
made quick work of the No. 11 seed when play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis is hitting the ball harder than she ever has, because the
need to keep up with the Williamses forced her to add more power to
her all-court game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was like everything was slower; you had more time to
prepare for your shots, mix it up more, slow it down, make it
faster,'' Hingis said. ``Now you have to hit every ball as hard as
you can. There's no more time to play games.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. With the fast, powerful Williams sisters around,
everything is faster these days.
</P>
<P>
   Including postmatch interviews. nn

 NOTES-TEX 
CUNNINGHAM PROMISES TO BE READY (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram IRVING _ Backup quarterback Randall Cunningham didn't promise a
better performance if has to start in place of the injured Troy
Aikman against Cardinals on Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, he said there's no question that he will be better
prepared than when he took the field against Eagles two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always ready,'' Cunningham said Monday. ``As a backup, I
prepare myself like I'm going to play. The main thing that's going
to change is that I will get more reps in practice this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who is still learning the Cowboys' offense, took few
snaps with the first unit in practice the past three weeks partly
because of bursitis in his shoulder and partly because the Cowboys
were focused on getting Aikman ready.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham also downplayed the significance of the sprained
right thumb he suffered against the Eagles. Cunningham, who was
squeezing putty between his fingers in the locker room Monday to
strengthen the thumb, said there was little swelling on his thumb
and that it wouldn't limit him in practice or the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham also promised that he wouldn't limit his play as he
did at times against Eagles. With Aikman out and no other
quarterback on the roster, Cunningham said he played cautiously
because the team couldn't afford to lose him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave everything I had, but I had to be smart,'' Cunningham
said. ``I made sure I didn't hold on to the ball too long or take
too many hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have already made the decision to promote rookie
free agent Clint Stoerner from the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and coach Dave Campo said Stoerner
would replace the injured Joey Galloway on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys already have a fourth quarterback in the fold.
Second-year player Anthony Wright, who played with the Pittsburgh
Steelers last year, was signed to the practice squad last week. He
will practice with the team for the first time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said James McKnight is the leading candidate to replace
Galloway at receiver, although Wane McGarity will also be
considered.
Front seven blamed for run woes
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo blamed the team's inability to stop the run on poor
technique used by the defensive line and linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the defensive lineman not getting off blocks; it was
linebackers not filling where they were supposed to fill,'' Campo
said. ``We are a better front seven than we showed. We've got to
get back to the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said what was most disappointing is that the mistakes were
made by two units he had the most confidence in coming into the
season. However, he promised that the run woes will be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you that we will get back to the basics,'' Campo
said. ``As far as those young corners are concerned, I don't know
what's going to happen. But we are going to stop the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the team might go back to its old philosophy up
front, where the defensive lineman's first responsibility is to
hold up the offensive lineman to allow the linebackers to run and
make plays. Because the Cowboys were so confident in the ability of
their defensive line to dominate in 2000, they allowed them to be
more aggressive and charge across the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   That aggression led to 201 yards rushing for Eagles running back
Duce Staley.
Williams holdout hurt line Though tackle Erik Williams wasn't
primarily responsible for many of the offensive line breakdowns
against the Eagles, Dave Campo said that Williams' 28-day holdout
played a factor in their poor play.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offensive line was together for only one preseason
game. Guard Solomon Page, who had trouble with Eagles rookie tackle
Corey Simon, played tackle for the first four weeks of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something to be said about the fact that you like to
have all your people in training camp,'' Campo said.
``Communication is important up front. There were some
communication problems in the game. You can trace it to that. You
lose some communication when you move guys from spot to spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will also lose some in the wallet; he will be fined by
the league and the team after being ejected in fourth quarter for
punching an Eagles player in the kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him as soon as he came off the field,'' Campo
said. ``We will handle that.''

SAMPRAS SURVIVES TEST FROM QUALIFIER (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Andre Agassi, the No. 1 seed at the U.S.
Open, lost in the second round. No. 2 Gustavo Kuerten went out in
the first.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Et tu'', Pete Sampras?
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's fourth seed _ and only player left in the draw
that's widely recognized by casual fans _ faced triple-break point
in the sixth game of his fourth-round match Monday against unknown
opponent Hyung-Taik Lee.
</P>
<P>
   How unknown? The Korean native has been playing challenger
events all summer and had to win a qualifier just to get into the
Open. He's ranked No. 182 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a good idea to hide sharp objects from CBS
executives when he had the multiple break chances. Without Sampras,
they no doubt were envisioning a Sunday final that just might get
better ratings than a re-run of ``This Old House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, though, didn't fold under the pressure of being the
savior of the men's draw. He held serve and went on to a 7-6 (4),
6-2, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult playing someone I've never seen play,''
Sampras said. ``It's like a batter facing a pitcher he's never
seen. It takes you awhile to feel it out. He came out playing well.
He wasn't overwhelmed by the situation. But after winning the first
set I settled down and started playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has played well all tournament. He's the only man not to
lose a set, although he has gone to four tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for anyone who wants to see a big-name player
in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets have claimed Agassi, Kuerten, No. 5 seed Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, No. 8 Alex Corretja and No. 10 Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Moya beat Corretja in straight sets Sunday. Pioline lost
in straight sets against Todd Martin on Monday, although his
conqueror probably qualifies as a big name. The veteran American
played Agassi in the final last year.
</P>
<P>
   With so many seeds out, the Open has become a coming-out party
for talented but little-known players such as Marat Safin, Juan
Carlos Ferrero and Lleyton Hewitt, who played Thomas Enqvist in a
late match.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian, Spaniard and Australian players might be the
future of the game, in the present they don't have the name
recognition of Sampras. Not to mention the resume of the career
leader in Grand Slam singles titles.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a long way to go before the TV people and the
ticket holders for the final can breathe easy. Next up for Sampras
is the big-serving Richard Krajicek, who advanced with a
straight-set victory against Dominik Hrbaty, 7-6 (11), 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with my serve-and-volley game,'' Krajicek said.
``It's tough to break me. And my return game is good enough to keep
the ball in play and have a chance to break my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek has beaten Sampras six times in nine meetings, although
Sampras won in Cincinnati a couple of weeks before the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a match that's going to come down to a couple of
points,'' Sampras said. ``He's a great player, and when he's on
he's tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a matchup of two of the biggest servers in the game.
Krajicek set an Open record with 49 aces in losing to Kafelnikov in
the quarterfinals last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come down to the return of serve, who puts more
pressure on the second serve,'' Sampras said. ``It's not an easy
match. The court's playing quick, and it'll be tough to break. It
won't be an easy match.''
</P>
<P>
   Time to hide the sharp objects again.

TIME TO SAY GOODBYE: AIKMAN'S LIFE NOT WORTH RISK FROM CONCUSSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
IRVING _ Two thoughts for you, Troy Aikman, as your headaches
gradually grow lighter and the nausea slowly recedes this week; two
word pictures to keep in mind as you consider your future.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think about Eric Lindros, flopping on the ice like a fish in
last year's Stanley Cup playoffs. Think about how that made you
feel, how sickening it was to see him like that.
</P>
<P>
   And consider old friend Steve Young, still puking his guts out
months after he'd decided to quit football. Still fighting the
headaches, the dizziness, the nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go there. Please.
</P>
<P>
   You heard me say it last year, when you had back-to-back
concussions at Indianapolis and Minnesota, and you're still here,
but I'll say it again anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Quit.
</P>
<P>
   Walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's the hardest thing you'll ever do, it also will be
the best thing you'll ever do, because you'll be doing it for all
the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For your new bride.
</P>
<P>
   For the children you someday hope to have.
</P>
<P>
   For yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about the fans, or the media or even the Cowboys and
owner Jerry Jones. This is just about you, and no one is
presumptuous enough to think that it isn't totally your decision.
</P>
<P>
   But from this seat, the risk you'll be taking by continuing to
play just isn't worth it any more.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about courage or being macho. Anyone who has seen you
play has no question about your bravery or manhood. This is about
common sense. Leave, while you still have some.
</P>
<P>
   We sat there at Valley Ranch yesterday _ you'd already come and
gone _ and heard Jones tell us that ``Troy is day-to-day.'' He
talked about how mild this concussion is compared to the severity
of last year's injuries (which were initially terribly understated)
and how tests at the hospital left open the possibility that you
might play Sunday in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Then he also admitted he hadn't even bothered to ask you, when
the two of you spoke yesterday, how you were feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Who's kidding who, here?
</P>
<P>
   Don't do it. Don't even think about playing Sunday. For once,
it's time to ignore what that big heart of yours tells you to do
and be reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would personally share the logic,'' Jones said, ``that if
one week off is the thing to do, as opposed to any risk of him
being out knocked out for four or five games, then I would be the
first to not want him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Four or five games? What about the rest of your life, Troy?
That's what could be at stake here, and don't let Jones or anyone
else convince you otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think I'm sitting here pushing him on behalf of winning
a ballgame to get back out there, the answer is no,'' Jones
insisted. ``One of the really comforting things is that over the
last year Troy went to different experts, if you will, on
concussions, people who have not only treated and advised, but have
studied concussions, and he was assured, based upon anything he'd
had happen in the past, he'd had no long-term effects from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very comforting thing for him and for someone in my
shoes as well. But let me be clear about one thing: I'm not
interested in jeopardizing his long-term wellbeing or quality of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's reassuring, but the one thing you've learned, Troy, in
educating yourself about concussions, is that when doctors start
finding bad things in their tests, the damage has already been done
and cannot be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   That's what your friends are worried about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing about concussions is, it's not like looking at
an X-ray and saying, `Oh, it's broke. You can't play.' As it has
been explained to him, if something shows up on the MRI, that means
you already have dead \Rbrain\S tissue,'' deep-snapper Dale
Hellestrae said. ``You should have retired the concussion before.''
</P>
<P>
   Helly says you've often talked about quitting before that
happens. Now's the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, you're worried about the individual,'' Hellestrae said.
``You want him to be all right and you want his quality of life to
be good for the rest of his life. He's got a lot of years left and
hopefully kids, a new wife and all that, and you want him to be
able to enjoy that. That's your No. 1 concern. Football is
secondary when it comes to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, he's 33 years old and he knows that. He's
consulted with a bunch of specialists and he knows the risks, so
it's not like he's going into it naive. He's probably as educated
as you can be, and even then, there's some unknown, which is the
scary part. That's what makes this such a sticky situation.''
</P>
<P>
   So do you sit out one game? Two? Five? How many is enough? By
now you should know that there's no answer to that. There's never
enough. You've had three concussions in your past 10 games, at
least nine, and probably some that weren't counted, in your
football career.
</P>
<P>
   Which one is the one that turns a man into a vegetable? Fifteen?
Twenty?
</P>
<P>
   Ten?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he sits out five weeks and goes back,'' Hellestrae pointed
out, ``he can still get another concussion if he gets hit the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately,''the right way'' is obviously getting a lot
easier for tacklers. Take a look at Sunday's game film, if you have
the stomach for it. There were the four Eagles' sacks, of course,
but you were belted even when you got the pass off.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the last hit that did the damage? Or did it happen
earlier?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when it happened,'' center Mark Stepnoski said.
``Up until he left the game, he was no different in the huddle than
he always is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Troy, none of the hits looked particularly devastating;
none of the collisions were of the helmet-to-helmet variety that
causes us to wince and wonder if you're going to get up again.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, you've developed a ``glass'' head like a fighter who
has taken too many punches develops a glass jaw. He becomes easier
and easier to knock out. So have you.
</P>
<P>
   The message is all too clear: The brain just can't take it any
more.
</P>
<P>
   You've never been just about football, as much as people have
tried to paint you that way. You have a lot to offer the world away
from the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Take some time. Think this through. Talk to your family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for all the right reasons, walk away. nn

PIRATES END DODGERS WINNING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just in case the Dodgers were starting to think
wild September thoughts, along came Jimmy Anderson and the
Pittsburgh Pirates to humble them.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be the same Pirates who entered the game tied for
the worst record in baseball. The same Anderson, who in his past
six starts, couldn't get out Robert Daly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Pirates made like they were still family and
Anderson like a hot prospect, as they pushed the Dodgers around for
a 12-1 victory before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 31,418 to snap
their six-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort, who had won his last six decisions, struck out
19 in the 13 innings of his past two starts and hadn't lost since
June 29, was both ineffective and unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers offense was both scattered and poorly timed.
</P>
<P>
   Put them together, and a team that had won 11 of their past 14
games, was just another club for the 57-79 Pirates to punish Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything kind of went the wrong way tonight,'' Dodgers
catcher Todd Hundley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates scored their 12 runs on 13 hits, seven being charged
to Dreifort (10-8) over his 5 innings of work. That included two
home runs, including a second-inning grand slam to left-handed
Brian Giles _ a slicing drive that landed one row up the
right-field seats, about 335 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Giles was going to beat me, I was going to make it the
other way, and he did,'' Dreifort said.
</P>
<P>
   The third slam of Giles' career left the Pirates up 5-0,
although the Dodgers looked like a team just waiting to explode
against the left-handed Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   They left still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was 0-3 with a 6.12 ERA in his past five starts. Of
course, the last team he'd beaten was the Dodgers _ blanking them
in eight innings Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers did manage to score a run against Anderson (5-8) in
the bottom of the second, but even that was a labored effort. They
had runners thrown out at third and home, needing four singles _
including Hundley's RBI hit to scratch together their run.
</P>
<P>
   In 23 innings in three outings against Anderson this season,
that accounts for their lone run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had six hits in the first two innings, and just one run to
show for it,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a 5-1 game in the sixth when the Pirates started
embarrassing the Dodgers, scoring seven times against Dreifort,
Onan Masaoka and Matt Herges.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates batted around for the second time, after Dreifort
started the trouble by giving up a walk and a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort just didn't have real good command tonight,'' Johnson
said. ``He kept getting behind, threw a lot of pitches (112), and
then our bullpen didn't give him any help.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka didn't get any of his four batters out, walking two and
giving up two hits. Herges gave up two more hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama said there'd be days like this,'' Hundley said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only bright spot for the Dodgers was the major-league
debut of Luke Prokopec, the right-hander who was scheduled to join
the Australian Olympic team until called up by the Dodgers last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Prokopec threw three scoreless innings, allowing a pair of hits
and striking out two.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politics can sometimes turn brother against
brother.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Podesta, chief of staff at the White House, is trying to
enhance President Clinton's legacy by adding prescription drug
benefits to Medicare and by persuading Congress to enact a bill of
rights for patients.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Anthony T. Podesta, represents the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, lobbying
against the president's Medicare plan. In fact, Clinton complained
the other day, ``the pharmaceutical industry has unleashed a
shameless, scorched-earth campaign'' to block his plan.
</P>
<P>
   One of Tony Podesta's partners in his lobbying firm, which he
calls podesta.com, Jeffrey Ricchetti, represents the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association in the insurance industry's effort to kill
patients' rights legislation. But John Podesta has his own ally in
pushing the bill: his White House deputy, Steven J. Ricchetti,
Jeff's older brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medicis controlled everything,'' Tony Podesta said in an
interview, referring to the merchant family that ruled Renaissance
Florence. ``We have it split into two families.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Tony Podesta are two of the most influential people in
Washington, playing opposite sides of the fence that is supposed to
separate policy-making from special pleading. But their
relationship _ brothers, former business partners, spokesmen for
people who hold a large share of the power and money in America _
can be seen as emblematic of the way Washington works in the age of
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying is serious business, but the best of the breed do not
take it too seriously because they know that today's enemies may be
allies on another issue tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, 51, has served as staff secretary, scandal handler
and chief of staff in the Clinton White House. He is needle-thin,
intense, moody at times, but with a wicked sense of humor. He is an
aficionado of roller coasters, working in a White House that often
resembles one.
</P>
<P>
   When he was staff secretary, responsible for the flow of paper
to the Oval Office, Podesta was particularly annoyed by
intelligence bureaucrats who dressed up routine memorandums with
``top secret'' designations to get the president's attention. When
the CIA or the National Security Council submitted a classified
report that Podesta had already seen on CNN, he stamped it
``EMBARRASSING'' in big green letters before sending it to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta, 56, a big, barrel-chested man, is more flamboyant
than his brother. He collects funky contemporary art and wears a
tie only when he has to. Like his brother, he is full of kinetic
energy. ``They're cranked up all the time,'' said their 82-year-old
mother, Mary K. Podesta, who lives here.
</P>
<P>
   The company now known as podesta.com was founded by the Podesta
brothers in 1988. For the first few years, the lobbyists were all
Democrats, but since 1991, the company has become more bipartisan.
Of the 30 professional employees, a third are now Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists include people who have worked for Democrats like
Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut; for Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House
Democratic whip; and for the AFL-CIO and the United Mine Workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the lobbying corps at podesta.com also includes people who
have worked for Republicans like Newt Gingrich, the former speaker;
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader; Rep. J.C.
Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Republican
Conference; and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another podesta.com associate is Heather Barbour, daughter of
the former chairman of the Republican Party and adviser to Gov.
George W. Bush, Haley Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta insists he never calls his brother or Steve
Ricchetti to obtain favors for clients, which include biotechnology
companies and drug companies like Eli Lilly and Novartis, as well
as Dow Chemical, Viacom, CBS, General Electric, Time Warner and the
Motion Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But his clients say he has opened doors for them elsewhere in
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta is a facilitator, a broker, a translator, who helps
businesses understand the ways of Washington. As a liberal
Democrat, he intuitively understands how Clinton administration
officials are thinking. Clients say they value his insights and use
him to send messages to the White House and Democrats in Congress.
Podesta said his company had billings of $8.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a civil liberties group, said: ``Tony is a political
operator, a political networker, with tremendous reach. There are
many connections between the White House and his firm, that's
clear. They know how to keep those lines separated, but it's a
high-wire act.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although clients or potential clients might hope that Tony
Podesta offers entree to the White House, the Podestas say they
never talk policy. It would be wrong ethically and suicidal
politically, they say. ``He doesn't lobby me, I don't lobby him,''
John Podesta says.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime client called Tony Podesta not too long ago and asked
him to contact his brother on a policy matter of concern to his
employer, a big media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said no,'' the client said, insisting he not be identified
for fear of alienating one of the Podesta brothers. ``I said, `Come
on, call him.' He said no. I said, `Tony, no one's been with you
longer than me _ call him.' He said no; he just wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary B. Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association
of America and a podesta.com client, said she had never known Tony
Podesta to lean on his brother on behalf of a client. ``It would be
stupid, and Tony's not stupid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, other lobbyists, competitors of Tony Podesta's company,
said the relationship had helped generate business and had given
Tony Podesta added clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, when you're an assistant secretary of something
and you have a bunch of phone calls after lunch and one has
Podesta's name on it, that slip gets to the top of the stack pretty
quick,'' said one competitor, a prominent Republican lobbyist.
``You know it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ricchetti, 43, has spun through the revolving door several
times. He headed the political department of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association from 1987 to 1989 and led the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee from 1990 to 1992. He worked in the
Clinton White House as the top Senate lobbyist from 1993 to 1996
and returned to the private sector to lobby for corporate clients
before going back to the White House in September 1998. Steve
Ricchetti's chief assignment in late 1998 was to keep Congressional
Democrats from voting to impeach or convict the president. In
January 1999, he became deputy chief of staff, with many additional
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Following in his brother's footsteps, Jeff Ricchetti worked at
Blue Cross and Blue Shield, as director of Congressional relations
from 1993 to 1996. The Ricchetti brothers, who grew up in
Cleveland, created a lobbying firm here in 1998. They sold it to
podesta.com early last year, after Steve went back to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ricchetti, 40, said he provided ``the full gamut of
lobbying on behalf of Blue Cross and Blue Shield.'' As a senior
strategist at podesta.com, he follows every twitch of activity on
legislation to define patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   William A. Pierce, a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield,
said: ``In the patients' bill of rights debate, we do not support
passage of any federal legislation. We oppose all the legislation
in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which provide managed health
care for 53 million people, are particularly opposed to giving
patients any new right to sue their health plans. Clinton says that
right is essential. But Pierce said it would be ``bad for consumers
because it would increase costs without solving the patients'
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta.com boasts of its ability to build coalitions uniting
Republicans and Democrats, corporations and consumer groups, and
competing companies in the same industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta has enhanced his lobbying power by raising money
for politicians including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta refers to his fund-raising operation, built around
fine meals at his northwest Washington home, as the ``Pesto PAC.''
His mother, Mary Podesta, cooks Italian food for guests at these
political dinners. ``I'm the pesto lady,'' Podesta said in an
interview. ``The funny part is, I'm Greek.''

   SCI-CAVE-VISITORS (Benson, Ariz.) - Take a sopping wet

entrance with heavy steel doors to keep out the hot desert air, a
misting system to keep the cavern damp and lights to show off a
wonderland of spires, flowstone, soda straws and other
phantasmagorical cave formations. Then add a human being who, in a
one-hour visit, sloughs off some 60,000 skin fragments, 160 million
dust particles, 20,000 clothing-lint particles, 25 quarts of carbon
dioxide gas and 170 watts of body heat. Multiply this by 183,000
visitors to the cave each year. The result is an ad hoc experiment
now under way at Kartchner Caverns near Benson, Ariz., to learn if
it is possible to bring thousands of people into the fragile

   SCI-RACE-RECOGNITION (Undated) _ After a decade of mapping
brains in tasks like recalling numbers, perceiving facial
expressions and using verbs, neuroscientists have recently honed in
on a much more controversial subject: The act of categorizing other
human beings. In recently published papers, two separate teams of
brain scanners joined by social psychologists describe how one
particular part of the brain becomes more active when people look
at members of a different race. By David Berreby.

   SCI-MENOPAUSE (Undated) _ For many menopausal women, the
question of whether to take hormones is one of the most crucial
health decisions of their middle years _ and one of the most
confusing. Hormone use relieves the hot flashes and night sweats
that plague many women during menopause, and protects against
brittle bones. But does it help prevent heart disease, as
researchers have long believed _ or could it actually increase the
risk, as at least one new piece of data seems to suggest? In a
package of six stories, women discuss the ways they approach the
therapy and their frustrations with unanswered questions.

   _ In recent months, researchers have pointed to possible signals
of Alzheimer's disease that could allow doctors to detect the
ailment before symptoms start. They have spoken of small areas of
the brain that appear to shrink, and psychological tests that yield
subtle clues. Now scientists think they may have found another
clue: smell.
</P>
<P>
   _ With the rate of Caesarean sections on the rise, a leading
group of obstetricians has issued guidelines that may reduce the
number of operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who want to start exercise programs but feel they don't
have enough time or energy to begin should think again. A new study
suggests that physical activity that lasts just 15 minutes, if done
often enough, may be as beneficial as longer workouts. The report
appeared last week in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feeling sick to one's stomach may have more to do with the
brain the stomach. Researchers at Ohio State University say they
may have uncovered the reason that, often, people feel nauseated,
even though what ails them has nothing to do with their digestive
tracks. The culprit may be a brain chemical called tumor necrosis
factor, or TNF, which the immune system releases at the first sign
that the body is coming under attack.

DOKIC'S FORTRESS CANNOT WITHSTAND SERENA WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jelena Dokic built a fortress these past six days,
shutting out her unruly father's ejection from the U.S. Open and
then dealing with its lonely consequences by striking the ball
without forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old Dokic seemed to gather strength in solitude
while her father and coach, Damir, stayed at his Manhattan hotel.
He was still there Monday when she ran smack into the strongest
player in the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   Under the broiling sun in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Dokic matched
Serena Williams' blistering power with her own in their
fourth-round tug-of-war. And then, in one tantalizing and telling
moment, having come back to take a 6-5 lead in the first-set tie
breaker against the defending U.S. Open champion, Dokic struck a
crosscourt backhand down the line.
</P>
<P>
   The ball, which on television replays appeared to have caught
the outside of the line, was called out. Dokic mildly protested,
but she would never be the same, her stone resolve crumbling. She
had one more set point, at 7-6, yet Williams fought that third one
off as well to win the tie breaker, 9-7, and then ripped through
Dokic's shell in the second set for a 7-6 (7), 6-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's what turned the whole set around, the whole
match,'' Dokic said later about the point at 6-5. That point,
though, was just the first pull.
</P>
<P>
   When she lost the first set, that unraveled her for the rest of
the match, as she started the second set completely dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's always hard to come out, especially after you
lost the first set,'' Dokic said. ``Maybe you feel like it's
slipping away a little bit when you did have a chance. If I was in
the situation again, maybe I would have won the set, would have
been a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her turbulent and enigmatic story ends, for now, at the
fourth round of the Open, an understandable exit for a player
ranked No. 43 against the world's sixth-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic reached the semifinals at Wimbledon by turning aside yet
another embarrassing public incident from her father, who was
escorted off the grounds for a day when he crushed a reporter's
cell phone and started yelling about the queen.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Australian Open, Damir Dokic got into a scuffle with
an Australian television crew off the grounds, and in the summer of
1999 he was ejected from a tournament in England for drunken and
disorderly behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Tennis Association Tour is investigating Damir
Dokic's pattern of verbal abuse, and could elect next week to ban
him from the tour as his daughter's coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the decision is, I'm just going to have to deal with
it when it comes to that,'' Jelena Dokic said, and then repeated
another familiar refrain she has used since last Wednesday, when
her father sparked an ugly confrontation over a $12.50 piece of
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to block things out,'' Dokic said. ``You've got to
go out on the court. You know, you've got to be able to just play
the game whether something's happening or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Williams' father and coach, Richard, watched the match
from the players' box in the stadium, Dokic was without any visible
support. Against players ranked below her, she could support
herself well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whether anybody is around or not, I played well in the
two previous matches,'' she said. ``You know, it's different
playing Serena. You've got to lift your level up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, her biceps and quadriceps bulging from her black and
lilac frock, struck 10 of her personal-best 14 aces in the first
set. But her power was also inconsistent; she had 24 unforced
errors in the first set, nerves gripping her. ``I did not move up
to the ball,'' Williams said. ``I was playing too cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   That was until she realized she was about to lose the set. She
raced to a 4-1 lead in the tie breaker and seemed to relax as Dokic
ripped five straight points to give herself two set points;
Williams was not ready to concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real fighter,'' Williams said. ``At that point when I
was down, 6-4, in the tie break, I was thinking, `Well, all I have
to do is get the ball back in play and make her play.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by 6-5, Dokic was locked in her strategy of attacking
Williams, going for every shot, when the lines official called her
backhand out. Dokic approached the chair umpire on the changeover,
but the umpire let the call stand.
</P>
<P>
   But after Williams tied the score, Dokic hit a forehand that was
called in, and this time, Williams did not agree. ``You win some,
you lose some,'' Williams said. ``That's just how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if she would have lost that tie breaker, Williams said
she would not have been as deflated as her opponent. ``I would have
come out even stronger in the second set because I tend to play a
little better when I'm down,'' she said. Williams has not lost a
set yet this tournament and is 13-1 in her three years at the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it could have been a tougher match,'' Dokic admitted.
``That's where experience comes into play. The more you play, the
more experienced you are. Maybe that set would have been the other
way.''

LAWSUIT A BACK-ALLEY ATTACK ON NATIONAL MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has written about public lands issues
for over a decade and is respected for his insight into these
issues. His e-mail address is levendos(at)trib.com.) 
By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The oil, gas and minerals industries are attempting another
strategy to abolish national monuments so they can drill and mine
on the public's land. This latest attempt is a legal shell game.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF) out of
Denver filed a lawsuit in the federal district court of the
District of Columbia against President Clinton. The lawsuit
contends that Clinton does not have the constitutional authority to
create national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   So close to the presidential elections, the lawsuit's timing is
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the members of Mountain
States Legal Foundation _ read that as Texaco, Exxon, Chevron and
other mineral industry donors _ and members of the Blue Ribbon
Coalition who want to drive their off-road vehicles on land now
protected by national monument status.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit challenges five of the most recent national
monuments that Clinton created: Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument
in Oregon, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument in Colorado,
Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington, Ironwood Forest
National Monument in Arizona and Grand Canyon Parashant National
Monument in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The MSLF admits in its lawsuit that members of MSLF ``have
concrete plans for the future to use, each of the five areas at
issue in this complaint for a variety of purposes including, but
not limited to: prospecting for minerals, exploring for and mining
for ore bodies, exploring for and drilling for oil and gas
deposits....''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is so sweeping and general, it might as well have
challenged the creation of all 110 national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   It repeats in simplistic terms that President Clinton has
violated the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article IV,
Section 3, Paragraph 2): ``The Congress shall have the power to
dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting
the territory or other property belonging to the United States...''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that Clinton violated the Property Clause of
the Constitution ``because he thereby disposed of, reserved, and
made various rules and regulations respecting property belonging to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Not once does the lawsuit acknowledge or even mention the
Antiquities Act of 1906. The Antiquities Act specifically gives the
president the authority to reserve federal lands and put them under
the management of public lands agencies created by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can and has given the executive branch certain
authority over public lands. The Antiquities Act is one of those
delegations of power granted to the president by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Antiquities Act an unconstitutional delegation of
authority? That seems to be the unasked, invisible question in this
simple-minded lawsuit that MSLF has filed in its original
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiquities Act is constitutional if Congress inserted into
the act guidelines specific enough, so that it is Congress making
the public policy and the president merely implementing that policy
when he creates national monuments. The guidelines are there. The
fundamental policy is made by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress has the power of the purse so that it can refuse to
fund any national monument. Congress can also, by a vote of a
majority in both Houses, abolish any national monument.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has no problem with the constitutionality
of the Antiquities Act. In Cameron v. U.S. (1920), Wyoming's only
U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Willis Van Devanter, delivered the
opinion of the court and upheld the national monument status of the
Grand Canyon against mining claims. Theodore Roosevelt created the
Grand Canyon National Monument in 1908. Congress later turned it
into a national park.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a decision in federal courts where the
president's authority under the Antiquities Act has been denied.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice will undoubtedly respond with a
request for summary judgment to dismiss the case based upon the
authority given to the president under the Antiquities Act to
create national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the shell game: The challenge was never really about
violating the Property Clause of the Constitution; it's about how
to undo national monuments through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   After the Justice Department's response, we can expect MSLF to
file an amended complaint that spells out more specific allegations
as to how the president violated the terms of the Antiquities Act
in creating the five recent national monuments. The litigation will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the timing. Presidential elections are held in two
months. This case could very well be a calculated move to keep a
challenge to these national monuments in court until after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The president is named as a defendant in the case. So if George
W. Bush is elected president and the case is still in a federal
court, the new president, Bush, could simply settle the matter out
of court by abolishing the challenged five national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario would be a back-alley attack on the authority
that Congress has granted presidents since 1906.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, the president's power under the Antiquities
Act would be gutted. Other national monuments could be challenged
in federal courts and then settled in favor of the minerals
industries. All our national monuments would be at risk. For what?
For mining. For oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there must be room for the minerals industries, for
drilling and mining _ elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of balance, there also must be room in our nation
for the grand vistas, scientific and cultural sites, landscapes and
special wilderness areas that are protected by national monuments.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The Olympics: a moment, just a moment
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not widely known, but Andy Warhol amended his famous '60s
prediction that in the future everyone will be famous for 15
minutes. In 1979, saying he was bored with the old line, Warhol
modified it to read: ``In 15 minutes, everybody will be famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it won't really happen in 15 minutes. More like a week or
so.
</P>
<P>
   As we edge closer to the Sydney Olympics _ curtain up on Sept.
15 _ untold unfamous people will become famous. Today they are just
vague names splashed across a sports page. Three weeks from now,
they will be household names _ people who, bundling Warhol's two
assertions, will be famous in 15 minutes, for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, a headline running across the bottom of a
sports page caught my eye. It said that Greene and Jones sparkled
in sprints in preparation for Sydney. I wondered: Do I know that
Greene and that Jones?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't. But I will. Soon.
</P>
<P>
   And, another story informed me, Lindland will replace Sieracki
on the U.S. Greco-Roman squad. This bothered me because I never got
to know who Sieracki was before he was gone _ and ordered gone by a
federal judge, no less!
</P>
<P>
   I guess I could delve into the reason the issue was before a
federal judge and not a coach, but there's little time to waste on
that. There are too many people about to be famous, why spend time
on those who won't?
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are a fascinating spectacle. There's hardly a one
of us who has followed something as remote as luge competition
(yes, I know, it's a winter sport), yet every four years we sit
transfixed watching one or two foolhardy types on sleds _ on their
backs, crotch forward! _ plunging down a shaft of ice at God-knows
how many miles an hour. Who was that guy? Hackl of Germany. Oh.
</P>
<P>
   For just a few days, we marvel at a Japanese gymnast, his ankle
broken, twirling on what are called rings. We even get to know his
unpronounceable name, for just a while. And we are led to believe
we know something about ``rings.'' Enough, I daresay, to
second-guess the judges.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, whatever happened to those contemptuous, plump
judges from the old East Germany who always gave Western athletes
low scores? Were they tried and convicted of something? I hope so.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon, we not only will be admiring svelte young people in skin
tight swimsuits, alien-looking goggles and abhorrent latex head
caps, but we will be wondering what it is, after years and years of
rigid training, makes a person one one-hundredth of a second
swifter than another after 100 meters of swimming.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, we will start to understand the difference between
meters and yards _ but forget it after 15 minutes!
</P>
<P>
   We will admire the continuing growth of female athletes as they
race around the track at seemingly phenomenal speeds. We don't know
them now, but we will know their names then. To most of us, their
names will disappear unless one is so phenomenal that her visage
and name adorn a Wheaties box for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is meant to imply that the Olympics is minimal, or
that the athletes who appear in them are anything less than
physically superior to our alarmingly obese society.
</P>
<P>
   What puzzles me is not them, but us. We never heard of them
before, loved them for their symbolic 15 minutes, and _ with the
closing ceremonies _ returned to what we were doing never so much
as recalling who they were when they were.
</P>
<P>
   How often does a Jesse Owens come along, a Jim Thorpe, a
Florence Griffith-Joyner? For just a relative few, a gold medal
will have made it well worth their short-lived metamorphosis from
anonymity.

PATRIOTS WON'T BE HOLDING THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Sale Isaia may not be the answer but he's
the solution for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the oft-injured Isaia may not be what it takes
or have what it takes to fix the problems along the Patriots'
offensive line, but for this week at least he's the only solution
they've got, so expect to see him at guard most of the game Monday
night against the Jets when the Patriots face a far less formidable
defensive front than the one from Tampa that dismembered them
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Isaia is a four-year veteran who started out under Bill
Belichick when both were in Cleveland, but he's spent half his NFL
career on injured reserve and was one of the last cuts of the
Oakland Raiders a week ago, neither of which is an overwhelming
resume item. But at least the latter explains why he wasn't used
more Sunday after the Tampa game began to resemble a jail break
every time Drew Bledsoe dropped back to pass.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in Foxborough for less than 10 days and didn't have
down all the pass protection schemes and other mental requirements
of the job, so Belichick used him sparingly, alternating him with
versatile Jason Andersen after Max Lane was undressed by Warren
Sapp on three straight series.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was not willing to reveal what he is going to do about
his offensive line against the Jets except to say he had yet to
settle on five guys, which means (A) he will continue to rotate
players at least some of the time, especially from the shotgun,
when Andersen goes to center and Damien Woody to guard; and (B) he
doesn't have five guys he knows he can rely on for very long. At
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the best people you can put out there,''
Belichick said. ``As soon as you know, you make the moves. Once you
know, it's easy to do it and be strong with it and go forward. But
you don't want to make a hard decision and then in a short time
make another hard decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation? I've got more problems than I've got solid starting
linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, too many of those problems Sunday came not from the new
faces in front of Bledsoe but from the old ones like Lane and
tackle Bruce Armstrong, who struggled in his first real test of the
knee he tore apart last season playing eight weeks in silence with
a torn ACL.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Armstrong and a running back seemed to be confused over
whom to block. Both times Armstrong ended up blocking the safety
while the back ended up whiffing on a defensive lineman. It is
unlikely many pass protection schemes are designed to match a
tackle on a safety and a back on a defensive end. Belichick would
not single out Armstrong, but a source inside the organization
conceded, ``It was our veterans who gave us the most problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Belichick would come to singling out anyone was when
he spoke of mental errors in pass protection, alluding to the
Armstrong/running back mixups that resulted in Bledsoe getting
pounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times we knew what to do and then didn't do it,''
Belichick said. ``Twice in the game people came loose from the back
side (of Bledsoe, his left) and hit him in the back. Those weren't
physical problems. They have good, physical players up front, but
we created problems for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems have to be solved, and a six-time Pro Bowl tackle
will surely not repeat his, but pointing out the problems is far
easier for critics than solving them will be for Belichick. Isaia
may help, but he is but one guard on a line that at the moment
seems solid only at center when Woody is in there.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Grant Williams actually played well against a
difficult pass rusher in Chidi Ahanotu, left guard Derrick Fletcher
played like what he is _ an inexperienced big man _ and Andersen
played better than what he is, a seventh-round draft choice from
1998. That's why Andersen played so often and why when the Patriots
go to the shotgun he moves in at center and Woody shifts to guard.
Of course, if Woody weren't wilder than Steve Blass when asked to
make the shotgun snap, that shift wouldn't be in vogue, so don't
make more of that than it is.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone looking for a big personnel shakeup Monday night in
front of Bledsoe or a shift to playing the same five offensive
linemen from opening whistle to final gun can forget it. For now,
the solution to six sacks and 14 knockdowns is Sale Isaia.

CITY ZIP HITS A TRIPLE AT SARATOGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In horse racing, a tie counts as a win. That's an important
distinction that allowed City Zip's name to be inscribed on a very
important page in the Saratoga record book.
</P>
<P>
   When City Zip rallied to gain a dead heat with Yonaguska in the
$200,000 Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga Saturday, he joined Regret
(1914), Campfire (1916), and Dehere (1993) as the only horses to
sweep all three of the major 2-year-old stakes at The Spa (the
Sanford, the Saratoga Special, and the Hopeful). Regret went on to
become the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby, while Dehere was
2-year-old champion.
</P>
<P>
   Because both of his front knees had been operated on for
ligament problems, City Zip cost only $9,000 when purchased as a
yearling by owner Carl Bowling. His sire, Carson City, was strictly
a sprinter, but City Zip is making hay while the races are short,
and he has now won 5 of 8 starts (8-5-2-1) for trainer Linda Rice,
who enjoys an excellent reputation for her handling of juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Both Yonaguska, who cost nearly $2 million as a yearling and is
trained by D. Wayne Lukas for owner Michael Tabor, and City Zip had
excuses to lose the 7-furlong Hopeful, but each overcame trouble to
hit the wire together, ahead of nine rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Hopeful, a thunderstorm was threatening Saratoga,
so the horses went directly to the gate without a post parade and
were sent off three minutes ahead of the scheduled 5:22 p.m. post.
City Zip stalked Yonaguska through the early running, but suddenly
dropped back nearing the far turn. His rider, Jose Santos, said
City Zip had been frightened by lightning around the area before
and during the race. But City Zip, the 7-5 choice, got back in gear
and made a rippling, five-wide run to catch 7-2 shot Yonaguska, who
had opened up a 1 1/2-length lead past the eighth-pole, right on
the line in the time of 1:24 2/5 over a track that was still fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overcame a lot to win this,'' said Santos. ``We started
making our run around the turn, and there was no room on the
inside. But he came with a huge run down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey insisted that Yonaguska, a son of Cherokee Run, would
have won had the saddle not slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the backstretch, the saddle started to ride up on his
neck, and I lost a lot of leverage,'' he said. ``My plan was to
angle him out once we got to the stretch, but I had to keep him on
the rail becaue I didn't want to move with him. I don't think he
was on the best part of the track, and he still ran a great race.
He'll only get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Macho Uno, who finished third at 9-1, closed between horses and
was beaten only a neck. He also had an eventful trip, and the son
of Holy Bull, who was making only his second start after breaking
his maiden in his debut, may have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the gate, he reared his head up and hit me in the nose,''
said Edgar Prado, who rode Macho Uno for owner Frank Stronach and
trainer Joe Orseno. ``He gave me a bloody nose, but I was fine. At
the top of the stretch, he started ducking in and was goofing
around. He started picking it up again when City Zip came on the
outside. He ran a big race.''
</P>
<P>
   City Zip took the Sanford July 27 by better than 3 lengths, and
the Saratoga Special by better than 2 Aug. 16. In the Sanford, he
handed Yonaguska (4-3-1-0), who did not contest the Saratoga
Special, his only defeat. Yonaguska had beaten City Zip in the
Flash Stakes at Belmont June 9, so their head-to-head rivalry
stands at one win each, with a tie. It will be interesting to
follow these two colts as they head toward the $1 million Breeders'
Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Juvenile is run at a mile and one-16th, and at that
distance, it may turn out that Macho Uno is the one to watch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Surf' is up
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surfside, a top 3-year-old filly who was considered a Kentucky
Derby candidate before being injured, zipped 5 furlongs over the
Oklahoma training track at Saratoga Saturday in 1:01 under Pat Day,
as she continues her comeback bid under the eye of Lukas. A
daughter of Seattle Slew, Surfside, who had won four Grade I races,
chipped both front ankles, and has not raced since finishing fifth
in the Santa Anita Derby April 8. ``We're still debating about
where we should send her after Saratoga,'' said Lukas. ``I'd like
to get her one start before the Breeders' Cup.'' . . . Also on the
comeback trail is Mighty, a late-runner who has not competed since
injuring his right front knee while running seventh in the Blue
Grass at Keeneland April 15. Mighty, who won the Louisiana Derby,
went a half-mile in :49 1/5 over the Oklahoma surface Saturday.
``He's really coming back to himself,'' said James Jones, assistant
to trainer Frank Brothers. ``He's getting fitter and stronger.''
Mighty's connections hope he can make the Jerome Handicap at
Belmont Sept. 23 . . . A reminder that, for this week only,
Rockingham Park will be dark to live racing Wednesday but run a
live card Thursday.

SOFTWARE: DO IT YOURSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe every business needs a hook, but that doesn't mean every
business plan must be unique.
</P>
<P>
   For entrepreneurs who freeze up at the keyboard, a California
company has begun selling a $100 software package to help aspiring
capitalists generate business plans quickly using a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Nova Development Corp.'s ``Business Plan Writer Deluxe,''
package mostly consists of suggested charts and graphics to use to
impress lenders with goals like turning a pretax profit or
acquiring a certain number of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``describe your business'' section, containing
a slew of ``professionally-written text examples,'' or business
plans to crib from. According to the company's packaging, the
examples ``can often be used without modification.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the plan for a ``Used Car Business'' outlines a
marketing and sales strategy, a paragraph of suggested financial
considerations, and suggestions for management-team
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   One example: ``The number-one responsibility of our management
team is to create a friendly atmosphere where our customers come
first. They will always be courteously acknowledged with a friendly
smile and a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there something unseemly in admitting a business plans
could rely on so much boilerplate?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people starting businesses just don't write well, or
might need some assistance'' said Nova spokeswoman Teri Bruno.
Closely-held Nova, of Calabasas, Calif. bought competitor PlanWrite
last February for an undisclosed amount. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Adero Inc. has announced an alliance with with Inktomi Corp. and
America Online Inc. called ``Content Bridge,'' designed to enable
companies to track exactly who's viewing their Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Adero, of Charlestown, Mass., says its software deployed as part
of the alliance will make it easier for Web-site operators to
figure out exactly which users are accessing their content _ and
bill them.
</P>
<P>
   Currently much content is distributed off the Internet backbone
systems operated of Internet service provider comapnies like AOL
and PSINet. But as Adero chief executive Jonathan Crane points out,
the relationship means there can be ``no real economic
collaboration between the content provider and the cache,'' or the
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   With the software, content providers can pay a fee, or be paid,
when their content is called up, thus making it easier to structure
advertising deals, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded two years ago, Adero now has about 250 employees and
counts Fidelity Investments as a chief backer. It recently received
a $72 million investment from Intel, Microsoft, and Mitsubishi. The
company sees itself as a competitor to Akamai Technologies of
Cambridge, and plans to move to a new headquarters in Waltham
soon. &QL;

   WebCT of Peabody, Mass. plans to announce that Thomson Corp. is
taking a majority stake in its online educational site,
www.webct.com. Last month the two companies had announced an
alliance whereby WebCT's coursework-administration package could be
used by teachers to assign material from Thomson's Course
Technology unit. Thomson's latest funding will bring the total
amount invested in WebCT (the CT stands for Course Tools) to $110
million.
</P>
<P>
   WebCT, which employs 173 people in Peabody, describes itself as
the ``leading provider of Web-based course tools, community,
content, and commerce to the higher education marketplace.'' Its
offerings don't always seem so serious, however; users with
RealPlayer software can download videos of a chemistry teacher
known for burning candy Gummi Bears on ``The Late Show with David
Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Learning, in Stamford, Conn., a unit of Thomson Corp.,
distributes educational material to students both in high school
and colleges, and for adult-education courses. Materials related to
oceanography, psychology, and engineering will be among the first
Thomson offerings on the site.
</P>
<P>
   WebCT's largest investor is CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass. The
company licenses out its content to students and faculty at rates
of up to $12,000 a year. The company originated with a 1995 grant
by the Univeristy of British Columbia to develop course-related
tools for the Web. &QL;

 WESTWOOD, Mass.: ... be different.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seppy Basili is hunched over his desk on a Tuesday morning,
inside a modest office with no door. His is the first cubby one
finds upon entering LearningBrands.com through the wrong, unsigned
door _ the lunchroom door, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   He comes out with a smile, still a little bewildered at the
cavernous new space that puts a good 20 feet between him and the
employees he used to rub elbows with.
</P>
<P>
   He raises his arms wide and looks across the 10,000 square feet
of the new Norwood facility. This office is quiet. You can't hear
voices over the muted whir of a ventilation system. Employees are
still working at the same butcherblock desks, but they've got ample
space now.
</P>
<P>
   The color scheme is similar to the old office, cheerful red,
yellow, and blue walls. The floor is cinderblock, with carpet only
under clusters of desks. Several thick, black coils hang from the
ceiling, with electrical outlet boxes suspended several inches from
the floor _ an inexpensive alternative to rewiring the whole place.
</P>
<P>
   Basili points about 40 feet away, to the row of offices where
Henderson and Nick Vennaro, the chief operating officer and
technology guru, sit. They decided not to put all the top
executives' offices on the same wall, he says, to avoid creating a
traditional ``corridor of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the company's mantra, he says, ``We don't believe in a
hierarchy of ideas.'' But, he concedes, ``In reality, there is a
hierarchy of management.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Basili and Henderson walk across the room many times a day
to talk. They can't shout to each other. ``At first it was weird,''
Henderson says. ``I'd find myself calling him on the phone. Then
I'd think, `What am I doing?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meetings are more deliberate now, Basili says. People don't just
stop by and constantly interrupt him or Henderson. On the other
hand, their offices have no doors, to preserve a sense of openness.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder how soon they'll have to hire a human resources
director. They consider that the death knell, the sign they've gone
corporate.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the bigger space, the founders say, is a bit more
privacy. It was literally impossible to have a private meeting in
Westwood. ``You had to take a walk in the parking lot,'' Henderson
says.
</P>
<P>
   And it's much easier to get writing done now, both founders say.
``Before, I either had to write before seven in the morning or
after 10 at night,'' Henderson says.
</P>
<P>
   There is a receptionist's desk now but no one to fill the job
yet. There is even a game corner, in keeping with the start-up
culture. The air hockey table is assembled and there's a
mini-basketball net on the wall. Still no foosball. For one thing,
it's expensive. For another, it's a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   The blue plastic blue couch, plus two matching chairs, is still
the only common furniture in the place. Some boxes in the
conference room offer a glimpse of things to come: new filing
cabinets. And leopardskin pillows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to spend money on people, on growing the business, not
on our space,'' Henderson says. ``We'll earn the luxuries a little
bit at a time.''

<P>
   WESTWOOD, Mass. _ The mirrored office building seems surreal,
plunked at the end of a dusty suburban industrial park. A blinding
July sun gleams off its 1960s facade. Two middle-aged workers smoke
cigarettes on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby is empty. There's no exposed brick, no funky dot-com
signage, no trace of hip Web marketing gurus. Except for an
inflatable blue couch.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, that's the conference room ``annex'' for
LearningBrands.com, which has used up every last inch of its space
in this Westwood office. Some 50 employees are crammed,
elbow-to-elbow, into desks fashioned from long butcherblock slabs.
The walls are bright red, the ceiling high. The room buzzes with
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere in January, our board said, `Go. Go fast,' '' says
Ted Henderson, 33, chief executive and cofounder of LearningBrands.
So the company lurched into high gear, building Web systems, hiring
designers, and wooing clients.
</P>
<P>
   They went slowly in one thing only _ spending money _ to avoid
the cash burn that's derailed many start-ups in recent months. That
may seem elementary, but the LearningBrands experience offers a
glimpse into the daunting process of growing a real company. It's a
process that goes beyond whiz-bang technology and forces
entrepreneurs to mull matters of culture and physical work space.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a former advertising executive turned ``e-learning''
zealot, sits at a plain brown table, in spitting distance of his
partner and head of content, Seppy Basili, and just a few feet from
the rest of the troops. There are no offices or doors, not even a
cubicle. The space is too crowded for foosball; a dismantled air
hockey table leans on its end, against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't spend a lot of money,'' Henderson says. ``Fifteen
dollars a square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want to shell out the $60 a square foot landlords are
fetching for chic Cambridge digs. Henderson instead rented a tiny
room in the back of the mirrored building, where he and his
partners set up shop for their first month, with a couple of cheap
folding tables and cable spools for chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taking it one step at a time,'' says Terry Conroy,
the building's owner and a childhood friend of Henderson's.
</P>
<P>
   He contrasts LearningBrands' penny-pinching ways to the
frivolous approach of another tenant that flamed out of business in
six months. ``The prior start-up took 40,000 square feet, bought
expensive furniture and had only 10 employees,'' Conroy says. ``He
was so confident that his new concept would be viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy never got his rent from that entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the market shakeout in April, start-ups and the
venture capitalists who back them have become more sober about
spending. Even in free-wheeling Silicon Valley, where rents are
sky-high, companies are moving to less glamorous addresses, more
suited to a young, profitless state.
</P>
<P>
   Bursting at the seams in this 3,000-square-foot space,
LearningBrands is now planning to move to a site triple the size.
And Henderson's nervous about it, mainly for cultural reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to lose the energy we have here. We've really
thought a lot about what happens when you put people in offices,''
he says. ``We don't believe in a hierarchy of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   LearningBrands made it for seven months on its first $1.5
million, raised from Megunticook Management in Boston last October.
Henderson had approached the firm in the summer, with little more
than his prep school pedigree, a Harvard MBA's chutzpah, and the
germ of an idea: ``Brands should teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Matlack of Megunticook told him to go back and write up a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely something there,'' Matlack says. ``When
they got rolling, thre was no one talking about (that sector). I
think they were well ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   By August, Henderson delivered the specifics, and within weeks
he had the venture capital to pursue his decidedly capitalist form
of online instruction. ``If you don't teach your customers,''
Henderson argues, ``your competitors will.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is not peddling online corporate training courses, nor
brush-up sessions on James Joyce _ both viable but separate niches.
His is an advertising and marketing model that aims to help
companies attract customers and sell more product, whether they're
dealing in bicycles, stereos, or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $85 billion spent annually on advertising, Henderson
says: ``You should be spending some portion of your marketing
budget actively teaching your customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks earnestly of e-learning, one of those unfortunate
monikers of the new economy that seems destined to fade as the
Internet becomes second nature.
</P>
<P>
   But his concept is logical. You've got seven to 12 minutes to
impress the average Internet consumer with your Web site, he says.
If that person learns something during the visit _ say a potential
boat buyer gets a quick sea kayaking course on the L.L. Bean site _
he or she is more likely to make the purchase and become a loyal
customer, he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of getting somebody to buy something,'' says
Cushing Anderson, an analyst with IDC, a Framingham research firm.
That's a different niche, he notes, than offering customers
training after they've bought a product.
</P>
<P>
   Basili, LearningBrands' executive vice president, is the
curriculum expert and resident teacher. He holds a law degree and a
master's in education from Berkeley, where he studied how to keep
adults engaged in learning. He shows sites the firm has built for
clients, such as Cook's Illustrated in Brookline and Liberty mutual
funds in Boston, with the quiet confidence of a tenured professor.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he said, is to connect content and commerce.
``You just have to be elegant about it and smart about it,'' Basili
says.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Cook's U,'' LearningBrands has helped the magazine
publisher run courses, such as making classic tomato sauce or
roasting the perfect turkey. Some courses are two to four weeks
long. Instructors respond to student e-mails and students can
interact on message boards. More than 3,000 people signed up in the
first six weeks, Basili said.
</P>
<P>
   The online learning field is so new, analysts say, it's up for
grabs to an array of players, including notHarvard.com of Austin,
Texas, and DigitalThink Inc. of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Rival notHarvard.com has raised $34 million since July 1999,
with backers including barnesandnoble.com. LearningBrands has
raised a total of just $5.5 million, enough to last through the
year, Henderson says. He wants to raise another $8 million to $10
million this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The company's last $4 million was secured in April from
Megunticook, from Seattle's Staenberg Venture Capital, and from
private investors, including Matthew Barzun, chief strategy officer
at CNET Networks Inc., the San Francisco-based Internet network
that produces TV and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barzun and Jonathan Staenburg, the venture capitalist and
former Microsoft executive, sit on LearningBrands' advisory board.
The rest of the lineup is high-octane too, including Fortune
magazine president Jolene Sykes; Coby O'Brien, chief of advertising
giant Saatchi and Saatchi's interactive arm; and personalization
expert Bruce Kasanoff.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applaud LearningBrands for a ``not-com'' attitude.
``They have this advertising agency orientation,'' says Trace
Urdan, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco.
``They're talking to the right people in the right language. I
think that's going to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson still bristles at being called an ad guy.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a respected Boston venture capitalist, Greylock
Management Corp.'s Robert Henderson, his first job after Dartmouth
College was with the Chicago agency Leo Burnett. Then he leaped
into the education field, working most recently as a senior manager
at Kaplan Educational Centers (where he and Basili met), the
trainers for college and grad-school entrance tests. He also
founded the Boston Learning Society, a Needham-based adult
education center.
</P>
<P>
   He's about to learn some new lessons of his own, as he and his
colleagues prepare to move out of their start-up space. Henderson
is excited. But he's also anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried,'' he admits. ``It will really be different.''

SEGA PRESIDENT FACES BIGGEST GAME OF HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ Is Peter Moore A glutton for punishment?
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain his last two jobs _ vice president of
marketing at Reebok International Ltd., and now president of Sega
of America?
</P>
<P>
   At Reebok, Moore and his Canton, Mass. shoe company were stomped
by Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Today at Sega, Moore is gazing up at the looming heel of Sony,
the Godzilla of the game console industry. On Oct. 26, Sony is
launching its highly anticipated PlayStation 2 video-game console
in America. This gives Moore roughly two months to outmaneuver
Sony, or at least get out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who came to the United States from Britain in 1981 to
play soccer for the Cleveland Cobras, is hustling to do just that.
This week, Sega is slashing the price of its Dreamcast console 25
percent, to $149. It's also launching its online gaming network,
SegaNet. And it is discounting its top-selling ``all star'' games,
including Sega Bass Fishing, Sonic Adventure, and NFL 2K.
</P>
<P>
   Will the hat trick work?
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly have to do something,'' said P.J. McNealy, a
technology analyst with Gartner Group in San Jose. ``Sega's biggest
advantage is that they are the first company to do online console
gaming. If they can do it well and Sony can't, that's a huge window
of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is placing a huge bet on SegaNet, in the same way Reebok
wagered millions on its Shaquille O'Neal endorsement. Set to launch
Thursday, SegaNet promises to let people play video games over the
Net using their Dreamcasts. While gamers have played online for
years on PCs, SegaNet will be the first to let people play online
through a console. For those without a Net connection, Sega will
provide dial-up access for $21.95 a month, the same fee charged by
America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It is a high-wire gambit. To break even, Sega will have to sign
up 200,000 paying SegaNet users by March 2001, said McNealy. The
SegaNet launch this week would also have to be glitch-free. To do
that, Sega would have to solve a technical quirk recently unearthed
by testers _ many reported difficulty logging into SegaNet when
they used an Internet access provider other than Sega's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sega has an opportunity to set the stage for people's
expectations of online gaming,'' said McNealy. ``A lot rides on
what happens next week.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moore, this is a familiar refrain. He heard similar
critiques when he was at Reebok in the 1990s when Reebok went up
against Nike _ and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent more time trying to out-Nike Nike rather than being
true to ourselves,'' said Moore, 45. ``This made us schizophrenic
in our brand positioning. You could say we lost our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok, with decent success, has in recent years returned to its
core business _ fitness and cross-training shoes with an emphasis
on comfort. Sega likewise made blunders in the 1990s with its
overly ambitious Saturn console. Its market share sank below 1
percent in June 1999. Last year, Sega refocused, introduced the
Dreamcast in the fall, and reclaimed a 15 percent market share as
of August.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is working hard to defend Sega's hard-won ground. Knowing
that consumers buy consoles only when there are good games to be
played, he recently criss-crossed the country to personally meet
with 18 game developers over five weeks to urge them to continue to
make games for the Dreamcast. He's also throwing $130 million this
fiscal year into a marketing blitz. And he's stuffed Sega's
pipeline with dozens of new games.
</P>
<P>
   All this has not silenced Sega's naysayers, but that doesn't
bother Moore. A chipper bloke, Moore grew up in a pub his parents
owned in Liverpool. Moore moved to the United States in 1981 to
play and coach soccer. Two years later, he became a salesman for
Patrick USA, a subsidiary of a French athletic shoe company. Five
years later, he became the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Reebok beckoned Moore to develop its worldwide soccer
business. When Reebok retrenched two years ago, Moore ``became a
bit of a dinosaur.'' He left Reebok in 1998 as the senior vice
president of marketing to become head of marketing for Sega of
America. He became Sega's president in April 1998, at the company's
nadir. Perhaps that's why all this talk of gloom and doom doesn't
seem to annoy Moore; he's seen worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything said about us is always skeptical,'' said Moore.
``We're always having to prove everybody wrong. And we will.''

   Some things in life you can count on. Here, from Ed's Joke List
on the Web (www.eds-jokelist.com) are a few of the things bound to
happen on flights:
</P>
<P>
   --No flight ever leaves on time unless you are running late and
need the delay to catch the plane.
</P>
<P>
   --Flights never leave from Gate Number 1 at any terminal in the
world. And the later you are, the farther away your gate is.
</P>
<P>
   --If you have to work on a flight, you will experience
turbulence as soon as you begin to write. (Or start to drink your
coffee.)
</P>
<P>
   --If you are assigned a middle seat, you can determine who has
the seats on the aisle and the window while you're still in the
boarding area. Just find the two largest passengers.
</P>
<P>
   --Only passengers in window seats ever have to get up to go to
the lavatory.
</P>
<P>
   --The crying baby on board is always seated next to you.

   In response to a Travel Trivia answer that said Big Ben is the
nickname for St. Stephen's Tower in London, Paul Mason of
Brookline, Mass. writes that this is a common misconception. ``Big
Ben is actually the name of the bell itself _ and only the one that
strikes the hours. St. Stephen's Tower (in which the bell is
housed) does not have a nickname.'' Chiming in with similar
comments were Joseph Schmuch of Reading, Harry Gennis of Concord,

   Chris Hounsome of Ottawa, in responding to a reader's comment
that ``America'' should refer to more than just the United States,
writes: ``All the people in North and South America are Americans,
yet it's only the US of A that uses that term to describe its
citizens, which is just a bit irritating to us non-US Americans.
May I suggest `Usanians'? Better yet, start a contest to rename
your country and give it a name which isn't just the equivalent of
a bunch of political entities which banded together as part of this
continent. You've got a great country, get a great name. I suggest
`Bob.' ''

   Our mention that Calais, Maine, and Calais, France, were
pronounced differently (CAL-is vs. Cal-AY) brought this response

<P>
   Joseph Pike of Natick, Mass. continues to protest our use of
``loopy laws,'' saying we have failed ``to verify the truth of the
bizarre things you write.'' He calls our sources inadequate and
cites a law we mentioned earlier, saying it cannot be found on the
books.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but not all the laws or ordinances are as worded in
our source books. Some stem from incidents where existing laws
(public nuisance, care of animals, driving to endanger, public
nudity, etc.) are applied in court or elsewhere to so-called
bizarre behavior in the city or state mentioned in the loopy law.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate: Stuart Cohen of Marblehead, Mass. notes that in
Sandwich, Mass., near the pond by the old grist mill, a sign says,
``Abandoning of ducks or geese shall be punished by a fine of not
more than $500. Violators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent
of the law. (Massachusetts General Laws) 272 Sec. 77.'' That
section of the law, however, says nothing about ducks or geese but
a lot about animal cruelty. Thus a loopy law might read: ``You are
forbidden to dump your ducks in Sandwich.'' (Not that there's
anything loopy about proper treatment of animals.)
</P>
<P>
   Pike responds, ``You make very good points . . . although I do
not consider a court decision to be the same as a law.'' That,
likewise, is a very good point.

GLAUBER'S CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Swedish company's bid to buy the London Stock Exchange out
from under its prospective German merger partner illustrates just
how competitive world bourses have become.
</P>
<P>
   OM Group, a high-tech start-up that operates a stock exchange in
Sweden, is seeking to derail Frankfurt's Deutsche Boerse's merger
plans with a $1.2 billion bid for the LSE. No fewer than seven
European securities markets are now investor-owned. But hostile
raids are something new.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a dozen new-fangled ``electronic communications
networks'' continue to move in the world's two largest stock
exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Something like a
third of Nasdaq's total volume now takes place on these alternative
trading systems. Recently they've begun to move in on Big Board
listings, too.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest of these ECNs are Bloomberg's Tradebook,
Reuter's Instinet, Datek's Island, and the Archipelago system. The
industry is preparing to go public with its opposition to Nasdaq's
proposed Supermontage trading system _ a price display technology
that the ECNs fear would put them out of business. The NYSE in turn
(with one eye on the Justice Department) has considered buying an
ECN or two.
</P>
<P>
   And Nasdaq, which has repeatedly said it expects to build a
presence in Europe, has been mentioned as a possible bidder for the
LSE, if the English merger with the Frankfurt bourse breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   The German-English market (in which Nasdaq is to have a minor
share) is slated to be called iX; the Paris, Amsterdam, and
Brussels exchanges have teamed up to form Euronext NV. Who will
finally succeed in putting together a pan-European market? It is
anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   The leading player in all this is, of course, the Internet.
Computer technology for years has been transforming stock exchanges
from storied citadels of privilege to commercially motivated
information networks. European integration accelerated the process.
</P>
<P>
   In the calm eye of the storm sits Robert R. Glauber, 61, adjunct
lecturer at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and
all-around financial trouble-shooter. He is slated to become top
regulator of the National Association of Securities Dealers and its
feisty stock exchange in November, taking his place beside Richard
Grasso of the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Glauber has been a familiar feature of the regulatory landscape
since 1987, when Nicholas Brady chose him to serve as executive
director of the commission appointed by President Reagan to study
the October stock market crash. Previously Glauber has been
professor of finance at Harvard Business School and chair of its
Advanced Management Program.
</P>
<P>
   After Brady became Treasury secretary in the Bush
administration, Glauber served as undersecretary for finance. He
oversaw the overhaul and recapitalization of the savings and loan
industry, and laid the groundwork for the commercial banking reform
act that finally passed last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt
Jr. who in 1995 caused Glauber to be appointed to the NASD board,
after a series of scandals shook public confidence in the ability
of the second-largest stock exchange to ride herd on its dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Levitt is forcing the NASD to privatize Nasdaq, ultimately
retaining only a 20 percent stake in the exchange it founded in
1971. The first part of the sale took place earlier this year. For
now, NASD will retain full ownership of the American Stock Exchange
as well, but its main purpose is to perform a full schedule of
regulatory functions.
</P>
<P>
   Glauber was a natural choice to replace retiring Wall Street
veteran Frank Zarb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like NASD to become the source of regulatory
oversight for new exchanges,'' Glauber said last week. ``We would
like to offer our services to exchanges in other countries. We see
ourselves as a potentially global regulator.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-regulatory organizations like Glauber's are yet another
source of American competitive advantage in global markets. They're
not substitutes for the SEC, but extensions of it. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board is another good example of the sort.
Glauber's challenge at NASD is to extend the concept of the
semi-private industry watchdog to other continents in an
increasingly complicated world.

THE GREENING OF SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SYDNEY _ They are 400,000 strong, these gutsy competitors
gathered in an Olympic village the size of a gold medal podium.
They are the worms of the 27th Olympiad, a writhing mass of
spineless participants in what Olympic organizers promise will be
the most environmentally friendly Games in history.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a large bin in the basement of the Sydney organizing
committee's headquarters, the tiger and red worms eat, process, and
turn into compost an estimated 165 pounds of organic waste daily
from a staff cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The worm farm is among scores of ``Green Games'' projects _ from
a solar-powered athletes' village to roads pitched so that they
channel storm water for recycling _ designed to minimize waste and
resource consumption by the 500,000 people expected to converge
here each day from Sept. 15 to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the efforts represent an unprecedented bid to
expand the Olympic credo of ``faster, higher, stronger,'' to
include the environmental mantra: ``reduce, reuse, recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Care for the environment has been integrated into all the
planning, design and construction of the Games,'' said Michael
Bland, a former Greenpeace official who is environmental spokesman
for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. ``It's
not some kind of public relations campaign that was slapped on at
the last minute with a can of green paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the environment is surprisingly difficult at the
Olympics, which create, in essence, overnight cities with all the
sewage, waste and air pollution of major urban areas. Making
matters worse, most ``residents'' are tourists who are living on
the run and giving little thought to Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental concern has increasingly been part of Olympic
planning since the 1994 winter games in Lillehammer, Norway. There,
organizers recycled many of the buildings themselves once the Games
were over, even hauling the 500-room athletes' quarters most of the
way to the North Pole to house tourists and students. Sydney won
the 2000 Olympics in part because of planners' ambitious
environmental agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups have complained that Sydney Olympic
organizers could have done more and failed to achieve all the goals
they set for themselves. But even most of the harshest critics
acknowledge that Sydney has done something remarkable, going far
beyond the achievements of previous Olympic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far and away the best Olympic Games from an
environmental standpoint,'' said Rupert Posner, an Olympics
campaign worker with Greenpeace Australia. The Greenpeace flagship,
the Rainbow Warrior, sailed into Sydney Harbor last week to pay
tribute to Olympic organizers' green achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee, has gone so far as to declare that, in light of Sydney's
efforts, protecting the environment will be the ``third dimension''
of the Olympic movement, along with sport and culture.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sydney seemed the least likely city to become a
role model for Olympic environmentalism, if only because of the
industrial wasteland where it decided to stage the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the competition and ceremonies will take place at the
Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush Bay, a 1,900-acre site with a
two-century history of environmental abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles from downtown, its first industrial use began in the
early 1800s, as a saltworks, and later as a naval armaments depot.
In 1907, part of the site was set aside for a state abattoir that
eventually became the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, employing
1,600 people who slaughtered more than 20,000 animals daily.
</P>
<P>
   Futher degrading the site, part of Homebush Bay was home to a
brickworks for much of the 20th century, creating a landscape so
barren and ugly it was chosen as a location for the
post-apocalyptic movie ``Mad Max III: Beyond Thunderdome.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s and 70s, as Sydney grew up around it, Homebush Bay
became an enormous dump. Domestic, commercial and industrial waste
was strewn throughout one-quarter of the site, with enough refuse
to cover a football field with a mile-high trash mound.
</P>
<P>
   Wetlands had been filled, creeks had been converted to concrete
channels, and waterways were badly contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Although reclamation work began in the 1980s, it wasn't until
1993, when Sydney was awarded the 2000 Summer Olympics, that the
cleanup moved into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated into Sydney's proposal to the IOC was a detailed plan
to restore Homebush Bay's natural beauty at the same time sports
facilities were being built. The sweeping efforts fell into five
main categories: energy conservation; water conservation; waste
avoidance; pollution avoidance; and protection of significant
natural and cultural environments.
</P>
<P>
   From the first shovel of dirt to the eventual choice of
packaging used at the ubiquitous McDonald's restaurants at Homebush
Bay, environmental considerations frequently trumped commercial
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results:
</P>
<P>
   -- The 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium was designed to save energy
with a sophisticated natural ventilation system that draws in cool
air while allowing warm air to escape. Similarly, the Aquatic
Center was designed to cool only the air surrounding the spectators
_ not around the pool _ which saves both on cooling the stands and
heating the pool. The Aquatic Center also was designed to
significantly reduce the use of toxic chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   -- Existing wastes were consolidated into four containment areas
on the site _ large mounds essentially _ each of which was capped
with clay, topsoil and landscaping at a cost of $90 million.
Contaminated runoff from the mounds is collected in drains, pumped
into tankers, and taken to a nearby waste treatment plant.
Meanwhile, formerly damaged wetlands are being restored to a more
natural creek system.
</P>
<P>
   -- The design of the Olympic Village _ through methods including
shading, cross-ventilation, and energy-efficient appliances _
reduces energy demand by 50 percent compared to conventional
construction. Most of that demand is met by solar power, making it
the world's largest solar-powered suburb. After housing 15,000
athletes during the Games, the village will become a private
neighborhood _ prices start around $200,000. Solar power is also
used in numerous other places in the Olympic Park, including 19
huge solar towers that line, and light, the main thoroughfare,
Olympic Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   -- A dual water system was developed to provide drinking water
through one set of pipes and non-drinkable water _ recycled from
storm water and sewage effluent _ through a second set. The
non-drinkable water is used for irrigation and toilet flushing.
Streets and buildings were designed to catch and channel as much
storm water as possible to a complex filtration system.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plans to build the Olympic Tennis Center at the former
brickworks were changed when it was discovered that, despite its
polluted past, the site was home to the rare green and golden bell
frog. Special tunnels were built to allow the frogs to move through
the site without the risk of being squished. In a stroke of
particularly good luck for the frog, its green and gold coloring
matches Australia's sporting colors, instantly turning the
amphibian into an unofficial national mascot.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Sydney Games will be the first car-free Olympics, with
nearly all spectators using public transportation to Homebush Bay.
New train lines that can handle 50,000 people an hour were built at
a cost of $54 million to reduce pollution and increase access and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   -- To offset greenhouse gases, Olympic organizers have
undertaken the planting of 2 million trees, not just at Homebush
Bay but across Australia.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Olympic Torch was designed to be both energy-efficient
and non-polluting; ``solar buggies'' will move athletes around the
site; and building materials throughout Homebush Bay were chosen
for environmental friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers say there is no way to calculate the added
costs of the environmental efforts. ``They were integral to
everything, so it's not like we added them separately and asked,
how much could we save by not doing this,'' Bland said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few items with environmental price tags are the
initial waste cleanup, which cost about $90 million, and the water
recycling plant, $10 million. The total cost of transforming
Homebush Bay and building the sports venues was about $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results have generally won praise, but some skeptics have
wondered whether the environmental efforts have been overplayed by
a public relations machine eager to polish Olympic rings tarnished
by bribery scandals and various smaller missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Take the worms as an example.

ARE WE GETTING CLOSER TO CLONING HUMAN BEINGS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are unlikely pioneers, almost universally scorned and
doubted, yet vowing to embark on one of the boldest scientific
experiments ever.
</P>
<P>
   One is a religious cult that believes in UFOs and aliens whose
leaders say they will soon try to clone cells from a recently
deceased young child.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a maverick physicist who shocked the world when he
announced in 1998 his plans to buy property in Japan to establish a
cloning laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the world learned of Dolly, the cloned sheep,
no one has taken the dreaded and often-predicted further step, so
far as is known, of cloning a star athlete, dictator, or even a
beloved pet. A two-year, $2.3 million effort in Texas to clone an
aging pet border collie named Missy has yet to yield a whimper of
success.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not for lack of trying. Groups and individuals far
outside the scientific mainstream make no secret that they want to
clone people. The religious cult's Clonaid project claims already
to have its first paying customers, the parents of a deceased child
willing to pay to clone him.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and ethicists alike, however, say their bigger
concern is people-cloning projects that may be going forward
without publicity.
</P>
<P>
   And, amid the current wave of enthusiasm for cloning human
embryos to obtain versatile ``stem cells'' for repairing the body,
some worry that the stage is being set for scientists to slide past
social and legal bounds and eventually clone not just embryonic
cells but entire human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely think there's a bridge being built from one type
of cloning to the other,'' said Peter Garretts, a spokesman for
MATCH, a British anti-cloning group. ``I think the cloning of
humans is an inevitability,'' an opinion that many experts share.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH's anxiety is prompted by the decision of a British
government advisory committee that recently called for allowing
scientists to create human embryos through a cloning process, in
order to obtain embryonic stem cells that could develop into any
tissue of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The panel firmly stated that these cloned embryos could be kept
for no more than 14 days: They would be discarded after the stem
cells were removed. MATCH and other critics are concerned that some
unethical scientist might instead place such an embryo into a
woman's uterus, where it could develop into a fetus to be born.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dr. Liam Donaldson, Britain's chief medical officer, told
the London Observer recently: ``We're not talking about cloning
whole human beings; it's abhorrent, it's illegal. And we're not
growing whole parts of the body, sitting in the lab growing arms
and legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the British infertility industry is closely regulated
by the government _ unlike its US counterpart _ and efforts to use
the created embryos to initiate a pregnancy would likely be caught,
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   For people concerned about the possibility of human clones,
however, there is plenty to keep a nervous eye on.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Pope last week denounced cloning and embryo
research, the UFO-oriented religious group called the Raelian
Movement said its cloning project, called Clonaid, would soon try
to make a genetic copy of a young child who had died and whose
parents were willing to pay the cost of the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Clonaid, formed in 1997, is based on the group's belief that
life on Earth was created by a race of human extraterrestrials
using DNA engineering: Jesus himself came into existence through
cloning, the Raelians believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should cost more than $500,000'' for a clone,
Clonaid's scientific director, Brigitte Boisselier, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the high failure rate of current methods of cloning
and that many cloned animals are born with birth defects,
Boisselier said, ``You need to be very careful. We have been
designing a kind of DNA transfer that wouldn't cause damage to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified couple who has requested the cloning, she
added, ``say they know this will not bring their baby back, but
they want to give his DNA a chance to express itself'' in a
genetically identical child.
</P>
<P>
   Clonaid has four scientists on its team, but is still seeking an
existing lab, or a place to build one, in a country where cloning
isn't yet outlawed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such countries are becoming harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Japan moved toward a cloning ban designed to sew up
loopholes in existing regulations. The gaps came to light when
Richard Seed, a physicist from Chicago, announced in 1998 he had
raised financing to buy property in Japan to establish a cloning
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Seed, who has three Harvard degrees but is not trained in
reproductive science, is perhaps the most notorious would-be
cloner. Several times after the birth of Dolly, Seed stirred alarm
in scientific and legal circles by announcing plans to clone humans
_ including himself and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Seed has the expertise and can recruit capable
scientists or raise sufficient funding has never been clear, but
his announcements forced the scientific community and lawmakers to
confront the possibility of human cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Current rumors say the purported financing for his Japanese
venture fell through. Last week, he did not return calls to his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-credentialed cloning enthusiast is an Italian
infertility expert, Dr. Severino Antinori, who heads an IVF clinic
and said he has pioneered legitimate infertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Rome last week, Antinori said he
is experienced in both animal and human reproduction, and wants to
offer cloning to men who have no sperm but desire a biologically
related child. Italy, however, has a legal ban on human cloning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very surprised that people in general say no to this,''
said Antinori of the International Associated Research Institute
for Human Reproduction. He said he will discuss reproductive
cloning with other infertility experts at a meeting in Budapest
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike normal reproduction, cloning perpetuates the genetic
material of only one individual, not two. Dolly, born at the Roslin
Institute in Scotland in 1996, was the first mammal cloned from an
adult body cell.
</P>
<P>
   In this type of cloning, the animal's genetic material _ the
full DNA complement in the nucleus of one cell _ is placed into a
female individual's egg that has been stripped of all its DNA.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the experiment that produced Dolly showed that
something almost miraculous occurs when an adult cell is
successfully cloned: The donor nucleus is ``reprogrammed'' so it is
able to generate an entirely new individual from scratch. Rather
tham having the same genetic age as the animal from which it was
duplicated, the nucleus somehow was made young again, as if a clock
were rewound. As a result, it became once again fully active in all
its genes and capable of developing into an entire individual.
</P>
<P>
   Success in cloning Dolly from an adult ewe has led to similar
feats with calves, mice and _ most recently _ pigs. Monkeys,
however, have not yet been cloned from adult cells, nor have dogs
or cats.
</P>
<P>
   Following close on the hoofsteps of Dolly's arrival, President
Bill Clinton issued an executive order banning federal funding of
human cloning. A proposed federal law, however, failed to pass
mainly because scientists were concerned it would hamper legitimate
research.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, four states _ Rhode Island, Michigan, California and
Louisiana _ have passed cloning bans.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``it's really universal disapproval of cloning that is
preventing scientists from getting involved,'' said Lori Andrews,
director of the Institute for Science, Law and Technology at
Chicago-Kent College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no scientists, politicians or ethicists have a good
word to say about cloning human individuals.
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, professor of health law at Boston University,
argued that cloning an existing human being ``is replication, not
reproduction.'' It threatens human uniqueness, he said, and
devalues human life _ because the clone would be so much compared
to the original person that it would be only a perpetual ``echo''
of another person.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a California lawyer representing infertile
people argues that banning cloning interferes with a constitutional
right to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Eibert challenges the notion that clones would be mere
carbon copies, pointing out the identical twins have striking
individuality though they are genetically the same. That's because
environment and learning also shape personality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Eibert told a California commission on cloning, the
real issue is who decides whether infertile people can reproduce by
cloning _ the individual or the government?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the lawyers, there are members of the public who are
drawn to the possibilities, not so much to create the next Michael
Jordan as to fill an emotional need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big interest'' in cloning or related procedures
among ``a lot of single women who have not found a partner, or the
right partner, and still want a child biologically related to
them,'' said Dr. David Keefe, chief of infertility services at New
England Medical Center and Women and Infant's Hospital in
Providence. In the absence of any proven human cloning method, he
said, many of these women desperately want embryos created by
couples for IVF but not used, and kept on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists argue about the merits and morality of human cloning,
experts debate whether there really is much interest in cloning
people, but for the moment, say Keefe and other specialists, those
are moot points. Why? Because the risks of failure and
abnormalities are too high, as the animal results show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know nothing about the safety'' of cloning humans, Keefe
said. Animal clones have been born with oversized organs and
malfunctions, and there is debate about whether clones may
prematurely age.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's possible that a cloned kid at 5 might develop
Alzheimer's and get cancer'' and have symptoms of advanced age.
``Show me one parent'' who would accept that risk in cloning, Keefe
said. ``We should assume the worst _ because kids are too
precious.''

EVEN THE SHUNNED HAVE RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is ironic that authorities should choose to confine Rebecca
Corneau in a place born of compassion for this culture's pregnant
outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that Neil J. Houston, the social reformer
for whom the house for expectant inmates is named, would not be
appalled that a woan neither accused nor convicted of a crime is
being held there against her will and forced to submit to medical
examinations against her religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in 1987, Houston was famous in Boston's social
advocacy community for championing the cause of those the larger
society shunned. Corneau and members of her small religious sect
from Attleboro certainly fit that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribing to beliefs that acknowledge no secular authority,
the group has provoked the ire of Bristol District Attorney Paul F.
Walsh by refusing to answer questions about the deaths last year of
Corneau's infant son, Jeremiah, and his 10-month-old cousin,
Samuel. The fathers of those children and six others in the sect
are in jail for refusing to cooperate with a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh suspects that Jeremiah died soon after birth for lack of
routine medical care and that Samuel might have suffered a slow and
agonizing death from starvation. If he is right, then members of
the sect could be charged with crimes ranging from illegal disposal
of human remains to homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that Walsh does not know if he is
right. The sect is not talking and, without the bodies, there is no
physical evidence. Which brings us to the current legal dilemma.
Can the state incarcerate an unindicted woman on the basis of what
authorities fear might happen to the fetus she is carrying? Does
the state's interest in a fetus in the third trimester supersede
the rights of a pregnant woman to refuse medical care?
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Collins, the nurse appointed by the court to examine
Corneau, found her ``very kind and gentle'' but firm in her refusal
to submit to a medical exam. A Christian Scientist might be no less
defiant, but would Attleboro Juvenile Court Judge Kenneth Nasif
have been so quick to declare her an ``unfit mother'' and label her
a member of a ``bizzare and dangerous cult?''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh would have us believe that the legalities are best
addressed after insuring a safe delivery of Corneau's baby. But
even if medical supervision could guarantee a healthy delivery,
since when does the state have the power to deprive individuals of
their liberty first, and ask questions later?
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is being disingenuous when he claims that locking up
Rebecca Corneau is not punitive. Of course it is. No doubt he has
genuine concern for the safety of the baby Corneau will soon
deliver. Who among us does not share it? But it is also true that
the sect's refusal to cooperate has stymied his criminal
investigation. He wants answers. He locked up eight men months ago
in a futile attempt to get them; now he has begun to lock up the
women. Another member of the sect is pregnant and Walsh has said
that she, too, might be taken into custody at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Americans love the US Constitution when we read in it
protections of the rights we hold dear. We are more disdainful when
those whose beliefs we revile claim the same protections.
</P>
<P>
   In another Massachusetts courtroom last week, the American Civil
Liberties Union said it will defend the North American Man-Boy Love
Association against a $200 million lawsuit that claims the two
pedophiles, who molested and murdered Jeffrey Curley, 10, from
Cambridge three years ago, were inspired by NAMBLA's literature and
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a less sympathetic group than NAMBLA.
Committed to the repeal of laws that bar sexual contact between
adults and children, it contends that boys as young as 8 are
capable of informed consent. But if the First Amendment does not
protect the worst among us, it protects none of us. The Curleys'
rage at NAMBLA, like Walsh's frustration with Corneau, is
understandable. But the criminal justice system cannot be guided by
rage or frustration; it must be guided by the law.
</P>
<P>
   For pregnant inmates of Framingham State Prison, a room in the
Houston house is a liberation, a chance to bond with their newborns
in a more homelike setting. For Rebecca Corneau, a woman with no
criminal record but too many unpopular beliefs, it is a prison
cell. Neil Houston would be appalled.

AT SUNAPEE, IT'S ALL ABOUT LAKE, MOUNTAIN, TRANQUILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNAPEE, N.H. _ ``There have been two important times in
Sunapee's history,'' declares Capt. Bob Henry as he heads the
excursion boat M/V Mount Sunapee II out into Lake Sunapee. ``One
was 100 years ago, and the other is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, more than a dozen grand resort hotels were built
in the Lake Sunapee area and a fleet of steamers launched to carry
visitors, most of whom came for long stays from Boston or New York
by train, to resorts and summer homes around the 9-mile-long lake.
The passenger trains, steamers and vast old wooden hotels are long
gone, victims of changing times.
</P>
<P>
   However, the things that attracted visitors in the first place,
the large, crystal-clear lake (there are also a number of smaller
lakes and ponds in the area) and Mount Sunapee _ the 2,743
foot-high mountain that towers over it _ are still here. And
they're both being rediscovered and appreciated by a new generation
of city dwellers looking for easy-to-get-to natural beauty and
tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a backwater,'' says innkeeper Ted Harriman happily.
``There are no shopping malls, bowling alleys or fast-food
franchises. All those things are not too far away if you need them,
but they're just not here.'' Harriman owns the 16-room Inn at
Sunapee (603-763-4444/www.innatsunappee.com), a former 1870s dairy
farm typical of the pleasant but modestly sized (and priced) inns
and B&AMP;Bs that have replaced the resort palaces of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mount Sunapee II cruises down the lake, Capt. Henry
points out the sights: a lighthouse, one of three on the lake; the
sites of several once-famous resort hotels; and the yacht club with
the country's largest flotilla of Star Class racing sailboats.
Also, some landmark old homes and cottages. ``That one has been in
the same family for five generations,'' he says of a sturdy-looking
lakeside cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Given Lake Sunapee's long history as the focal point of a resort
area, there is still a surprising amount of undeveloped land along
the shoreline, including forested sections belonging to the John
Hay National Wildlife Refuge and Mount Sunapee State Park. The
state park's long, sandy beach is Lake Sunapee's only public beach,
but there are a number of places where boats can be launched.
</P>
<P>
   There's also quite a bit of construction around the lake.
Calling attention to a large mansion being built on a beautiful
point of land jutting into the lake, Henry shakes his head in
wonderment. ``They say that place will cost about $10 million when
it's finished,'' he says, ``Sunapee is changing!''
</P>
<P>
   Another visible example of the area's renaissance is Sunapee
Harbor, home port for the vessels of Sunapee Cruises
(603-763-4030/www.sunapeecruises.com), the Mt. Sunapee II and its
sister vessel M/V Kearsage, which carries passengers on nightly
dinner cruises around the lake. The center of resort activity at
the turn of the 20th century, Sunapee Harbor fell on hard times
with the completion of Interstate 89, which made the area _ now
only a 90-minute drive from Boston _ more a day trip than a
vacation destination for southern New England.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, most of the buildings in Sunapee Harbor were
boarded up. Today, largely because of the efforts of the
improvement-minded Sunapee Harbor Riverway Corporation, the harbor
is a lively and attractive place once more. Beds of flowers
brighten a waterfront park, and a large bandstand _ which stands on
the site of the Ben Mere, last of the local grand hotels _ is the
scene of frequent concerts and performances.
</P>
<P>
   There are several interesting gift shops and boutiques in
Sunapee Harbor, including the Wild Goose and the Woodbine Shoppe as
well as The Anchorage (603-763-3334), an informal restaurant with a
lakeside deck that's a popular place to be just about anytime on a
sunny day. The Sunapee Historical Society operates a small seasonal
museum, housed in a former livery stable across from the excursion
boat dock, filled with photos of the old hotels and memorabilia of
the steamboat era, including the pilot house of one steamer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunapee Harbor is the area's summer recreation focal point,but
the year-round hub is New London, a few miles to the east on Route
11. An elegant old town with a gracious Main Street, New London is
the home of Colby-Sawyer College, a liberal arts college founded in
1837. Another local cultural institution is the highly regarded New
London Barn Playhouse (603-526-6710) one of the oldest summer stock
theaters in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Another important fixture in town is the venerable New London
Inn (603-526-2791/800-526-2791) on Main Street, founded in 1792,
and still dispensing food, drink and hospitality. Peter Christian's
Tavern (603-526-4042), a nearby restaurant, gets high marks from
locals, and there is usually a line waiting to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Hill Farm (800-231-8637/www.maplehillfarm.com) a 175-
year-old, 10-guest-room farmhouse just off the I-89 exit for New
London, is a cozy and comfortable B&AMP;B with an authentic country
feel to it. (There are sheep in a back pasture, and the eggs served
at breakfast come from the farm's hens.)
</P>
<P>
   Also pretty traditional is Twin Lake Village (603-526-6460), a
200-acre resort on Little Lake Sunapee in New London. Owned by the
Kidder family since the 1890s, this really is rather like a
village: Guests stay in 18 two-story mansard-roofed ``cottages''
scattered around the grounds. One of the amenities is a nine-hole
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Because until the 1920s most visitors to Lake Sunapee arrived in
the area by train and got around the lake by boat, no road was
built around the shoreline. So, it's almost impossible to get good
lake views from a car. To see Lake Sunapee up close, you have to
get out on the water. For the best overview, however, the place to
be is the summit of Mount Sunapee.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain is also enjoying something of a renaissance. Mount
Sunapee is part of the state park, but two years ago the formerly
state-run ski area was leased to the Okemo Mountain Co. of Vermont,
which has expanded thefacilities and operating season. Mount
Sunapee Resort (1-877-687-8627/603-763-2356/www.mtsunapee.com) now
has an active summer program that includes mountain biking,
skateboarding, and special events, among them one of the largest
craft shows in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest attraction of all, however, is the chairlift that
carries hikers (the state park has a network of hiking trails) and
rubberneckers to the summit lodge. The 360-degree, panoramic view
from the top is impressive anytime but spectacular in foliage
season. And, directly below _ seeming so close you could almost
dive in _ stretches the gleaming expanse of Lake Sunapee.
</P>
<P>
   Lake and mountain. That, after all, is what the area is about.

STOP THE RHETORIC, SAVE THE CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women's rights groups ought to take a deep breath in the legal
drama unfolding around cult member Rebecca Corneau and the
impending birth of her baby. If they don't, they're at risk of
harming their own worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   Far more important than any murky precedent that may or may not
be established by placing Corneau in state custody, far more
significant than the ongoing intellectual parrying in the courts
and news media, is one simple, indelible fact: This case is about
life and death.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of weeks, a child will be born to Rebecca Corneau, a
child who, from the very second he or she enters this world,
deserves the full rights and protections inherent as a citizen of
the United States. That child didn't ask to be born to a member of
an extremist cult, and that child shouldn't be put at risk because
of the mother's noxious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Some facts: Two children of this Attleboro, Mass. cult are
missing and presumed dead _ a 10-month-old who authorities have
good reason to believe was starved to death over the course of
three agonizing months as part of ``God's will,'' and an infant
(Corneau's most recent child) who died at birth, probably for lack
of proper medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member cult regards science and medicine as blasphemy and
refuses to acknowledge the existence of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Members apparently buried the tiny bodies in makeshift coffins,
perhaps somewhere in the wilderness of Baxter State Park in Maine.
No one really knows because the cult members won't say. Rather than
speak to authorities, eight of them have been placed in jail for
contempt of court. Cult leader Jacques Robidoux went so far as to
tell a judge that authorities have no right to search for his
missing son, Samuel, because the boy was a sovereign individual and
not a citizen of the United States. Good one.
</P>
<P>
   So officials have taken a series of uncommonly sensible steps.
First, a judge ruled that the members of the cult _ including
Corneau _ were unfit parents, and so their 13 children were removed
and placed in the custody of the state Department of Social
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Then District Attorney Paul Walsh asked a judge to place
Corneau, who is believed to be about 8 1/2 months pregnant, in
state custody to assure that she will take proper steps in
delivering a healthy baby. After Corneau refused to be examined by
a court-appointed nurse, Attleboro Juvenile Court Judge Kenneth
Nasif granted the order, and last week, she was taken from the
courthouse to a state prison hospital in an unmarked cruiser by a
pair of state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is that as soon as the baby is delivered, Corneau will
be free to go; the child will be turned over to the DSS.
</P>
<P>
   Enter an assortment of women's advocates and civil rights
groups, many of whom have begun sounding as shrill as the National
Rifle Association when it fights proposed bans on deadly submachine
guns by saying that such measures will erode the rights of hunters.
</P>
<P>
   In a vacuum, their arguments have some merit. It is not without
alarm that the government detains a healthy woman for the purpose
of imposing the medical will of a prosecutor and judge. There are
civil rights, religious rights, that create the foundation of our
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be clear: The body count from this cult already stands
at two _ two boys named Samuel and Jeremiah. A criminal
investigation forges onward, the detectives trying to penetrate the
wall of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be equally clear: This is not about religious freedom. No
acceptable religion allows a child in its immediate care to starve
to death. No acceptable religion hides corpses from authorities who
don't just have a right but a responsibility to recover and analyze
them.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, this is not about abortion rights, of which I'm
entirely, unequivocally in favor. In this one instance, it is about
the care of just one child _ a newborn who will be endangered by a
group of fanatics the second he or she enters the world.
</P>
<P>
   One commentator recently said authorities were only ``guessing''
at the danger involved. With two dead, whether by intent or
neglect, it's a pretty educated guess.
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups would do well to acknowledge that Corneau's
newborn baby has the right to be protected against a cult in which
children tend to die. These women's advocates don't want to appear
extreme, which is precisely how they look right now.

WHY GORE IS SMILING: YOU CAN'T BEAT THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Al to Tipper: ``It's the economy, darling.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the kiss in Los Angeles. After Labor Day, the boom
remains Al Gore's strongest suit for victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers, not voters, seek soul mates. The American electorate
doesn't have to fall madly in love with the next president. Voters
just need to like and respect Bill Clinton's successor enough to
trust him with their prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   If the market stays steady and inflation and interest rates stay
down, switching horses becomes harder and harder to rationalize.
This is particularly true when the other horse _ George W. Bush _
is running scared and a little ugly much sooner than his earlier
cockiness would predict.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Mr. Congeniality seems a little less so as he signs on
to a campaign of attack ads against his Democratic opponent.
Naturally, the Democrats will fire back with their own negative
ads. That just stands to make likeability a draw, leaving Gore _ at
least on paper _ with the upper hand when it comes to the politics
of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In what seems like a century ago but was only last month, Bush
tried to turn the economy into an issue that helps his cause.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, he
accused the Clinton administration of squandering the ``promise of
prosperity'' and pledged to confront ``the hard issues,'' such as
national security, health, education, and retirement. But except
for education, where Gore is shaky in his absolute rejection of any
kind of school voucher system, Bush is making little headway in
demonstrating his way is the better way. He, in fact, has been on
the defense in each area.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the issues wouldn't matter so much if the vaunted Bush
charm had remained the focus of summertime headlines. But Gore was
lucky and, for once, Bush was not.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Gore, no one paid much attention to the
substance of the Democratic National Convention, particularly to
his rushed delivery of a flat acceptance speech, with its single
memorable and hardly inspirational line: ``I stand before you as my
own man.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Bush, the trivial was the big news out of Los
Angeles, from Hollywood and its stars to the Gores and their kiss.
Only in America _ and only for a candidate as dependably robotic as
Gore _ would a three-seconds-long smooch between husband and wife
give a presidential campaign new lift and major redefinition.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in marriage and in politics, passion goes only so far.
The kiss provided some nice imagery for Gore, but it is not strong
enough to carry him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and November there are pitfalls aplenty for both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still has to prove that he is smart enough to be president,
and he can't do that if he looks as if he is afraid to debate his
opponent face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that a debate planned for the University of
Massachusetts at Boston is too partisan because the school is
adjacent to the Kennedy Library is a bit puzzling for a
presidential nominee who used a film clip of John F. Kennedy in his
Philadelphia infomercial. Of course, Bush must survive whatever
debates he engages in without major gaffe or guffaw.
</P>
<P>
   Gore must keep himself separated from Bill Clinton's personal
weaknesses in the voters' minds and hope that his own fund-raising
activities and curious miscellaneous declarations about things like
inventing the Internet don't undercut his overall credibility, as
the Bush camp desires. Demonstrating that he is a big policy wonk
with some soul would be helpful, too, especially during debates.
But here is one vote for less kissing at the podium and more
fact-backed dissing.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in last Friday's Wall Street Journal, ``The Nasdaq
composite index soared 102.54 points, or 2.5 percent to 4206.35,
while the Dow Jones industrials jumped 112.09 points to 11215.10,
capping a month of strong gains for both indexes. . . . Factory
orders dropped a record 7.5 percent in July, but a buildup of
inventories suggests continued strength in the manufacturting
sector. Overall, factory orders are up 9.5 percent so far this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper to Al: ``I love it when you talk numbers to me,
sweetheart.''

HE WALKS HOLY CITY'S LITTLE CORNERS OF HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yehuda Amichai pulls back the window curtain on the
soft light at the end of the day and looks over the climbing pink
bougainvillea and onto the Old City's gray ramparts at Jaffa Gate.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's 75-year-old poet laureate, the man who has put words to
the soul of Jerusalem, watches people traverse the paths that lead
through dry scrub pines and up into the fortress-side revetments of
the Ottoman-era gate _ Orthodox Jews in black hats, Palestinian
children pushing vendor carts, tourists with their camera bags.
</P>
<P>
   They are Jerusalem, and they are all his muse. From his home in
the Yemin Moshe neighborhood, a hillside of stone bungalows with
red-tiled roofs and long windows facing the Old City, Amichai just
watches and says nothing.
</P>
<P>
   With the future of Jerusalem in the hands of Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, and so many political analysts and ideologues
with opinions on sovereignty and sacred space, it seemed time to go
to Amichai for the poet's view on the city that is holy to three
faiths and a national symbol to two peoples.
</P>
<P>
   His passion as a writer _ mostly of poems but also of novels and
short stories _ has always been for the people whom these decisions
will affect the most _ the ones who live here.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai dwells in ``the small corners,'' as he puts it, of
Jerusalem, the human moments, the contact _ and the lack of it _
between people. How will they fare after all the negotiating is
done _ or undone _ and the city has to go on?
</P>
<P>
   So is Amichai hopeful?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopeful means nothing. Hopeful is too big a word. I have cut
it down to little hopes. One peaceful day with a breeze,'' says
Amichai. ``I don't look high, I look down. On a dish in a
restaurant. Buying vegetables from a woman in the Old City. At this
bougainvillea plant. My hopes are not like big stones, but little
stones ground up and made of cement that will support a whole
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked every little corner of Jerusalem,'' says Amichai,
slowly shuffling in from a terrace to sit in a bamboo chair. Two
fans are cooling him on a scorching hot day. ``I walked every
little corner of hope. And somewhere in there, that's where peace
will come from.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Amichai speak is to hear him form a poem, thoughts and
words carefully chosen and then arranged and presented in a slow,
raspy voice. But, put to the page, these words are more than
collections of poems; they have become part of the daily language
of modern Hebrew. They are woven into life here. He is Israel's
Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amichai is somebody who has managed to tap into the deepest
currents in this society, the greatest hopes and the deepest
sorrows, in a way that is simultaneously high literature and an
expression of the common soul,'' says Noga Tarnopolsky, an Israeli
writer and reviewer of literature and poetry who has just returned
from a fellowship at Amherst College.
</P>
<P>
   Lines from his poems have become proverbs voiced by people every
day. And he is alone among Israeli writers in having made a
contribution to modern Hebrew, a language that was re-created only
within the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Phrases such as, ``It's sad to be the mayor of Jerusalem,'' can
be heard just about any day, on any street corner or city bus. The
phrase conveys a resignation to the craziness of life in Jerusalem,
and is taken from one of his best-known poems, titled ``Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lines uttered among lovers and former lovers have been
etched into the collective consciousness, such as, ``A pity. We
were such a good invention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is loved. He is truly loved,'' says Ariel Hirschfeld, a
professor of literature at Hebrew University. ``It's probably hard
to understand how much outside of Israel. But it is an appreciation
across all of the generations of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``His poems are our slang, they are our popular wisdom,'' adds
Hirschfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai was born in Wurzburg, Germany, in 1924, and his family
immigrated to what was then Palestine in 1936, when it was under
the rule of the British Mandate of the League of Nations after
World War I. The family landed at the port of Haifa, and Amichai's
life has been woven into the history of this land ever since. He
has been part of Israel's struggle to exist, then to survive, and
now, as he puts it, to overcome the past and ``just live'' in the
``complicated mess'' that is Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He fought with the Jewish Brigade of the British Army in World
War II, and after discharge in 1946 he joined the Palmach, an elite
fighting unit of the emerging Jewish state. He fought in Israel's
1948 War of Independence on the southern front, in the Negev
region.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, he attended Hebrew University and studied
biblical texts and Hebrew literature. He held a series of teaching
positions, and through it all he sat down every day at an old
wooden desk, one he still has in his office, and wrote poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and in Other Days,'' his first volume of poetry, was
published in 1955 to very good reviews, and he has been a prominent
figure on Israel's literary landscape ever since. He is now
published in 37 languages and has been awarded the prestigious
Israel Prize. His most recent collection of poems, ``Open Closed
Open,'' was recently published in English.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other poets who are successful in their own time,
Amichai has his share of critics. Some have been known to scoff at
his poetry as facile, and too approachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a good poet for critics,'' says Tarnopolsky, who is
an admirer. ``He is so direct and so heartfelt that he touches
people, and doesn't give much work for critics who want to
deconstruct and explain. Amichai's poetry doesn't need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Amichai has written beautifully about Jerusalem, about love, but
also about war, especially the loss and the fear that come with
war. One poem, titled ``I Want to Die in My Own Bed,'' was seen by
some Israelis as a kind of betrayal of the Zionist cause.
</P>
<P>
   He is among the founders of Peace Now, the Israeli peace
movement that has pushed for justice and reconciliation among
Israelis and Palestinians, and in many ways he has sought to pave a
path toward the long, drawn-out negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a soldier in his soul. But he was always proud of
his service. He felt it a duty,'' says his wife, Hanna, who sat by
his side through an interview and cared for him through two years
of cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is in remission from lymphoma, but the deep lines
etched on his face tell of a long battle with illness. He still has
a proud profile, with the bent nose of a boxer. His skin has a warm
tone, like worn leather.
</P>
<P>
   He has a son and a daughter in their 20s, and an older son from
a previous marriage has given him his first grandchild. On
Saturday, the Sabbath, he gathers with his family.
</P>
<P>
   He is a staunch Zionist but not religious, he says, at least not
since he was a boy. Still, he has a stone on his desk with the
Hebrew word ``Amen'' etched into it. It is a 1,000-year-old
fragment from a Jewish cemetery in his hometown in Germany. It is
his talisman, a sandstone triangle that he unconsciously holds in
his hand, as if he were gauging its weight while he talks.
</P>
<P>
   His father was an Orthodox Jew, and Amichai's poetry seems drawn
to the mystery of faith, and to prayer. Asked about his father, he
smiles and says, ``We had such love.'' But Amichai struggles with
the religion of his father, warming his hands by its fire but
pulling away and yelling in lyrical verse when it burns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Amichai's poetry is Jerusalem. He is a scribe in the
Holy City with an ability to see life from many perspectives, and
in that sense he has opened Israel up to the possibilities of peace
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai has, on occasion, done readings with the Palestinian
poet laureate Mahmud Darwish. But he does not see two poets getting
together for a select group of academic elites as true peace. That,
he says, has to come from the people, from the streets, and from
those ``small corners of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most enduring poems is titled simply ``Jerusalem.''
At the end of a long, hot day, he reads it aloud:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a roof in the Old City
</P>
<P>
   Laundry hanging in the late afternoon sunlight:

<P>
   The white sheet of a woman who is my enemy,
</P>
<P>
   The towel of a man who is my enemy,

<P>
   To wipe off the sweat on his brow.
</P>
<P>
   In the sky of the Old City
</P>
<P>
   A kite.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the string,
</P>
<P>
   A child.

IN NEW ECONOMY, MORE IS DEMANDED OF ANALYSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The job of a stock analyst used to entail, well, analyzing
stocks. But there's more to it than that in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   With venture capitalists pumping money into a host of ambitious
technology start-ups, analysts for investment bankers increasingly
must have a handle on promising companies before they go public.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jim Kedersha. He recently left SG Cowen's Boston-based
research group to start a communications technology group for local
rival Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill. Adams wants him and his new recruits
to be gurus of the hot telecom sector, with perspectives that can
reach from the big, established companies to the emerging companies
Adams, Harkness takes public and follows for its investment
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a view on the new players in the industry,
which are often private,'' Kedersha says. ``The opportunity for
someone to come out of left field with a disruptive technology is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites successes such as Sycamore Networks Inc. and Juniper
Networks as telecom companies that took the market by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Kedersha just lured one of his Cowen colleagues, Blaine Carroll,
a wireless expert, to join him at Adams, Harkness. His focus is on
convergence, where voice, data, and video meet and are transmitted
through wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says clients have a range of investments, and they often
want to know not just the outlook for a particular stock, but what
buyouts of private firms mean for bigger companies, such as Cisco,
Nortel, and Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably one of the funnest parts of this business _
going out and meeting the privates,'' Carroll says.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, Harkness has gone fishing for talent at Cowen before. A
few years ago, the firm hired three biotech analysts from Cowen to
build its expertise in what is again a high-profile business,
particularly since the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Research is a route to greater credibility in the market, even
for regional brokers, and, with any luck, to more investment
banking business. Boston-based Tucker Anthony Sutro last week
announced it had recruited two new analysts to beef up its Internet
investment banking resources.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, Harkness now has 18 analysts, up from 14 a year ago. The
firm has been enjoying a higher profile in recent years as a
technology and health-care investment banker. And the firm's tech
conferences are drawing huge crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lead with research and follow with banking,'' says Matt
Patsky, research chief at Adams, Harkness. With the new telecom
group, he notes: ``We will be very active in the banking space. It
will be very much dictated by the research analysts'
(contributions).''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it is the job of investment bankers to find and woo
companies that are preparing to sell shares to the public. But
there are so many young companies in the Boston area market now _
particularly in telecom and Internet-related businesses _ that
analysts can be an important source of deal flow, too.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting companies and meeting with their executives,
Kedersha explains: ``If we think highly of them, that's when we try
to see if there's any role for us that fits in on the investment
banking side.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been struggling to hold on to analysts, as
research talent is in high demand among venture capitalists,
consultants, and a new cottage industry of consulting analysts that
has sprung up around the Internet. Start-ups now regularly plan
visits to pay their respects at firms such as IDC, Forrester
Research, and Gartner Group, much as they make the rounds on Wall
Street, before going public.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen's research chief did not return a call seeking comment
about the recent departures.
</P>
<P>
   Kedersha and Carroll said they left because Cowen, since its
acquisition by French banking giant Societe Generale, is doing
bigger investment banking deals. The analysts are more interested
in emerging companies, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The added draw, Kedersha said: ``It's a smaller shop, more
focused. We have the opportunity to build something from scratch.''

AUTOMAKERS MAKE THEIR PLAY ON NET 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ You're not supposed to laugh at this, but
big car makers including General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler-Daimler
are thinking they could be the next big Internet companies of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that as traffic and the mobile lifestyle make many
of us spend ever more time in our cars, the automobile will join
the office, home, and wireless phone as a place where we want _ and
demand _ access to the convenience, information, and entertainment
of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford, for example, already offer services to luxury car
owners providing emergency roadside assistance and directions with
so-called telematics devices. IBM, Microsoft, Motorola, and
old-line car accessory makers such as Delphi are pouring millions
of dollars into joint ventures to roll out new car-Web services,
such as e-mail and Net access.
</P>
<P>
   But especially compared to Europe and Japan, the US market has
only begun to develop. GM's OnStar service, for example, counted
only 200,000 customers earlier this year, and Ford has yet to
launch its Wingcast venture with Qualcomm. Most systems out there
are limited to what small slices of the Web, or special in-house
services, your carmaker has arranged to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian company called SmartMove earlier this year opened a US
subsidiary in Kendall Square that aims to become a key player in
the field by creating a unified platform for bringing a vast array
of information sources into your car.
</P>
<P>
   SmartMove envisions cars outfitted with a miniature touch-screen
device that is connected to everything from FM radio to wireless
phones to satellites to special short-range communications services
you might use at a gas station to download a movie for the kids'
back-seat TV set.
</P>
<P>
   But it would not necessarily make these devices or produce the
content delivered to cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, SmartMove hopes to become a king of the hill with its
plans for equipping so-called communication and control centers
that companies such as Ford and GM, or maybe America Online or
AT&AMP;T, would use to bring together a vast array of services to
deliver to your car through five or 10 communications modes. The
system would also handle connecting and billing you for them.
</P>
<P>
   By incorporating the Java computer code, which simplifies
writing programs to run on numerous devices and systems, SmartMove
hopes to create the common operating system that pretty much all
carmakers and vendors say they want but remain far from coming to
terms on.
</P>
<P>
   Today you might have an on-board navigation system running off
compact disks stored in the trunk, plus a global positioning
satellite receiver, not to mention a car phone and a radio and
maybe a port for your wireless Palm Pilot (or a passenger seat for
your wirelessly connected laptop computer).
</P>
<P>
   SmartMove hopes to make the system that enables you to put all
of those functions in a single box in your dashboard _ with
speech-recognition technology included so you can use your voice
and ears to get much of the information and keep your hands on the
wheel and eyes on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot have 100 hardware modules in my car,'' says
SmartMove's Luc De Brouckere. Likewise, there are many services you
would rather have delivered from satellites or special FM radio
channels rather than from expensive cell-phone airtime. ``You want
to have a car that can have an interface on several levels,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   One of SmartMove's innovative system features is software
allowing people to subscribe to services when they want them. For
example, instead of spending $30 every month to be connected to a
Web-based navigational aid showing where you are on a computer
screen map, you might only turn it on for $2 a pop when you are
driving someplace unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, instead of paying GM $35 every month for OnStar
monitoring that instantly alerts operators whenever your air bags
are deployed _ and uses GPS to help them tell an ambulance exactly
where you are _ you might be happier to spend $5 calling 911 only
when you really need 911.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond what can be sent to the car, industry officials also
think there could be a market for data sent from cars: real-time
reports from actual vehicles about how fast they are driving on
highways for traffic reports, or data on where people are using
their windshield wipers _ and at what setting _ to help forecasting
companies develop super-precise weather readings.
</P>
<P>
   A new report issued last month by UBS Warburg LLC estimated that
automotive telematics revenues will explode over the next 10 years
in the United States, from $280 million in subscriber revenues this
year to $21.7 billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, automotive industry leaders are convinced there is a
potential gold mine in going beyond selling people $20,000 cars
every five years to also selling them $25 Internet-access packages
every month, or $5 movie and music rentals for long trips. The idea
is not just to sell you a car you live in two hours a day, but to
make money off the time they have you captive.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have been selling steel and rubber for 100 years,''
says SmartMove marketing executive Bart Stevens. ``Now they want to
move on to bits and bytes, and the sky is the limit to come up with
new services.''

YOU, TOO, CAN BE A `SPACE COWBOY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are 55 or older and dreamed of being a space cowboy, it's
time to stop fantasizing and join the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys,'' the hit movie about older astronauts
returning to space can be a near reality for just about any older
person who's ready to pull up to five ``Gs,'' fly an Advanced
Flight Simulator, or direct a lunar rover mission. And it's all
held in _ you won't believe this _ Togo, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   And, you don't have to follow the yellow brick road to find
this, just call Elderhostel and sign up for the Astronaut Training
Program held at the Smithsonian affiliate Kansas Cosmosphere and
Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   The program is based on one that has been offered to middle
school students for 16 years, and as a senior astronaut you'll
perform stress tests in the Centrifuge, a G-force trainer that
pulls up to five Gs, work in teams in the Cosmosphere's Mission
Control, fly the Advanced Flight simulator housed in an actual
F-101 cockpit, and direct a lunar rover mission much like the Mars
Pathfinder. The week ends with a pace shuttle mission aboard a
motion-based shuttle simulator, the Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 33 people ages 57 to 89 from 13 states are on the
mission of their life. The program's cost is quite reasonable. If
you live nearby, it's just $290 a person; from out of town, it's
$440 and that includes a room, meals, and transportation to and
from Cosmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmosphere is located in the prairie town of Hutchinson, about
50 miles northwest of Wichita, and houses the largest space
artifact collection outside the Smithsonian Institution's National
Air and Space Museum. The center tells the story of the Space Race
between the United States and the former Soviet Union from early
rocketry to the present and examines the future of space
exploration. Among exhibits are the largest collection of Russian
space artifacts in the Western world, a full set of Mercury,
Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft and German V-1 and V-2 rockets.
</P>
<P>
   There are four Elderhostel programs a year, with three still
upcoming. For information, call Elderhostel director Helen Unruh at
800-397-0330, ext. 319, or visit www.cosmo.org/elderhostel.htm.

SURE, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ There was a pause during the recent questioning of
Charles J. Haughey at Dublin Castle, where he is being asked to
explain how he managed to solicit at least $12 million from
businessmen during the three terms he served as Ireland's prime
minister, and Haughey's eyes drifted skyward.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to briefly regard the imposing chandeliers that hang
from the ceiling at Georges Hall where the tribunal investigating
widespread corruption in Ireland is sitting, and one could not help
thinking those chandeliers and the chiaroscuro paintings that adorn
the green walls were the very sort of things that Charlie Haughey
once had handed to him by wealthy businessmen currying his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him on the witness stand, it was striking to note the
parallels between Haughey, the most charismatic, controversial
Irish politician of the 20th century, and James Michael Curley, the
most charismatic, controversial Irish-American politician of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Curley, the son of Irish immigrants, was elected governor of
Massachusetts once and mayor of Boston four times, the last time
while he was under indictment on corruption charges. He served a
term in Congress, and a term in prison for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey served three terms as Ireland's prime minister, or
taoiseach, during the 1980s and 1990s, despite having been indicted
on, and controversially acquitted of, charges that he ran guns to
the IRA in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey was, like Curley, a rogue, a man who used his public
position for private gain. But, like Irish-Americans, the native
Irish love a rogue, especially when he's one of their own. Curley's
cheeky, subversive campaign slogan, ``Vote often and early for
Curley,'' played on that sympathy for rogues. It also sounded like
something that could have been dreamed up in the members bar at
Leinster House, home to the Dail, Ireland's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Curley grew up poor but studied well. He was smart, erudite, and
one of the greatest orators in American politics. Still, the best
thing you can say about a Boston pol is that he never forgot where
he came from, and Curley never forgot where he came from. His
compassion for the poor was genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Curley first got into trouble in public life when he got caught
impersonating an Irish immigrant at a civil service examination.
The Protestant Brahmin establishment was horrified by Curley's
audacity. But to the first- and second-generation immigrants living
in the tenements of South Boston, Charlestown and Roxbury, where
Curley grew up, his fraud was an act of compassion, the work of a
politician who cared deeply about the plight of those struggling to
get a foothold in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Having been born into poverty, Curley never lost his empathy for
the poor. As mayor, he built Boston City Hospital, vowing that no
one would be denied medical care, regardless of their ability to
pay. That Curley shamelessly extorted money from the
Brahmin-controlled banks and property developers to underwrite his
philanthropy never seemed to bother most Bostonians. Nor did the
fact that Curley, like Haughey, enriched himself in the process. If
anything, Curley's storied shakedowns of bankers and developers
enhanced his reputation among the immigrants who by the 1930s had
assimilated and formed the biggest voting bloc in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When, 60 years apart, Curley's and Haughey's coat holders found
their heroes facing charges of corruption, they defended them by
noting how much each had done for the poor and elderly. Along with
their defenders, both Curley and Haughey seemed to share a healthy
sense of entitlement, believing that their help of the poor and
their positions of enormous responsibility somehow excused their
acceptance of enormous sums of money from rich businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Both Haughey and Curley exploited the inherent bias against rich
people in their own constituencies. Some years ago, when I told my
mother that there was overwhelming evidence that Curley had used
his position to extort millions of dollars from banks and property
developers, her response was telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for James Michael Curley,'' said my mother, the daughter
of immigrants from Galway. ``What did the banks ever do for the
poor people?''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in Dublin, I heard variations of the same theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your man Charlie's all right,'' a man in O'Reilly's pub in
Sandymount told me. ``Sure, they were all stealing. He's no worse
than the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fintan O'Toole recently pointed out in The Irish Times,
Haughey was the product of a Fianna Fail party whose members relish
their revolutionary past, who see themselves as rebels even though
they have, more than any other party, run the Republic of Ireland
since 26 of Ireland's 32 counties won independence from Britain in
1922. It is a delusion, rooted deeply in folk myth.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Curley was portraying the Boston Irish as exploited
victims of the Protestant Brahmin establishment long after the
Irish had pushed the Yankees aside to assume political control of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is true the Irish were treated shabbily when they first
arrived in Boston in large numbers, after the potato blight in
Ireland that began in 1845. But the Irish worked hard, and through
sheer numbers and political savvy were able to make Boston their
own. Hugh O'Brien and Patrick Collins, the first immigrants to
break the Brahmin hold on City Hall, and the only Irish-born mayors
of Boston, were conciliatory toward their former oppressors,
seeking a partnership that would mutually benefit the Yankee
establishment and the mostly poor but industrious immigrant
community.
</P>
<P>
   But, by the 1930s, when Curley had become the most charismatic
and powerful mayor the city had ever seen, he continued to appeal
to the worst instincts of the Irish, playing them off against other
ethnic groups and telling them that only his continued hold on the
reins of power would ensure that they got their fair share from the
Brahmins.
</P>
<P>
   Second- and third-generation immigrants, especially the Irish,
kept Curley in power, even while the establishment railed that he
was corrupt. He played their vulnerability, their fondness for
rogues, like a virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey did the same in Ireland, winking and nodding and getting
rich while presiding over a country that in the 1980s was among the
poorest in Europe, with an unemployment rate of 20 percent. While
the Irish were putting their children on boats and planes so they
could find work in London, Boston, New York, and just about every
major city in the world, Haughey was lining his $200 million
mansion on 300 acres north of Dublin with priceless works of art,
much of it handed to him by businessmen whom he claims sought no
favors.
</P>
<P>
   Like Haughey, Curley loved the finer things in life: good food,
fine art, exotic travel. And like Curley, who was forever telling
people of his spartan lifestyle, Haughey didn't seem to think his
lifestyle was extravagant at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lavish lifestyle,'' Haughey told a lawyer for
the tribunal. ``My work was my lifestyle and when I was in office I
worked every day, all day. There was no room for any sort of an
extravagant lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Curley justified his luxury ocean cruises and trips to Europe
with similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if all politics is local, all corruption is relative.
Like Curley, Haughey did good, too. Haughey was a creative finance
minister between 1966-70, introducing free travel, cheap fuel, and
free electricity for the elderly and tax breaks for artists.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Haughey did many good things for Ireland,
just as there is no doubt that Curley helped many Bostonians. But
both men were swamped by a change of tide in public opinion. By the
1950s, as Americans became more educated and affluent than ever,
petty corruption by public officials became widely frowned upon. In
his ``Last Hurrah'' campaign for a fifth term as Boston mayor,
Curley was defeated at the polls by John B. Hynes in a
138,000-126,000 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government put him in jail and he came out a broke
and broken man. He died virtually penniless, though his wake was an
impressive tribute. Bob Lawler, the Boston undertaker who became
Curley's surrogate son after his own father died when he was 11,
remembers how thousands of people lined up to view Curley's body at
the Statehouse rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had tears in their eyes,'' Lawler recalled. ``They were
saying, `We love you Jim.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Curley had nine children. All but one of them died young, before
he did. He had no grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that Haughey's demise will be as sad as Curley's.
But just as Bostonians tired of their politicians lining their
pockets, so, too, does it seem the Irish people have said enough is
enough, that the days of furtive exchanges of cash in parking lots
is over.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if Haughey will follow Curley's footsteps
into prison. Curley emerged from prison unrepentant, and went on to
write his autobiography, which he called, ``I'd Do It Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Haughey may not go to jail, but if he ever writes his
autobiography, he'd be hard-pressed to come up with a better title.

 SYDNEY: ... as an example.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are four worm farms, including two at the main press
center and one at the Novotel Hotel at Homebush Bay, a javelin
throw from the Olympic Stadium. Their combined effect on waste
reduction, when compared to the 10,000 tons of waste anticipated at
the Olympic venues, will be something like removing a fraction of a
grain of salt from a super-sized Big Mac meal.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials, however, say the worms are only a tiny part
of the effort, despite their appeal to journalists looking for a
story. Organizers say they hope to recycle or compost fully 80
percent of the waste generated at the Games using more traditional
means.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite its general praise for the work at Homebush Bay,
Greenpeace Australia last month gave Games organizers an overall
grade of ``C'' for environmental performance _ one activist called
it a ``bronze medal.'' The grade was based on goals Olympic
organizers had set for themselves with Greenpeace's participation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace grades for individual elements of the Olympic effort
ranged from an A-plus for the athletes' village to Fs for
abandoning plans for a solar power station, and placing a
volleyball stadium in the middle of Sydney's Bondi Beach, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they've crossed the line in terms of delivering
Green Games, but they haven't delivered on everything they promised
to the world,'' said Posner, the Greenpeace official.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace's biggest complaint was aimed at the presence of air
conditioning and refrigeration units that contain chemicals that
deplete the ozone layer and contribute to the buildup of greenhouse
gases. ``That's a real disappointment,'' Posner said. ``None of the
air conditioning on site will comply with their own guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Bland, the Olympic environmental spokesman, acknowledged that
was ``the biggest downfall in terms of construction and
development.'' But he said the blame should be shifted onto
Australia's air conditioning and refrigeration industry, which he
said failed to make cleaner equipment available.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, officials of Olympic sponsor Coca-Cola _ the
largest user of refrigeration units at the site _ promised to phase
out greenhouse gases called HFCs in all its new cold drink
equipment in time for the Athens Olympic Games in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace also faulted organizers for failing to move more
quickly to clean up what it described as ``hundreds of tons'' of
dioxin still contaminating the land and mud around Homebush Bay. In
1997, Greenpeace discovered 69 barrels of highly toxic materials
abandoned on a peninsula adjacent to Homebush Bay, and Greenpeace
officials said they remain there, untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said cleanup work has been planned, and the government of
New South Wales, the Australian state where Sydney is located, has
committed $14 million for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said Greenpeace ``has a legitimate position because they
were there at the beginning of the process and now they're there at
the end.'' However, he dismissed the group's overall conclusions as
``a bit of a whinge,'' an Australian term for whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fairly cheap publicity ploy,'' Bland said. ``At the
end of this process, I think it's pretty clear we've set a new
benchmark, not just for the Olympics, but for any major new
development.''

A HEATED DISCUSSION OVER THE SUN AND THE EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Somewhere in the Bible the prediction is made that the sun
will one day shine sevenfold in its strength. I'm curious to know
if that would result in an arithmetic or geometric increase in
heat. In other words, if it were 100 degrees Fahrenheit outside,
would it then become 700 degrees, or greater, due to factors of
which I am ignorant?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Ayer, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, while I'm not a Biblical scholar (I'm Dr. Knowledge,
not the Reverend Knowledge or Rabbi Knowledge), I can certainly
shed some light (sorry for the pun) on the science of your
question. When something emits light because it's hot, the amount
of power it emits goes up with the fourth power of the temperature.
That is to say, if you double the temperature of a hot metal rod,
it will emit 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 (EQ) 16 times as much energy
per unit time as it did when it was cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing backwards, to get the sun to be seven times brighter,
you need to find what number, when multiplied by itself four times,
will give you 7. That will be by how much the temperature of the
sun will go up and a quick tap at the calculator will tell you that
the temperature of the sun will be about 1.6 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   Now how about the Earth? Here things get a little trickier:
Suppose that over the course of a day, the Earth warms up by 50
degrees Fahrenheit as a result of the light it receives from the
sun. In other words, let's say you have a warm night of 50 F, and
reach 100 F during the day. Now, if the Earth receives seven times
as much energy during the day, you'd expect the temperature to go
up by 350 F and get to around 400 F, and you're going to get
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Then things will get complicated. The polar caps will certainly
melt, the oceans will boil, and the air will have lots of water
vapor in it. Most living things will start to die, and it's hard to
tell what will happen to the relative amount of greenhouse gases. A
detailed computer simulation would be needed to make detailed
predictions. Of course, if the sun were to get that much brighter,
it would have to be the result of something gone very wrong, like
it had reached a late stage in its life when it might turn into a
red giant. In this case, it would actually be cooler, but the
apparent brightness would be greater as it swallowed up the Earth
and fried us all horribly.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a brighter sun sounds like a very, very bad thing to
me.

THE FUTURES MARKET FOR PRESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ See if this doesn't ring a bell as a novel way of
describing the atmosphere as the presidential campaign heads down
the stretch starting today:
</P>
<P>
   The futures market in the Midwest that politics-crazed tea-leaf
readers love to follow was delightfully confusing as the Labor Day
weekend began.
</P>
<P>
   Not the one for pork bellies, the one for presidents.
</P>
<P>
   A single ``contract'' on the next American presidency, paying a
dollar on the popular vote victor, was available for about 49.9
cents assuming it's a Republican, and 49.5 cents for a Democrat. It
doesn't get any closer than that, unless it's the 50.1 cents for
each at which the market closed Thursday at midnight. If that
sounds like a market forecast of the popular vote, that's because
it basically is.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, the Republican contract was getting much
more bidding attention. As of Aug. 17, the day of Al Gore's
acceptance speech, the spread was 57-44 in the Republican
direction. But then it began switching steadily in the weeks that
followed, producing the current muddle.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty at the University of Iowa's business school has been
running this market for years, drawing a useful basis for election
forecasting. People put real money (up to a $500 limit) on the
line, and not just casually guess, and the market is dynamic,
updated every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A futures market is one thing. A resort to the operation of the
economy to divine political trends seems more fanciful.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is the economy, measured the right way, is even
more reliable as a guide to voting behavior in the presidential
elections. This is unsettling, if only because economic determinism
is not exactly an apple pie concept in this country. Most of us
prefer campaigns as narratives of a contest between two individuals
that usually seesaw back and forth in a contest where opinion polls
keep score. In this view, the campaign in all of its grandeur and
baloney is the key.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another way of looking at presidential campaigns
and that's as referendums on the condition of the country. Oriented
more toward the crucial quarter of the electorate that is capable
of voting for either candidate, the issue assumes the two nominees
are basically capable fellows and frames the question as whether
the in party should stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where political economists can help. Defined the right
way, usually by some measurement of personal economic health as
opposed to aggregate production or employment levels, the track
record for numerous models that have evolved in recent decades is
eerily accurate _ as if the campaign itself was inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, the economy-based models are coming up Al Gore
over George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   These models have been correct through many a campaign that
appeared dead even on Labor Day, but there is widespread uneasiness
about them this year for reasons that go much deeper than Bush's
long domination of the early polls until quite recently.
</P>
<P>
   Several major Bush campaign figures, most notably adviser and
pollster Fred Steeper, assert that prosperity is such an ingrained
reality this year that it has lost the political pull it exerted
when the business cycle was more real to people. They point to huge
disparities between the large majorities who think the country is
headed in the right direction, who give President Clinton high job
approval marks, and the comparable majorities who think the
country's moral climate stinks and give Clinton low personal
approval numbers. They also believe the prosperous economy has
freed voters to emphasize other concerns _ hence the campaign's
message of ``restoring honor and dignity to the White House'' and
on improving education.
</P>
<P>
   But the models don't go away. A state economy specialist firm
called Dismal Scientist has a reliable model that forecasts the
Electoral College. Its emphasis is on the performance of a basic
measure of the standard of living _ inflation-adjusted changes in
personal income in per capita terms _ with weights for inflation,
recent stock market performance and an allowance for incumbency.
Its latest projection is 356-182 for Gore, based on 52.7 percent of
the two-party vote total.
</P>
<P>
   Another one, by Sweden-based professor Douglas Hibbs further
adjusts the personal income data for federal taxes and looks at the
record throughout the current presidential term. Gore's vote share
is at roughly 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even those models that try to make allowances for a vague desire
for change through weights that factor in the duration of the in
party's lack of an incumbent on the ballot and other concepts are
still coming up for Gore because the economy's performance this
year keeps strengthening beyond expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush went negative in his campaign. Perhaps it
reflected his campaign's belief that people want better leadership.
But perhaps it also reflected his campaign's discovery that the
fundamentals are beginning to apply.

DIRTY POLITICS, BUSH-STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON -- The last time George W. Bush played dirty, he at
least arranged a protective veneer and a convenient pretext.
</P>
<P>
   This time he has done neither. It may work, it may not; but it
is a huge, revealing gamble.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain can recount the story as only a victim can. This
time around, Al Gore has had the good fortune to see it all coming.
The differences are important.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's landslide in New Hampshire, the Bush campaign
limped home to Austin, where communications adviser Karen Hughes
devised a brilliant new image _ albeit in contravention of the
facts _ that Bush was himself a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real campaign behind that convenient veneer was to slam
McCain for his apostasy on tax cuts and rally the Right to crush
him. When an initial Bush probe in South Carolina produced an
unthinking, angry response from McCain in the form of a TV ad
comparing Bush to the evil Bill Clinton, the governor pounced with
an attack-ad campaign that lasted straight through the primaries in
early March. McCain wasted less than $50,000 falling into the trap;
Bush spent millions springing it as the reluctant epitome of
injured innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room guy stuff that permeates Bushdom, they like
to call this maneuver jujitsu _ an easy parry and then a reversing,
overwhelming thrust.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to assault Al Gore's character, integrity and
honesty was different.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushies were horrified when the numbers came in from the
Democratic convention. The numbers that mattered were not those
that defined Gore's remarkable bounce from the convention in the
horserace. What produced the horror were two sets of so-called
``internals'' from their data. The first was the sharp increase in
favorable opinion about Gore as a person and as a leader; the
second was the sharp shift in attitudes on issues that left Bush at
a disadvantage on major domestic issues from his beloved education
to social security to tax cuts to health care.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to lose the clear advantage and be facing a
truly close campaign; but it was something else to be facing a
dynamic in the ``internals'' that all pols believe is the precursor
to something much worse.
</P>
<P>
   What is not generally understood is that Bush was ready to go
negative within three days of adjournment in Los Angeles. The
campaign produced a dreadful commercial about honesty, whose
last-instant rejection by Bush tipped Gore to what was coming. It
also obliterated the last fig leaf of distinction between a
campaign's ``own'' advertising and the stuff we used to be told was
nominally ``independent'' from its political party. Produced by a
media group inside the Republican National Committee that tried to
push the same stuff on Bob Dole four years ago, the fact that the
specific ad was rejected after it had already been fed to nearly
400 TV stations was less important than that character attacks were
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's unsteady, foggy communication out of the box after LA
only reinforced the decision to go negative on character.
</P>
<P>
   On the assumption less of cynicism than that we are all
grownups, the attack ad running in 17 states this weekend is hardly
grounds for grand jury action. There have been, and will be, much
worse. Gore may even end up responding in kind, a decision you can
be assured will be made on tactical grounds, not clean-campaign
purity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign's response to date is revealing.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing it did was get completely out of the way in a
newsmaking sense, so the story was the Bush TV ad. The second thing
Gore did was to put off a Democratic Party ad on Bush's
increasingly muddled record as governor of Texas. In the black arts
of politics, the rule of thumb is that it's not negative to argue
about issues and records or claim distortion of same; it's when it
gets purely personal that the word appropriately applies. Even
another, updated Democratic reminder about Texas reality was deemed
a distraction for a holiday weekend now dominated by the Bush
decision.
</P>
<P>
   And third, Gore did not waste effort playing gotcha games with
the 30-second ad, conspicuously not seeking attention for a
counterclaim that he in fact raised not a dime at the temple in
Southern California and that he never claimed to have invented the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself is behaving defensively. The ad is described as
tongue-in-check and actually just a counterattack. It is neither.
Listen to Bush himself these days on the road, no longer selling a
dream for every willing heart but the message that ``Clinton-Gore''
was a failure of leadership and seven years of squandered promise.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to admit admit to the ``N'' word, he says, ``I guess it
all depends on your definition of negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?

FOR BILL CLINTON, NEXT TERM ... HARVARD! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy anticipated an early retirement, yoked by the
22d Amendment to two terms in office, destined to be an
ex-president at 51. It was a frightening thought: Politically
ripened before his time, he'd be too young to hunker down to the
homestead like Eisenhower and Truman.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Kennedy's thoughts drifted to Harvard
University, the school that gave him his intellectual credibility
and social allure. After leading the free world, he mused to his
secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, he could lead the academic world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost four decades later, Bill Clinton is pondering an early,
unwanted ex-presidency, as a far less majestic figure in an
admittedly less majestic age.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a fateful confluence of events, Harvard is commencing a
wide-open search for a new president, a job that usually opens up
every decade or two.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the image seems all wrong: Clinton, all Bubba
and baggage, in the crimson gowns of an institution that rivals the
Vatican for pomp and veiled intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an idea that, like a well-crafted piece of legislation,
could serve both parties well _ and serve some larger purposes as
well.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, it would present a new challenge, so vital to
harnessing his restless energies. Without such a stimulant, even
his supporters can envision a Dante-like descent into tabloid hell,
in which the aging and portly former president gets hounded through
a series of embarrassing personal degradations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose level of introspection is unusual for a
politician, gave voice to his fears of a lonely retirement during
his meeting with ministers on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I will miss more than anything is the job,'' he said. ``I
loved the job. I love it every day. My biggest problem now is that
I hate to go to sleep at night. I want to _ you know, I go to bed
and I sit there reading for hours. I just keep working. I'm trying
to do everything I can before I leave. I have loved the work.''
</P>
<P>
   He added later, ``And the other thing that I'll really miss is
the opportunity, on a regular and consistent basis, to come in
contact with every conceivable kind of being. I hope that I can
find something to do when I leave office which will at least keep
me in contact with different kinds of people who have different
interests and know different things, from whom I can continue to
learn and for whom I can continue to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   But where to find them? The usual paths for former presidents
don't suit Clinton. He's unlikely to hole up and write book after
book like Richard Nixon, even if he develops a Nixon-like desire to
wash away his sins in a mad volley of spin. Financially, he may
have cut a deal with a MacDougal or two, but it's hard to believe
Clinton would get much satisfaction from fattening his bank account
by giving paid speeches and serving on corporate boards, like
Gerald Ford and the pre-Alzheimers Ronald Reagan. Jimmy Carter's
tool belt is an odd fit, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard would whet his every appetite. And the university needs
him, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost axiomatic that, to achieve an education, academic
studies must be leavened with a dose of practicality. Harvard
remains, in most eyes, America's preeminent university, but many
inside and outside the university believe its undergraduate program
lacks sufficient shape and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   With its copious endowment and nonstop succession of
billion-dollar fund drives, Harvard grows programs on top of
programs. Subjects like human rights get spread around among scores
of rival departments, schools, and institutions. The university's
proponents, including Provost Harvey Fineberg, describe it like a
giant buffet table, with bountiful treats for the choosing.
</P>
<P>
   But not all students are capable of nourishing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The current president, Neil Rudenstine, made it his mission upon
taking office 10 years ago to bring more order to undergraduate
education. But his path inevitably touched on the defiant fiefdoms
of many deans, who have broad powers under Harvard's diffuse
governing structure. In some eyes, Rudenstine made progress. But in
the wake of his resignation last spring, he's been praised more for
achieving prosperity than unity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is uniquely positioned to tether Harvard to the real
world. He's famously at home in the realm of ideas. He's also
famous for never once forgetting the price of milk.
</P>
<P>
   As a fund-raiser, he'd have no peer. And the most imperious
deans would easily submit to his charms and manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Born poor, Clinton is also a living role model for the kind of
transformation that universities can help bring about. As the
journalist Nicholas Lemann has pointed out, in the 1960s, around
the time that current Republican presidential hopeful George W.
Bush was arriving at Yale, the Ivy League was undergoing change.
People like Bush, buoyed by prep schools and family legacies, were
suddenly in the minority. While elite universities had always made
room for academic achievers of different backgrounds, those
students were never really part of the dominant culture. By the
late '60s and early '70s, a new meritocracy was taking over and, in
the process, rescuing the Ivy League from the fate of outmoded
social clubs everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary Clinton, then studying at Yale Law School, were
avatars of the new meritocracy. And as such, they stand at the
intersection of thought and deed; they represent academic power
merged with middle-class bustle.
</P>
<P>
   For Harvard, especially in the oddly atavistic class mind-set of
Boston, elitism is still the wolf at the door. Without an ongoing
push to modernize and diversify, top-notch universities run the
risk of obsolescence: Strivers could always decide to get their
schooling elsewhere. The new economy, so hostile to other
hierarchies, has been quite friendly to the traditional academic
powerhouses; but the new economy remains fluid, dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard would be well guided by Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no evidence he is even under consideration by
the presidential search committee formed recently by the Harvard
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything about Bill Clinton being a candidate
but that doesn't preclude anything,'' said Harvard spokeswoman
Rebecca Rollins. ``Harvard Corporation is sitting down and thinking
about the type of qualities they're looking for. I have no idea if
they've even interviewed anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the chair of the search committee, Robert G. Stone Jr.,
did describe the qualities the committee seeks in a letter to the
university community. And they were decidedly Clintonesque: ``We
will, of course, be seeking a person of high intellectual
distinction, with proven qualities of leadership, a devotion to
excellence in education and research, a capacity to guide a complex
institution through a time of significant change, and a dedication
to the ideals and values vital to a community of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, of course, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, with its
lingering threat of a post-presidency indictment, renders Clinton
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I can't imagine it,'' offered Sheldon Stern, the
recently retired historian at the John F. Kennedy Library. ``It
would be a very controversial move. If not for the scandal, then
sure. But I think that erases everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. The job of university president these days bears
little resemblance to a scoutmaster. And wasn't it Harvard
professors who took the lead in insisting the Clinton had committed
no legal offense? Law professor Charles Ogletree represented
defendants before special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Alan Dershowitz
wrote a book decrying ``Moral McCarthyism.''
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is the university that responded to news that its
Divinity School dean was stockpiling pornography on his office
computer by expressing outrage not over the offense, but over the
investigation. Free speech, not morality, was at issue for much of
the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree that Clinton would be at home in such an
environment. Few would disagree that Clinton, with his
still-febrile ambitions, would accept the job with relish.
</P>
<P>
   Would Harvard dare to make the offer?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There were two things he always noticed, Carlton Fisk
said, when he played at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Jimmy Fund sign, and the retired numbers of Red Sox greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when there was nothing else in this ballpark,
except the Jimmy Fund sign and those numbers,'' the Hall of Fame
catcher said Monday. ``That's all there was to look at. Never in a
million years do you think your number is going to go up there with
those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million years went by quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's No. 27 joined the numbers of Bobby Doerr (1), Joe Cronin
(4), Carl Yastrzemski (8), and Ted Williams (9) on the facing of
the right-field roof, a place reserved for the most select of Red
Sox ballplayers. That combination, 1-4-8-9-27, undoubtedly will
appear on lottery tickets throughout a six-state region this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big old handsome, methodical, fiery, Yankee New
Englander,'' as Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette called him,
was honored in a pregame ceremony that brought Fisk onto the field
from behind the center-field wall to the dramatic strains of
``Fanfare for the Common Man'' by composer Aaron Copland.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of proceeding directly to the podium set up behind
second base by groundskeeper Joe Mooney, Fisk took a detour and
made his way along the right-field grandstand railing, slapping
hands with spectators, until he reached the first-base dugout,
where Sox players, including native New Englanders Rico Brogna and
Lou Merloni, stood and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek would later wear his socks with
the stripes showing in imitation of Fisk, a 10-time All-Star who
played 2,236 games, a record for a catcher, 1,078 of those with the
Sox. The Chicago White Sox, the team with which he finished his
career, already have retired his No. 72.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk stood in front of the dugout, facing the crowd, and patted
his heart in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a chance to see too many of those people in the
outfield,'' Fisk said. ``The dugout-to-dugout fans, I doubt they're
probably the same people, but I used to call the people behind home
plate my people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's family, including his parents, Cecil and Leona; his wife,
Linda; his daughters, Carlyn and Courtney; and his son, Casey, all
occupied seats of honor, along with Red Sox CEO John Harrington,
Duquette, and Carl Yastrzemski, Fisk's Hall of Fame teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the game the right way,'' Yastrzemski, his hair dyed
black, said in his speech, ``both behind the plate and at the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's voice thickened with emotion as he invoked the
names of Tom and Jean Yawkey, the former Sox owner and his wife. It
was after the death of Tom Yawkey that Fisk left the Red Sox under
bitter circumstances, signing as a free agent with the Chicago
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70s were a time of turmoil and turnover,'' Fisk would say
later at a press conference. ``Mr. Yawkey died. If there was one
person I wish could be here, it was him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Ted Williams also was not present, but during the
ceremony he called the ballpark. Among those who attended were
former teammates Rico Petrocelli and Dwight Evans and former
hitting coach Walt Hriniak. Red Sox batting coach Jim Rice and
broadcaster Jerry Remy also played with Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, which featured a video compilation of Fisk in
action, culminating with his 1975 World Series home run off the
left-field foul pole, was noticeable for a blatant commercial
tie-in. On either side of the podium, there were placards bearing
the logos of the Red Sox and a credit-card company. The credit-card
logo also was displayed prominently on the backdrop for Fisk's
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, who was gently teased for the length of his speech at
Cooperstown in July, kept his remarks brief, speaking for six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roots of New England were with me every step of the way,''
Fisk said. ``I hope I can be an inspiration to other New England,
New Hampshire boys and young men.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, two pitchers of distinction emerged from
the Sox dugout. One was Pedro Martinez, who headed toward the
bullpen to warm up for his start. The other was Luis Tiant, Fisk's
favorite pitcher, who retreated behind the plate to receive the
ceremonial first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't find a chest protector big enough to fit him,''
Fisk joked afterward. ``What a reversal of positions that was. I
said, `What are you doing kneeling down? Squat down.' He said, `No
way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The two men warmly embraced. Then, to the sounds of Tina Turner
belting out ``Simply the Best,'' Fisk strolled past the visitors'
dugout, where Mariners coach Larry Bowa, veteran outfielder Rickey
Henderson, and current star Alex Rodriguez were among those who
shook his hand. Eventually, he made his way out to left field,
where he held the framed plaque of his number, then reached up and
patted the foul pole with which he will forever be linked. Asked
later if he would have dibs on the pole when Fenway is demolished
to make way for a new ballpark, Fisk smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably have dibs on parts of the rubble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest cheers were reserved for the video footage
that showed Fisk's scraps with the Yankees, a '70s rivalry that he
said would never again be matched in intensity. One of the scenes
showed the fight Fisk had with Lou Piniella, the former Yankee
outfielder who was here as manager of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Fisk's press conference and the start of the game,
Piniella dashed from the visitors' clubhouse to the Diamond Club to
congratulate Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him before the game that not too many players have two
uniforms retired,'' Piniella said. ``It's a great tribute to him. I
think Thurman (Munson) would be happy. They had a great rivalry.
He'd be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, Fisk was asked what it was about being a New
Englander that defined him as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe all the intrinsic things you are when you are a New
Englander,'' he said. ``Being stubborn helped you out more than it
hurt you. Just being able to deal with obstacles and tough times
when they presented themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put up and deal with a lot of things. I never accepted a
mediocre effort from myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk recalled a conversation he once had with Mace Brown, the
former Sox pitcher who later became a coach, after an afternoon in
which Fisk, still a minor leaguer, had labored for hours in the hot
Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked like I had been in a war,'' Fisk said. ``Mace Brown,
who was from South Carolina, said to me'' _ and here Fisk adopted
Brown's drawl _ `` `Son, I want to tell you something. I know you
had a tough day, but I want to tell you something my daddy told me
when I was about your age. He said, ``Son if you hadn't wanted to
work, you oughtn't have hired out.'' ' ''
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of Fisk's labors can now be found on a plaque in
Cooperstown, and on a rooftop on Yawkey Way.

 &HT;    `529' plans popular for college
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Suppose you could stash away money for your kids'
college years, invest it and skip paying taxes on your earnings for
years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that opportunity has been available for several years.
It comes in several dozen state-sponsored college savings plans
that offer savings not just on income tax, but also on estate and
gift taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now the plans _ named 529 plans after the section of tax law
that authorizes them _ are catching on.
</P>
<P>
   What made the difference? The answer is classic capitalism: More
salesmen will sell more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first were Fidelity _ pushing a plan sponsored by New
Hampshire but available all over the United States _ and TIAA-CREF
in Connecticut and New York. Now Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith
Barney, Vanguard and others have joined the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have stashed $1.7 billion into 529 plans, and the
numbers are growing. Assets in Fidelity's New Hampshire plan
tripled in one year. Maine, a partner with Merrill Lynch, picked up
$264 million in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for the accelerating growth.
</P>
<P>
   It's a no-brainer. Once you pick your plan, all you do is write
a check and leave the investment management to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and South Dakota are the only states that do not offer a
529. But at least 21 other states will open accounts for residents
of Georgia or any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Tax benefits are the most attractive advantage, says certified
financial planner Kyle H. Flynn. Your earnings grow tax-free until
you withdraw money to pay college expenses. Then the money is taxed
at the student's tax rate, presumably lower than his or her
parents' rate.
</P>
<P>
   You can put a lot of money into a 529 account. The limit for any
one child is over $100,000 in most states.
</P>
<P>
   You might try to top that by opening accounts in more than one
state. ``But I think the IRS is going to try to prevent that,''
said Joseph F. Hurley, author of a book on 529 plans and founder of
www.savingforcollege.com. ``You're asking for trouble, because
you're abusing the program.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no income caps. Other tax incentives are phased out
for high-income taxpayers but not 529 plans.
</P>
<P>
   The donor keeps control of the money. ``If Johnny doesn't go to
college, it's not Johnny's money,'' said Abram Claude, Fidelity's
vice president for college planning. ``You can change
beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom and Dad also have the power to decide when to make
withdrawals. They can even take the money back, though they would
pay both income taxes and a penalty on earnings, usually 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents can rejoice: Contributions to a 529 plan are
removed from the donor's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions qualify for the $10,000 annual gift exclusion.
What's more, a donor can contribute as much as $50,000 into an
account at one time and spread the tax benefit over five years.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not able to control the investments,'' said Flynn, a
member of the Financial Planning Association. ``You need to be
comfortable with how the sponsor invests the money for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, you lose the income tax benefit if the money doesn't go
for college expenses. In general that includes tuition, fees, books
and room and board. If college plans collapse, you can leave the
money in the account indefinitely, transfer it to another family
member or withdraw it and pay a penalty on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The complex part is shopping for the plan that best meets your
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the place to start. Hurley's
www.savingforcollege.com offers details on every plan and links to
related Web sites. Click on ``5-Cap Ratings'' to get started.
</P>
<P>
   You will want to know who manages the money in the accounts. If
you are already comfortable with managers at Fidelity or TIAA-CREF,
for example, that will help narrow your list.
</P>
<P>
   Asset allocations are important, too. In most plans, your money
will be split between stock and bond mutual funds, and the portion
in bonds will increase as your child approaches college age.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative investors can check out the Iowa plan, which starts
children under 5 in the Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Portfolio. It
keeps 57 percent of assets in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is more adventurous. One option is an age-based portfolio,
which starts very young children with 90 percent stocks and 10
percent bonds. Other options include a 100 percent equity portfolio
and one that is 75 percent equities. You can mix and match, but
once you make a contribution to a particular portfolio, that money
has to stay in that portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Expenses are an important consideration. The more you pay for
management, the less you get to reinvest. The difference can be
significant, especially if you start when your children are very
young.
</P>
<P>
   Utah uses low-cost Vanguard funds, and its expenses are capped
at $25 plus 0.35 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Merrill Lynch's plan costs 1.36% to 1.58%, according
to www
</P>
<P>
   .savingforcollege.com.

IS IT PERSONAL? BELICHICK COOLING HIS JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Football, lies, and videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Brace yourself for the very best of them.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a short week of what went wrong in the Tampa Bay game
and a long week of Bill Belichick's return to the Meadowlands to
face the team he scorned last January to take the head job in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a softball for Dennis Miller, the ``Monday Night
Football'' comedian, who will have lots of ammunition for next
week's Jets-Patriots game, starting with the ugly divorce between
Belichick and Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Included are two chapters of Parcells's new book, ``The Final
Season,'' in which he depicts Belichick in a bad light after
Parcells handed him the torch as the Jets' next head coach, only to
have Belichick reject it in a bizarre final press conference in
which he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will have fodder in Belichick and his relationship with
Jets players, plus Belichick and New York coach Al Groh, who worked
together for years, and the Jets' brokering of a deal to free
Belichick for a No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   There's also ``The Video'' acquired by the Lawrence Eagle
Tribune's Bill Burt, which shows a disoriented Parcells in the late
moments of last year's season-opening loss to the Patriots. The
tape shows Parcells, now the Jets' director of player personnel,
apparently unaware of the score and questioning why the Patriots
were trying to set up for a field goal. The Patriots were trailing
by a point, but Parcells apparently thought they were up a point.
It may all be moot by now, but the video has received much
attention in the media, including Channel 7's ``Sports Xtra,''
which showed it Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Just another game?
</P>
<P>
   Not when Parcells writes in his book, ``In retrospect, I think
something happened with Belichick or with his agent on Monday
afternoon that made Belichick reconsider his position with Jets (on
Tuesday). I can't prove it, and I really don't care now that he has
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Belichick's performance at the press conference, Parcells
wrote, ``He was just too emotional to handle the situation. And he
said some things about me that weren't true. He also said some
things that were said in private conversations between coaches,
which coaches know are not to be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Parcells writes, ``His excuse about things changing with
the death of Mr. (Leon) Hess was weak. Mr. Hess had been dead for
seven months. The potential buyers of the Jets were all told by
Goldman Sachs that Belichick, by contract, would automatically be
the next coach as soon as I stepped down.''
</P>
<P>
   And this baby: ``Bill did a good job for me. But I did a good
job for him. Honestly, I still can't figure out why he didn't take
this job instead of going to New England. If the Patriots never
came forward, I think he would have been happy to be the head coach
of the New York Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the book, which hit stores this weekend,
Belichick took the high road, as he did when asked about the
videotape, which he appears on.
</P>
<P>
   While answering questions about his sorry offensive line Monday,
Belichick also began to get Jets questions from the New York media.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter asked whether there will be extra emotions about
facing the Jets for the first time. Belichick's official response
was, ``No. That's really not the issue. The main issue for me is
that it's a divisional game. Every team needs to win its division
games. It's a division game on the road, and that's what's really
important. They're not going to have everyone's personal record in
the standings on Monday; it's going to be what the Patriots are,
and that's why we're here. It's about what this football team does
collectively. It's not about individuals. It's not about my record
and your record and somebody else's record.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that Tampa Bay wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, the
former Jet, said he would be rooting for Belichick Monday, the
coach quipped, ``If that translates into points on the board, I'll
take them. I doubt that it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said, ``It's not like you're out on the field playing.
You're just trying to get your team prepared to play. I feel I put
as much into this Tampa Bay game as I'll do the New York game and
the Minnesota game.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say that, because of the familiarity between the teams,
``It'll be like an intrasquad scrimmage. Each side can probably
call every play. There are a lot of storylines.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots defensive back Otis Smith, another former Jet, also
joined the parade of ``it's just another game'' commentary. ``Our
sole purpose is to go down in New York and try to win,'' said
Smith. ``Hopefully, we will get that done. It's no bigger than any
other game. I played there. I know what the guys are like over
there, and they know what I'm like. It's like the first time I left
there and came here to play and went back. It's the same feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``As players, we don't know what's going on with coaches and the
front office. That stuff is out of our control. To link me with
what's going with Bill and the Jets I don't think is the right
thing to do. That situation is done with. We're here now and we're
trying to win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ty Law, who loves Monday night football anyway,
expects a highly emotional night, especially with old friends like
Curtis Martin and Vincent Brisby on the other sideline. ``That's
going to be a fun game,'' said Law. ``Curtis is over there, and
he's a guy we have to stop to stop the Jets' offense. And Briz,
he's going to pick up where he left off a couple of years ago here.
He's a good receiver. He had those hamstring problems, and a
receiver can't be expected to go out there and run around with
those. He was a great asset for our team. He opened things up for
other guys. I think he can go over there and fill Keyshawn's shoes
and they probably won't miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he does believe Belichick will have a personal agenda
in this one. ``He has total control of this team,'' said Law,
``which he wouldn't have had up there. So I think he's going to
have a little personal side to this.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Law added, ``You can't pick that up because it's not
talked about. As the week goes on, you'll get the sense of it if
it's going to be personal or not. He has a good way of keeping the
same tone of voice, so it will be hard to pick it up with him. All
you have to do is go talk to (offensive coordinator) Charlie
(Weis). He'd probably let it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis, of course, was the coordinator in New York who was
stripped of his play-calling duties by Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick brought other personnel with him to New England,
including defensive backs coach Eric Mangini, assistant personnel
director Scott Pioli (Parcells's son-in-law), and national scout
Lionel Vital. Former Patriots defensive line coach Ray Hamilton is
the Jets' line coach.
</P>
<P>
   What the story is missing is Keyshawn firing the first shot.
Someone will have to do that between now and Monday. Rest assured,
it won't be Belichick.

</P>
<P>
   The donor keeps control of the money. ``If Johnny doesn't go to
college, it's not Johnny's money,'' said Abram Claude, Fidelity's
vice president for college planning. ``You can change
beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom and Dad also have the power to decide when to make
withdrawals. They can even take the money back, though they would
pay both income taxes and a penalty on earnings, usually 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents can rejoice: Contributions to a 529 plan are
removed from the donor's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions qualify for the $10,000 annual gift exclusion.
What's more, a donor can contribute as much as $50,000 into an
account at one time and spread the tax benefit over five years.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not able to control the investments,'' said Flynn, a
member of the Financial Planning Association. ``You need to be
comfortable with how the sponsor invests the money for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, you lose the income tax benefit if the money doesn't go
for college expenses. In general that includes tuition, fees, books
and room and board. If college plans collapse, you can leave the
money in the account indefinitely, transfer it to another family
member or withdraw it and pay a penalty on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The complex part is shopping for the plan that best meets your
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the place to start. Hurley's
www.savingforcollege.com offers details on every plan and links to
related Web sites. Click on ``5-Cap Ratings'' to get started.
</P>
<P>
   You will want to know who manages the money in the accounts. If
you are already comfortable with managers at Fidelity or TIAA-CREF,
for example, that will help narrow your list.
</P>
<P>
   Asset allocations are important, too. In most plans, your money
will be split between stock and bond mutual funds, and the portion
in bonds will increase as your child approaches college age.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative investors can check out the Iowa plan, which starts
children under 5 in the Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Portfolio. It
keeps 57 percent of assets in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is more adventurous. One option is an age-based portfolio,
which starts very young children with 90 percent stocks and 10
percent bonds. Other options include a 100 percent equity portfolio
and one that is 75 percent equities. You can mix and match, but
once you make a contribution to a particular portfolio, that money
has to stay in that portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Expenses are an important consideration. The more you pay for
management, the less you get to reinvest. The difference can be
significant, especially if you start when your children are very
young.
</P>
<P>
   Utah uses low-cost Vanguard funds, and its expenses are capped
at $25 plus 0.35 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Merrill Lynch's plan costs 1.36% to 1.58%, according
to www
</P>

 &HT;    Relieve stress by giving yourself `do-overs'
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. LeCrone: Several years ago you wrote a column on
relieving stress by giving yourself ``do-overs.'' I lost my copy
and wonder if you could repeat his helpful information.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Reader: When my children were young, many of their favorite
activities involved ``do-overs.'' For those of you unfamiliar with
this term, do-overs are second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of do-overs in adult games are golf with the mulligan _
a second drive _ on the first hole. The second serve in tennis is a
do-over, as is the retaking of an examination by the lucky student
whose instructor believed his story of misfortune on the first
taking of the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Do-overs do many things in life for us.
</P>
<P>
   They take the ``life or death'' element out of the first attempt
at something. Anxiety is decreased by spreading the chance of
success over more trials. Reducing the seriousness that comes when
you have one and only one chance at something can make events more
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many individuals were brought up and taught to
live by such statements as, ``Anything worth doing is worth doing
right the first time,'' or ``Do it right the first time or don't do
it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   During an athletic contest involving young children, I once
heard a coach tell his players, ``Second attempts are for losers
and slow learners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself how often you are dissuaded from attempting some
task or new opportunity because you are afraid you might not
complete it successfully on the first attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity is often stifled because of concern about needing to
succeed on the initial try at something. Parents often send such
messages to their children such as ``now let's be sure you get it
right on your first try.''
</P>
<P>
   The child then begins to develop anxiety and doubt about his or
her capabilities, leading the child to be reluctant about
attempting anything but sure bets, 100 percent gold-plated
guaranteed successes.
</P>
<P>
   There are obviously situations in life that do not lead
themselves to do-overs. Those providing a service to other fields
such as medicine, law and education may, in many instances, need
exactness on the first attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for many of these individuals develops, however,
when they extend this need for exactness in their job into other
areas of their lives not requiring this same degree of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   This need for perfection is imposed on those around them, often
creating a great deal of unnecessary stress. Individuals who rarely
or never see do-overs as an option in their lives, often view life
in terms of extremes such as black or white, stop or go, right or
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For these perfectionists I offer a suggestion. Consider areas of
your life where do-overs are options and see if these areas can be
expanded. Is making sure you do it right the first time as
necessary as you perceived it to be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut yourself some slack'' and give yourself some do-overs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hap LeCrone is a Waco clinical psychologist. His column
appears Sunday in the Waco Tribune-Herald. If you have questions or
topics you would like Dr. LeCrone to discuss, write him 4555 Lake
Shore Drive, Waco 76710 or e-mail him at hlecrone(at)aol.com.

 &HT;    Breaking even in the game of life
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. ``Life's a crapshoot. Ya' lose a little of
this and you gain a little of that. The best ya' can hope for is to
break even.'' This from the wiseguy peering over my shoulder as I'm
weighing myself on the old penny scales
</P>
<P>
   in the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez!'' I mutter, looking only half-way back at him. ``Gimme a
break here. Can't a girl even weigh herself in private any more?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This here ain't private, Lizzie,'' the voice says and adds
with a chuckle, ``and you ain't no girl.'' I swivel for a better
look at my tormentor and discover it's just one of my smart-mouth
coffee buddies. I fish in my pocket for a coin, hold it out, and
dare him to take my place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' he says by way of refusal. ``I only weigh nekkid.'' I
tell him to go ahead and he says he would but worries that the
excitement of catching a glimpse of him in his altogether might be
just too much for the lady behind the
</P>
<P>
   counter. I agree with him, but not for the reason he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Then I try to make a deal, suggesting we could each subtract 15
pounds for clothes and shoes. He turns me down and shuffles off to
the prescription counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get your Viagra over the Internet, you know,'' I shout
after him in an effort to get even. He just shakes his head and
keeps on going.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking it must be time to buy my own scales so I can weigh
at home _ stripped, before breakfast, and with a modicum of privacy
to avoid situations like this. The kind with really big numbers
would be ideal so that way I won't have to subtract five or six
pounds for my glasses _ depending on whether I'm wearing the new
lightweights or my old horn-rims.
</P>
<P>
   But my geezer friend has set me to thinking about losses and
gains, and wondering if in the long run, life really does break
even. One can only hope.
</P>
<P>
   It's a definite loss when the eyesight dims. The flip side is,
we begin to look better to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we lose speed, but we gain awareness _ kind of a
``stopping to smell the flowers'' thing.
</P>
<P>
   And so what if a little bit of the memory goes? Do as one of my
friends suggests _ invent a new reality, one that makes you happy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest benefits of joining the ``slightly over the
hill bunch'' is the serenity that comes with the realization that,
unlike what our mothers taught us, it really doesn't matter what
other folks think. If we choose to
</P>
<P>
   stop in the middle of digging up lilies or spading in manure, to
walk uptown for a bite of lunch, who cares if we look a fright?
It's not going to affect our standing in the community one bit.
Besides, by this age we know who we are
</P>
<P>
   and that conformity counts for nothing. Can't please everybody
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   My geezer buddy is right. Life really is a crapshoot, and since
we have no idea where it's going to dump us from one day to the
next, the best we can hope for is a journey smoothed by family and
friends who love us _ AND a sense of
</P>
<P>
   humor to help us enjoy the gamble.

   QUAKE-WINERIES (Napa, Calif.) _ The 5.2 earthquake last weekend
couldn't have shaken Northern California's famed Wine Country at a
more hectic, vulnerable time. Crowded with Labor Day tourists and
migrant farm workers, its restaurants and spas booked and
fermenting tanks filling up with the spoils of harvest, the
wine-saturated Napa Valley landscape was ripe for chaos. By JENNY
STRASBURG and ANASTASIA HENDRIX.
</P>
<P>
   SUVS-POLLUTION (San Francisco) _ The Sierra Club is launching a
nationwide campaign to showcase what it sees as the dark side of
SUVs _ the brown haze of air pollution, weather disasters linked to
global warming, and oil derricks chugging away to fill gas tanks.
In a snappy six-page brochure released Sunday, the 108-year-old
national environmental group is depicting gas-guzzling,
carbon-dioxide-spewing SUVs as hazardous, not hip. By JANE KAY.
</P>
<P>
   KILLER-OTTER (Moss Landing, Calif.) _ The placid waters of
Elkhorn Slough are host to the things that make Monterey Bay a
natural treasure: gliding pelicans, twittering sandpipers, lounging
sea lions and frolicking harbor seals. But all is not well here: a
serial killer may be at work. The suspect: an adolescent male sea
otter. By VICKI HADDOCK.
</P>
<P>
   SF-ASIAN-CENSUS (San Francisco) _ Sometime this year, according

you put a little thought and creativity into it. With a bit of
ingenuity, you can make living areas from seemingly nonexistent
space. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.
</P>
<P>
   COACH-HORN (Undated) _ The melodic coach horn was the precursor
of the modern, blasting car horn. Road coaches served as public
transportation and for delivering supplies and mail. Each of the
authentic calls, still used by pleasure coaches, carries a message:
we have arrived, we're thirsty, we need lodging, get ready and
let's go. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT(``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-DEATH (Undated) _ How do we about dying? Investigative
reporter Bill Moyers and his wife, Judith Davidson Moyers, spent
the past two years in hospitals, hospices and most importantly the
homes of terminally ill people. Their efforts resulted in a
four-part, six-hour documentary for PBS that examines, as one dying
subject puts it, ``living in the light of death.'' By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   WHITNEY-BIOGRAPHY (Undated) _ Cornelius ``Sonny'' Vanderbilt
Whitney was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and grew up to be
one of the world's wealthiest tycoons and the stuff legends are

Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney,'' provides an in-depth journey into
the privileged life of a gentleman. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.

who lie and cheat in his films, Neil LaBute had escaped the
attention of his Mormon Church elders for a long time. Then LaBute
got personal. He introduced Mormon characters. Homicidal Mormon
characters. In ``Bash: Latter-Day Plays,'' a filmed version of
which aired on Showtime last week, pretty people of the faith
confess ugly crimes. That made the phone ring. It was the church
asking LaBute to portray Mormons in a positive way. By RON DICKER.

<P>
   September's gentle light has a way of illuminating flaws in your
landscape. Yes, early autumn offers an abundance of fruits and
vegetables to harvest, and many flowers keep going strong until
frost, but somehow the eye is drawn to the barren space where the
hollyhocks never emerged; lawn furniture, looking used and worn;
that climbing rose, begging for a new trellis. It's time to embark
on what I like to call the Great Fall Scavenger Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Most people obsess over their gardens in the spring, and folks
at garden centers and nurseries know it. They stock up on loads of
plants, tools, fertilizers and other irresistible items, well aware
that we, still partially dazed with winter delirium, will
obediently march out and purchase tons of merchandise at premium
prices. Everyone is both anxious to get his or her garden in shape
immediately and willing to pay for the privilege. The wise few who
exercise patience and foresight, however, can avoid the long lines
and high prices in springtime by doing some homework _ and legwork
_ now, when the distractions of spring and oppressive heat of
summer are pretty much over.
</P>
<P>
   Every year in early September I take a long walk around my
property with pencil and notebook in hand, making careful note of
any problem. While not exciting, careful record-keeping is critical
to the garden-improvement process: In order to get the most out of
the hunt, scavengers need to know exactly what items, and how many
of each, they need.
</P>
<P>
   So into the garden I go, paying particular attention to what has
worked this year and what hasn't. I search for gaps in the
perennial border, for instance, assess which portions of the yard
could use additional screening or color and earmark elements of the
``hardscape'' _ gates, trellises, edgings, etc. _ for replacement
or repair. I also stop by the toolshed and take stock of what
equipment or supplies I might need. When my list is complete, I
reorganize my notes into three general categories: perennials,
other plants, and hardscaping and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Next it's time, list in hand, to go bargain hunting at the local
nurseries. If you haven't been to a garden center after Labor Day,
you're in for a pleasant surprise. Not only are spring crowds long
gone, but demand-spiked prices have fallen on many items by as much
as 25 percent to 50 percent. While the selection may not be as
large as it was early in the season, nursery employees and garden
center owners are eager to reduce their inventories before the
onset of winter. Any remaining perennials, bushes or trees will
have to be healed into the ground for the winter, or otherwise
stored or disposed of, at great expense. Far better to sell the
stock, even at prices that are sometimes below cost. The same holds
true for tools and fertilizers, many of which have a limited shelf
life. Even items like pots, urns, statuary and arbors must be moved
to make way for the mountains of snowblowers, shovels and Christmas
paraphernalia that will soon take their places.
</P>
<P>
   This seasonal change makes for a savvy gardener's paradise.
Usually I concentrate on the live portion of my list first and
postpone purchasing the remainder of the items until the weather
gets colder. (While it's quite cozy to prowl the interior of a
garden center on a cold, rainy late-October day, hunting for plants
outside in the wet isn't as much fun, so I try to finish up the
plant part of my search while the weather's still pleasant.)
</P>
<P>
   Many people seem adverse to planting in the fall, fretting that
the trees, shrubs and perennials they buy now will merely perish
over the course of the winter. On the contrary, fall planting is by
and large just as successful as planting in the spring. In general,
throughout most of the country, temperatures remain warm enough
well into autumn, allowing the plants time to settle in, with the
added benefit of several months of ample moisture that is often
lacking in the late spring and early summer.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one critical difference in choosing plants
for purchase now: In the spring, the condition of the top of the
plant _ the leaves and branches _ is just as important as the
roots. Whether the plant lives or dies will be determined by how
successfully the foliage produces the nutrients necessary to
establish the plant in new ground. In the fall, though, the foliage
of non-evergreens is relatively unimportant _ it's the roots that
count. While you obviously wouldn't want to choose a specimen tree
with a permanent flaw such as a poor branching structure (at least
one you couldn't fix by pruning), don't worry if the leaves look a
little tattered _ they'll be gone shortly anyway and come back as
good as ever in the spring. The same holds true for shrubs and
perennials. What's far more important are the roots. Take a look
inside the pot or burlap bag: The roots should appear healthy and
smell fresh. If there's a scent of rot or decay, find another
plant. Pot-bound plants make good choices; this is usually an
indication of a healthy specimen.
</P>
<P>
   Generally I will set aside a day or so and take a tour of all
the nurseries in the area. I purchase whatever they have on my list
that's both in decent condition and on sale. Oftentimes I will find
other material that's not included on my list that is too good to
pass up, and I'll take that, too. The somewhat random nature of the
hunt is part of the appeal. Usually I return home with my truck
loaded to the max and begin planting.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is crucial in the fall, so don't procrastinate: The
sooner you get the plants in the ground, the longer they will have
to settle in before the onset of winter and the more successful the
operation will be. Planting in the fall is the same as planting in
the spring, except that once again the roots are more important
than the tops. You actually want to discourage new leaf growth that
in all likelihood would be killed back by the cold, and instead
promote root growth. So rather than adding a balanced fertilizer
with a high nitrogen count (the first of the three numbers on
fertilizer labels), concentrate on phosphorus (the middle number),
which stimulates the roots. I like to scatter a handful or so of
superphosphate (0-20-0) in each hole as I plant. I finish by
covering the roots with earth and watering: Presto _ a new addition
to the garden! If you are planting large trees or evergreens,
you'll probably want to secure the plants to a stake or two.
</P>
<P>
   So this September, as the soft autumn light begins to creep over
your garden, don't be lulled into pleasant repose. A fun and
exciting quest awaits. All that's required is a little legwork, an
inquisitive nose and a spare afternoon or two. Your reward will be
a far better garden next year, at far less cost. Sounds like a
bargain to me!

HALLIE KATE EISENBERG: PRINCESS OF POP

 (ART ADV: Photo of Hallie Kate Eisenberg is available on Newscom or

 By JESSICA BROWN 
 c.2000 Child magazine. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 8, Hallie Kate Eisenberg has a career that would make
most actresses jealous: She worked with Al Pacino and Russell Crowe
in last year's Oscar-nominated ``The Insider'' and plays Minnie
Driver's daughter in ``Beautiful.'' Then there are the Pepsi ads
that catapulted her to fame, in which she channels the voices of
such legends as Aretha Franklin and Marlon Brando. Not bad for
someone too young to stay up for her six guest spots on ``The
Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her high profile, Hallie seems like a typical kid. She
arrives after a full day as a second-grader at her New Jersey
hometown's public school, chatting about the usual little-girl
loves: dancing (she's taken tap, ballet and jazz classes), glitter
nail polish, in-line skating and her three pets (a dog, a cat and a
bird). It isn't until she mentions that it was Hollywood hunk
Russell Crowe who bought her the skates that you remember she
really isn't your typical 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   So how does her family cope with Hallie's sudden fame?
Surprisingly, her mom, Amy, reports that the Eisenberg household
isn't as crazed as you'd think. ``We all view this as a lot of
fun,'' she says. In fact, the lifestyle isn't so new to them, since
the family is chock-full of performers: Son Jesse, 16, has acted on
TV and on stage, and Amy herself worked as a clown for 15 years.
Only Hallie's father, Barry, a healthcare consultant, stays behind
the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Hallie had her first brush with fame when she was only a day
old. ``I gave birth to Hallie during National Breastfeeding Month,
and the hospital put her on the cover of their newsletter, wearing
a bib that said 'I Eat at Mom's,''' remembers Amy. But it was at
age 3, during a meeting with Jesse's agents, that Hallie got
noticed. ``The agents asked if they could send her out on
auditions, too,'' Amy recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Hallie's first gig was a ``Blue's Clues'' commercial, in which
she was supposed to react enthusiastically as she watched the show
with a group of kids. ``But I had never seen it before. Everyone
else was yelling out the clues, and I just sat there like this,''
Hallie explains, demonstrating a transfixed stare.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much larger and more successful jobs followed,
namely, the Pepsi ads. But Hallie almost missed her chance to be
Hollywood's soda songstress. Though her agents assured Pepsi that
they had the perfect girl for the part, the Eisenbergs were out of
the country for most of the audition period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we finally got an appointment for her to try out in New
York City, we were given the wrong address. We ended up stuck in
rush-hour traffic, desperately trying to get across town to make
the meeting,'' Amy says. But in the end, there was no need to worry
_ on their way home from the audition, Amy got a call on her cell
phone from Pepsi, telling her that Hallie had gotten the part.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her glamorous job, Hallie appears unaffected. ``It's not
like we have to work at maintaining our values,'' says Amy. ``She's
not spoiled at all. She makes her bed, sets the table and cleans up
her messes. Acting is just fun to her.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an attitude Amy wants her to keep. ``I see kids at
auditions who simply aren't into it, and I wonder why they're
there. But Hallie has shot scenes in the pouring rain and been the
happiest person on the set.'' Amy is also very conscious of
protecting her daughter from any pressure. ``At one point, she had
just filmed 'The Insider' and a TV movie at the same time, and I
said to her, 'You know, after this maybe you'll just go back to
first grade and be a regular girl.' But Hallie burst into tears,
asking 'What did I do?' I wanted to give her an out,'' Amy says.
``But she didn't want it. She loves having a lot to do. You could
wake her up in the middle of the night and she would still be ready
for anything.''

&HT;     COACH HORNS: A SOUND THAT CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The melodic coach horn was the precursor of the modern, blasting
car horn.
</P>
<P>
   Road coaches served as public transportation and for delivering
supplies and mail (a coach horn is also referred to as a post
horn).
</P>
<P>
   As inns began to spring up along the service routes (usually
about 10 miles apart, the distance a team of horses could daily
haul a heavy load at a brisk pace), the hornsman or groom would
announce the approach of the coach by blowing a tootle (also known
as a call or tune) on his horn.
</P>
<P>
   Though these calls were functional, they also served to
entertain passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the authentic calls, still used by pleasure coaches,
carries a message: we have arrived, we're thirsty, we need lodging,
get ready and let's go. There were also calls to clear the road of
people and animals, and for directions _ off side, near side,
slacken pace, pull up, steady to the right, to the left _ and one
for a change of horses or to add a horse to help pull the coach up
the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no phones back then and so you had to be able to
communicate from a distance if you were to keep on schedule,''
explained Richard O'Donnell, vice president of branch
administration for First National Bank in West Chester, Pa. ``In
its day, the coach horn was really like a car radio, providing a
traffic report and entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coach horns are as long as 52 inches, which takes great
skill to play while standing up on a moving coach. The favored
length today is 48 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Coach horns are made from tin, copper, brass or other metals
that have been silver-plated.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who played trumpet in high school, is one of about 30
to 40 coach hornsmen in the United States and Canada. He also
drives and has a collection of carriages and coach horns.
</P>
<P>
   He said a brand name antique coach horn in excellent condition
can cost approximately $1,000 to $7,000 and a reproduction sells
for around $600.

NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH 
By Josephine Humphreys. Viking. 341 pp. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Josephine Humphreys is a shrewd Southern writer whose fiction
has long embraced the contradictions of the region. She knows that
evil can take up residence on the most ordinary street corner, that
humor can conceal and sometimes appease a world of pain. As a
native South Carolinian, she understands the land's allure and
treachery both: understands that, to a Southerner, the strands of
place and love and obligation can get as tangled as kudzu.
Humphreys's earlier novels _ ``Dreams of Sleep,'' ``Rich in Love,''
``The Fireman's Fair'' _ relied on emotional insight and depth of
character to explore these themes, drawing their rich sense of
story from a New South steeped in old and intractable ways.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Nowhere Else on Earth,'' she has eschewed this contemporary
palette for a historical novel set in North Carolina during the
final months of the Civil War. Certainly all the makings for high
drama are in place here in Scuffletown, on the banks of the Lumbee
River: violence, betrayal, familial ties assaulted by hunger and
heartbreak as well as slavery and war. But Humphreys has focused
her sights upon a particular segment of the rural, war-weary South:
the insular settlement of Lumbee Indians in Scuffletown, under
siege by a roving home guard that is intent on saving its own white
sons by drafting Indian boys first. The resulting saga has both the
familiar ring of old Civil War themes (broken homes and loyalties,
huge losses and unlikely heroics) as well as the more remarkable
story of a community ostracized from within. As with other recent
Civil War efforts by contemporary writers (Charles Frazier's ``Cold
Mountain,'' Russell Banks's ``Cloudsplitter''), ``Nowhere Else on
Earth'' seeks to deliver individual agonies on a war-torn stage _ a
character study wrung out from history's bloody garb.
</P>
<P>
   The novel opens as a retrospective memoir, written in 1890 by a
41-year-old woman named Rhoda Strong. The only daughter of a Lumbee
Indian mother and a Scot father, Rhoda is 15 in the last year of
the war, subsisting on potatoes and cornmeal and day-dreaming about
a better life. Her quick mind nurtured by a doting father, Rhoda
has left home once, to be tutored by a white woman, but the girl's
love for her family and strong ties to Scuffletown brought her
back. The town is more fishnet or cobweb than real town, Rhoda
tells us: ``two hundred houses spread through miles of swampy
woods, threaded together by footpaths and narrow oxcart lanes of
sand.'' Most of its residents make their living from pine resin:
Robeson County is home to 80 turpentine stilleries, worked by
slaves and Lumbees and, more often than not, owned by whites.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the South by that point in the war, the folks in
Scuffletown are simply trying to outlive the Union's final victory:
``What we wanted,'' Rhoda tells us, ``was the life before us. To do
the work, to fall in love, survive the sorrows, stay put.'' An even
greater threat than Sherman at this point is an evil man named
Brant Harris, whose home guard has turned from a ragtag local army
into a marauding gang with personal vendettas. The Strongs spend
too many days hiding from Harris in their one-room house,
protecting Rhoda's brothers, Boss and Andrew, but their best hope
lies in Scuffletown's prodigal son. At 19, Henry Berry Lowrie is
already a young legend, feeding the hungry and outrunning the enemy
and hiding the good town boys in the woods. His brothers have made
him the leader of the band who can stand up to Harris; even Rhoda's
mother, Cee, wary of all that charisma, knows that the community's
future is riding on him.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda loves the legend even before she's laid eyes on the man,
of course, and Henry, when he appears, takes to this outspoken girl
who wants to shield her brother from harm. And so the love story
between Rhoda and Henry unfolds with an elusive if predictable
persistence, enough to provide the obligatory romantic thread in a
story rife with blood and doom. But it's the dark transformation of
its characters that offers the real ballast of the novel: Henry's
moral tests, too often bigger than he is; Rhoda's surrender of
desire, or transient happiness, for the greater potential of a
long-term investment. There are piercing subplots that sustain this
ominous milieu, from the martyrdom of the retarded brother of one
of Harris's henchmen to Rhoda's creepily poignant tending of a
dying Yankee soldier. The fates of the innocent are what we fear
most: Playing Little John to Henry's Robin Hood, Boss Strong is so
young and serious you know he'll have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere Else on Earth'' feels young and serious, too. It's
meticulously researched, and Humphreys's narrative attention to
specific scenes (usually the horrific ones) can be riveting. But
too often this novel seems less than the sum of its considerable
(and desultory) parts. In constructing a story possessing some of
the great themes of all wars, and this war in particular, Humphreys
has sacrificed many of the finer elements of resonant fiction. We
care far more for a character's interior struggles than, say, the
racist specifics of 19th-century anthropology, but the characters
in ``Nowhere Else on Earth'' don't have much room to thrive or
develop _ they're up against too much history. In the face of so
much backdrop _ the rumble of Sherman's march, the internecine
violence of Scuffletown, the familiar losses endured by an entire
society _ it's hard to focus on anything much beyond the
well-traveled territory of Civil War fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Writers turn to history for a variety of reasons; they may be
drawn to a moment in time, or they may simply want to flee the one
they're in. A rash of Civil War novels in the past five years
suggests to me the latter. In this present-tense world of so much
ironic distance, careless ennui, and blurry, untraceable sorrow,
maybe the Civil War _ with all its well-delineated horrors and
classical tragedy _ looks pretty good. But the genre can't help
doing the same thing historical fiction has always done: provide a
setting of so much unarguable fact that it precludes any real
creative flight. And instead of imaginative possibility, what you
get is paint-by-numbers fiction.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Jake Pinato, 18, almost couldn't afford the
$25,000-plus tuition at MIT, but a last-minute increase in
financial aid allowed the incoming freshman to attend his first
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got very lucky,'' said Pinato, of Manhattan Beach, Calif.,
as he waited in front of the student center last week for an
orientation tour to begin. ``My Dad was saying, `Even if you got
accepted to MIT, I don't think I could afford it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His older sister wasn't so lucky, however, when the family
couldn't foot the bill for her top pick, the University of
Michigan. She's attending the University of California, Santa
Barbara, instead. ``It's pretty far from her first choice, all
because it's the money. It's kind of sad,'' said Pinato, who's
considering a major in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   While college costs are already the highest they've ever been,
in 18 years they could average more than $200,000 for four years at
a private college and $80,000 or more for public schools, according
to recent College Board data.
</P>
<P>
   For families with newborns, that can be frightening. Indeed,
some surveys say American families are more worried about affording
a college education for their children than they are about having
enough for retirement, according to the College Savings Plans
Network, an affiliate of the National Association of State
Treasurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``National polls on family finances have shown this as being the
number one concern across the country,'' said Marshall Bennett,
chairman of the savings plans network and treasurer for the state
of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   To address this hot-button issue, Congress, the Clinton
administration, and presidential candidates Al Gore and George W.
Bush have all proposed fixes, and 43 states including Massachusetts
have recently added tax-favored college savings plans or prepaid
tuition plans.
</P>
<P>
   Pending in Congress is legislation that would allow a federal
tax exemption for earnings on state college savings plans. And
legislation pending in Massachusetts would give tax breaks for
state college savings plan earnings and contributions, according to
state Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien's office, which sponsored the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes a college tuition tax credit that would save
families with college students up to $2,800, while Bush has said he
would expand the Pell Grant program to give an extra $1,000 to
students who have taken advanced-placement or college-level math
and science classes in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Existing financial aid has reached a record $64.1 billion,
according to the latest figures from the nonprofit College Board.
But it hasn't kept pace with tuition increases.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, four years of private college tuition, fees, and room
and board average from $80,000 to $100,000, and from $30,000 to
$45,000 at a public college. A typical family now faces financial
aid loans of nearly $20,000 for each child's undergraduate
education, according to the College Board, an association of more
than 3,700 colleges and other educational organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the growing concern, acknowledging that
traditional financial aid programs aren't enough, both state and
federal governments have recently come up with new ways to help
families save and pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the federal level, there are the Hope and
Lifetime Learning tax credits, and on the state level, there are
the prepaid tuition plans or tax-deferred college savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families really have to be prepared for this and save to the
extent that they're able,'' said Scott Prince, director of external
relations for the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority,
which provides low-cost educational loans and administers the
state's prepaid tuition plan, known as the U.Plan, and college
savings plan, known as the U.Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But for current college students and their families, the bills
are already coming due. In an effort to pay them, they've had to
take such steps as work 60- to 70-hour weeks, plead with schools
for more financial aid, or seek alternative sources of educational
funds on the Internet and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Moira Toscano, 54, of Boston, took to the Web in an effort to
pay for her son Gregory's junior year at Northeastern University
and her daughter Jennifer's freshman year at Lasell College in
Newton. Tuition for both children totals about $34,000, and after
financial aid, the amount Toscano and her husband must contribute
is about $13,000 _ more than they could afford without remortgaging
their house or taking out another loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really staggering. I'm not even talking about Ivy
League,'' said Toscano, the primary caretaker for her husband, a
retiree who suffered a stroke a few years ago. ``It's not like we
didn't put money away for their college. It was wiped out the first
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, in July Toscano won $25,000 (or about $18,000 after
taxes) through www.FreeScholarships.com, a new Waltham-based Web
site that has daily, weekly, and quarterly scholarship drawings for
registered members. So far, she's sent Gregory's tuition bill to
FreeScholarships to be paid directly to Northeastern. The money can
be used over a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the site launched in February, it has awarded scholarship
money to nearly 200 registered members from around the country.
Founded by Chuck Digate, chief executive of MathSoft Inc.,
FreeScholarships is a privately held company funded by the software
firm. But it also seeks money from philanthropists and others who
want to ``do something great for humanity by providing a quality
education for some promising scholar,'' according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   To pay their tuition at MIT, Jake Zucker, Kelli Griffin, Cindy
Adams, and others relaxing in front of the MIT student center last
week said they've resorted to more traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker, 20, of Reno, Nev., a straight-A student with a double
major in math and biology, is paying the full freight since his
father's income as a pediatrician and other family assets are too
high to qualify him for aid.
</P>
<P>
   He worked 60 to 70 hours a week at two jobs this summer to help
pay the bills, but ``that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface
of the costs,'' Zucker said, as he hung out in front of the student
center with fellow varsity football team members Kevin Ferguson,
Bobby Owsley, and Kip Johann-Berkel. Ferguson is on a Navy ROTC
scholarship, while Owsley and Johann-Berkel both qualified for
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all paying too much in the grand scheme of things,''
said Zucker, who's thinking of following in his father's footsteps
into medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Griffin, 19, of Tiverton, R.I., a member of the varsity
soccer team who's majoring in material science engineering, said
she qualifies for financial aid and is maxing out on student loans
of several thousand dollars a year. ``I'll have a lot of loans to
pay off,'' she said, as she iced down a flare-up of tendinitis
after team practice.
</P>
<P>
   And as incoming freshmen and newfound friends Cindy Adams, 18,
of Pennsylvania, and Mana Shah, 17, of Connecticut ate a late
breakfast last week, they, too, talked about paying for an MIT
education. Adams qualified for financial aid, including work-study
and loans, but Shah didn't because of her family's income and
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like MIT, but it's really a lot more expensive,''
said Adams, who's thinking of majoring in aerospace engineering and
has dreamed of working for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration since she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   But Shah, who's thinking of majoring in biology and doing
medical research, said hopefully: ``It pays off later.''

MORE STUDENTS DETOUR FROM TRADITIONAL PATH TO COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMONT, Mass. _ The night he made the big decision, Mike Crotty
drove alone through the streets of his hometown, hoping that the
familiar geography of his life would inspire him.
</P>
<P>
   His dream, a basketball scholarship, had come true. St.
Michael's College had offered $100,000 in tuition and fees, and the
chance to play for the same school that his childhood idol had
attended, a fellow point guard who had helped Crotty become Belmont
High's shooting star.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance, too, that his parents never had. A young man
who grew up in public housing developments, Crotty would be
fulfilling their dreams as well.
</P>
<P>
   But he was torn. After taking the SAT over and over, until he
had a 1200, hadn't he earned a spot at a top college? St. Michael's
was a safe bet. But his education was so crucial, he kept thinking,
that the stakes seemed worth raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``A true point guard is someone who gets the best shot,'' he
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were up when he came in that night in the spring of
1999. I've decided, he said. He would risk the scholarship, even if
it meant going into debt, and wait for his best shot.
</P>
<P>
   With a record 15.1 million Americans enrolling on campuses this
fall, Crotty's story stands out among the many that admissions
officers hear. He said no to St. Michael's and spent the last year
shoring up his academic and athletic records in an unusual way.
This week, he's heading to college, hoping his choice will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more families are wrestling with where to send their
children, how to pay, and what kind of education is right for them.
Specialists say the strong economy and increasingly abundant
options after high school are encouraging students to work,
volunteer, or study in nontraditional settings, before beginning
the college experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say that there's a traditional course of study or
one clear path to college anymore,'' said Mark Cannon, deputy
executive director of the National Association for College
Admission Counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty's decision to reject a scholarship was unusual, as he is
a ``first generation'' student _ one whose parents didn't go to
college. Some educators see these freshmen at some risk, since
parents who went to college may be more equipped to show their
children the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Crotty wagered his scholarship on the hope of
something greater _ an unusual choice for a young man who dreams of
playing professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big thing, my education. And I had to think about
the next 10 years more than the next four,'' Crotty said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Crottys, it was a long journey _ not only over the last
year, as they waited to see if a thick acceptance letter from an
elite school would arrive, but for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had any money, and we're never going to have any
money,'' said Michael Crotty, Mike's father, sitting in a living
room filled with high-school pictures of Mike and his older sister,
Tarsha. ``The only thing important to us is to make sure the kids
get their education.''
</P>
<P>
   Crotty grew up dunking baskets in a mini-hoop set that he would
break, and his father would fix, again and again. He was a little
guy in a tall man's sport. And if he didn't have flash, there was a
scrappy style that began to gel in pickup games with other children
in his old subsidized housing complex. Playing for his dad's youth
basketball team pushed him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we wouldn't dive on the floor for the ball, my dad
would say, `What is this, a Belmont thing? You don't want to get
dirty?' '' Crotty said.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet confidence surrounds Crotty, who is as comfortable
passing the ball to others as driving to the hoop himself. He is
much like his father, from the hooded eyes and long eyelashes, to
the lead foot on the gas pedal. The elder Crotty's work ethic seems
to have also rubbed off. His son recalled watching his dad go to
work during the weeks he was also undergoing radiation for
Hodgkin's disease.
</P>
<P>
   In high school Crotty earned As and Bs while becoming an
all-star on the court. He imagined playing Division II basketball
at his sister's college, St. Michael's, which also had recruited a
Belmont point guard who guided Crotty into high-school play by
making him a ballboy in the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   St. Michael's moved quickly with the scholarship offer. ``I had
St. Michael's folders, St. Michael's binders,'' he said. But he
felt as if he was grasping for reasons to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deal was to get the best school with good basketball,'' he
said, ``but to get that best school first.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Joe O'Donnell. The head of Boston Concessions Group Inc.
and a family friend, O'Donnell urged Crotty to consider a Plan B: a
fifth year of high school, at Phillips Exeter Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I did,'' O'Donnell said. ``I thought he had great
ability, mentally and physically, and that the year could help him
trade up on any college he could go to.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of watching his buddies go off to college, while he
went back to high school, seemed ridiculous to Crotty at first. But
the chance to grow intellectually, while also growing a couple more
inches, would help him in the long run, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Exeter made the offer _ nudged, in part, by a couple of calls by
O'Donnell _ and offered a need-based aid package that left the
Crottys with a $5,000 bill. By then, the parents were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really wanted to have a basketball scholarship and didn't
want us to pay for his college,'' said his father, who is a
technician for Polaroid. ``But once he was past that, he could see
the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Post graduate'' programs like Exeter's are one of several
popular options for students who want shore up their academic or
athletics skills, or who don't feel quite ready for college,
according to Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   New England has a wealth of schools with such programs _ several
with reputations for admitting players to beef up teams. While many
of these students play sports at Exeter, they are admitted on their
academic record, school officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes they're young men and women who aren't ready for
college yet,'' said Susan Herney, Exeter's associate director of
admissions. ``They bring a freshness and vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   And in return came opportunities: classes of 12 students around
the legendary wood seminar tables, where debates among classmates
take precedence over lectures by teachers. Crotty started on the
basketball squad, and was elected a captain.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a 12-man house on campus, the first time away from
home. He introduced one of his housemates to basketball, and the
two ended up working on computers together. Shooting pool one day
in the house, Crotty watched two students fiddling with the
lighting in the room, and then filming the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that the light is so unbelievable, and I'd just be
playing pool,'' Crotty said, comparing the moment to watching a
basketball play unfold with someone who had never dribbled.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty said his richest learning came out of the classroom.
``Everyone has something that makes them go,'' he said. ``But
there, everyone has something that makes them go that's different,
and everyone accepts that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Crotty settled in did his thoughts return to
college.
</P>
<P>
   The close-knit atmosphere and classes on Exeter's campus were
deeply appealing. Like other prospective first-generation college
students, he'd had limited exposure to higher education, which made
the Exeter experience that much more influential. He liked how
students spoke up, spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   Size was also crucial, and he thought small: Brown University,
Amherst, Williams, or maybe Bowdoin College.
</P>
<P>
   An Exeter guidance counselor told him to consider some safety
schools as well, not to become too entranced with those he saw
first. But the warning faded once he reached Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball coach, Harry Sheehy, invited Crotty and his
parents out for Halloween weekend, to see the campus and a football
game, and talk over the basketball program. Williams has a strong
Division III team, but no athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy's low-key sales job and the enthusiasm of students stood
ou to Crotty. But what won him over in particular was the
description he heard, several times, of many undergraduates there:
``Student-athletes.'' That sounded just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking in the middle of town with my parents, not
saying anything. And they said, do you like it? And I said, this
might be the place,'' Crotty recalled. His parents tried to hide
their excitement: ``My dad's like, yeah, maybe. And I was like, I
think it is. And they're both like, Oh, we LOVE it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks grinded by with no word on his application. But the day he
was heading home for winter break, a single letter was slipped into
his mailbox at school. ``I read the whole thing by myself,'' he
said, ``and it just felt like, bingo.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Crotty will head for Williams. Meanwhile, he will
pack clothes and pictures and a computer, what with 600 songs on
it. He will meet his roommate, Adam. He will play basketball, he
hopes, and put more energy into a part of life he hasn't explored:
falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, he will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope everything continues to go well. But I'm working
hard. I'm working at it.''

MORE AIRFARE SITES READY TO CHALLENGE PRICELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Amazon, AOL, and eBay before it, Priceline.com made an
almost immediate jump into the public consciousness three years
ago. And like its fellow trailblazers, Priceline quickly attracted
a swarm of imitators.
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline name, though, has remained synonymous with
name-your-own-price airfare over the years despite facing a gaggle
of look-alike sites. Only now, in fact, is Priceline about to face
truly threatening competition.
</P>
<P>
   That's because at least half a dozen Web sites have just taken
off _ or are taxiing into final position _ with the promise to save
fliers money using unique ``alternative pricing mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   As Priceline shook up the travel world with its innovative way
of selling tickets in 1997, a couple of these sites could shake
things up in 2000:
</P>
<P>
   --www.Hotwire.com is a joint venture of six major airlines, and
it is aimed squarely at Priceline's market. Also, from a consumer's
standpoint, it's a darned good idea.
</P>
<P>
   American, America West, Continental, Northwest, United, and US
Airways teamed up, essentially, to win back the ``distressed
inventory'' market from Priceline. These are the seats that go
empty on scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than get nothing for the unoccupied seats, airlines try
to lure last-minute, budget-minded travelers to them with low fares
not listed in industry-wide reservation systems. Airlines make the
unpublished fares available through their own Web sites, discount
travel agencies, and, increasingly, Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   Hotwire differs from Priceline in that you don't have to name
your own price. You plug in the parameters you want and see what
kind of discounts Hotwire can dig up for you.
</P>
<P>
   After you do a search, you have half an hour to buy a ticket for
one of the itineraries offered. If you pass, you can't search the
same route for 72 hours _ though your spouse, child, or Internet
alter-ego can.
</P>
<P>
   The site is technically scheduled to launch later this month,
but the ``beta version'' is online and open for business now.
</P>
<P>
   --www.Orbitz.com is the most controversial of the new sites,
even though it isn't scheduled to take off for a couple of weeks.
Both low-tech and high-tech travel agents have complained loudly
and bitterly about Orbitz since it was unveiled last spring, and
the Justice Department is reportedly conducting an antitrust
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With all that fuss, you have to assume there must be something
interesting going on. And there is.
</P>
<P>
   American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, and United combined
forces to found the site, which has a $100 million war chest of
start-up financing. The idea is for this single site to use an
MIT-created search engine to plow through both the published
industry fares and the unpublished discount fares available from
the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that really scares travel agents is that Orbitz plans
to offer the same discount services for hotel rooms, rental cars,
cruises, and full-service travel packages. They fear Orbitz will
offer low-ball prices until it essentially puts the competition out
of business, then will raise them again.
</P>
<P>
   While the travel agents fret and the feds investigate, you can
take a sneak peek at a stripped down version of Orbitz's system at
www.itasoftware.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.iDerive.com began selling consumer electronics Friday and
will launch its car-buying service Sept. 15, but won't make hotels
and plane tickets available through the site until November.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, iDerive will offer a list of discounted tickets
for the route in which you're interested. If one looks good, you
accept it and then wait _ to see if iDerive accepts you. If the
airline later opts not to give you seats at the quoted price, your
credit card doesn't get charged and, for your trouble, you get a
check for the full amount of the would-be tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Mark Nordlicht says the airlines have such sophisticated
revenue-management software these days that iDerive customers will
get the tickets they sign up for 95 times out of 100. In the other
five cases, they'll get a nice little check but will be left
scrambling for another ticket five days before they want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting concept, but probably one that works better
for cars and consumer electronics than for airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   --www.Savvio.com is a good, old-fashioned reverse auction site
that happens to specialize in airline and cruise-ship tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines can get rid of distressed inventory through Savvio by
offering the tickets at a discounted price, usually 10 percent to
40 percent below the going rate. As the flight dates approach,
prices will fall for any unsold tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are supposed to keep heading south until they're sold out
or the auction ends _ in the case of travel tickets, the auctions
have limited time frames, for obvious reasons. Travelers can jump
in at any time during the auction to scoop up tickets that have
fallen to prices they're willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The site started taking orders Friday, even though its official
launch date is Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   --www.Revelex.com promises to offer a ``continuous double
auction'' format along the lines of the Nasdaq Stock Market. It has
circled Sept. 20 on the calendar as its launch date in the 25
biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   In English, a ``continuous double auction'' is one in which
buyers and sellers submit bids and offers on a rolling basis that
are visible to everyone involved. There is no beginning or end to
the auction, but shares (or plane tickets) change hands whenever a
buyer and seller match prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Revelex, travelers submit bids that are listed for all to see
and are ranked from highest to lowest. At the same time, airlines
and ticket consolidators submit offers that are also displayed for
all to see, but listed from lowest to highest.
</P>
<P>
   Any time a high bid and a low offer overlap, a deal is
consummated. To ensure adequate sellers on the site, Revelex has
partnered with the International Air Transport Association, which
counts the major US airlines as members.
</P>
<P>
   --www.FairAir.com hopes to split the difference between the two
groups of traditional travelers: corporate road warriors who aren't
concerned with price, and price-conscious vacationers who are
perfectly willing to stop in Pittsburgh and Minneapolis on their
way to Denver if they can save $150 per ticket.
</P>
<P>
   FairAir's big breakthrough is to acknowledge that some business
fliers want cheap tickets, too, but not with the limitations that
usually make them non-transferable and non-refundable for the
vacation set.
</P>
<P>
   The details are sketchy at this point, but FairAir says it is
creating an industry-sanctioned electronic exchange where travelers
can buy, sell, or trade tickets they bought on the site. That would
allow frequent fliers to buy discounted tickets, then unload them
if something changes later.
</P>
<P>
   FairAir.com is scheduled to debut in November, but you can leave
your e-mail address now if you want to get updates as things
progress.

MARVEL GAMBLES ON `ULTIMATE' READERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUIS PORTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the whirlwind of American teen culture, the flashy
superheroes and soap-operatic stories of comic books seem like a
beacon of stability, or at least longevity. Spider-Man, the
Fantastic Four, and the X-Men have been around for decades, but the
stability is an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having a safe, if immature, spot in the world of
publishing, the spandex-wearing superheroes face a threat much
scarier than the arch-villain Green Goblin _ a precipitous drop in
sales over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel Comics, the largest independent comics company (DC, its
main rival, is owned by Time Warner), is trying to reverse the
trend of declining readership. Starting this week, the company will
release a new line of comic books, optimistically titled the
``Ultimate'' series, as a way to get kids reading _ and buying _
comics again.
</P>
<P>
   The largest publishing initiative in Marvel's history will
reintroduce some of its most popular characters _ Spider-Man on
Thursday, the X-Men early next year _ in new story lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing absolutely the most obvious thing possible,''
says Bill Jemas, Marvel president of publishing and new media.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he explains, the industry neglected young readers who
buy comics in drugstores, newsstands, and shoe shops, to write and
sell almost exclusively through specialty comic book outlets.
Consequently the industry has been losing 7 to 10 percent of its
sales a year since the speculative comic boom of the mid-1990s.
(Yes _ there was a speculative boom in comics just like those in
21st-century Internet stocks and 17th-century tulip bulbs.) Marvel
has suffered along with the rest of the pack _ the company sells
about 36 million issues a year now, down from the 150 million it
produced at the speculation peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a madness going on, as happens every so often,''
says John Miller, a comics fan and editor of Comics Retailer and
Comics Buyer's Guide, a publication based in Iola, Wis. A friend of
Miller's bought 5,000 copies of the 1991 issue in which Marvel
relaunched the X-Men, believing he would eventually make money on
their resale as collectibles. Unfortunately for Miller's friend,
Marvel printed more than 7 million copies of the book, making them
almost worthless today.
</P>
<P>
   Along with takeovers, consolidations, and confusion among the
distributors and the boom-and-bust speculation cycles, there were
fewer and fewer outlets for comics. Mom-and-pop drugstores and
newsstands stopped carrying the heroes' adventures. Consequently
there is now a generation who never spent time under the covers
with a flashlight getting hooked on heroes spouting one-liners and
fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   But probably the biggest reason for the decline in sales is the
complexity of the stories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The continuity problem &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvel is finding itself trapped by their very strength _
their continuity,'' says Matt Lehman, the owner of Comicopia, a
comics bookstore in Boston's Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel's innovation was that if Peter Parker (Spider-Man's nerdy
alter ego), or any of Marvel's characters, got married or killed in
one issue, they stayed that way in future ones, Lehman explained.
This strict continuity was lacking in the comic books of other
companies, including DC, which predated Marvel.
</P>
<P>
   The continuity ``was really interesting and exciting,'' says
Lehman, who started reading comics as a teenager growing up on Long
Island in the 1970s. But over the decades the complex, cohesive
story line meant that getting a new reader was like asking a
pre-teen to jump into the middle of ``War and Peace.'' As Jemas
says, it is almost impossible for a 12-year-old to pick up an
``Uncanny X-Men'' book and follow the story. Or a 40-year-old, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   So along comes the ``Ultimate'' experiment's attempt to vanquish
comics' availability and accessibility woes with one dynamic,
web-swinging entrance by Spider-Man. Taking a page from comic book
history, the company will sell the books in a wide variety of
places, shipping about 75,000 monthly issues to comic shops (making
``Ultimate Spider-Man'' one of the top 15 comic titles), and
200,000 copies to newsstands. The first comic in the ``Ultimate
Spider-Man'' series will retail for $2.99; following issues will
cost $2.25, the price of most comic books. In addition, Marvel will
produce 3 million free, one-time promo copies of ``Spider-Man''
that will be distributed by Buster Brown Shoes and game company
Activision.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's popular ``X-Men'' feature film and next summer's
``Spider-Man'' movie will also help Marvel with its promotional
campaign. The company hopes the films will introduce the
superheroes to new readers, preparing them for Ultimate's new story
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to modernize the stories and reshape them from
the beginning. For instance, Peter Parker will no longer be a
freelance photographer for the 1960s Daily Bugle, but instead will
be a Web designer for the newspaper's online edition. And since the
comic will start, well, at the beginning of Parker's story, Marvel
hopes a new batch of teens will start reading the books,
unencumbered by almost 40 jam-packed years of back story.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the Ultimate series will be able
to climb the Empire State Building (we won't say leap it in a
single bound _ Superman works for DC). Comic companies have tried
to entice kids back to reading comics before, and had little
success because of the quality of the comics, according to Jemas.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, those books for kids have been some of the worst
(stuff) in comics, and maybe in publishing,'' says Jemas, who left
Marvel in 1996. When he rejoined the company last February after
managing the sports division of Madison Square Garden, he
immediately focused on the Ultimate project. He knew that the
writers and artists working on the new books had to be the best,
which, he says, was not the case with previous kid-directed books.
</P>
<P>
   So Marvel signed Brian Michael Bendis, a freelancer who has
built a large following by drawing his own, independent comics, to
write the Ultimate Spider-Man books. Bendis will not significantly
alter the characters or dumb down the comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comics have always been written on a pretty adult level. My
job is merely to write the best story possible,'' Bendis says,
adding, ``Stan Lee (the `grandfather' of Marvel who created
Spider-Man and the X-Men) is such a great writer that you don't
have to fall far from his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good the comics, there is no guarantee of success.
Marvel has to win back a mass audience that it hasn't reached in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have lost a generation of older-brother
influence,'' Jemas says. But he adds that he is sure the venture
will succeed, at least in producing good comics. ``On a content
level, we are not going to fail with this creative team.''

&HT;     STUDIOS: SMALL CAN BE BEAUTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A studio apartment can be a gem unto itself if
you put a little thought and creativity into it.
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of ingenuity, you can make living areas from
seemingly nonexistent space.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary closet can become a kitchen, and room dividers made
from a pair of antique doors or wrought iron gates define open
space as functional and personalized living areas.
</P>
<P>
   Before you start, get rid of any unnecessary items _ from
furnishings to clothing. If you can't part with some things, put
them in storage.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to think about unifying the space with
monochromatic tones and materials that appear weightless, suggests
James Grayson Trulove and Il Kim in their book, ``Studio
Apartments: Big Ideas for Small Spaces'' (William Morrow $30).
</P>
<P>
   Trulove is a publisher, editor and author in the fields of
landscape, architecture, art, graphic design and architecture. Kim
is an architect and co-author of ``The New American Cottage.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos and floor plans in their book illustrate how more than 20
architects and interior designers extract maximum style and usage
from small, urban dwellings. The result is a compilation of ideas
spanning styles from traditional to casual modern and cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Parsons + Fernandez-Casteleiro designed a studio
with five separate parts _ library, study/dining room, living room,
entrance and kitchen _ with each part crossing over to another, but
unified by a sinuous wall. One section of wall conceals a Murphy
bed that opens into the living area at night. In the main area of
the studio, a large built-in shelf hides a bed.
</P>
<P>
   When the bed is down, a rolling translucent panel divides an
open living/dining space into two distinct areas: a guest bedroom
and a breakfast room, where the owners can eat without disturbing
their sleeping guests.
</P>
<P>
   Interior designer Diana Vinoly, of Diana Vinoly Interiors in New
York City, told the authors she was inspired by yacht architecture,
which requires many functions in a restricted space.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a small space, you can always be adventuresome without much
cost,'' said interior designer Nancy Smith, owner of Saratoga
Signature Interiors in Saratoga Springs and Albany. ``It's easy to
experiment with paint, and the color you choose has a lot to do
with the personality of who lives there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says dark colors paired up with white woodwork are
especially effective in small areas, particularly bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Trulove and Kim suggest painting the trim, ceiling and walls in
deep, strong colors that can blur the edges of a room, making it
appear larger.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting is also critical to making small projects provocative,
according to the authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In small spaces, it's nice to be dramatic,'' explained Smith.
``You can accomplish this in a few ways by using lighting coming up
from the floor to wash a wall or highlight a plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how you direct it, recessed lighting in the ceiling
can also wash a wall to illuminate artwork, sculpture or plants.
Table lamps (if you have space for tables) add warmth to a room.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors can also do wonders for a small area. In addition to
reflecting light, they create the illusion of space.
</P>
<P>
   A photo in ``Studio Apartments,'' shows a room by New York City
designer James Brehm, who hung a drapery divider near a
floor-to-ceiling mirror. The effect makes the drapery look twice as
wide. It also was hung in front of a wall to create the illusion of
space beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   Placing a mirror on a wall across from a window will give the
appearance of two windows. A floor-to-ceiling mirror can create the
illusion of another room.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture should be multifunctional, such as a storage trunk
coffee table or a desk that's built into a freestanding wall of
bookcases with a walk-around on one or both sides. The back of the
bookcase can serve as a wall for the head of your bed. A daybed
doubles as a sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Curved walls create irregular movement within the space. Walls
can be a simple as framed panels covered with a neutral colored
burlap or sturdier framing and Sheetrock covered with paint or
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Add another dimension to the wall by constructing shelving,
cubicles or drawers or build the wall around a buffet or antique
chest of drawers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Built-ins are not only functional, but add architectural
appeal as well,'' added Smith. ``They also help to free the space
from too much clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studio apartment dwellers need to be creative with storage and
closet space. IKEA (http://www.ikea.com or 800-434-IKEA) offers a
large selection of reasonably priced beds, such as a twin daybed
that has a roll-out spare bed underneath for $60.
</P>
<P>
   The company also features a wide selection of wardrobes for
between $676 and $834 that feature shelves, drawers and hanging
space enclosed with frosted tempered safety glass doors.
</P>
<P>
   Their wardrobes, which also have solid or mirrored doors, can be
customized to fit your space and storage needs. These freestanding
units make great room dividers. Hanging framed pictures and works
of art on the back creates a dining or breakfast space.
</P>
<P>
   If the ceilings are high enough in your studio, you might
consider the addition of a loft, which can be used for sleeping, a
library or guest area. The area beneath can be used as a living
room or dining area.

WRITING HIMSELF INTO HISTORY 
Oscar Micheaux, His Silent Films, and His Audience 
By Pearl Bowser and Louise Spence 
Rutgers University Press, 288 pp., illustrated, $52 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably not a coincidence that Oscar Micheaux made his
first film just a few years after D.W. Griffith's ``Birth of a
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith's 1915 racist masterpiece presented such a virulent
depiction of blacks that it was blamed for riots, lynchings, and
the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, which it glorified. Four years
later, Micheaux made ``The Homesteader,'' with the promise that
``aside from the general public, who themselves have never seen a
picture in which the Negro race and a Negro hero is so portrayed,
12 million Negro people will have their first opportunity to see
their race in (a) stellar role.''
</P>
<P>
   As astute as he was ambitious, Micheaux saw the ill effects of
Griffith's film, and understood the ability of film to help shape
public perceptions about his community. So for 30 years, Micheaux
made his pioneering ``race films,'' each boasting ``an all-star
colored cast,'' which sought to counterbalance Hollywood's
then-common portrayals of blacks as buffoons and brutes.
</P>
<P>
   Given his importance as one of the seminal figures in American
film, ``Writing Himself into History,'' Pearl Bowser and Louise
Spence's scholarly examination of Micheaux serves a dual purpose.
Through six essays, they analyze Micheaux's work, how it was
received by both blacks and whites, and how his films encouraged
fresh discussions about race. But Bowser and Spence's book also
rescues the filmmaker's accomplishments from decades of obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1884 on a farm on the Ohio River, Micheaux declared
early in his life that he would become, in his words, ``a personage
of much importance.'' He was the son of a slave, but he had no love
of field work, preferring to spend his days reading and writing. By
his 20s, he was submitting autobiographical stories to the Chicago
Defender, a black weekly, about his experiences as a homesteader in
South Dakota. He self-published his first novel, ``The Conquest,''
in 1913, and would write six more books.
</P>
<P>
   Micheaux saw himself as a man without limits. He thought himself
capable of anything he set his mind to, and that included writing
and directing a film based on his novel, ``The Homesteader.'' That
Micheaux knew nothing about making a film was irrelevant; he
budgeted the film at $15,000, and produced an eight-reeler that he
declared was ``destined to mark a new epoch in the achievements of
the Darker Races.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was a hit, and Micheaux was committed to representing
black life as he knew it. And by ``addressing such contemporary
social issues as rape concubinage, miscegenation, peonage, and
lynching,'' the authors write, ``he created a textured and
expressive response to the social crises that circumscribed Negro
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Micheaux's films gave the white establishment
all kinds of fits. Sheriffs and theater owners believed the films
would inflame racial tensions and send black folks rioting in the
streets. Micheaux was quick to point out that the only film of the
time that violently agitated black filmgoers was Griffith's ``Birth
of a Nation.'' To the contrary, his films became known as race
pictures, which ``identified them as products generated by and for
the community,'' and blacks saw them as a source of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Well, some blacks anyway. There were complaints that Micheaux's
scripts tended to focus on the foibles of the black middle class,
ignoring their counterparts in the inner city. Though all of his
actors were black, their light complexions and straight hair also
seemed to promote a European ideal of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the films themselves. Technically, they were
a mess. The lighting and editing were sloppy, and Micheaux's
scripts were at times poorly plotted. Of course, it's doubtful his
actors noticed, since most were amateurs, and their skills ran the
gamut from wobbly to woeful. By 1925, even black critics were
denouncing Micheaux's films. In the Amsterdam News, a black weekly
in New York, Romeo L. Dougherty criticized Micheaux's films as
``passe'' compared with Hollywood films, which were beginning to
open slightly to black performers. Wrote another critic in The
Afro-American, ``The day is gone when people will pay to see a
colored picture simply because it is a colored picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their faults, the films of Micheaux paved the way for
others by and about African-Americans, proving there was a market
and an interest in films about his community. Just this summer,
three films starring or directed by African Americans _ ``Scary
Movie,'' ``The Nutty Professor 2,'' and ``Big Momma's House'' _
have surpassed the magic $100 million mark. Micheaux would be proud
_ but not surprised.

MONTREAL FILM FEST OFFERS NEEDED ALTERNATIVE TO HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Momentarily, the season's new films will be upon us,
ushered in via a stream of festivals _ Telluride, Toronto, Boston,
New York. But first, as always, the season's new crop surfaces in
Montreal, fittingly enough for a city perched on North America's
birth canal, the St. Lawrence River. At a time when the film
community, like the rest of the world, is run by a handful of
multinationals, ``festival'' has come to mean an alternative to
Hollywood. Most of the more than 300 films that were screened here
through Labor Day won't be seen at your local multiplex. Festivals
are a reminder that there's more to film than what the studios
aptly call ``product.''
</P>
<P>
   Two international figures bringing new films were China's Gong
Li and India's Om Puri. Each is the equal in stature to any
Hollywood star. Yet, it's a tossup whether ``Breaking the
Silence,'' in which Gong plays the struggling single mother of a
deaf boy, or ``My Little Devil,'' in which Puri plays a cook who
befriends a boy in a Catholic boarding school, will be seen on many
screens in the United States. Gong's quiet heroism shines from
beneath the everyday textures of ``Breaking the Silence.'' So does
that of her unruly young son (Gao Xin) in a film where the big
question is how she can scrape enough money together to replace his
hearing aid, broken by school bullies.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sense of victimization or playing for sympathy in Sun
Zhou's ``Breaking the Silence,'' just a bravery whose
matter-of-factness is reinforced by the film's muted neorealistic
style. Om Puri also takes a chance playing opposite a charismatic
child, in this case Rushabh Patni, the protagonist of ``My Little
Devil.'' The title is affectionately bestowed. Patni's spry orphan
gets into trouble, but most of it stems from his kindheartedness in
stealing food to feed the hungry family of an African-Indian
friend. As the avuncular cook who does what he can to help, Puri
plays only a supporting role, but he manages to stand for the
humane impulses of an entire culture in this film directed by his
``My Son the Fanatic'' costar, Gopi Desai.
</P>
<P>
   As you would expect in French-speaking Quebec, most of the films
are from Canada and France. Opening-night films can be political
triumphs but artistic disasters. Happily, this wasn't so for Agnes
Jaoui's ``Le Gout des Autres'' (``The Taste of Others''). It's a
richly rewarding ensemble piece that doesn't rely on dramatic
thunderbolts, but rather makes you feel steadily more invested in
the lives of its characters, who without exception grow on you as
they always did in the hands of Jaoui's obvious model _ and it's a
great one _ Jean Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   There's much humor, including a lot of the rueful kind. But it's
humane comedy as well as human comedy, set in motion by characters
imparting meaning to the title by imposing their tastes _ in
paintings, plays, decor, morals _ on others. In general, the
control freaks don't emerge happily, but Jaoui has given the actors
fresh, unexpected, and complex roles, and they respond brilliantly
and affectingly. First among equals is Jean-Pierre Bacri, as a
factory owner who is by no means the philistine he initially may
seem. He's so moved by a play that he falls in love with its
leading actress _ and deeply, not superficially. His two bodyguards
provide a few surprises, too. So does Jaoui as a waitress who sells
drugs on the side. But so do they all in this film, one of the
year's very best, that unerringly finds the telling behavioral
detail.
</P>
<P>
   As for films from the United States, the big event was David
Mamet's screwball comedy and Hollywood showbiz satire, ``State and
Main.'' It should once and for all lay to rest any doubts about
whether Mamet can write funny. ``State and Main,'' set in motion
when a Hollywood film shoot invades a small Vermont town, isn't
quite all it could have been, but it throbs with gleeful
outrageousness and comic inventiveness. Imagine Mephistopheles with
a cell phone, invading Eden, and you'll have an idea just how
amusingly William H. Macy's director and David Paymer's producer
work the place over, with the aid of Alec Baldwin's star who seeks
out underage girls with the destructive intent of a heat-seeking
missile. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the writer whose soul is the
film's moral battleground, is, as always, a big plus, and so is
Rebecca Pidgeon in what I can't help thinking of as the Jean Arthur
role. More later on ``State and Main,'' when it begins what I hope
will be its long run.
</P>
<P>
   The promise in the casting of Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in
``Under Suspicion'' was thuddingly unfulfilled by that film. One
had hoped for a meaty routine thriller, but it was not to be. The
only fresh things in this otherwise inert remake of Claude Miller's
``Garde a vue'' were a few views of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and
Monica Bellucci as the sleekly beautiful young wife of a big-shot
tax attorney played by Hackman. He's suspected by Freeman's
homicide detective of serially raping and murdering preadolescent
girls. The lawyer is diverted from a charity gala to a grilling in
police headquarters across the plaza. But if the idea was to turn
up the claustrophobic pressure, it backfires badly. Once confined
to the interrogation room, the film goes nowhere fast, losing
energy and purpose and reminding us that even pros the caliber of
Hackman and Freeman are in the end only actors, not magicians.
</P>
<P>
   A much livelier and more original twist on violence comes in an
offbeat feminist action thriller from Finland, Auli Mantila's
``Pelon Maantiede'' (``Geography of Fear''). In it, a squad of
abused women turned ninja avengers go after male sexist abusers.
Caught in the middle is a forensic dentist who, as a woman, shares
their views, but has trouble accepting their embrace of
criminality.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the name of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski on its
screenplay drew audiences to a Polish film, ``The Big Animal.''
It's an elegant, wistful parable in artful black and white,
directed by Jerzy Stuhr, who completed Kieslowski's unfinished
script. He also stars as a provincial bank clerk who awakens one
day to find that a camel has wandered into his yard. Flecked with
the wonder of incongruity, the film alternates Magritte-like
vignettes with prototypical Central European absurdity and
sociopolitical resonances as it plays out the fate of the exotic
arrival in an environment too base to know how to appreciate it.

ALLY SHEEDY'S REALITY CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So what happened to Ally Sheedy? Back in the
mid-1980s, when she was in her early 20s, Sheedy seemed like a
sure-fire star in the churning _ from the girl-next-door ideal in
``WarGames'' to the foxily frumpy screwball in ``The Breakfast
Club'' to the only appealing character in the Brat-Packed ``St.
Elmo's Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, she vanished into a decade-long vortex of drab
roles in dreary comedies and finally just about went pphhht!
altogether, until two years ago, when, out of the blue, she took a
colossal leap to play a heroin-snorting lesbian photographer in a
small indie film called ``High Art.'' She won enormous acclaim for
her performance _ including three top critics' prizes for best
actress _ only then to return to obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she stopped working. Her latest film, ``Autumn Heart''
_ which was shot in and around Boston a month after ``High Art''
was wrapped _ opens Friday. She's done some episodes of ``Oz'' for
HBO. She plays the title role in ``The Warden,'' a TNT pilot that
airs in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the big agents, the big producers, the big networks haven't
been calling, and the big question is, Why not? Why isn't this
woman's phone ringing off the hook?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may have as much to do with modern Hollywood as with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a coffee bar not far from her apartment on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, Sheedy recalls the epiphany of her
professional life. It took place 11 years ago, just after she had
starred in two successive bombs. Her career seemed in danger of
tanking, and her agent of the time told her _ though she quotes his
remarks in more vivid terms _ that her problem was, nobody in the
moviegoing audience would want to go to bed with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling was,'' Sheedy goes on, lighting up another in a
nonstop series of cigarettes (American Eagles: no additives, no
preservatives), ``that there was this emergency, that I had to turn
myself into something people would want to buy. The idea was I'd
have to become a sexpot. I needed to change my hair, my body. None
of it had anything to do with any work I wanted to do.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Immersed in feminism &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The whole incident threw Sheedy into particular shock because,
while she was growing up, her mother, the literary agent Charlotte
Sheedy, was one of Manhattan's most active feminists; she'd turned
their Central Park West apartment into a lively salon. In 1971,
when Ally was 9, Charlotte divorced her ad-executive husband and, a
few years later, came out as a lesbian. For as long as she can
remember, then, Ally Sheedy wasn't merely immersed in the women's
liberation movement; she was practically present at its creation.
</P>
<P>
   So, to be told, while still in her 20s, that she would have to
go sexy to make it in Hollywood _ ``well,'' she says, still
seething a little, ``it would be like a writer being brought up in
a left-wing family and having an editor say, `The only thing you
can do is write a book that's a glowing portrait of Bill Gates.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just my agent who told me this,'' she adds. ``I
heard the same thing, in lots of different translations, from
everybody. The only person who told me otherwise was Jane Fonda.
She took time to talk to me. She told me, `What you are is a
character actress. You need a variety of roles. Work really hard to
get them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was the studios weren't offering many such roles for
actresses. The independent-film scene didn't yet exist. So, Sheedy
says, ``I just felt I had to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, Sheedy was in a relationship with Richie
Sambora, the guitarist in Bon Jovi, and became addicted to the
sleeping drug Halcion while traveling with the band on tour. After
the intervention of a few friends _ including Fonda _ she checked
into a clinic in Minnesota, cleaned up, went to Chicago to audition
for a play at the experimental Steppenwolf Theater (she got the
part), then moved back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that being a movie star is not what I wanted to do
_ not once I realized what it entailed,'' she says. ``I wanted to
be an actress. I got out of New York originally because I'd grown
up there, I wanted to be independent. I'd done commercials here. I
wanted to see if I could get into movies, see if I could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   She did get into the movies, almost from the moment she arrived
on the coast at age 18. But after the hits came the duds, and that
was it. ``They really have these lists,'' she says. ``One day I was
on the A list, then suddenly I was way down in the alphabet _ I was
on something like an E list. When that happens, especially if
you're a woman, you just don't get many shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Abramowitz, author of ``Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?,''
a chronicle of women and power in Hollywood, says Sheedy's story is
far from unusual. ``A female head-of-production at a major studio
told me that actresses are `a disposable commodity,' '' Abramowitz
recalls. ``All these beautiful young women come out here, have one
or two minutes in the spotlight, then it's on to the next one. It's
very hard for actresses, after they turn 35, to move to another
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one actress, Julia Roberts, can all but guarantee the
success of a movie these days. Several men can. So, Abramowitz
says, the studios ``build a movie around a male star, build him up,
and basically gut the female part. You see this constantly _
constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, even a genius like Meryl Streep has a hard
time. A cannily appealing actress like Renee Russo keeps her career
going by playing mature wives or girlfriends to Kevin Costner or
Mel Gibson. Other talented actresses who don't quite fit that bill
_ Isabella Rosselini, Elizabeth Perkins, Diane Lane _ start
dropping off the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sheedy, who is 38, Abramowitz says, ``She really shocked
the town when she came back with `High Art.' But she seems a
too-complicated presence just to be somebody's girlfriend. She has
this spiky intelligence. The studios don't know what to do with
it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A resonant line &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a line in ``High Art'' when Sheedy's character explains
why she left the high-glamour world of photography: ``I loved the
attention, but I couldn't handle the impact _ I sort of felt
pigeonholed.'' ``When I read that monologue,'' she remembers, ``I
thought, `I know this part, I know this like the back of my hand.'
''
</P>
<P>
   It was by pure accident that Sheedy even found out about that
role. In the summer of 1997, she was fired by the William Morris
Agency, whose executives calculated that her acting income was too
meager to justify their continued services. Suddenly, she was an
actress without an agent, which is like being a canoeist without a
paddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so depressed,'' she says, ``I didn't know what I was
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Sheedy's sister-in-law, a secretary in a smaller
agency, had just been promoted to agent. Her agency had the script
for ``High Art.'' She read it and passed it along to Sheedy, who
jumped on the chance, called the director herself, and pleaded for
an audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roles like this are so hard to find _ complicated characters
with a dark side,'' she says. ``The actresses I've always admired _
Judy Davis, Helen Mirren, Genevieve Bujold _ they're complicated,
they get angry, they're real people, they have all sorts of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to be nice anymore,'' Sheedy sums up. ``I'm
not interested in nice characters anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly she's not nice in ``Autumn Heart,'' a film about three
sisters and their rocky reunion with their father and brother, who
ran out on them and their mother when the girls were small. Sheedy
plays the most bitter, profane, and unforgiving of the sisters. She
speaks in a convincing Boston accent (which she learned from her
sister's Boston-bred husband _ ``I had him sit down and read my
part'') and works herself into fits of anger so stormy and real you
can feel the steam blowing out of her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I have a lot of anger inside,'' she says. ``It's fun to
get a character who's such a raging _ I wouldn't say `lunatic,' but
someone just about to go over the edge. There's something
liberating about that. It's not cathartic, because I still have it.
I think it's important not to lose it. It's important to keep it
all in reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheedy hasn't hit stardom, but by most actors' standards, she's
doing very well. That is to say, she manages to support herself and
her family _ her husband, fellow actor David Lansbury, whom she met
on a stage set in 1992 shortly after she returned to New York, and
their 6-year-old daughter, Rebecca _ on her earnings..
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant juggling act,'' she says. ``Indies don't
pay.You get scale or less. I got paid less than scale for `High
Art' and `Autumn Heart.' The TV stuff'' _ the movies she's made for
various cable channels _ ``is where I make money. I try to find
something that's not totally dreck _ most of the time. I have to do
something at least once a year to pay the bills. The rest of the
time, I get basically nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her success in ``High Art'' improved her situation _ a little.
``I was in the desert for a while _ which is not to say it's an
oasis now,'' she says with a laugh. ``I'm seeing a lot of material
that I wouldn't have been offered before. Stuff like `The Warden' _
I don't think they would have considered me a viable option for
that.'' But the basic reality is the same: ``If `The Warden'
results in a series, fine. If it doesn't go, I'm looking for
another job to pay the bills. This is one thing about being an
actress _ you're always waiting for the project to come along and
find you.''

RON ROSENBAUM: TEARING THROUGH THE KNOTTIEST MAZES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SECRET PARTS OF FORTUNE 
Three Decades of Intense Investigations and Edgy Enthusiasms 
By Ron Rosenbaum. Random House,. 799 pp. $29.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not the smallest delight of living where I do is the Wednesday
ritual of going to the newsstand, picking up the weekly New York
Observer, and riffling through its back pages to read the column
called ``The Edgy Enthusiast'' by Ron Rosenbaum. There is nothing
like these columns anywhere else: impassioned, obsessive probings
of whatever puzzles or pleasures happen to be crossing the author's
mind _ the broader significance of Yale's secret societies, the
true meaning of Keats's ``Ode to Autumn,'' the zen wisdom of Bill
Murray, the mystical silence of Salinger and Pynchon _ all imbued
with a feel, at once funny and melancholy, for humanity's uneasy
place in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   There's an enormous chutzpah to this sort of venture, and in
most hands it would turn arrogant or plain silly, but Rosenbaum
tears through the knottiest mazes and hieroglyphs _ whether of
metaphysics, poetics, or politics _ with an infectious zest, a
rock-solid meticulousness, and a conspiratorial intimacy, as if he
were inviting you to join him on a secret treasure hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his essays, on the blind Argentine fantasist-novelist
Jorge Luis Borges, he writes, ``It's a seductive and dangerous
taste, Borges. Once you've allowed yourself to be enticed into his
garden of forking paths, you can't be sure you'll emerge the same,
you can't be sure you'll emerge at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Rosenbaum's own twisty labyrinths.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum's approach to life and letters stems from two great
influences: Hardy Boys mysteries, which he devoured in his drab
suburban boyhood; and ``close reading,'' the technique of finding
literature's meaning by scrutinizing its text, which he learned
from Harold Bloom and the other ``New Critics'' in the English lit
department at Yale (Class of '68).
</P>
<P>
   ``Close reading,'' Rosenbaum writes in this book's introduction,
``was more than a way . . . of unlocking the secret parts of
literature. It was also, later, to become my chief asset as an
investigative reporter,'' as he realized he could apply the art to
such texts as ``trial transcripts, autopsy reports,
congressional-hearing records, Mob wiretap pickups'' _ in short,
the clues of real-life mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   He is drawn most avidly to ultimate mysteries, the enigmas whose
decoding might illuminate something fundamental in the nature of
things. ``The search for the hidden hand, the hidden springs, the
hidden handshake behind history,'' he writes, ``attracts a certain
kind of glory seeker, Ancient Mariner, mad scholar, Wandering
Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is not quite one of those seekers; he has, as he puts
it, too much of ``what Keats called negative capability _ the
ability to abide uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts without
succumbing to the temptation of premature certainty.'' Yet his best
essays are about the succumbers _ the mad-driven scholars of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, the conspiracy buffs who glom on to the Kennedy
assassination, and their myriad kin ``who risk disintegration,
destabilization, in the single-minded, even self-destructive
devotion to the decipherment of such enigmas. . . . There's
something thrilling,'' he observes, ``about the passion, even the
madness of scholars when ultimate truths are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Parts of Fortune'' compiles 53 of Rosenbaum's
essays over the past 30 years, taken from a variety of
publications, some of which were collected in two earlier, long
out-of-print books (``Travels with Dr. Death'' and ``Manhattan
Lunches''). The thread running through nearly all of them is this
obsession with obsessives, a pursuit of pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is the opposite of didactic on this theme; he sneaks
up on you with it, then delivers a shiver. Take his piece on Henry
Lee Lucas, who confessed to murdering hundreds of random victims
and then said he'd made it all up. The tale is a well-told mystery
in its own right _ the tense uncertainty over which of Lucas's lies
are true, the fascinating ease with which he convinced the Texas
Rangers of the most glaring improbabilities. But what pushes the
piece over the top, what transforms it into something beyond
journalism, is the capper, Rosenbaum's final musing on serial
killers as a ``consoling myth'' _ based on a common ``longing to
ascribe all the inexplicable violence and tragedy in contemporary
life to inhuman alien monsters, cold-blooded killing machines,
rather than the warm-blooded people we live and work with.''
</P>
<P>
   To Rosenbaum, this longing is the human comedy and he finds it
explored most riotously in the novels of Charles Portis _ and here,
I should digress to touch on another of Rosenbaum's roles: literary
crusader. His main purpose in writing this particular piece, for
Esquire, was to urge some publisher to reissue Portis's
out-of-print masterpieces, ``Dogs of the South'' and ``Masters of
Atlantis''; and so passionate and persuasive was his plea that
Overlook Press did just that. For that alone, Rosenbaum deserves
enormous plaudits.
</P>
<P>
   But back to our theme. As Rosenbaum puts it, Portis's novels are
all ``about the longing for Hidden Secrets, the seductions of
secret societies . . . the profound, wistful desperation in the
American collective unconscious, to believe that somehow things do
make some kind of sense, that life is not all chaotic horror and
random acts of cruelty by fate, that there is an Answer, even if
it's locked in a trunk somewhere and we've lost the keys.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum touched on this desperation in ``Explaining Hitler,''
his brilliant bestseller of two years ago that sifted through the
various theories that scholars and theologians have devised to
explain _ ``to make some kind of sense'' of _ how the epicenter of
Western civilization could produce the most monstrous mass murderer
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of essays in ``The Secret Parts of Fortune''
are, in their own fashion, no less provocative and engaging.
Rosenbaum makes reading _ even reading about reading _ an
adventure.

VANDROSS: NEW LIFE WITH A NEW LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Santana got the Clive Davis treatment and ended up
winning eight Grammy awards this year. Whitney Houston, Sarah
McLachlan, and TLC didn't do too badly, either, with Davis guiding
their careers at Arista Records, where he was label president for
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always admired Clive's commitment to his artists. I can't
wait to be on his wagon,'' said Luther Vandross, the first major
artist joining a new label that Davis has formed since he was
squeezed out of Arista. _ thanks to a corporate power play that no
one quite understands _ soon after Santana's Grammy triumphs. The
new company, J Records, will be a subsidiary of BMG Records, which
owns Arista.
</P>
<P>
   Vandross, who headlines FleetBoston Pavilion  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  (some
tickets are still available), made the finest, most personal record
of his career two years ago in ``I Know,'' but it only went gold
(500,000 sales). He then parted ways with the label that released
it, Virgin Records.
</P>
<P>
   Vandross recently went to dinner with Davis, and the two hatched
plans for a comeback that may mirror what was done for Santana _
that is, a number of guest artists and producers are hired who give
Vandross fresh credibility and get him back on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive wants to get started immediately, and I can't wait to
work with him,'' Vandross said.
</P>
<P>
   Vandross's renewed enthusiasm extends to other areas of his
life. He is feeling great from doing step aerobics five days a week
and following a diet that has seen him shed 124 pounds and 20
inches of his waistline (from 54 inches to 34 inches). ``It's a
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet _ no bread or pasta, rice or
cereal. It's based on the Atkins diet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've changed my attitude toward food. I always used food
to cope with sadness and even extreme happiness. If you win a
Grammy, you eat to celebrate. If you lose a Grammy, you eat to
drown your sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   His weight loss also has helped his singing, he says. ``You get
more power, because you have more ability to breathe. Your
respiratory system is better, so you can hold a note much longer,''
Vandross said.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side, however, is that his dramatic weight loss sparked
rumors that he was sick. One rumor this summer even said that he
had died. ``It was started by some bored (expletive),''Vandross
said. ``It was horrible. I was only glad that I got to my mother
first before she heard it. I have three siblings and they all died
in the last three to four years, so my mother didn't need any more
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm officially telling everyone that I'm fine,'' said
Vandross, who has been on a well-received tour with Boyz II Men as
his opening act.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent suggested touring with Boyz II Men and I immediately
said `yes.' I felt it would be a treat for the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Several reviewers have talked about how relaxed Vandross appears
on stage this time, and he's pleased to hear it. And another reason
that he's eager to work with Davis is that he won't have to work so
hard to produce his own music, which drained his energy, but will
have outside producers helping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a variety of people on the record so I don't have to be
bouncing cello and viola tracks together at 4 a.m. like I have
done,'' Vandross said. ``I want to sing and then put on my coat and
go out with friends and go see things like `The Scary Movie,' which
is my recent favorite. And I want to go out with my nieces and
nephews. In this business, you can get sequestered in limousines
and the like, but I've gotten to the point where I rebel against
security. I want to go out and be with the public and breathe the
same air that they breathe.''

THE PRINCE OF TENNESSEE 
The Rise of Al Gore 
By David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima. Simon and &AMP; Schuster. 298
pp. $22. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subtitle of this campaign biography could be: The Riddle of
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Why does a disciplined, earnest, intelligent man with high
morals have, as the authors describe it, ``an occasional propensity
to enhance his role in events''? To believe that as a 20-year-old
he contributed to Hubert H. Humphrey's acceptance speech at the
1968 Democratic convention. To claim that he was ``shot at'' in
Vietnam when he never faced enemy fire. To expand his job
description at The New York Times from copy boy to ``newspaper
trainee.'' And, most famously, to pose as father of the Internet
and role model for the protagonist of ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima provide some answers in their
study of Gore's life, tracing the Democratic presidential nominee
from his unusual childhood and formal relationship with his father,
the late former senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, through Harvard
and the Vietnam War years to his decision to go into politics
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a need to live up to expectations, first those
of his parents, then those of the larger world,'' the authors
write. ``He had a competitive instinct that made him want to be
able to show that he could do anything and know everything. In a
broader sense, manipulating reality is an inherent aspect of
politics. Some politicians are deft at it, Gore seems especially
clumsy. His exaggerations are clunkers and he is a bad liar,
without the nuance or fluidity of Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Maraniss won a Pulitzer Prize for his work for
The Washington Post probing Clinton's background in Arkansas, an
assignment he turned into the best of the biographies of the
president, ``First in His Class.'' This year, Maraniss and
Nakashima, his colleague at the Post, produced an excellent series
on Gore that led to ``The Prince of Tennessee.'' (The publisher
says that roughly half the material is new and did not appear in
the newspaper.)
</P>
<P>
   The book is grounded in strong reporting and honest perception.
While many candidate biographies are rushed and rely on newspaper
clippings, ``The Prince of Tennessee'' sparkles with vignettes
drawn from hundreds of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The authors' portrait of Gore is that of a good family man with
a fine intellect and work ethic, though saddled with a few curious
flaws, an overachiever who always seemed older than his years.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to admire about Al Gore. Raised in the rarefied
air of a residential hotel off Dupont Circle in Washington and
educated at prep school, Gore managed to preserve his ties to the
earthier world of his ancestors in middle Tennessee. Deeply
conscious of the racial divide, he specifically requested a black
roommate at Harvard. When others, including Joe Lieberman and both
members of this year's Republican ticket, found ways to avoid
Vietnam, Gore felt an obligation even though he opposed the war.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse square in Carthage, Tenn., near the Gore family
home, contains a memorial to the fallen men of Smith County: 138
dead from the Civil War, 24 from World War I, another 54 from World
War II, and eight from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cambridge, reassured by the prevailing sense that the war
was evil and had to be stopped and that any means of avoiding it
was acceptable, Gore allowed himself to consider other options,''
the authors write. ``But it was impossible, he said later, for him
to think of Carthage and not come back to the conclusion that he
had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors located sources who said that Gore was given a safe
position in Vietnam. ``It was like being on a college campus,''
said one. Gore obtained an early release after less than five
months in the country. But he served.
</P>
<P>
   Like others of his generation, Al Gore smoked dope. The account
of his attempt to escape this bit of personal history is quite
comic. As is the time Gore, a cub reporter on the Nashville
Tennessean, took a phony obit for a Swedish gynecologist named
Trebla Erog. His own name spelled backward.
</P>
<P>
   There are suggestions that Gore's character has been shaped by
strains of his Southern Protestant faith. ``He comes from that
brand of religion that is informed by John Calvin,'' says
theologian Walter Harrelson, who taught Gore during his brief brush
with divinity school. ``Calvin has this deep, deep sense of how
human beings, none of them, can fully be trusted, precisely because
we're not God.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Barbara Howar, remembers young Al as ``an
egregious little tattletale'' at the Fairfax Hotel. As a reporter,
he went beyond the bounds of traditional journalism to testify
before Congress and to collaborate with Tennessee authorities in a
bribery investigation. He wrote every word of his best-selling
environmental scold, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and remains proud of
its preachy, provocative passages.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore was clearly influenced by his father, three women
have played enormous roles in his life: his mother, Pauline, a wise
guide throughout his life; his wife, Tipper, whose quiet work among
the homeless is almost Christlike in its virtue; and his sister,
Nancy, who had all the joie de vivre Al didn't. The chapter
concerning Nancy's death is more heartbreaking than Gore's personal
description, delivered at the 1996 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The book effectively ends as Gore becomes vice president. There
is nothing of his demolition of Ross Perot in the NAFTA debate and
little of his fund-raising caper at the Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty in ``The Prince of Tennessee'' to round out
a picture of a complicated man. The authors find intimations of the
courage it took to ask an Orthodox Jew to be his running mate, as
well as the fear of failure in a political leader who once blurted
to an aide: ``Don't you know how insecure I am?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Al Gore doesn't move fast, he's going to lose all the
momentum he's built up in the weeks since the DNC-17 Convention,
when he smooched Tipper with a kiss worthy of an episode of ``Red
Shoe Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kiss was great for Gore. The Kiss inspired dozens of
late-night monologue jokes, a hundred op-ed pieces and countless
political cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was greeted with raised eyebrows by the cynics, the
Kiss at least raised the possibility that the Tin Man has a heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiss even put a temporary halt to all those lame and
ill-informed digs at Gore for supposedly saying he'd invented the
Internet, was the inspiration for the character of Oliver in ``Love
Story'' and had a childhood friend named Harry Potter who had a
mysterious, thunderbolt scar on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's time for Gore to leave behind the Kiss in favor the
Diss.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's talking about the Kiss any more. All anyone wants to
talk about is the offhand remark George W. Bush made in Naperville
on Labor Day, on one of approximately 150 campaign stops the
Republican candidate made during a 36-hour stretch during which he
went without sleep, food, water or executing a prisoner on Death
Row in Texas _ all new records for ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   As you've no doubt heard by now, Bush put his Cole-Haan foot in
his mouth when he took to the stage at a rally, spotted a reporter
he considers to be particularly tough and said to Dick Cheney,
``There's Adam Clymer, major league a--hole from The New York
Times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, he is, big time,'' chimed in Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so THIS is what Bush meant when he said ``It's time to get
some plain-spoken folks in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, in the interest of accuracy, I checked with the
Times, and the aforementioned comment is NOT Clymer's official job
description. Their official stylebook indicates a preference for
the term ``correspondent.'')
</P>
<P>
   No doubt political candidates say stuff like that all the time
when the ties have been unbuttoned and the phones have been muted
and the room service trays are stacked outside the door _ but the
Bush-Cheney exchange took place in public and was caught by a live
microphone, thus giving a snoozing Labor Day press corps a spicy
little story worthy of a 24- or even a 48-hour news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   It was a positively Clintonian moment for the candidate, and I
mean that in a good way. People like to hear these guys
occasionally talking like real human beings as opposed to
programmed cyber-candidates on automatic pilot. (Bush had another
Clintonian moment years ago when a reporter asked him what he and
his pop talked about when they weren't talking politics, and the
frisky W. replied, ``Women.'' Only he didn't say ``women.'')
</P>
<P>
   With depressing self-righteousness, the Gore campaign pounced on
the remark with a load of horse hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold virtually all members of the Fourth Estate in the
highest regard and we believe they should be part of the democratic
process day in and day out,'' said Gore spokeswoman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, and you're all for campaign finance reform, and the check
is in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Clarification from the GOP and finger-wagging from the Dems
aside, the comment was a win-win for everyone involved. Clymer said
he was disappointed with Bush's language, but as a hard-hitting but
fair-minded reporter, he can't be too upset that the Republican
nominee has been rattled by his stellar work. (One of the more
satisfying moments in my career was when Michael Jordan told the
press a column of mine was ``all B.S., trying to sell newspapers.''
It proved I wasn't one of those creampuff media cronies of Jordan's
who spent most of the 1990s with their lips Super-Glued to his
posterior.)
</P>
<P>
   The jibe won't hurt W. either, as many voters would use that
same term to describe many of the perceived ``liberal media'' who
cover politics.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Gore has got to find a way to go from the Kiss to
the Diss. Beat W. at his own game!
</P>
<P>
   _ Get into a shoving match with a scribe from the Wall Street
Journal on Air Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do a Mick Jagger and point to an adversarial reporter from the
stage and proclaim, ``People, why are we fighting? Look if that guy
doesn't stop it right now, we're leaving!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Challenge Sam Donaldson to a duel.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kiss and the Diss, we've finally got a little campaign
momentum going here, boys. Don't go back to the script now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Lucas Orwig arrived at Brown University last
fall as nervous and excited as any freshman, eager to make new
friends with people from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate, who is Chinese, was already done looking for
friends by the time Orwig arrived, however. ``I thought it was
weird that all of his friends were Chinese,'' said Orwig, who grew
up in Houston. ``He had this group of friends, and I didn't get to
join them.''
</P>
<P>
   His roommate had been on campus four days early to attend the
Third World Transition Program, a pre-orientation conference for
minorities only. No whites were invited.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the program has become troubling to some people on
this Ivy League campus that prides itself on embracing diversity.
Critics say the program, designed to help minority students adjust
to the social and academic pressures of an elite school, is
divisive and indirectly promotes a segregated campus.
</P>
<P>
   Orwig, who describes himself as mixed-race, declined an
invitation to the program, known as TWTP. ``I don't feel like I
have issues with my race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other top colleges, including Yale, Tufts, Williams, Mount
Holyoke, and Wesleyan, have long held similar orientation programs.
Most, if not all of them, grew out of pro-diversity activism in the
1960s and 1970s. Brown's program started in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But some students and observers say minority orientations,
instead of encouraging integration and a more unified campus,
actually harm university race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College ended its minority orientation three years ago,
concluding that it sent the wrong message. And Brown's TWTP has
long been condemned by critics _ whites and non-whites alike _ as
fueling self-segregation on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader level, debates over the merits of minority-only
orientations are another illustration of how complex and tense the
topic of race continues to be.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, a ``Visiting Committee on Diversity'' at Brown,
made up mostly of scholars from other institutions, said in a
report that it ``strongly suggests'' that TWTP ``be integrated into
orientation activities organized for all entering students.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of that committee, Harvard Professor of Education
Pedro A. Noguera, said he was shocked to find that ``nothing had
changed in 20 years,'' since he was a Brown undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   TWTP ``is such a cozy experience. You meet all these nice folks,
and you don't feel the need to meet a lot of other people,'' said
Noguera, who attended TWTP. ``The administration has got to find
ways to serve students without isolating and separating them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Amherst, qualms about the school's minority orientation were
serious enough that trustees canceled it in 1997. ``Amherst risks a
serious misunderstanding of our principles by asking students to
arrive on campus in the first instance on the basis of differences
among them,'' President Tom Gerety said in a statement at the time.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown decides to follow the Visiting Committee's
recommendations _ after holding campus forums on them this fall _
it will face fierce and vocal opposition from many partisans of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Shin, now a senior, has found Brown's racial climate at
times inhospitable. One of the most startling affronts, said the
21-year-old Asian-American, came at the beginning of her freshman
year. A white student stood up at a class meeting and proclaimed,
as Shin remembers it, that racism doesn't exist, and that students
of color are paranoid if they think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It was a comment Shin took personally. Thankfully, she said, she
was able to draw strength from her experience at TWTP.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't gone to TWTP, I would have completely cracked when
he said that,'' said Shin, who coordinates the program. ``Survival
for us (minorities) is a lot harder.''
</P>
<P>
   In exit interviews on the eve of graduation, minority students
repeatedly name TWTP as the best, most vital part of their Brown
education, said Armando Bengochea, associate dean of the college,
who added that ``self-segregation'' would happen even without TWTP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have TWTP because the students who participate in it tell
us they want it, they need it,'' said Bengochea.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have only anecdotal evidence, administrators
believe TWTP _ along with other services such as ``minority peer
counselors,'' who live with freshmen, helps retain minority
students who might otherwise drop out, said Karen McLaurin-Chesson,
director of the Third World Center at Brown and an associate dean
of the college.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at TWTP, which mixes barbecues and dances with
workshops on topics like racism, sexism, and homophobia, usually
hovers around 50 percent of eligible students. This year, of about
400 minority freshmen (29 percent of the class) 171 attended the
Third World Transition Program.
</P>
<P>
   The Visiting Committee on Diversity also recommended omitting
the term ``Third World.'' For decades, it has been embraced at
Brown as a term of empowerment, less pejorative than the word
``minority,'' McLaurin-Chesson said. Yet countless outraged parents
call the admissions office each year, asking how their
African-American daughter or Japanese-American son can possibly be
labeled ``Third World,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Semantics aside, TWTP is controversial only because of the
discomfort and suspicion that surround race, said Bengochea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical response (from white students) is `How come not
me, too?' And I don't recognize that as a legitimate, thoughtful
retort,'' said Bengochea. ``There are no such complaints about
international orientation or athletic training,'' both of which
draw freshmen to campus early.
</P>
<P>
   TWTP is designed to offer a forum for discussion of sensitive
issues and introduce students to a network of administrators,
professor and peers whom they can rely on later as they enter a
mostly white environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants come from mostly white schools and
communities, and delight in their first opportunity to be in the
majority. Others have never before faced a largely white
environment, like freshman Michael Lucero, from a predominantly
Mexican-American town of Raymondville, in south Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what it would feel like to be faced by all these
white people,'' said Lucero. ``This lessens the blow. It's not
going to be a cold shower. It's going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of this year's TWTP participants say it's important to them
that the program is for minorities only. To explain, Shekinah
Elmore, an African-American from Denver, offered her opinion that,
of the many TWTP workshops on various social ills, the sexism
discussion with men and women in the same room was the most
strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to be open when someone else comes from a
perspective of more societal power,'' said Elmore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some mostly satisfied participants see problems with
TWTP. Thai Vargas, a junior, said she enjoyed TWTP, but still feels
that it can coddle students who make friends quickly with members
of their own race, and don't expand their horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freshman year I stayed mostly with the TWTP `clique,' so to
speak, and only last year did I start to branch out,'' said Vargas.
``As you grow, you have to move and see different kinds of people.
You can't just segregate yourself.''

RELIGION FINDS A PLACE ON THE TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Tikkun olam'' is a venerable Hebrew phrase that
translates loosely as ``improve the world.'' A day after the
Anti-Defamation League told Joseph I. Lieberman to stop talking
about religion in the presidential campaign, his wife, Hadassah,
asserted that the spiritual call was the mission of the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore-Lieberman team is committed to service and
benevolence,'' Mrs. Lieberman, daughter of a rabbi, like his wife a
Holocaust survivor, said in her first official campaign speech,
delivered last week at the B'nai B'rith convention. ``Our ultimate
purpose is `tikkun olam' _ to repair the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacred words, Biblical images, confessions of faith, policies
presented as moral imperatives _ the 2000 presidential campaign may
be historic in relocating the intersection of religion and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the nomination of Lieberman, the first Orthodox Jew
to be a vice presidential candidate, both Governor George W. Bush
of Texas and Vice President Al Gore were fiercely competing to
claim faith-based morality and a God-centered life.
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't want to be told what religion to practice. But
that doesn't make them deaf to God-and-values talk on the political
stump, pollsters say. Moreover _ and probably more important _
behind the soaring campaign rhetoric, a consensus is quietly
forming in Congress, in think tanks, and among sectarian groups
about a need to expand the role of religious institutions in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take great comfort in knowing their leaders act and
have an agenda that is informed by a faith commitment,'' said Anna
Greenberg, an assistant professor who studies public opinion at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``There is a yearning in
this campaign for a discussion about values, not the `family
values' of abortion and homosexuality, but of personal
responsibility, discipline, and having society work more
decently.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of it, of course, stems from a national embarrassment over
President Clinton's Oval Office adultery and a strong sentiment for
electing a leader who is virtuous and respected. Beyond that, many
Americans feel that culture, especially as it affects children, has
coarsened and even spun out of control, and that a dose of religion
might not be the worst antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a two-term US senator from Connecticut who is known
to his colleagues as a man of deep faith and rectitude, tapped into
those double anxieties before he joined the Democratic ticket. He
is famous for his floor speech chastising Clinton for his affair
with Monica S. Lewinsky, and he has threatened the entertainment
industry with calls to regulate content if it doesn't curb sex and
violence in movies, TV, and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also is a key player in a relatively new policy debate
over returning religion to the public square. It isn't being driven
by either the church-state separatists or conservative Christians,
who have dominated the discussion for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new voices are centrist Democrats (such as Gore) and
``compassionate conservative'' Republicans (such as Bush) who argue
that a shrinking government needs to form a partnership with
grass-roots, faith-based institutions to address social problems,
particularly those in urban America.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure inside Congress is coming from groups such as the
Empowerment Caucus, a bipartisan, ideologically mixed group of
members who would like to see funds for federal initiatives, on
housing, fatherhood, drug avoidance, literacy, and sexual
abstinence channeled to religious bodies or charities that have
reputations for getting results with their own programs. Lieberman
is a Senate cochairman of the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, groups such as the National Council of Churches, which
representsmainline Protestant denominations, are becoming more
politically active on issues of social justice. The council, which
is now run by ministers who formerly had political careers _ Mayor
Andrew Young of Atlanta and US Representative Bob Edgar of
Pennsylvania _ led the effort in reuniting Cuban refugee Elian
Gonzalez with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In detailed policy addresses last year, both Gore and Bush used
language about the transforming power of faith as they laid out
similar visions for cracking the wall between church and state.
They pledged to expand the concept of ``charitable choice,'' an
obscure provision in the 1996 welfare overhaul law that requires
state agencies to let religious groups compete for government
contracts without demanding they give up their sectarian character,
as long as they don't evangelize.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a July 1999 address at a Methodist church in
Indianapolis: ``In every instance when my administration sees a
responsibility to help people, we will look first to faith-based
institutions, to charities, and to community groups that have shown
their ability to save and change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Public Justice, a Christian think
tank in Annapolis, Md., Bush's commitment to charitable choice _
the governor issued an executive order endorsing it after the
welfare law passed _ has made Texas one of the only states
aggressively to steer public funds to religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lazarus, a policy analyst at the center, said most
states have either been unaware of the provision, or, like
Massachusetts, made no new efforts to expand partnerships they
already had with faith-based groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long history of contracting with faith-based
organizations, so it really was a part of welfare reform that
didn't have much of an impact on us,'' said Thomas Noonan, general
counsel of the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance.
Noonan said sectarian groups providing shelter for the homeless
will receive $6.2 million, or about one-third of this year's
shelter budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a May 1999 speech to the Salvation Army in Atlanta,
called for extending charitable choice beyond welfare to drug
treatment, homelessness, and youth-violence prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the separation of church and state, but
freedom of religion need not mean freedom from religion,'' Gore
said. ``There is a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Rogers, general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee
for Public Affairs, noted that Gore has not spoken out on the issue
recently, perhaps because charitable choice is not garnering
``untempered enthusiasm'' from all faith groups on the left and the
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel distinctly uneasy when I hear policy makers talk about
all the positive social results that religion produces, like
churches are some cog in the bureaucratic wheel, or you can plug
them in and use them,'' Rogers said. She added that religious
institutions could lose their autonomy if they become too dependent
on federal contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea is ``hot,'' Rogers said.

COUPLE NEEDS TO AMASS MORE SAVINGS FOR EARLY RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We have no children, but are planning to start a family
within a year or two. At that time, my wife will stay at home with
the children and we will live on my salary. Our goals are to save
for college education, save enough to meet emergencies, move up
from our current home to a single-family home in the $275,000
range, and retire at age 50. We have some lofty goals, but feel
confident enough that through careful planning they can be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   B.S., Beverly, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you certainly have set yourself some aggressive
targets, with the final one _ retirement at age 50 _ being the
toughest.
</P>
<P>
   Before I go into details, I have to say something is missing:
savings. As you outline your income and expenses, and after making
a 28 percent estimate of taxes, I come up with a monthly surplus of
a little more than $2,000, and that's not counting your rental
income. Since you list no savings beyond the two 401(k) accounts, I
am wondering where that money has been going.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the two of you have sat down and decided to
turn over a new leaf, financially speaking. But that's a lot easier
to do on paper than it is in fact. My guess is that your outlay of
$1,292 a month for all expenses beyond your mortgage is based on an
idea of what you should spend rather than on an historical view of
what you have been spending.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, projecting 10 percent average annual returns from your
joint 401(k) accounts and ongoing contributions at current levels
would take you to $57,810 after two years. Then, with contributions
from you but not from your wife, the pool would grow to $923,681
during the next 19 years, following the same assumptions. Let's
consider that after the effects of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If you are indeed spending $2,599 a month, you would need $5,338
a month to maintain the same lifestyle in retirement, provided
inflation averages 3.5 percent during those 21 years. Your
accumulated savings would have to produce a 6.93 percent yield to
meet that requirement, and if you simply withdrew what you needed,
you probably would not be reinvesting enough to protect you against
the inflation of the late years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   So it would probably be wise to build a supplemental retirement
savings plan. If you wanted to build a sufficient supplementary
savings pool to support your lifestyle without touching the 401(k)
funds until age 59 1/2, you would need a total of $391,881 at age
50, and to build such a pool you would have to save a further $460
a month, starting now. And you would have to draw upon other funds
to deal with the tax liabilities that this savings program would
generate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with $2,000 to $2,600 surplus monthly income at this
point, that sounds realistic, but when your wife's paycheck
disappears in a couple of years, your after-tax income would be
sufficient only to cover expenses and those savings _ with very
little beyond your rental income left to cover the costs of the
growing family, working on your emergency savings, and trading up
to a single-family home.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not all that black. All of these assumptions
have been based on savings at the current level. Presumably, your
income will rise and your savings level will rise with it. Also,
the estimate of the effects of inflation includes your mortgage
expense, which probably would go up if you bought a new home, but
otherwise would not be subject to inflation. Still, you will have
to be awfully frugal to get where you want to go. I suggest you
think in terms of retiring sometime in your 50s, rather than
pinning your hopes on giving your boss your regrets on your 50th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A few other points: as you build emergency savings, I suggest
that you put the first $10,000 into a mutual fund money market
account, with additions beyond that going into an investment such
as a good GNMA fund. If you anticipate buying a new home within
five years, savings toward that goal also should be in a money
market mutual fund _ not one of those low-yielding money market
funds offered by many banks. If you think it will more likely take
longer to move up to a single-family home, you could save toward
that goal in a balanced mutual fund. As for supplemental retirement
savings and money put aside for college costs, both accounts could
be in a mutual fund managed to track the results of the Standard
and Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My father is selling his home and moving into a retirement
apartment and I am helping him set up his finances. He is risk
averse and would never invest in mutual funds. I'm proposing
investing all of the $236,000 in Vanguard GNMA fund, which pays
monthly dividends. He will need to use some principal each month,
so I am proposing the GNMA dividends be reinvested and that he then
write checks as needed. I calculate that his money will last him
well beyond age 100. I'm interested in your opinion.
</P>
<P>
   G.B., Acton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the cardinal rules for advising on investments is not
to push people into something that makes them uncomfortable. While
Vanguard GNMA is an excellent fund, like other bond funds its value
will rise and fall as interest rates move, and it is indeed
possible _ and in fact even likely about two years out of every
decade _ for it to lose money in a given year. It is not for
somebody who is resolutely risk averse, any more than for somebody
who would never invest in mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, GNMA funds aren't particularly attractive right now,
given that long-term CD rates provide a more attractive yield. For
a risk-averse person, the rates on a five-year jumbo CD _ as high
as 7.81 percent entering last week _ are simply unbeatable. I
suggest you shop around and open two jumbo $100,000 CD accounts and
one regular account for $36,000. No muss, no fuss, and everything
federally insured.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, I don't see how you calculate that your father
will have to dip into capital. I tally that he will need $1,087
monthly in addition to his pension to meet his expenses. Even with
your assumption of a 6.5 percent yield from the fund, he would have
sufficient yield to reinvest a bit every month. If he went with the
highest CD rates, he would have quite a bit _ $444 a month _ to add
to his savings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our only investment is Fidelity Equity Income fund, which we
hold for emergency purposes. It has been doing very poorly. Would
you recommend switching to another fund? We've had this investment
for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   R.G., Ipswich, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The woes of Fidelity Equity Income fund are not isolated _
you'll see almost all funds that take a value-oriented approach to
investing have had the same lackluster results over the last six
years, during which the market has been almost universally growth
oriented.
</P>
<P>
   But with a 20-year perspective, you should be able to take a
longer view. While a value fund will not deliver the stellar spurts
that sometimes come with growth stocks, it provides a steady and
less risky ride. Over the last decade, Fidelity Equity Income fund
has delivered average annual returns of 15.21 percent, the kind of
thing that didn't look bad before the rabid pace of recent growth
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Equity Income has stuck to its knitting, maintaining a
low price-to-earnings ratio, currently 22, a modest price-to-book
level, currently 4.6, and a low turnover level of 26. Its 1.52
percent yield is modest but not in comparison to that of
growth-oriented funds.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is the time to quit on value investments. The
markets traditionally move from one sector to another and the value
stocks eventually will return to favor, and the funds such as
Fidelity Equity Income that have stuck by their guns through the
growth markets once again will shine.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the fund has a portfolio that should prove relatively
resilient if a serious market downturn develops. Its investments
are concentrated in energy, financial, industrial and utility
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I don't think a stock fund is a particularly
good place to hold emergency money. My suggestion is that you
decide how much you would likely need in an emergency _ say $5,000
or $10,000 _ and move that money to a more conservative investment
such as Fidelity Mortgage Securities, leaving the balance in
Fidelity Equity Income with the assumption that it will deliver
long-term growth to protect you against future inflation.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the presidential candidates prepare for the
traditional post-Labor Day campaign push, both sides are grappling
with the arithmetic of the electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which is emerging as one of the few close races
for the presidency in the last century, will be issues-heavy, with
Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush of Texas
sparring on education, health care, and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But the target audience for that debate will be much narrower
starting this week, as the two campaigns focus their energies on
the handful of states that will tip the electoral college scales in
favor of Democrat Gore or Republican Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, Democratic and Republican analysts agree, is for the
American center: the middle of the country, the middle class, and
the middle of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key states are really in the industrial Midwest,'' said a
Republican pollster, Ed Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a close election, that we know,'' said
Stephen Hess, a political analyst with the Brookings Institution,
and neither candidate can win without showing well in the nation's
heartland. ``There's no hidden load of electoral votes.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Bush and Gore trade barbs on the issues, debate about
having debates, and raise money for the last grueling nine weeks of
the campaign, their staff members are huddled in offices, looking
at maps, doing the math, and figuring out who has which state.
</P>
<P>
   On this topic, at least, the two campaigns are in some
agreement. And while the campaigns are fond of insisting that they
aren't taking a single vote for granted, now is the time when the
two sides make cold, calculating decisions about which states are
worthy of a fight to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   For voters in Massachusetts, there won't be many chances to see
either candidate for the rest of the campaign season, since both
camps have chalked up the Bay State for Gore. The same goes for the
overwhelmingly Democratic District of Columbia, which usually does
not see Republican candidates at all, unless they end up in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's home state of Texas is considered a lock for the
Republican governor, as are most of the Southern and the Rocky
Mountain states. All told, 155 electoral votes appear to be safely
in Bush's column. Gore, meanwhile, appears to have a firm grip on
142 electoral votes, including those from delegate-rich California
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to the magic number of 270, the number of
electoral votes needed to win the presidency. As the national polls
have tightened, so have many of the polls in individual states,
meaning Bush and Gore are likely to engage in a hard, perhaps
bitter, battle that could be decided by just a few electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns appear upbeat and ready for the traditionally
hectic pace of post-Labor Day campaigning. Gore is glowing amid
polls showing him neck-and-neck with, or even ahead of, Bush for
the first time in months. Bush, despite his slippage, has come back
fighting. Last week, the Republicans unleashed a TV ad attacking
Gore's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom this year is to ignore conventional
wisdom. ``There's a lot of misunderstanding about the state of the
race, forged by old attitudes toward the states,'' said a Gore
strategist, Tad Devine.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the candidate who leads in the polls on Labor Day
historically has ended up winning the election. But because only
four of the last 25 presidential elections have ended up close,
this year's contest may not follow that pattern, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can either candidate count on historical precedence in
lining up states. Gore, for example, is doing poorly in the South,
where President Clinton did well in both 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, typically a Republican state (although Clinton
won it in 1996), is a dead heat. Meanwhile, Gore cannot count on
taking his home state of Tennessee, where, despite his local
celebrity, the vice president is ahead by just 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the disaffected, reform-minded voter could also
tip the electoral scales. In Minnesota, usually a safe Democratic
bet, the allegiance of the voters who elected Governor Jesse
Ventura, the former professional wrestler and Reform Party member,
is up for grabs. Minnesota is considered a battleground state, and
a crucial one, with 10 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state and Oregon, offering a combined 18 electoral
votes, the candidacy of the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader could
frustrate Gore's campaign. Nader is polling at 4 percent or 5
percent in those states, a seemingly paltry share that nevertheless
could put Bush over the top in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, speaking on NBC's ``Today'' show recently, said he wasn't
concerned about taking votes away from Gore. But ``obviously, I am
worried about Al Gore taking votes away from me,'' Nader said. ``We
all have to earn our votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore never mentions Nader in his speeches, and his campaign
aides insist that most Nader supporters will pull the lever for
Gore, if only as an anti-Bush vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Joseph I.
Lieberman, appealed to voters last week not to back the longtime
consumer advocate. ``A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush,''
Lieberman said at a fund-raiser Friday in Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are likely to spend most of their time before
Election Day in the Midwest, where there are 100 electoral votes in
a block of seven states: Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa,
Illinois, and Minnesota, as well as Pennsylvania, which has 23
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to campaign hard in the state of Ohio,'' Bush said
on a recent visit there. ``I've got a good chance of winning, but I
know I've got to come back and ask for the vote. . . . We're going
to cover this state with a lot of visits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, meanwhile, is planning to send the vice
president up and down the Missisippi and Ohio rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been making a populist appeal, demonizing health
insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, drug
companies, and oil companies as he seeks the votes of people who
have not benefited as much from the nation's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Tailoring his message to this conservative region, Gore rarely
mentions issues such as gay rights or abortion rights, instead
focusing his message on raising the minimum wage, protecting the
rights of workers to strike, and paying for prescription drugs for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has swung back, telling Midwestern, middle-class voters
that Gore's targeted tax cuts will miss some families, unlike
Bush's across-the-board tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are middle-income Americans,'' Bush said Friday in
Swanton, Ohio, as he stood beside Tami Shelton and her husband,
Tim, a truck driver for Wonder Bread. ``They get no tax relief
under (Gore's) plan, and under my plan, they get over $2,000 in
savings. These are real folks who will end up with real savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise may come from the South, where the Bush
campaign is facing the possibility that Florida, the nation's
fourth-most-populous state and once considered a virtual certainty
for Bush, could be in play.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton took Florida in 1996, it is still a conservative,
traditionally Republican state, and Bush _ whose brother Jeb is
governor there _ had been seen by both campaigns as the likely
winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore appears to be gaining in Florida, with one recent poll
showing him ahead by eight points. Even the Gore campaign says that
lead is inflated, but that Florida is definitely winnable for the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to get the taste in our mouth now'' that
Florida could go Democratic, said a Gore campaign strategist. ``Our
issues are strong there,'' with Gore campaigning heavily on
long-term care for the elderly, and Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the recent polls, the Gore campaign is planning an
all-out fight for Florida, a Gore aide said. Even if Gore does not
end up taking the state, the aide said, the closeness of the race
will force Bush to spend more time and money there than he planned,
diverting resources from other critical contests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a tough, diverse constituency in Florida. Gore is
popular among Democrats in Dade County and in ``condo heaven,''
populated by retirees from New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
But he faces trouble from the Cuban-Americans in Miami, who are
angry with the Clinton-Gore administration over its handling of the
Elian Gonzalez case, and from conservatives in Central Florida and
the panhandle, who oppose stricter gun controls and typically are
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has a much better organization on the ground,'' said
James P. Monroe, a professor of political science at the University
of Miami. While Gore is leading in at least one Florida poll now,
Monroe said, ``on election day, I just don't think that's going to
be the case.''
</P>

&HT;     PBS TO AIR EYE-OPENING SERIES ON DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are not a nation of quitters, especially when it comes to
death.
</P>
<P>
   As a society, we follow the philosophy of a Welshman, Dylan
Thomas, who told us to not go gently into that good night. Of
course, he never got to rage against the dying of the light: The
poet died suddenly at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   But how much rage is enough? When does the ``good fight'' mean a
bad death? When is a desperate grab for a cure worse than the
disease?
</P>
<P>
   In virtually all cases, we can't determine what will kill us.
For the most part, we can't determine when we'll go. God, nature,
fate pick one takes all that out of our hands.
</P>
<P>
   But what about how we choose going about dying? Investigative
reporter Bill Moyers and his wife, Judith Davidson Moyers, spent
the past two years in hospitals, hospices and most importantly the
homes of terminally ill people (note: not always ``patients'').
Their efforts resulted in a four-part, six-hour documentary for PBS
that examines, as one dying subject puts it, ``living in the light
of death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Our Terms: Moyers on Dying'' airs Sept. 10-13 (9 to 10:30
p.m. Eastern, check local listings). This is advocacy television
that attacks a basic Western precept: Death is the enemy, and we
must never surrender until our last bullet is fired. The
counter-argument suggests that, sometimes, a waning life is best
lived preparing for death.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-20th century, death came quickly and early. Before
World War II and the advent of penicillin, death came at a median
age of 52 and the end usually came fast. Now people live to a
median age of 76, and death is often a drawn-out process, the
result of lingering disease.
</P>
<P>
   This medical-cultural shift and other factors such as the aging
of the baby-boom generation, the rise of a mobile society which
scatters families, and the global toll of the AIDs epidemic has
lent urgency to discussion about the quality of life's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of that slow and tortuous death, most of us have
realized we want to die ... with peaceful closure,'' Moyers told
members of the Television Critics Association in July. ``We want to
be free of pain; we want some control over the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   We rarely get it. Four out of five of us want to die at home
surrounded by loved ones, but that same number will die in a
hospital or some other institution. ``Too many of us today are
dying deaths we deplore in places we despise,'' Moyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting if not embracing death contradicts the professional
ethos of most doctors, who believe in heroic measures backed by
modern medical technology. Saving lives is always the noble goal,
while prolonging life regardless of its quality is most often a
viable fallback position.
</P>
<P>
   The third option is palliative care, which places the emphasis
on comfort rather than cure. The concept does not sit well with
some in the medical community. The thinking is death is failure,
not the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diane E. Meier, director of Mount Sinai Medical Center's
Palliative Care Institute, joined Moyers, and offered a telling
detail about the medical community's priorities: Through medical
school, residency and a fellowship nine years in all Meier never
heard a single lecture on pain management.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been this sort of infatuation and love affair with
the ability of modern medicine to cure sometimes and to prolong
life,'' Meier said, ``and we get so caught up in the excitement of
that and the rewards of that that we forget our core mission as a
healing profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBS miniseries focuses on different topics in each of its
four nightly segments. On Sunday, ``Living with Dying'' focuses on
the choices faced by the terminally ill and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ``A Different Kind of Care'' looks at Meier's
department at Mount Sinai in New York City, where the focus is
making death as comfortable a transition as possible. On Tuesday,
``A Death of One's Own'' looks at the agonizing steps people take
in the decision of when to suspend debilitating treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's final segment, ``A Time to Change,'' calls for
hospice, home and palliative care. Like many things in America,
access to this kind of care is a question of money.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people featured in the program is Dr. William
Bartholome, a noted pediatrician and medical ethicist who
contracted cancer of the esophagus. Bartholome underwent surgery
but, recognizing that his war against the disease is futile, chose
against chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Bartholome was
shocked by the insensitivity of the hospital hierarchy: If a full
medical school professor is treated that way, he told the PBS
program, what happens to the average person?
</P>
<P>
   Bartholome checked himself out of the hospital. ``I knew I
wouldn't be free until I got out of there,'' Bartholome said.
</P>
<P>
   Could Bartholome have extended his life? Maybe, by weeks or
months. But at what cost?
</P>
<P>
   ``We shifted the fight,'' said Pam Roffol Dobies, Bartholome's
widow (they married after his terminal diagnosis). ``Instead of a
fight for medical care ... our fight shifted to quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not giving away the ending to tell you that Dr. Bartholome
died, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The story is how he got there and how we will, too.

<P>
   If you're one of those people who find today's pop culture
frightening, you'd better stay away from your TV tonight at 8.
That's when Shawn and Marlon Wayans of ``Scary Movie'' co-host
``The 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.'' The two outrageous comedians
are likely to be on their worst behavior, as will many of the
artists at the cheerfully raucous annual event, broadcast live this
year from Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sisqo (``Thong Song'') and Christina Aguilera are the most
recent additions to a list of performers that also includes 'N
Sync, Eminem, Rage Against the Machine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers
and Britney Spears. The pairing of hard core rock and rap artists
with teen-age bubblegum hotties ought to produce some amusing
ad-libs _ this could be a bleep-intensive production. Presenters
range from Robert DeNiro to Chris Rock to ``Survivor'' winner
Richard Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees for Video of the Year are Blink 182 (``All the Small
Things''), D'Angelo (``Untitled 'How Does It Feel'''), Eminem
(``The Real Slim Shady''), 'N Sync (``Bye Bye Bye'') and the Chili
Peppers (``Californication'').
</P>
<P>
   While this is one of TV's most entertaining awards
extravaganzas, we've yet to be convinced that the music video is a
form of art, and not advertising. Still, we can hardly wait to see
what Lil' Kim is wearing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: Nothing at the MTV event, not even
Lil' Kim's outfit, will be as depraved as this manipulative
``reality'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends,'' NBC at 8: Katherine's father (Bruce Willis)
threatens to get Ross fired. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Smackdown,'' UPN at 8: Even pro wrestling is looking good
compared to ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead Presidents,'' Fox at 8: Larenz Tate stars in this 1995
film about a young Vietnam veteran who turns to crime. It's a
thriller with a message from directors Allen and Albert Hughes.
Rated R.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC at 8:30: Two episodes air back to back. In
the first, Will's old boyfriend returns to the scene. In the
second, Joan Collins guests as Grace's competition for a design
job. Reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC at 9: Regis Philbin
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore,'' PBS at 9: This is the
final two hours of writer Robert Hughes' investigation of his
native land and its culture _ the best warm-up for the Sydney
Olympics starting on Sept. 15. Racism against the Aborigines is one
focus tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Shoot Me,'' NBC at 9:30: An elaborately conceived episode
that plays as an A&AMP;E ``Biography'' episode on demented model Nina
Van Horn. A&AMP;E helped out, and sure enough, Harry Smith hosts. A
funny rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER,'' NBC at 10: It's Julianna Margulies' last episode as
Hathaway, and there's a surprise at the end. Or there would be if
this wasn't a rerun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Eddie Murphy's animated series ``The PJs'' appears on the WB
tonight, debuting at 8:30 before moving to its regular night and
time on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It surprised many that the show wasn't more of a hit last season
on Fox, given its distinctive stop-motion animation and voices by
creator Murphy, who's enjoying a career resurgence in the movies.
And the PJs' setting in the urban projects hasn't been explored on
TV much since ``Good Times'' back in the 1970s. Nowadays the barbs
are more pointed and knowing.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy stars as the voice of cantankerous building super
Thurgood Stubbs, who's forever put upon by his tenants and the
larger world, and never shy about voicing his complaints. In
tonight's episode, ``The Last Affirmative Action Hero,'' Thurgood
gets involved when a Jackie Chan movie films in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a fan of the show on Fox, by the way, all of this
fall's episodes are reruns to you; new episodes won't appear until
the winter.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAN MILLSAPPS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill Clinton, our first Bubba president, is
commonly known in the South as a Good Ol' Boy, which actually means
a bad boy, or at least a naughty one, a fact made clear during his
effective but morally tarnished administration.
</P>
<P>
   Good Ol' Boys work hard. They may run the local feed-and-seed
store or neighborhood branch bank or the whole United States, but
they all know how to stop working long enough to kick back and have
a rousing good time.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday morning, they go down to the Southern Baptist Church
to repent for all the naughty things they have done that week and
then hurry away to sin some more so they can come back to church
next Sunday and repent all over again.
</P>
<P>
   But this piece is not about Clinton. It is about that other
Southern Democrat who would be president, Al Gore, who has stood so
long in Clinton's shadow that sometimes he seems permanently gray.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Gore is that too many people think that he is
cut from Clintonian cloth. He's not. Gore is not a Good Ol' Boy,
and try as he might, he never will be. He is, instead, a Good Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Differences between Good Ol' Boys and Good Boys are major. The
outcome of November's election may depend on our understanding the
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   If Billy the Bad has spent his life being naughty and then being
sorry for it, Gore has spent his life actually being good.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore the Good went to Sunday school, and later to divinity
school, he paid attention. When the preacher read from the Good
Book, ``Go and sin no more,'' that's exactly what Gore did.
</P>
<P>
   His wholesome Saturday nights on the family farm, boring perhaps
in contrast to Billy the Bad's carousing, have provided him a less
than exciting public persona.
</P>
<P>
   Good Boys ARE dull; Good Ol' Boys excite simply by swaggering
into a room _ such as the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Good Boys are perfect public servants, however, because they
spend all their time trying to do what's right. Early on, they
learn to please their parents and then their schoolteachers and
then pretty much everybody they run into after that.
</P>
<P>
   Because he obeyed his parents and listened to his school
teachers and probably had perfect attendance to boot, Gore the Good
Boy is well-schooled with the intelligence to figure out the
answers to all the really tough problems, and he has the good
manners to not strut or gloat when he does.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore says he wants to work for you, this is not empty
rhetoric. He'll figure out how to get whatever it is you want _ a
good job, Medicare prescription medicine coverage, a clean
environment _ then, by God, he'll get to work and make it happen.
If someone else hadn't invented the Internet and we still needed
one, Gore would do this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally Gore tries too hard to please. When his campaign
advisers, who do understand the differences between Good Boys and
Good Ol' Boys, told him they wanted him to be more exciting, Gore
tried his best, leaping into a crowd to glad hand, looking
absolutely foolish in the process.
</P>
<P>
   When they say ``jump,'' Gore jumps, sometimes to his own
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, by the time he had to write and deliver his
acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention (``I stand
here tonight as my own man''), he had reclaimed his less mobile but
more sincere self.
</P>
<P>
   Good Boys can be good boyfriends or good husbands because they
try so hard to please. But, wouldn't you know it, for Southern
girls, the grass is always greener.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Tipper Gore may sometimes wish she had a Good Ol'
Boy, while Hillary Rodham Clinton no doubt wishes her man would
just lose the Ol' part and behave himself for a change.
</P>
<P>
   So you can call Gore stiff, you can call him formal and boring,
but don't call him Bubba. He is more a Southern gentleman than a
Southern scoundrel.
</P>
<P>
   Think Ashley Wilkes instead of Rhett Butler. And if the American
voters understand the difference, we may even be able to call him
President.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, I might add, is neither Good nor Good Ol', but
something else again. Down home, we call his type a Rascal. You
figure that one out.
</P>

   CONGRESS-DEMS _ WASHINGTON _ As the Senate reconvenes, President
Clinton and Democratic leaders on Tuesday outline their
end-of-session priorities at the White House. GOP senators expected
to respond on Capitol Hill. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 12
</P>
<P>
   BUSH _ Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush on Tuesday
announced a $158 billion plan to help seniors pay for prescription
drugs, improve benefits and shore up finances of the health program
that ensures millions of elderly Americans. The governor's proposal
would pay at least one-fourth of the cost of prescription drug
coverage, whether seniors choose a new Medicare benefit or a
private plan. The elderly poor would get drug plans for free.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's proposal, health plans that participate in Medicare
would be required to provide a prescription drug benefit. Medicare
currently offers no prescription coverage. (Austin

   VETS-GORE _ At a recent party of his 24-member Sunday school
class, Jim McLaughlin decided to liven up the evening by playing a
trivia game, asking everyone to jot down ``what people aren't going
to know about you'' and drop the slip of paper into a hat. On his,
McLaughlin, 55, wrote: ``I did what Gore did in Vietnam.'' When it
was pulled, the crowd was stumped. Like many Atlanta-area Vietnam
veterans, McLaughlin, who's ``leaning'' toward George W. Bush in
November, is a little miffed at criticism from conservative
commentators that Gore was as safe over there as he would have been
in the states. (Hendrick, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS

scanned item in the grocery store. That's one reason chains are
getting their own banana ripening rooms. Randalls has ones in
Dallas and Houston, with multiple chambers, from which where Austin
bananas will soon be coming. At its new produce warehouse in San
Antonio, HEB has a series of ripening rooms where they are working
on a variety of fruits in addition to bananas. The rooms are the
size of an 18-wheeler trailer so they can hold an entire load and
our testers do samples and taste tests throughout the day. What's

&HT;     THE NO-SAFE DEPOSIT BOX 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In June, when Mrs. O'G learned that her cancer
had returned and metastasized, she figured she might not have a
whole lot of time to get her affairs in order.
</P>
<P>
   One big item of business: A 30-year-old safe deposit box that
rested in a Bank of America branch a few blocks from Mrs. O'G's
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave the girl the keys and she went to check the signature
card. Then she came back and said, `Well, your safety deposit box
isn't here. It's been drilled,'' said Mrs. O'G, who is 78, widowed
and prefers not to have her full name used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what 'drilled' meant. I just thought the box was
someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. O'G found out, after weeks of phone calls and digging
by her daughters, Mary and Peggy, was that drilled meant disaster.
Everything of personal value that Mrs. O'G stored in the box had
been destroyed when the bank sent the contents to the state
Controller's Office as ``unclaimed property'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As Mary and Peggy discovered just last week, only one document
was spared: an easily reproducible certificate for some Pacific Gas
&AMP; Electric stock.
</P>
<P>
   Gone forever was the deed to Mrs. O'G's Holy cemetery plot and
the naturalization papers she and her husband received when they
arrived in the United States from Ireland in the late 1940s. Those
she'd planned to give to her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here she's had so much taken away by the cancer, and somebody
took her history away,'' Mary said. ``This is just shocking to me.
I didn't believe something like this could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. O'G's story is any indication, something like this may
be happening to many people.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the state controller's office now houses more than
$2.6 billion in unclaimed property belonging to some 5.2 million
people. How many of those people, like Mrs. O'G, never received a
single notice that their box was about to be opened, sent to
Sacramento and purged of all but financially valuable items?
</P>
<P>
   State law says that after three years of ``inactivity,'' a box
must be drilled and its contents shipped to the controller's
office. But the law also says that banks, insurance companies or
business associations that hold such property MUST attempt to
notify the box owner first.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Mrs. O'G.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived at the same address since 1963. Almost every week
she has stopped by the same branch, where she's had a checking
account since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, unlike me,'' said Mary, ``my mother opens and reads every
piece of mail she gets. If she isn't interested, she shreds it.
There is no way she could have missed ONE, let alone MANY
notices.''
</P>
<P>
   As near as anyone can tell, the last time Mrs. O'G's safe
deposit box was truly safe was in the spring of 1992. She opened it
so her attorney, Daniel Piccinini, could transfer her PG&AMP;E stock to
a trust. That was just about the time the Bank of America was busy
taking over Security Pacific, a smaller bank that previously had
taken over Gibraltar Savings.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. O'G had leased their safe deposit box from
Gibraltar in the early '70s. Sometime in the mid-'80s, Mrs. O'G was
notified that, thanks to her senior citizen status and certificate
of deposit, the box was free for as long as she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bank of America swallowed Security Pacific, Mrs. O'G
had every reason to believe the only change was a positive one: All
her financial operations were now under one roof in her long-time
Bank of America branch.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't know was that, by the autumn of '92, her box had
been drilled and the contents itemized by the Bank of America in
preparation for transfer to Sacramento as unclaimed property.
</P>
<P>
   Through several frustrating visits to the branch and dozens of
phone calls to various bank departments and the state Controller's
Office, her daughters recently discovered the awful truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't believe the amount of time we've spent on the phone
just trying to speak to a real person,'' Peggy said. ``One day at
the bank, they had my mother sitting there on hold, and it wasn't
even for the right department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one of the bank's employees aside, and I said, `This
would be a lot easier on her if somebody would just apologize.' The
woman looked at me and said, `I didn't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The state Controller's Office was no picnic either.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary called the agency's unclaimed property number and
explained the situation, ``This woman told me in a monotone that
they only handle these cases once a year in November. I told her
again about Mom's cancer diagnosis and the deed to the cemetery.
She just repeated what she'd said: `We only handle these once a
year; you'll have to call back in November.'''
</P>
<P>
   To State Controller Kathleen Connell's credit, when she heard
about Mrs. O'G's ordeal last week, she immediately ordered an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heartfelt sympathies go out to this woman and her family,''
Connell said. ``And if we in any way contributed to their anxieties
during this difficult time, we apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of America was not so quick to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Peggy and Mary are now trying to get copies of
Mr. and Mrs. O'G's papers from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. There are, of course, forms to fill out, a $150 fee _ and
a waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   Just back from the doctor, Mrs. O'G said late last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``All my things are gone; there's nothing to be done to get them
back. But maybe knowing about me can help save somebody else this
experience. I mean, if they did this to me, they must have done it
to others.''

<P>
   Cornelius ``Sonny'' Vanderbilt Whitney was born with a silver
spoon in his mouth and grew up to be one of the world's wealthiest
tycoons and the stuff legends are made of.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Rodengen's new biography, ``The Legend of Cornelius
Vanderbilt Whitney'' (Write Stuff Enterprises, $39.95), chronicles
the story of this multimillionaire before the age of dot-coms.
Rodengen has penned 29 other books, 22 of them in the series ``The
Legend of ...''
</P>
<P>
   Laid out in coffeetable format chock-a-block with photos, the
book provides an in-depth journey into the privileged life of a
gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   One of the twists of the history of C.V. Whitney's life is the
fact that the man who married his widow would commission this
biography.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Whitney died in 1992 at the age of 93, John
Hendrickson married Marylou Whitney in a small ceremony in Alaska.
Their main residence remains Cady Hill House in Saratoga Springs,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a remarkable man who accomplished things most
people only dream of,'' said Hendrickson, who also paid $250,000 to
bring the book to fruition. ``I've learned so much about this
compelling man and I wanted to produce a comprehensive book of his
life story.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Whitney kept a journal, which later helped
him and Marylou write five books about his adventures, including
``First Flight,'' about his days as a cadet in the Signal Corps in
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of Whitney's parents, Gertrude Vanderbilt and Harry
Payne Whitney, joined two of America's wealthiest families.
Whitney's mother, Gertrude, a sculptor, founded the Whitney Museum
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   C.V. Whitney, the only son of Gertrude and Harry Payne, was
named for his great-great-grandfather, steamship and railroad
tycoon Commodore Cornelius Van Derbilt, builder of Grand Central
Terminal in Manhattan. When the commodore died in 1877, he left a
fortune of approximately $100 million to the eldest of his 13
children.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 26 years old, C.V. Whitney turned a land deal around
that netted him his first half-million dollars. With that money, he
co-founded Pan American Airways. The following year, by selling
some stock in Pan Am, he founded the Hudson Bay Mining &AMP; Smelting
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to be idle, Whitney went on to establish the world's
first public oceanarium, Marineland in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Already a millionaire in his own right, at age 35, Whitney
inherited $20 million from his father's estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money was to him simply a way to be involved in greater
challenges, not a cushion upon which to recline and live the
lagabout, ne'er-do-well existence his father seemed to fear,''
wrote Rodengen.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney's accomplishments also included producing ``Gone With
The Wind,'' ``A Star is Born,'' ``The Searchers'' and ``Missouri
Traveler.'' The last starred Mary Schroeder, who would become
Marylou Whitney, the fourth Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   C.V. Whitney was an avid sportsman and polo player, and excelled
in the competitive thoroughbred racing industry, breeding 141
stakes winners in 54 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Saratoga Springs, which Whitney listed as his legal voting
address, he co-founded the National Museum of Racing and Hall of
Fame and established the National Museum of Dance.
</P>
<P>
   When not engaged in business deals, Whitney would relax by
hiking or fishing, especially in the Adirondacks of upstate New
York, where his family had owned more than 83,000 acres since the
1800s.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what his accomplishments and travels around the world,
Whitney was always most proud of being an American and flew the
American flag at each of his homes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he enjoyed his privacy, Whitney was always charming and
entertaining, whether sharing candid stories of his personal life,
reciting poetry, a limerick or telling a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``A success in spite of his money,'' proclaimed Sports
Illustrated in 1961, calling Whitney a ``thoroughbred purist'' and
a ``far cry from the popular tintype of the rich American sportsman
and socialite.''

A SURE `BETTY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RBOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raised right in a semi-rural Houston suburb by conservative
European parents, Renee Zellweger turned out smart, sweet,
hard-working and well- mannered. She is to the cliched stereotype
of the high-strung, high-living movie star what water is to fire.
You'll be hard-pressed to find a less affected, better adjusted
person in all of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   How she ever went so bad is just one of those mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding there. But considering some of the things
Zellweger's been getting up to in the past year, it's
understandable if some people are starting to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   These guys she's been hanging out with _ nasty, nasty filmmakers
like Neil LaBute and the Farrelly brothers, that unpredictable
boyfriend of hers, Jim Carrey _ they're so, well, kind of
dangerous. And then she upset those nice English people (they're
all very polite over there, you know), which we'll get into in a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the French like her (make of that what you
will). Zellweger's latest film, the LaBute-directed ``Nurse
Betty,'' was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival in May. And it was
something of a surprise, considering how highly her performance was
regarded by festgoers, when Zellweger just missed taking Cannes'
best actress honors as well.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpectedly charming black comedy in which Zellweger's
Kansas waitress loses her mind, pursues her dream and for the
longest time manages to elude a pair of hitmen, the film lives or
dies on Zellweger's ability to make Betty's madness believable and
her plight sympathetic. When she sees her no-good husband murdered
over a drug deal gone wrong, Betty retreats into her favorite
fantasy _ a daytime soap opera she watches religiously _ and takes
off for California in search of her ``true love,'' one of the
show's fictional characters.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kinnear is the somewhat befuddled actor who is nonetheless
charmed by Betty's earnest interest in his work on the show. Morgan
Freeman and Chris Rock play the bad guys on her tail. And while the
comedy certainly has its dark hues, many will find it a cheerier
exercise than LaBute's aggressively misanthropic previous films,
``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the proper person she is, Zellweger is not about to let
anyone get away with dissing a friend that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil's not a misogynist; he's a nice, kind man,'' the
31-year-old actress says in her warm, whispery Southern accent.
``His films can be dark, but it's commentary. It's not him. It may
be his sense of humor; he's very witty and wry, but not ugly or
malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the basic Zellweger take on, oh, just about everybody.
The Farrellys, for whom she appeared in last summer's
much-criticized grossout comedy ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' are
perhaps misunderstood but ``talented filmmakers whose humor really
appeals to me, as terrible as that is to admit. It's rude and
disgusting and borderline offensive, but I absolutely love it.''
And her ``Irene'' co-star Carrey, whom she realized she was in love
with months after having had a wonderful time making the film with
him last year, naturally receives gushing praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a vast range of ability that he has,'' she says.
``I have tremendous respect for that, and it's funny: what he does
isn't typically recognized as great acting, but I would say that
that's the most difficult kind of acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course, all these false reports that we were dating
came after the shoot. But after some months of telling people how
wonderful Jim was while denying that we were an item, I started
missing him and gave him a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey, who had apparently been smitten at first sight, needed
little encouragement. The outlandish and outlandishly successful
comedian had been suffering romantic traumas for years before,
evidently, he met the right person.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's too special; she's a gem, she's a gem,'' Carrey
says,deliriously, of Zellweger, then gets a bit more specific.
``And she's a very straightforward person. What you see is how she
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinnear, who had already made ``Nurse Betty'' with Zellweger
before she made ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' calls them ``pretty grounded
people. I've met Jim a few times. He's a funny guy, and she's
funny. She's such a warm person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest you get the impression that Zellweger might be suffering
her own, dangerously Pollyannish delusions at this point,
understand that a sharp, analytical mind is constantly at the
controls of the sunny disposition. Take, for example, her shrewd
view of the role that many are calling her best work since she
first came to critics' attention in the smart popular hit ``Jerry
Maguire'' and the spunky arthouse character study ``The Whole Wide
World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty Sizemore is kind and generous to a fault,'' Zellweger
observes. ``Everything is at her expense. But she's content, goes
to her waitressing job, stays married to her mean husband and
watches her soap opera doctor every day. She dreams of a better
life but doesn't have the ambition to go out and get it. But
interestingly, the way she learns to live her dreams is by kind of
falling into her subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tricky thing to play, but also very technical,''
Zellweger adds. ``(Betty's) is a very specific condition that
happens after someone experiences a really traumatic blow that
makes it impossible for them to cope. The mind creates this altered
state in order for the person to go on. For me, it was about
understanding the parameters of the condition, and then making
creative choices about her and how far to take it within those
limits. It was fun to do the research and talk to the therapists
who've studied it, but it also left me a lot of creative leeway as
she evolves through this.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the power of the mind ... pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. As Zellweger learned earlier this year, people's
preconceived notions can be powerful things, especially when
they're challenged. The actress has been in England since February,
preparing for and playing the title role in the movie version of
the bestselling novel ``Bridget Jones's Diary.'' The award-winning
book's heroine, an unmarried thirtysomething publishing worker in
constant anxiety over her weight, social standing and romantic
prospects, was considered by many to be the fictional spokesperson
for a generation of British women.
</P>
<P>
   When Zellweger was cast to play Jones over such homegrown
possibilities as Kate Winslet and Emily Watson, outcries ensued.
The sensationalist tabloids went ape over the perceived Yankee
invasion (never mind the fact that British actors have played far
more American characters in films than vice versa). Helen Fielding,
the book's author, even severed relations with the production.
</P>
<P>
   But with typical, industrious dedication, Zellweger threw
herself into mastering a British accent, familiarizing herself with
Bridget's world and even (remember what we said about her not being
your stereotypical Hollywood actress) bulking up to fighting
weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt any hostility, personally, over there, just
what I read,'' notes Zellweger, who as part of her research clipped
and compiled articles decrying her casting for the publishing house
that distributed Fielding's book. ``And that stuff could be
unnecessarily hostile in certain respects, to the point where it
felt like they were trying to hurt your feelings. But, of course, I
realized that they were just trying to make a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what can you do about it? I just tried to work as hard as
I could. The accent work has been fun, and I tried very hard to get
it right. I guess we'll know how well I succeeded if I'm lynched or
not next spring when the film comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the eating requirements, Zellweger brought her natural
good humor to that part of the job, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have been enjoying the London cuisine,'' she says,
laughing. ``That's a fun thing for an actress to do ... for about
two weeks. Then the novelty wears off and you've got three
obligatory chocolate bars to get down a day. That becomes not as
exciting as you might have anticipated. After all the fettucine
Alfredo and pizza lunches you could ever imagine overindulging in,
it gets to the point where you just want some spinach.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she confessed to massive homesickness and missing her
dog, Zellweger typically faced her long sojourn in London as
cheerfully as she possibly could. Maybe there is something of a
Pollyanna syndrome at work here _ but if so, it seems pretty
beneficial, and has certainly helped her live out her dreams as
effectively as Nurse Betty's psychosis helped her.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being so nice can be a little embarrassing sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an incredible adventure I've had, gol-lee,'' Zellweger
chirps, then stops short. ``Oh, no! `Golly' _ that sounds so geeky.
But it's instead of saying the other g-word that your mom doesn't
want you to say. Still, I hate reading myself saying that in print
_ 'I don't say that' _ but I guess you just caught me doing it.
It's very Gomer Pyle, isn't it?''

Postal Service workers of racial discrimination, sexual harassment
and other management abuses had poured into Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. The backlog of informal complaints had
built up to an incredible 30,000 filings a year, more than from any
other single employer. Some of the complaints escalated into costly
litigation, while others festered, undermining morale. But in 1994
as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit, lawyers at the
Postal Service, the nation's largest employer, started an ambitious
experiment in dispute resolution. They created a program settle
disputes using outside neutral mediators. The lawyers estimate that
the program has saved the agency millions of dollars in legal costs
and improved productivity. Now, two of the Postal Service's lawyers

&HT;     MORMON TESTS CHURCH AND FAITH ON SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RON DICKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the gallery of rogues who lie and cheat in
his films, Neil LaBute had escaped the attention of his Mormon
Church elders for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Then LaBute got personal. He introduced Mormon characters.
Homicidal Mormon characters.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bash: Latter-Day Plays,'' a filmed version of which aired
on Showtime last week, pretty people of the faith confess ugly
crimes. That made the phone ring. It was the church asking LaBute
to portray Mormons in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``From their point of view, art is something used to enlighten
and promote a kind of goodness,'' LaBute said in New York recently.
``And they don't really care for the idea of using bad to exemplify
good. So now it's up to me to say I'm going to follow that or I
will continue writing as I see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute already has made up his mind _ he'll keep following his
own vision _ so it is just coincidence that he made a departure
into comedy by directing ``Nurse Betty,'' which opens Friday. Renee
Zellweger plays a waitress who is so traumatized by seeing hitmen
kill her husband that she becomes delusional. She believes her
favorite soap star (Greg Kinnear) is a real doctor, and pursues him
cross-country with the killers (Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman) on
her trail.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute would never have touched such zaniness as a writer. So
why lighten up as a director?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any calculation,'' LaBute said, ``it was that
people will respect this. It wasn't that this has a much better
chance of making people happy.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute has never been about spreading joy. He insists his
upbringing in the Midwest was essentially normal and that he is a
regular guy. But the mantel of provocateur he once cloaked himself
in now fits so well, there's no use trying to stake out gentler
ground.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in an Upper East Side hotel suite, LaBute,
37, looks like a video-arcade refugee from the '70s. He sports a
Greg Brady Afro, glasses and a checked button-down shirt over a
striped T-shirt. His bearing is pleasant, and he speaks quietly, in
measured tones, making no apologies for his cynical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he attended New York University, LaBute wrote a play
called ``Deaf People are Funny.'' Then he penned another in which a
character railed against homosexuals, prompting the audience to
scream its disapproval. LaBute knew he was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the challenge of taking an audience to task,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute has known upstanding citizens, including his wife, Lisa,
and his parents. Lisa LaBute is of the same mind as the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that art should mirror beauty.
LaBute says he thinks of her as he writes, yet what springs from
his imagination would make church founder Brigham Young cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his feature films so far: In ``In the Company of Men''
(1997), an office Lothario bets an associate that he can make a
deaf worker fall in love with him before he dumps her.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' (1998), bored Manhattanites
slither around their spouses and best buddies to get a little on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute likes to think of his works as how-not-to manuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful people who we tend to emulate and want to be friends
with have as much trouble being nice and making good choices as
anybody,'' LaBute said. ``It's interesting to dissect. As long as
that interests me, I can't imagine not wanting to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's latest project stars Gwyneth Paltrow in a screen
adaptation of A.J. Byatt's novel, ``Possession,'' about a pair of
modern academics who discover an unlikely love affair between two
Victorian poets.
</P>
<P>
   What could be creepy about that?
</P>
<P>
   LaBute smiled. ``That was part of what I was worried about,'' he
said, ``so I had to give it as much dysfunction as I saw fit.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute sounds like a wholesome guy. Really. He helps his two
children, ages 9 and 12, get ready for school. He likes to putter
around the house and munch on potato chips _ anything to avoid a
blinking cursor and a blank page. And he is devoted to his religion
and the Midwest. LaBute recently moved his family from Fort Wayne,
Ind., to a Chicago suburb to have access to O'Hare Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He takes meetings in Los Angeles, but feels far less creative
there. ``I'm suspicious of blue skies,'' he said. ``I'm more
comfortable around frequent and furious change.''
</P>
<P>
   There is turbulence in ``Nurse Betty,'' but it comes in the
confection of Zellweger, whose goodness beams through even as her
Betty breaks from reality.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute knew he had to find the genuine article or the movie
would collapse under the weight of a wacky premise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renee has a lot of good will with the audience and you can't
manufacture that with a person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute expects that ``Nurse Betty'' will illuminate his hopeful
side, but as long as his dark side is lurking, the Mormon Church
will be watching.

BEIJING OFFICIAL ACCUSES TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT OF SEPARATISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Chinese spokesman on Tuesday attacked Taiwan's
president for remarks suggesting that the island's unification with
China is not inevitable, calling them ``very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman also indicated at a press conference that China's
patience with the president, Chen Shui-bian, who took office in
May, is beginning to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewing his first 100 days, we think he is not moving toward
accepting the one-China principle and is instead moving in the
direction of Taiwan separatism,'' said Zhang Mingqing, spokesman
for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang did not indicate that Beijing was taking any new steps
to threaten Taiwan, which it considers a part of China that was
separated by civil war and must some day return.
</P>
<P>
   China was deeply concerned about Chen's election because his
Democratic Progressive Party has long advocated Taiwan's formal
independence. But before and after his election, Chen eased
tensions by making it clear that he would not declare independence
unless China attacked Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Chen has sought to differentiate his
position as national leader from that of his party and, in a
gesture of friendship toward China, has offered to discuss closer
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government continues to shun discussions with Chen's
party, and on Tuesday the spokesman in Beijing said, ``We will not
have any contact with the DPP until it revises its pro-independence
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Chen said a majority of Taiwan's 23
million people do not support unification under the ``one country,
two systems'' formula for autonomy that China has offered. He also
rejected the policy of the long-ruling Nationalist Party that the
unity of Taiwan and the mainland was ``the only possible conclusion
for Taiwan's future.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman in Beijing said Tuesday that the remarks were
``very dangerous and cannot but incite alarm among all Chinese
people, including Taiwan compatriots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taiwan's official spokesperson, Chung Chin, dismissed the
warnings by saying that ``the situation is definitely not as
disappointing'' as Beijing had described.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's government hopes to coax China into talks on economic and
other issues without agreeing first on the overall goal of
unification, and the two sides still appear to be warily testing
each other.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Sept. 6:
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-ALMONDS (Huron, Calif) _ Eat marzipan in Germany or
almonds salted in the shell in India or China, and odds are high
that the nuts came from California. In California's Central Valley,
almonds are big business. The state's 6,000 growers produce more
than 600 million pounds a year, more than 70 percent of the world's
supply. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   DASTARDLY-DINERS (London) _ They do it harmlessly in Wodehouse,
and horribly in Waugh. Behaving badly while eating well is
traditional in England, where undergraduate hellfire clubs still
play at being Regency bucks by getting expensively sick over
shattered crockery. It would be just another minority pastime, like
trainspotting or cricket, if London's restaurant boom hadn't
provided an arena for a new generation of oafs. It's become so bad
that the president of the Restaurant Association here recently
declared British diners the worst behaved in the world. By Sam
Willetts.

from trying to teach anybody to cook. After a financial struggle
that cost the cable startup an estimated $88 million in the seven
years since its creation, media analysts predict the network will
finally break even this year. It is thriving by replacing the shows
with cooks standing behind counters _ the sorts of programs that
dominated the airwaves during the first four decades of
television's existence _ with shows that are purely about
entertainment. By Michelle Slatalla.

DECORATING TRENDS TO FALL FOR &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Sidebar on separate take) By BARBARA DeWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old Hollywood glamour and elegance is making a comeback this
fall in the land of white sofas and leopard throw pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a classic movie set, home accessories and furnishings
are warm, woodsy and elegantly retro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the fall home fashion look is more formal than the
Mission look we've been seeing. Furniture is sleeker than last
year, and there's a return to '40s-inspired armchairs ... perhaps
in chocolate suede, with a rolled arm that's not overstuffed,''
says Bombay Co. spokeswoman Cathy Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a luxurious faux mink throw draped over the ottoman. Then
there's dinner served on an organza-covered table set with crystal
and silver and iridescent blue glassware, creating a mood that's
very steeped in Hollywood glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   What's out is chi-chi beige glazed walls, all those
overly-fluffy and floral examples of the '90s Shabby Chic movement
and those ostentatious collections of decorative plates, gilt
cherubs and huge empty urns on marble pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Style guru and tastemaker Colin Cowie, whose Romance Classics
series ``Everyday Elegance with Colin Cowie'' begins its third
season on Oct. 18, gets right to the heart of the new design
mentality. ``While the '80s and '90s were about accumulating and
displaying everything you owned, this year is all about good
editing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowie's suggestion: ``Be ruthless. Throw out the bunnies,
turtles, owls, cherubs and distressed faux-finish furniture, and
put all those lavish serving pieces in the closet if you aren't
going to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also advises people to keep tables uncluttered if they want
to look like they're up to speed on decorating trends.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Baker, spokesman for the Pacific Design Center in Los
Angeles agrees, and says there shouldn't be anything but a big
candle and a single book on the family coffee table so that the
table can actually be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of decorating like an Old Hollywood set-designer
(potted palms have replaced ficus trees) has been so hot this year
that the Pacific Design Center recently invited the public to see
its 2,500-square-foot set of a '30s Hollywood bungalow created by
the Art Directors Guild and House Beautiful magazine. All the
newest nuances, from Mission chairs to wrought iron sets are there
as a reminder that the past is our present.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions of retro looks were even the theme of the hit
sitcom ``Friends,'' in which actress Jennifer Aniston convinces
co-star Lisa Kudrow, that their new apothecary coffee table from
the Pottery Barn catalog is an actual antique, not a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That apothecary table, a large rectangular mahogany coffee
table with numerous small drawers, has been a best-seller since it
was featured on the Jan. 6 episode (plus three reruns) and has been
included in the new fall catalog,'' says Pottery Barn spokeswoman
Jennifer Drubner.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the leaves turn red, gold and orange (or so we Los
Angeles residents are told), the experts offer some ways to feature
the new fall look in your home _ whether you're willing to spend a
little or a lot.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick way to freshen up your decor, Cowie suggests
removing any wallpaper and painting an entry hall or powder room
totally red or pumpkin. Shy-types may want to follow the Pacific
Design Center's design lead and go with green. ``Not just any
green,'' says Baker, ``but celadon green which is the shade of
celery.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker likes celadon as a replacement for plain white or beige
walls and thinks it encourages that continuing trend to bring the
garden inside the home. To complete the look, think about water
fountains, dark wicker and rattan and black wrought iron furniture
as indoor accents.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of overdosing on rose bouquets, go for a simple hot
house variety such as orchids. A single spray, whether it's real or
silk, is a best bet, says Cowie.
</P>
<P>
   Pringle is keen on faux fur throws tossed over the sofa or bed,
a stack of velvet pillows, and non-traditional chandeliers or
candelabras made of iron with crystal beads or colored crystal
drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Baker adds, ``gold and gilt chandeliers and brass
designs with tiny pleated shades are out. But there are plenty of
traditional things _ from Asian accessories to Tibetan rugs to club
chairs. Even sea shells are still looking fresh.'' However, he says
the throw rug should be silk and have a geometric design. And if
you want to be really fashion-forward, forget the sisal or
leaf-shaped rugs and go for a shag throw rug in a solid color.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Could olive green shag carpeting be next?
</P>
<P>
   Like other retail furniture stores, Pottery Barn didn't zero in
on one specific era. Says Drubner, ``We've tried to appeal to
everybody's taste, but we've found that people love that loose-fit
look of slip-covers in solid velvet, chenille or twill. And I'd say
that anything in chenille or velvet _ whether it's a pillow or
throw for the coach, chair or bed _ is one of the quickest ways to
update your home, especially in dark autumn or jewel tones.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the market for living room furniture, start with a
new coffee table, they say.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cowie, ``The coffee table should be the jewel or
focal point of the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Pringle comments that it's easy to find dramatic coffee and end
tables this season, often with carved pedestals featuring exotic
animals and palm trees, as well as walnut-stained bamboo trunks and
dark wood tables inspired by world travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Baker suggests a simple look: ``The newest looks in coffee
tables have a mid-century modernism, made of glass and chrome, or
of very dark or very blond wood with a refined and streamlined
silhouette.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving beyond the living room, these experts report that
old-fashioned chrome bathroom fixtures have upstaged brass and
gold; that bedrooms continue to have bright white wood accents with
handmade patchwork quilts, or a more masculine look with dark wood
and manly plaid bedspreads instead of comforters and dust ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's even a trend,'' says Cowie, ``to those really thin,
simple hotel bedspreads that suddenly seem clean and inviting.''
</P>
<P>
   The bed itself has changed, too, and dainty brass beds have been
replaced by less shiny metals in rustic designs, while the sleigh
bed continues to be a hot sleeping arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, it's wrought iron and glass tables and chairs,
or farm tables in white or blond wood with colorful ladder-backed
chairs. And counters filled with sleek '50s chrome appliances. &QL;

SLAMMING THE LID ON `BROTHER'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manipulation. Deceit. Anger. Suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the flavors of the month inside CBS' ``Big Brother''
compound with less than a month remaining in the psychological
contest.
</P>
<P>
   The houseguests and viewers seem to have eliminated the
residents who were, frankly, the most interesting _ trouble-making
Will, conniving Jordan, divorcee-to-be Karen and punky, cuddly,
virginal Brittany _ leaving the most benign residents inside.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have prompted Big Brother _ personified by a
rotating staff of story editors _ to turn up the heat on the
remaining contestants _ and even apparently to throw his weight
around on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, airplanes have flown over CBS' Studio
City lot towing banners reading ``Big Brother is worse than u
think. Get out now!'' ``There is dignity in walking out'' and other
calls to mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Oswald, a 36-year-old videographer and tape editor from
Charlotte, N.C., hired the flyovers, saying his immediate goal is
``to get them to walk out'' before the contest ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal (is) to make sure CBS never lets this happen
again,'' Oswald added.
</P>
<P>
   CBS apparently is not happy about the banner campaign. Doug
Johnson of Red Baron Air in Pacoima said Mike Skinner, security
chief of the Studio City lot, told him to stop flying over the
compound or CBS would consider taking legal action against Red
Baron, charging it with disrupting business at the lot's 16
soundstages with the single-engine Cessna's noise.
</P>
<P>
   However, Skinner would not comment Friday, and a CBS spokeswoman
said no legal action against Red Baron is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald started watching ``Big Brother'' after becoming hooked on
``Survivor,'' CBS' far more popular castaway show that concluded
last week. He was so disturbed by what he saw, he decided that
voting with his remote control was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I watched ('Big Brother'), the sicker I felt in my
stomach,'' he said. ``It's like watching a car wreck in slow motion
and then backing your car up to get a closer look at the carnage.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is concerned for the mental health of the houseguests
who, while they went in as willing volunteers on July 4, have no
idea how much they are being toyed with by the producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it a game, but the fact that they feel a need to
have psychiatric help on call around the clock for these people
should tell them something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jellison, a psychology professor at the University of
Southern California, said he has not watched the series, but there
is potential for harm inherent in the scenario of 10 strangers
confined to a house and yard for 89 days with no media and no
contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's reasonable concern,'' Jellison said. ``Let's
hope people aren't making life-changing decisions in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to underestimate the power of situations in
influencing our behavior,'' he said. ``When we're going through
life, we tend to think we're doing what we do because 'That's what
I want to do' or 'That's my personality.' We're unaware of the ways
all the social institutions around us or the people around us
influence us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the other residents aren't shaping an individual's
thinking and behavior, Big Brother certainly is.
</P>
<P>
   Many loyal ``Big Brother'' observers, posting updates about the
residents' activities on the Web, have noticed the story editors
have sounded more angry recently than they used to and have been
more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, the houseguests are wise to the manipulation. On
Aug. 23, the first time Oswald dispatched a plane over the house,
Big Brother hurried the houseguests inside and confined them all to
one windowless bedroom for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation lulled, Big Brother piped in bad
instrumental surfer music and commanded them to dance. The music
cut out for a time, then came back on. ``Stop screwing with us!''
one of the men shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, the New York lawyer, said he has braced himself for
ridicule or maybe unemployment whenever he leaves. He also told the
other residents to keep in mind that Big Brother does not have
their best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald, a ``media jammer'' who admits he is less polished at it
than ``Roger &AMP; Me'' director Michael Moore or MTV's Tom Green, said
his efforts to inspire revolt may have come too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're two thirds of the way through this thing and
they've got their eyes on the prize, and I can't say I would act
any differently,'' Oswald said. ``But that doesn't mean we're
through with it. We'll just keep throwing egg at ('Big Brother'
producer) Endemol (Entertainment) and see if it sticks to their
face.'' &QL;

   (ATTENTION EDITORS: ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World
of Richard Nixon,'' written by former BBC journalist Anthony
Summers with Robbyn Swan, is an exhaustive investigation of the
life and career of the 37th president of the United States. In
researching the book, Summers conducted more than a thousand
inteviews and drew on hundreds of thousands of documents. The New
York Times Syndicate is pleased to offer three excerpts from the
biography, each about 1,100 words in length. NORTH AMERICAN RIGHTS
ONLY. For purchase information, please contact DEBRA WEYDERT in New
Jersey at 1-732-390-4480; fax, 732-390-4697.)

   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT1 _ Outwardly Pat Nixon gave every
indication that she was the perfect politician's wife. Inwardly,
however, she was miserable: she hated public life and campaigning.
Richard Nixon was cold and dismissive toward her, and associates
never saw any signs of affection. This excerpt describes their
troubled relationship, punctuated by accounts of abuse, on occasion
allegedly physical. 1,100 words. NORTH AMERICAN RIGHTS ONLY.
</P>
<P>
   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT2 _ This excerpt describes how winning
the preidency changed Richard Nixon. He lavishly redecorated the
White House living quarters, and set up nine separate offices, all
with expensive communication systems, yet kept a very leisurely
work schedule. As former Republican Party chairman Len Hall put it,
Nixon became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in
the Oval Office and just issue orders. ...'' 1,100 words. NORTH
AMERICAN RIGHTS ONLY.
</P>
<P>
   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT3 _ This excerpt describes how, in 1968,
the founder of the Dreyfus Fund gave Richard Nixon a large quantity
of the prescription drug Dilantin, which Nixon began taking without
a doctor's supervision. In 1974, as his presidencey deteriorated,
Mr. Summers recounts how Nixon's aides and advisers took steps to
ensure that an increasingly erratic president didn't compromise
national security. 1,100 words. NORTH AMERICAN RIGHTS ONLY.

ON EVE OF U.N. SUMMIT MEETING, ANNAN SPEAKS OF HOPE FOR MIDEAST
PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Tuesday that
Israel and the Palestinians were closer to achieving a peace
agreement than ever before, and expressed hope that further
progress would be made at the next round of talks scheduled by
President Clinton for later this week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the two parties have ever been closer than they
are today,'' said Annan, who earlier this week talked with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat. He described both leaders as wanting more progress. ``But
of course we need to have a package on the table that both sides
find mutually acceptable,'' the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
   The last round of talks at Camp David, Md., ended in July when
the two sides could not agree on the future status of Jerusalem.
But Annan said, ``I think Camp David made major strides, and I
would hope we would be able to capitalize on that progress and
reach an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general made his remarks at a news conference on
Tuesday in advance of the three-day Millennium Summit meeting,
which its U.N. organizers are calling the largest gathering of
political leaders in history.
</P>
<P>
   Annan used the news conference to emphasize that the United
Nations could not be expected to do everything alone. And he warned
that the world's problems, from poverty to AIDS and economic
inequality, would never be solved without the active cooperation of
every country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is everyone's responsibility,'' Annan said. ``We will play
a catalytic role,'' but ``everyone has to do their bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting will bring together more than 150 heads of
state here on Wednesday. It will conclude on Friday with a joint
declaration, a draft of which began circulating on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The draft declaration commits signers to ``spare no effort to
free our peoples from the scourge of war'' and to promote
democracy, expand respect for human rights and ensure every
country's right to economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Other resolutions call for ridding the world of poverty,
promoting education and reversing the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no illusion that a single summit in itself can change
the world,'' Annan told journalists. ``But I believe this meeting
provides a unique opportunity for leaders to renew our mission and
our purpose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Annan acknowledged that the goals that were set out were
ambitious. But he expressed hope that everyone at the summit
meeting would go home and take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems seem huge,'' the secretary-general said, ``but in
today's world, given the technology and the resources involved, we
have the means to tackle them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the proposed expansion of the 15-member Security
Council sought by many countries, Annan said that he believed an
expansion was possible, though he doubted that it could be achieved
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, one of the council's five permanent members, on Monday
suggested an expansion of the council. Last spring, the U.S. chief
representative, Richard C. Holbrooke, spoke of increasing its
membership beyond 20 or 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western countries have argued that adding too many members
would dilute the council's effectiveness. But Annan expressed
sympathy with many developing countries that contend that the
council should be made more democratic and representative of the
diversity of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the idea that the expansion will necessarily lead to
a confused, ineffective Security Council which fudges all issues,''
the secretary-general said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The small road from Malaucene to Suzette winds through
deep-green wooded hills and rounded valleys terraced with rows and
rows of vineyards _ horizontal, vertical, diagonal _ a lush and
leafy basket weave of vines.
</P>
<P>
   The hills are not very high but the air is almost alpine, and
the landscape so rich, so carefully cultivated that it seems a
vision of earthly paradise. Then, suddenly, the road bends and
there, in the center of a circular green dell, two jagged white
rocks jut skyward like the razorback spines of a dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Romans called these hills ``mons mirabilis,'' the
marvelous mountains. Today, they're called the Dentelles de
Montmirail. And they are at the center of one of the most
historically curious regions of France, the splatter-shaped Comtat
Venaissin, a ``county'' which for some 500 years did not belong to
France at all but to the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   A good launching point for the Dentelles is the Comtat's old
capital, Carpentras, whose Friday morning market is one of the
biggest and best in Provence, filling the streets of town all the
way to the 15th-century St. Siffren cathedral and the 14th-century
synagogue, the oldest in France.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Carpentras, the road divides. It doesn't matter
whether you take the right fork or the left _ both routes lead
around the Dentelles to Vaison-la-Romaine and, on the way, to some
of the most delightful villages in Provence. Most are medieval
towns built on old Roman foundations and most are engaged in wine
making.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful chateau-fortress of Le Barroux pops up out of
nowhere, silhouetted against the sharp, blue sky, and on some days
the mistral wind literally howls as it whips past the crenelated
walls. Gigondas is surprisingly small, given the renown of its
wine, but it has an instant charm that befits its old Roman name of
``Jocundatis,'' the jolly one.
</P>
<P>
   Sablet forms an almost perfect circle in the vineyards, its
twisted streets and covered passages squeezed within its rampart
walls. Seguret is strung around the base of its dome-shaped hill
like a ruff, with its ruined castle perched all alone at the top.
This might be the prettiest town of all, with its sinuous streets
of stone houses cascading with flowers, and its artisans _ weavers,
potters, and makers of religious figurines called ``santons'' _ at
work behind amiably open doors. It also has a cozy little vineyard
hotel, the Domaine de Cabasse, and an excellent restaurant, La
Table du Comtat, with a superb view of the Dentelles.
</P>
<P>
   Crowning the circle of the Dentelles, Vaison-la-Romaine is, in
fact, not just one town but three: the ruined Gallo-Roman colony of
Vaslo Vocontiorum on the southern bank of the Ouveze river, the
fortified medieval village perched on the opposite hill, and the
lively modern Provencal city built squarely on top of the Roman
one.
</P>
<P>
   Vaison's sprawling archaeological site covers 37 acres,
including the ruins of vast, private villas larger than any found
at Pompeii. Divided into two principal sites, Puymin and Villasse,
the ruins lie a few feet below the current street level. The ``rue
des boutiques'' in the Villasse quarter was once arcaded and lined
with shops. Early in the morning, when the ruined street with its
broken columns is still empty of visitors, you can almost hear the
sounds of shutters being thrown open as shopkeepers prepared to
start the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the Puymin quarter, there's a large 1st-century theater and a
museum housing other treasures found on the site, including statues
of the emperor Hadrian and his empress, Sabine.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive Roman monument in Vaison is not a ruin at
all but the single-arch stone bridge across the Ouveze. In
September 1992, a flash flood devastated the city, sweeping away
everything in its path except the 2000-year-old bridge, still the
principal link to the medieval city on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the citizens of medieval Vaison moved across the
river to their citadel, however, they used foundations of a
Gallo-Roman temple to build their 11th-century Notre Dame de
Nazareth cathedral _ one of the most beautiful Romanesque churches
in Provence. The capitals of its thick-walled cloister are carved
with mythical figures and its galleries are filled with ancient,
marble fragments, like pieces of a puzzle that still won't fit.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the citadel, the cobbled streets climb past vine-covered
16th- and 17th-century houses with painted shutters. Tucked among
them is the delightful Hostellerie Le Beffroi, a small hotel near
the medieval belfry tower. At the top, the ruins of the
12th-century chateau offer a wonderful view of Mount Ventoux, the
big, bald, white rock that is Provence's tallest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   If you have time for side trips, take the road from Malaucene to
the windy summit of Mount Ventoux (the snow-capped peak is
sometimes closed in winter), or follow route D40 along the valley
beneath Ventoux's spectacular northern flank to the perched hamlet
of Brantes. There, you'll find a 12th-century chapel, a tiny
terrace for a cold glass of wine and an omelette and the small
workshop of Le Faience de Brantes, where Martine Gilles and Jaap
Weimar have been making some of Provence's loveliest ceramics for
more than 25 years.

<P>
   As Joe Lieberman prepared to speak at a recent rally in downtown
St. Louis, he chuckled, tapped Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore on the shoulder and pointed to a campaign placard that caught
his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that sign, I love it: `Batman, Superman,
LIEBER-MAN,''' said the bemused senator from Connecticut as he drew
laughs from the crowd and then launched into his stump speech
promoting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the four weeks since he was named as Gore's running mate,
Lieberman has added a touch of humor and a lot more to what had
been an often sluggish presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staffers believe Lieberman has helped put the Democratic
presidential nominee at ease, conveyed positive aspects of his
character and biography, promoted a message of ethics and values,
and managed to carry out effectively the traditional role of vice
presidential attack dog.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry and result have been so good, say campaign
officials, that Lieberman is likely to have frequent double dates
with Gore rather than simply following the standard vice
presidential script of campaigning alone in secondary markets and
attending fund-raising dinners. The pair's 27-hour Labor Day
weekend campaign sprint through several states tested the double
date theory to the satisfaction of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see Lieberman on his own, but you will probably see
the two campaign together along with their spouses more than has
been the case in past elections,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane has
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are good personal friends; they enjoy being together and
campaigning together. A central part of the campaign's focus and
message is how as a team they will work together to continue our
prosperity,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic between Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his GOP
running mate, Dick Cheney, is different. While the two have
appeared together and get along quite well, it is likely they will
follow the historic pattern of campaigning separately most of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Being together on the campaign trail can have drawbacks,
however. Sometimes Lieberman's visibility has prompted questions
about his past differences with Gore on key issues such as school
vouchers, affirmative action and Social Security privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman also campaigned together last week on the
West Coast, where Lieberman was deployed to denounce a new
Republican National Committee television commercial. That ad
attacks Gore's character and mocks his appearance at a fund-raising
event at a Buddhist temple four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than focusing on the serious issues before our country,
our opponents have hit the airwaves with paid political negative
personal attack ads, and that's wrong,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore was asked about the ad, he declined comment, saying
Lieberman ``addressed that on behalf of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials say the tag-team affair not only has given
Gore a warm-up partner, but has allowed him to take the high road
and to be seen as the leader instead of the understudy he has been
for eight years as Bill Clinton's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the message is that Gore is a strong leader -- a gap
he made up at the Democratic convention and with the bold and
historic selection of Lieberman,'' said Democratic pollster Mark
Mellman, referring to the fact that Lieberman is the first Jewish
candidate ever selected for a major party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Lieberman with him reinforces the notion of Gore as No.
1 and as a leader,'' Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe that Cheney brings experience to the ticket
as a White House chief of staff, a congressman and a defense
secretary -- acting as a kind of wise man for Bush, whose political
experience has been as a governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are working closely together on important decisions and
will continue to do so,'' said Bush spokesman Ken Kisaius.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney is also dour and serious, offering little humor or
animation on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bush, in fact, who is more colorful and has an easygoing
</P>
<P>
   speaking style. If campaign audiences are going to get a laugh
or two at a rally, it will come on a line from Bush and not from
his running mate. Cheney, a native of Wyoming, admits as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of in keeping with my quiet, low-key demeanor,''
Cheney said last week after brief remarks to a Christian athletic
group. ``I come from the West, a man of few words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Cheney adding a lot as a campaigner,'' said George
Edwards, director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas
A&AMP;M University. ``There is not the same kind of synergy as Gore and
Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically when Bush and Cheney are together, Cheney offers brief
remarks that include a vow to restore ``dignity and honor'' to the
White House -- a reference to the scandals of the Clinton
administration. Bush, in turn, describes Cheney as an able leader
who will be ready to help govern.
</P>
<P>
   When he has campaigned alone, Cheney has tended to avoid
questions from the press. He has appeared at smaller events and
followed a standard and often brief script, talking about weighty
defense issues and moral values, among other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in contrast, draws laughs and chants of support from
his crowds when he is alone or with Gore, and has given numerous
interviews. He talks about his own background as the son of a
bakery truck driver and his days as a civil rights worker in the
1960s, a tack Cheney does not follow.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also repeatedly talks of Gore as ``a man of courage''
who served in Vietnam, and a family man and individual of ``moral
values.'' He sprinkles his speeches with biblical references. These
comments have drawn criticism from the Anti-Defamation League,
while Cheney has been dogged by questions about his
multimillion-dollar retirement buyout from the oil services firm he
headed.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The decision to campaign often with Lieberman rests solely with
Gore, who in 1992 had to fight Clinton staffers to remain on the
post-convention bus tour. He has told friends he should have been
there more often.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said the Democratic nominee is not
worried that the campaign will limit its ability to reach a wider
audience that might otherwise come from splitting up the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this media age where there is a constant flow of
information, new cable networks and satellites, radio and the
Internet, campaigning together doesn't diminish our ability to hit
different markets,'' Lehane said.

PARDON, BUT DID YOU JUST HEAR A BURP IN THE RAIN FOREST? 

</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood may want to hold onto footage of President Clinton's
quick spin through Colombia last week. It could come in handy for a
movie someday.
</P>
<P>
   I envision a film _ let's give it a blockbuster title,
``Fungus!'' _ set in the Amazonian jungle. As the opening credits
appear, Clinton is shown defending his $1.3 billion aid package to
Colombia. ``This is not Vietnam,'' he thunders, ``neither is it
Yankee imperialism.'' Meanwhile, in the background, growing louder,
is the sound of munching.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the fungus and star of our show, Fusarium
oxysporum, a relatively unknown actor with a voracious appetite for
marijuana, cocaine, heroin and _ according to some critics _ just
about anything else that's leafy, green and unable to pull up roots
and flee.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, you may recall, Florida officials briefly pondered
testing this soil-borne fungus to combat the state's thriving
marijuana trade. Promoters touted it as a lean, mean weed-eating
machine, but skeptics pointed out _ accurately _ that precious
little is known about what else it may devour.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics include David Struhs, director of the state
Department of Environmental Protection. He joined a chorus of
opponents, including a predictably off-key contingent of potheads,
in denouncing the plan. He said the fungus is ``capable of evolving
rapidly'' and may be ``difficult, if not impossible, to control.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the fungus could live for decades in the steamy soil of
Florida. We've seen other species of greenery, meek and agreeable
in their home climates, become mean and gluttonous down South.
Think kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally do not like the idea of messing with Mother
Nature,'' Bill Graves, a biologist at the University of Florida
Research Center, told The New York Times last summer, shortly
before state officials shelved the idea. ``I believe that if this
fungus is unleashed for this kind of problem, it's going to create
its own problems. If it isn't executed effectively, it's going to
target and kill rare and endangered plants.''
</P>
<P>
   But the aid package delivered to Colombia last week includes _
surprise! _ $3 million to test the effectiveness of Fusarium
oxysporum on Andean coca bushes. U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey
hopes to demonstrate that the fungus is safe, then put it to work
wiping out Colombia's estimated 300,000 acres of coca.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Colombian officials are thrilled by the gift. ``This is
a living organism that will transform itself in order to survive,''
an unidentified Colombian government biologist told The Los Angeles
Times last week. ``Field tests are a risk for Colombia and the
entire Amazon region.''
</P>
<P>
   Others echo those fears. ``If it's bad for Florida, why is it
good for us?'' Colombian Sen. Rafael Orduz asked the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   In its May issue, Mother Jones magazine pointed out that the
fungus wiped out a large crop of coca plants in Peru in the early
1990s but also killed banana and other food crops. Writers Sharon
Stevenson and Jeremy Bigwood raised alarms about the U.S.
government's supposedly reassuring claims that the fungus will
attack only plants in the genus Erythroxylum _ a genus that
includes more than 200 plants besides coca.
</P>
<P>
   Drug czar McCaffrey says more than 100 species of plants have
been tested with the fungus and none has been affected. But that's
only a tiny fraction of species contained in the Amazon jungle, the
second most biodiverse region in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics point to studies indicating that the fungus can be
toxic to humans under some circumstances. McCaffrey's office
contends that the toxins would affect only ``immune-suppressed
cancer patients whose defense levels were very low, making them
vulnerable to almost any microbe.'' Those folks, according to the
drug czar, could be kept out of the way during spraying.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering squad for the tests includes Rep. Bill McCollum, a
Florida Republican running for the U.S. Senate. He says the fungus
could be ``the silver bullet'' in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's right, and Fusarium oxysporum will be a rare instance
in the history of government when the law of unintended
consequences is temporarily suspended. Maybe we really are looking
at a major turning point in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, we ought to bring plenty of extra popcorn to the
show. The fungus may well appear on our doorsteps in mid-viewing _
with a bad case of the munchies.

 &HT;    DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Time was, encounters with snakes
were no big deal
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Chris Myott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strange how things that petrify me now, like snakes, were
natural occurrences when I was a child during the early 1940s in
rural North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   I remember how happy mama was when daddy decided we would move
to Mr. Daniel Keen's newly acquired farmland adjacent to Black
Creek in Johnston County.
</P>
<P>
   It had a brand new four-room bungalow with a well beside the
front porch and a giant sycamore tree for shade in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Keen was a gentleman farmer and owned a lot of land. He
would give us kids a nickel each when he came to visit.
</P>
<P>
   As the landlord, he furnished the seed and fertilizer for the
crops. We, as tenant farmers, supplied the work and received half
the money from the cash crops of tobacco and cotton. The food crops
and animals were ours.
</P>
<P>
   The black water of the creek, from which it got its name, was
good for fishing, especially catfish, and enriched the adjoining
farmland. But it was also a natural habitat for snakes.
</P>
<P>
   My first encounter with a snake was in the summer when we had
the windows up and the doors open.
</P>
<P>
   The windows had screens, but there were no screen doors on our
house.
</P>
<P>
   It was customary for us to take a nap for an hour or so after
the big noon meal.
</P>
<P>
   Mama would spread an old quilt on top of the clean bedspread and
whoever wanted to could lie crosswise on the bed to rest.
</P>
<P>
   I remember coming into the room one day and seeing a snake
coiled on the floor underneath my mother's legs that were dangling
over the side of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   All I remember after that was that someone killed the snake and
my mother was not bitten.
</P>
<P>
   The snake was hung on a tree limb so it would rain.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Sunday afternoon when all of us were lounging
under the giant sycamore tree on the platform where we prepared
tobacco during the week for the curing barn.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody looked up in the branches and saw a huge snake curled
around a limb directly over us.
</P>
<P>
   Guess he was looking for a cool spot, too.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy nonchalantly walked into the house, came out with his
double-barrel shotgun and unloaded the first barrel into the tree.
</P>
<P>
   It took a second barrel to bring the snake tumbling to the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   He was pretty shredded, but we hung what was left of him on a
tree limb so it would rain.
</P>
<P>
   My final encounter with a snake at the Black Creek house was a
day when I was looking for something to snack on.
</P>
<P>
   I knew mama kept leftovers like biscuits, fried meat and gravy,
and the syrup pot in the pie safe on the shelf above her clean
dishes. I undid the latch and flung open both doors at once.
</P>
<P>
   There, lying in Mama's dishes, stretched from one side of the
safe to the other, was the biggest black snake I had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   That was one time I knew fear! I still don't remember who killed
the snake.
</P>
<P>
   I was too young to worry about things then, but many times over
the years I have wondered how a snake that big could have gotten in
the pie safe.
</P>
<P>
   He met his fate just like the others, and we hung him on a limb
so it would rain.
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking about these experiences scares me more now than it
did when they actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   I remember running barefoot and barelegged in the fields and
woods, wading up and down the branch that ran into the creek, even
wading in the creek water when it overflowed its banks and flooded
the road.
</P>
<P>
   No one in my family was ever snake-bitten, nor showed the
slightest caution about walking barefoot outside at night.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like in those days that country folks thought no more of
snakes than they did about leaving their doors unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Those were dream times.

prescription drug program similar to the Part B program that covers
doctors' bills. Medicare would pay half of prescription drug costs,
up to $5,000 annually.

&HT;     SIERRA CLUB WANTS TO PUT BRAKES ON SUV CRAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a snappy six-page brochure, the Sierra Club
is taking aim at sport utility vehicles, depicting them as
gas-guzzling, carbon-dioxide-spewing vehicles that are hazardous,
not hip.
</P>
<P>
   Switching from driving an average new car to a
13-mile-per-gallon SUV for a year, the 108-year-old environmental
group says, would waste more energy than leaving a refrigerator
door open for six years, a bathroom light burning for 30 years, or
a color television turned on for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other disturbing factoids in the brochure, based on industry and
independent research, assert the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ SUVs emit 43 percent more global-warming pollutants _ 28
pounds of carbon dioxide per gallon of gas consumed _ and 47
percent more air pollution than the average car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising the fuel-economy standards for SUVs and other light
trucks to equal that of cars would save 1 million barrels of oil
per day.
</P>
<P>
   _ An SUV or a pickup is more than twice as likely as a car to
kill the driver of the other vehicle in a collision, and an SUV is
four times as likely to roll over in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things we know how to do to reduce global warming,
the biggest single step we can take is making vehicles go farther
on a gallon of gas,'' said Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra
Club's $200,000-a-year Global Warming and Energy Program in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said improving the standards would be a greater benefit than
reducing power plant emissions by switching to cleaner fuels and
renewable energy or by cutting energy demand with efficient
lighting, appliances, and heating and cooling systems in houses,
offices and factories.
</P>
<P>
   Although not all scientists agree that pollutants alone are
causing the Earth's temperature to warm, many researchers say auto
and factory emissions are largely to blame. Pollutant gases such as
carbon dioxide emissions trap heat, they say ultimately raising
temperatures that could have devastating effects on the polar ice
caps and lead to flooding in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Auto
Manufacturers, which represents Ford, General Motors,
DaimlerChrysler, and other automotive manufacturers, said the
industry is improving SUVs for all the people who want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make SUVs cleaner and more fuel efficient. We
believe that competition is going to drive more progress,''
Bergquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUVs meet the demands of a lot of farmers, ranchers,
tradespeople, families and small business owners. While some SUV
drivers might not use their vehicles to their full capability, they
like knowing they could have the passenger room, cargo room, towing
ability and performance when they wanted,'' Bergquist said.
</P>
<P>
   According to calculations in the Sierra Club brochure, the Ford
Excursion, at 13 mph, emits 134 tons of carbon dioxide over the
124,000-mile life of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with 96 tons from a Jeep Grand Cherokee at 18 mpg,
74 tons from a Ford Taurus at 23 mpg, 48 tons from a Honda Civic HX
at 36 mpg, and 27 tons from a Honda Insight at 65 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the barrage of statistics is the Sierra Club's political
message: SUVs are getting a free ride. Classified as light trucks
instead of cars, they do not have to meet the federal fuel-economy
standards of 27.5 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, when the standards were first adopted, light trucks,
mainly pickups, made up about 20 percent of the vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 48 percent of the 16.9 million vehicles sold were
light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working vehicles, the Sierra Club says, today's SUVs
are ``far more likely to haul lattes home from Starbucks than
lumber from the yard. Even though Detroit has technology that could
make them both cleaner and safer, SUVs and other light trucks are
still held to low environmental standards, roll over more than cars
and pose greater danger to other vehicles than cars do.''

<P>
   I just popped a can of Bud in my 1,100-square-foot shack that's
now worth almost a million bucks on paper, and thought about how
much the Bay Area has changed.
</P>
<P>
   It's changed by a factor of five.
</P>
<P>
   That's rent times five, rudeness times five, politically correct
idiocy times five, and traffic times five. And there are five
parking spaces left somewhere in San Francisco and 500,000 drivers
looking for them.
</P>
<P>
   But I bought in when homes were ridiculously overpriced at
$200,000, and I've got a parking space, which I'm opening to bids
on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago was the 21st anniversary of the publication of my
first story at the old Palo Alto paper, and the 23rd anniversary of
my arrival in the Bay Area as a slacker of a grad student at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto was a sleepy college town with a couple of beer joints
that pumped out pitchers of old-fashioned macrobrews served up with
peanuts instead of goat-cheese pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Now Palo Alto is the exact geographic center of the universe, a
gold hole that sucks BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes and oversize homes and
egos into it.
</P>
<P>
   That first newspaper story of mine in 1979 was about the first
Gilroy Garlic Festival, which drew a few hundred people, many of
whom thought that eating garlic was very daring.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays having a steak is daring.
</P>
<P>
   Man, has the Bay Area distorted my mind, wallet and palate.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in San Diego two weeks ago, I went to Black Angus
steak house (because I love the ads). I felt like an anthropologist
studying an exotic tribe that enjoys foodstuffs with earthy names
like ``ranch'' and ``mud pie,'' and shamelessly enjoys sides of
recently slaughtered salad or cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Dining in the Bay Area must seem like an episode of ``Survivor''
to those Southern California suburbanites. We enter restaurants
that aren't even tried and tested chains, and we don't even blink
when we order braised skate, free-range beef cheeks and cuisine
made by hot and cold fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we enter restaurants if they'll let us in. The real game
of ``Survivor'' in the Bay Area is trying to get a table for two at
a highly rated restaurant before the chef goes to another place.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful job is not mayor, but reservationist, a person
who speaks the dread words, ``We can get you in at 5:30 or 9:45.''
That's on a Tuesday, three months after the chef has moved on.
</P>
<P>
   We're so twisted we like restaurants that refuse to feed us. I
don't know why people practice bulimia when all they have to do is
try to get a reservation at the French Laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Think of how the language has changed in the Bay Area. Of
course, there are more of the world's natural languages spoken here
as the population has changed, but the artificial and vernacular
languages have changed even more.
</P>
<P>
   We don't recoil in disgust at people talking loudly in public
about downloading, inputting, hacking and spam. We put ``e-`` in
front of everything the way hippies once started everything with
``Man.'' Companies end with ``dot-com'' as predictably as a night
in a bar once ended with ``My place or yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Sex has gotten weird. It hardly exists, at least as far as I
know, and the sex that exists is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area is where people once came to be free. Now they come
here to be free of sex talk in the workplace, free of smoke and
alcohol, free to obsessively exercise, free to tell strangers not
to eat meat or wear fur and free to flip people off in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   All this freedom is getting pretty tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   How did we ever live without cell phones or personal computers?
Somehow most of us did 15 or 20 years ago, and we lived pretty
well.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, but it seems the more we communicate, the less
community we have. A stranger speaks behind you, and you turn to
talk but find he's talking to someone else on a cell phone. Were
you crazy, thinking a stranger in the Bay Area would strike up a
conversation?
</P>
<P>
   We need Nokias and modems as go-betweens.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area has changed immensely as people have moved here
from Asia and Latin America, and money has moved here from
everywhere. But there have been some less welcome changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were people ever polite here?'' asks a young friend who moved
here not long ago from a famously rude city back East.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't believe it when I said they were. No car horns?
Unbelievable. No middle-finger salutes? Couldn't be. People who
treat others with respect unless those others were Dodger fans? No
way.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it was, and you even could get a table at
Chez Panisse.
</P>
<P>
   We've always been lucky to live here. Now we're lucky if we can
survive here. Let's pop a cold one to luck and next month's
mortgage.

WOMAN'S DATABASE ON KENNEDY ASSASSINATION IS THE ENVY OF
RESEARCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanied by KENNEDY-MOTORCADE)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKE COCHRAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ ``I never thought I'd have prostitutes or Mafia in my
house,'' says Mary Ferrell, her brown eyes flashing as her mind
sifts through events of the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've had them all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All'' includes the mercurial mother of an accused presidential
assassin and scores of authors and researchers who, not unlike
herself, are committed to solving the mystery of the 20th century:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who killed JFK?''
</P>
<P>
   It matters little to critics, researchers and just plain old
assassination buffs that there may be no mystery at all _ that
perhaps Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, killed President Kennedy
from his sixth-floor sniper's perch in the Texas School Book
Depository on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the Warren Commission conclusion, although many remain
unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart,'' says Ferrell, ``I believe Lee Harvey Oswald was
a patsy, that he was used, and that there were other participants
in the planning and execution and certainly in the cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of her colleagues, however, Ferrell is quick to add:
``I don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when future generations delve into the events of November
1963, the odds are good they will sift through material compiled by
this feisty, silver-haired researcher extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   At 77 and in uncertain health, Ferrell, a former legal
secretary, worries that if her assassination research falls into
the wrong hands it could be abused and distorted. Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my death,'' she says of portions of her collection, ``I
want them destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to suggest she intends to die anytime soon: ``I'm not
one of these people who wants to die. I don't give a damn if I'm a
burden. I want to keep on living.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell stands as a fountain of credibility in a garden of
conspiratorial nonsense. One of the original JFK researchers, she
is widely recognized as competent, sensible, relentless, honest
and, when necessary, outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply try to avoid the idiot fringe. It's not easy,'' she
says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Joking about many of the conspiracy theorists, she says: ``We've
been blessed with some of the biggest liars in the world. Some of
my dearest friends will believe anything under the sun. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very few people in this that I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Jim Garrison, the late conspiracy-obsessed district attorney,
she says wryly: ``He was the most charming, interesting man I've
ever met. But, poor dear, he let this assassination drive him
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Oliver Stone created the 1991 film ``JFK,'' there was an
assassination movie called ``Executive Action,'' which starred Burt
Lancaster and Robert Ryan, and blended facts into the fictional
plot. The producers persuaded Ferrell to provide the authenticity,
but she declined to accept money or credit.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been called scavengers and critics of the Warren
Report and (some claim) we're just in it for the money. ... As one
who has never taken money for what I've done, maybe it will help
uphold the credibility of the critics and researchers.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, when Mary Ferrell speaks _ not always softly _
people listen, and her assassination-related collection is truly
awesome.
</P>
<P>
   Gaeton Fonzi, a former investigator for the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, calls her the ``guiding star for those
who have devoted a part of their lives to pursuing the truth about
the Kennedy assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction of his book ``The Last Investigation,''
Fonzi says Ferrell has inspired a generation of JFK researchers
with her ``gentle patience and guidance'' as they ``struggled to
extract those rare gems of truth buried in the mountains of
government documents, investigative reports and private research
papers she has accumulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey
Plaza: ``All the Kennedy researchers, since the moment it happened
until decades in the future, will be totally indebted to Mary
Ferrell for compiling a massive database of facts, figures and
information.''
</P>
<P>
   A respected researcher in his own right, Mack says: ``Mary's not
really a theorist. She's a compiler. She gathers information and
organizes it.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that in the late '70s, the House Select Committee
contacted Ferrell for copies of certain documents that had been
overlooked or misplaced by the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a congressional investigating committee relies on a
private citizen for government documents,'' he said, laughing,
``you know that person knows what she's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a diverse group has beaten a path to Ferrell's modest
Dallas home. They include Jack Ruby's strippers, a driver for a New
Orleans Mafia kingpin, most of the authors of JFK-related books,
scores of fellow researchers, and the cantankerous and self-styled
``Mother of History,'' Marguerite Oswald.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer, who penned ``Oswald's Tale,'' was another who
sought Ferrell's counsel, and she insists he was both likable and
great fun.
</P>
<P>
   But, she sighs,''I have met some of the weirdest people in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of gunfire in Dealey Plaza had hardly faded that
November day when Ferrell launched her quixotic crusade into the
murders of Kennedy and police officer J.D. Tippit and, two days
later, the slaying of Oswald by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.
</P>
<P>
   Not an ardent Kennedy admirer, Ferrell was an unlikely candidate
for such an endeavor, as reflected by her activities earlier that
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up in the Southland Center having lunch in the Chaparral
Club and I didn't even care enough to go down on Elm Street to
watch the motorcade,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I didn't want anything like that happening in
Dallas. I thought it was a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ferrell, the murderous sequence didn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Tippit shooting, the police identification of Oswald in the
darkened Texas Theater, his capture and finally his subsequent
murder by Ruby seemed too coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just couldn't have happened this way,'' she says. ``It just
didn't seem plausible. ... I began my quest that afternoon and I
just never stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Wasting no time, Ferrell combed the regular and special editions
of the local papers that long, traumatic weekend for the names of
witnesses _ often misspelled, she points out _ and began recording
them alphabetically on index cards. She added information as it
became available from newspapers and magazines and, years later,
books. Once confidential government documents were declassified,
she also obtained data from the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up with over 40,000 3-by-5 index cards,'' she says,
shaking her head in wonderment. ``I built a database before I ever
heard the term `database.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She still has those typewritten cards, although her files are
now computerized.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a staggering collection of JFK-related books,
magazines and newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a few books that are very rare ... some published in
English, some in Russian. I'm not saying they've got anything
really valuable to say, but the book itself is a rare item.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1968, she remembers with a chuckle, her books filled
every nook and cranny of every room in her two-bedroom, yellow
frame house, finally overflowing onto the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' her husband, Buck, inquired one night, ``if I built
you a library out in back, would you put all these books out there
and never bring another book in the house?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He foolishly believed me. Of course, there are still books in
the kitchen, the bathroom, the other bedroom, living room,
everywhere. And that room out there _ (the library) _ you can
hardly walk. But he did have that room built for me in 1968.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Before the '60s ran their clamorous course, Ferrell's research
efforts took a pivotal turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same day that I started my database, there was a man over
in Highland Park that began what he called his chronology,'' she
recalls. ``He put everything in his book, wrote it down minute by
minute, in chronological order.''
</P>
<P>
   His name was Arch Kimbrough. He and Ferrell met in March 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really did like him,'' Ferrell says. ``He told me he was
going to devote 20 years to the assassination, and if it was not
solved at the end of 20 years, he was going to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Kimbrough, now dead, became a team of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was swap our work,'' Ferrell says. ``I gave him
copies of my index cards and he gave me copies of his chronology.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, they traveled to Washington together to examine
government documents at the National Archives. ``Arch and I would
be there when they opened and closed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And after 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``On Nov. 22, 1983, he stopped. He didn't want to hear
`assassination' again. And he thought I should stop, too. I said,
`No, I'm not going to stop. I never expected it to be solved by
this time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell added the chronology to her research effort, and it now
consists of some 10 volumes and thousands of pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time something new came up, I put it into the chronology.
... Lee's complete life is in these chronologies ... but the
chronology has everybody: Tippit and Ruby and Ruby's family ... and
a lot of people who had no business being in there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the dilemma, says Ferrell, one that might
compel her to destroy much of her research on both the index cards
and in the chronologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I can't let these things loose is because there's
so much supposition in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, she says, she included someone in her database and
chronologies without documentary proof of the person's possible or
purported involvement: ``If I had a reason for believing ... I put
it in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It created a paradox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's work in there that will never be duplicated ...
valuable work, and I agree it should be saved,'' Ferrell concedes.
``But maybe next to it is something that should be destroyed.''

   She says the solution would be to weed out the extraneous,
undocumented, potentially embarrassing material. But after a
serious run-in with cancer in 1997, her health won't permit such an
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took wonderful care of my library until I got sick,'' she
says. ``Now I don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she says, her daughter, Carol Anne Burtchaell, will
make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things that have been published _ newspapers, magazines
and books _ Carol Anne can give those to anybody she wants,''
Ferrell says, but a leading candidate is Tennessee researcher
Robert Chapman, whom she's worked with for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a reliable person and a good researcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Burtchaell, an IBM employee based in Dallas, says she is
undecided about the published materials and the files and
chronologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have promised to abide by Mother's wishes, but she has been
so vague that I feel I have a lot of latitude,'' she says. ``I
hope, if I outlive her, that I can reach a consensus with my
brother, Jim, who has taken an interest in the case, and Robert
Chapman, who is also very interested and has been extremely kind to
my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that a significant portion of Ferrell's work is
already electronically preserved outside her private collection.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she ``culled out'' more than 11,000 of her index
cards and fed the information into a computer, then transferred it
onto a CD-ROM. She also pulled from the chronologies Oswald's life
from the time he joined the Marines in 1956 until the day he died
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell gave the CD to a mail-order book service called JFK
Lancer, so named because Lancer was Kennedy's Secret Service code
name on his 1963 trip to Texas. The Grand Prairie-based group
primarily handles books dealing with political assassinations and
also publishes a quarterly newsletter out of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use that database and sell that CD-ROM for $60,'' Ferrell
explains, ``and it is financing scholarships for college students
writing about the Kennedy assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she can't prove a conspiracy, she decreed that
applicants need not embrace such a concept to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't prove definitely that Oswald wasn't the only shooter.
... I think there were shots coming from the grassy knoll, but I
can't prove that. I think the Zapruder film looks like it proves it
... that Kennedy was hit from the front and his head went violently
backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, more decisive about a purported coverup, which
she believes was orchestrated by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been covered up by anyone else,'' she says.
``They're the only ones who could control all these documents.
That's as specific as I can get. I don't know that there was any
other conspiracy. All of it may have been happenstance ... but
somebody went to a great deal of trouble to control the
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   She insists there is evidence that the FBI forged documents, and
cites as an example a page from a previously classified report on
the assassination. Dated Nov. 30, 1963, Page 129 cites evidence
that in effect would tend to put the assassin on the sixth floor of
the School Book Depository and bolster the case against Oswald.
However, what appears to be the original Page 129 of the same
report was decidedly less conclusive. That page was discovered by a
JFK researcher who stumbled across it tucked away in an unrelated
document from the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the substitute page was a forgery, she wonders
rhetorically: ``If they'd forge one thing, why not believe they'd
forge everything? You see why I get so angry and don't want to
stop?''
</P>
<P>
   But after 37 years, Ferrell admits she's not much closer to
``solving'' the crime than she was in November 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll solve it in my lifetime,'' she says
softly. ``But I want to leave the best possible records for
researchers, or schoolchildren, who might want to study the
assassination 100 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   No regrets, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, no, no. Because I'm convinced that we don't know what
happened. And I don't know that we ever will. I'm not one who
believes that we're going to turn over a stone somewhere and find
the answer. I don't think we will ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's been an interesting ride.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ Although Mary Ferrell was not in Dealey Plaza when
President Kennedy was slain, her car was.
</P>
<P>
   In a minor footnote to history, she explains that, at the time,
her husband, Buck, worked for Eagle Lincoln-Mercury, the auto
dealer that furnished cars for the presidential motorcade. In
October 1963, her husband had bought her a new 1964 station wagon,
a Mercury Colony Park. On Nov. 22, 1963, the car was in the shop
for a 2,000-mile checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Buck called her at the lawyer's office where she worked and,
says Ferrell, there was this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother, could I loan your car to this motorcade? They've
stripped us. We don't have anything else we can loan them. ... It's
out of the shop and it's in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to drive it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. Probably the DPS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When will I get it back?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, when they're through with the motorcade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they going to put gas back in it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hell. Forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, go ahead, you can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' she adds, referring to film shot that day, ``the station
wagon you see with the doors open and the men jumping out of it and
running up the grassy knoll? That's my car!''

&HT;     S.F. TO BECOME SECOND U.S. CITY WHERE ASIANS OUTNUMBER WHITES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIN McCORMICK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometime this year, according to trends
projected in a survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, San Francisco will
join Honolulu as the nation's only major cities where Asians
outnumber whites.
</P>
<P>
   While census estimates released this week indicate that
so-called ``minorities'' have now become the majority in
California, San Francisco is way ahead of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   The city's white population dropped below the 50 percent mark in
the early 1990s, and starting this year, the survey indicates,
whites will no longer even make up the largest racial group in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The census study, which questioned one of every 33 San Francisco
households, found that, as of 1999, Asians and whites each made up
36 percent of the city's population. And the Asian population is
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become the mainstream,'' said Rose Pak, who heads the
San Francisco Chinese Chamber of Commerce. ``We have suspected this
was happening for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Asians are set to be the largest racial group in San
Francisco, they lag far behind when it comes to political clout,
according to Pak and other community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The census survey estimated that people who considered
themselves ``white only'' accounted for only a little more than a
third of the city's population in 1999, but they still make up
about 72 percent of the voters, according to David Lee of the
nonprofit Chinese-American Voter Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who has done polls and surveys of the election rolls to
find out who is voting in San Francisco, calculates that about only
18 percent of voters are Asian although the census survey found
that their population was equal to _ and on its way to surpassing _
that of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of population, (San Francisco) has a majority of
minorities,'' he said. ``But in terms of voters, it's
overwhelmingly white.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco State University political scientist Rich DeLeon
said citizenship issues and cultural barriers might keep San
Francisco's Asian community from being able to fully exercise its
political voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the sleeping giant has awakened,'' he said. ``That
may be true, but it's not out of bed yet. Translating those big
(population) numbers into political clout can be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The census bureau's 1999 American Community Survey provides a
preview of the 2000 census, which won't be tabulated until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It was tested last year in 21 places around the United States,
including San Francisco, as an annual study that could eventually
replace the census long form.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimated that in 1999 the number of people in San
Francisco who considered themselves to be either fully or partly
Asian was virtually equal to those who considered themselves to be
``white only'' _ without Hispanic or mixed-race backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   And the Asian population in San Francisco has been growing
steadily every year, with an influx of new immigrants and a large
number of births. Meanwhile, the white population shrank in the
1990s and now is believed to be stable.
</P>
<P>
   So Asians are on track to quickly outnumber whites for the first
time, demographers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian population is growing rapidly,'' said DeLeon, who
noted that if Pacific Islanders are counted, people with Asian
heritage already composed the largest group in San Francisco. ``As
we speak, the Asian-Pacific Islander population has outnumbered the
white population in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco schools have been noticing this trend for a
long time. Asian and Pacific Islanders make up 42 percent of the
district's student enrollment, while whites constitute only 12
percent, according to data from the California Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Asians in San Francisco are also having more children. Last
year, there were 2,800 children born to Asian-Pacific Islander
families in San Francisco and 2,600 born to whites, according to
state records.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the Chinese population has become the middle class
of San Francisco,'' said Lee, a Chinese American raised in San
Francisco. ``They're the ones having children. They're getting
together to buy houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lee and other community leaders lament Asians' relative lack
of political power. Lee said some new immigrants cannot vote
because they are not U.S. citizens, but many qualified voters in
the Asian community simply choose not to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, there is a cultural barrier to voter
participation,'' he said. ``In some countries, like China, citizens
were actively discouraged from voting.''

ANTHEM LEAVES RUSSIAN ATHLETES AT A LOSS FOR WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Oh, say, can't you sing the Russian national anthem?
</P>
<P>
   That question could come to mind at the sight of tight-lipped
Russian athletes on the winner's pedestal at the upcoming Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Russian athletes hope to win more than 30 golds in Sydney. But,
as they are painfully aware, they cannot sing along to Mikhail
Glinka's ``Patriotic Song,'' because there are no words.
</P>
<P>
   And not because no one has tried to write them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing quite so eloquently captures post-Communist
Russia's struggle to find an identity as the inability to find
words to go with Glinka's 1833 composition, which former president
Boris N. Yeltsin decreed the national anthem after the collapse of
the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, composers, poets, blue-ribbon commissions, and even
a soccer coach have submitted a total of 500 proposed texts, but no
one has been able to agree on a final version. Glinka's music has
been criticized by specialists who say it is impossible to
remember, hard to write words for, and possibly not Glinka at all,
but a rip-off of a 17th-century Polish Catholic hymn. Kremlin
musicologists are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament, which until recently was dominated by Communists,
has refused to approve even Glinka's music, just as it rejected the
other Czarist-era symbols Yeltsin chose for the new Russia _ the
white, blue, and red tricolor as Russia's flag and the
double-headed golden eagle to replace the Soviet hammer and sickle
as the state symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Parliament has given preliminary approval for the
Soviet hymn commissioned by Josef Stalin in 1943, popularly known
by its opening phrase, ``Indivisible Union'' _ with new words, of
course, that someone would have to write.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Russia's Olympic athletes with the same wordless
anthem for the Sydney games that the winners of 26 gold medals had
to hum in Atlanta. This is only marginally better than standing on
the pedestal listening tight-lipped to Beethoven, which gold
medalists from former Soviet countries did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're up there on the pedestal, you're full of
emotion,'' said runner Natalya Nazarova, a member of Russia's
four-by-400 relay team, which has gold-medal ambitions. ``If we had
words to sing, that would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   To speed the process up, players of the Spartak soccer club,
some of whom also play on Russia's national team, in July sent
President Vladimir Putin a letter asking him to give them something
inspiring to sing before international matches. The team told Putin
their coach had suggested words for the work.
</P>
<P>
   But the request went unanswered, partly because this country has
so many more important things to do, but also because responsibilty
for writing words to the anthem seems to have been lost in the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is now dominated
by a pro-Putin party, one of whose leaders is wrestler Alexander
Karelin, who is a favorite to win gold in Sydney, and who
presumably would like to have something to sing when he does. But
an aide said Karelin was too busy training to worry about anthems
now. Another Duma spokesman said it was the government's business
to propose words.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Rozhkov, chairman of Russia's state committee on sports,
said it was a matter for the Culture Ministry. A Culture Ministry
spokesman passed the buck on to Putin's administration. And there,
no one can find the person who is responsible for anthem-writing.
</P>
<P>
   Various unconfirmed press reports, meanwhile, have indicated
that Putin also prefers giving new words to the old, Soviet
national anthem. Rozhkov thinks that would be a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all remember the Soviet anthem of course,'' he told
reporters last week. ``We remember the feeling, and we miss it. If
some words were apprvoed we would all be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But who can find the proper words, if neither Yevgeny
Yevtushenko, one of Russia's best-known poets, nor a commission
that includes the author of ``Indivisible Union,'' have been able
to?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that question misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   The words to national anthems, as Americans know, are not
necessarily written by a culture's greatest poets. Nor do they need
to convey only universal ideals shared by all a nation's citizens
at all times _ surely, not everyone in France is always thinking
about ways to fill the furrows of our fields with the impure blood
of invaders.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have to somehow encapsule some event, some feeling,
some sense of nationhood, something patriots can rally around for
generations to come. And that has been missing in Russia the past
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that could become such an event has been overshadowed
by something worse. Take the August, 1991 coup attempt by Soviet
hardliners, which ended in a victory for Yeltsin, who had made a
brave stand in the Russian parliament building. Down came the red
banner of the Soviet Union, up went the Russian tricolor, as the
symbol of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, Yeltsin sent tanks to the same parliament
building to blast away at legislators who were resisting his
(unconstitutional) order to disband. What could anyone write about
that?
</P>
<P>
   Any progress towards turning the old Soviet system into a sleak,
new market has been overshadowed by the fact that most of the
country is poorer, and the few people who have become really rich
have preferred offshore havens to investing at home.
</P>
<P>
   And while the perceived success of last year's offensive against
separatists in Chechnya seemed to many Russians a turning point,
that enthusiasm has dimmed as the second campaign against the
rebels has turned into the same costly quagmire that the 1994-1996
war was.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say, why even bother, when times are so hard? And
anyway, what is so important about words?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy to come up with the words of the national
anthem,'' said Georgy Vilinbakh, chairman of Russia's State Herald
Council, said in an interview published here last week. ``The main
thing is not the words, but the music. . . . There's nothing
terrible about a government with no words in its national anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. Take Spain, a perfectly stable, Western democracy,
whose national anthem has no words.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only Russia could decide about the authenticity of that
Glinka.

TAKING STOCK OF MOUNT CARMEL, SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a recent visit to Waco, I decided to drive by Mount
Carmel, the place where David Koresh and about 80 of his Branch
Davidian followers died in their flaming compound seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophe that unfolded before our eyes on television
intruded on our minds again this summer when special counsel John
C. Danforth issued a preliminary report of an investigation saying
that the Davidians themselves, not the federal government, set the
fire that destroyed the sprawling makeshift religious complex.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning blame for the fire, of course, does not reduce the
magnitude of the tragedy in which innocent children perished,
supposedly in the name of religion. Now the 77 acres, which
surviving Branch Davidians still see as holy ground, are a place of
curiosity. And also a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it remains a battleground of sorts. Three different groups
of Davidians are vying for the rights to the property.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty granite markers with names of all known to have died in
the fire are near the property's center. Each one is marked by a
flowering crape myrtle. One of the markers reads ``David Koresh _
April 19, 1993 _ Age 33.''
</P>
<P>
   A handsome new Branch Davidian church built by volunteers and
opened in April now stands near the memorials to the dead. A
granite plaque in front of the church thanks ``benefactors who have
faithfully answered the quiet call to rebuild upon the ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   An eerie stagnant lake on the land symbolized to me the dark
tragedy that unfolded there. Also, there are two burnt-out buses,
one of Koresh's scorched motorcycles and a green Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   Near the church is a granite stone memorializing four federal
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officers who were killed as they
tried to arrest Koresh at the Branch Davidian compound on Feb. 28,
1993. Six Davidians also died that day.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived on the Branch Davidian Sabbath, and a church service
led by those who still see Koresh as an earthly messiah was going
on in a mobile home near the entrance. About five cars were parked
outside. I didn't intrude.
</P>
<P>
   That group is led by Clive Doyle, a survivor of the fire, his
mother, Edna Doyle, and Sheila Martin.
</P>
<P>
   A rival Davidian, Amo Bishop Roden, welcomed visitors to the
property from a spot near the entrance as she has done for years.
Roden claims the right to the property because she was married, by
contract she says, to the late George Roden, whose parents, Lois
and Ben Roden, followed teachings of V.T. Houteff and created the
group known as Branch Davidians in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   She heartily disagrees with those who believe Koresh was a
prophet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still see David Koresh as a holy man of God,'' she said.
``If they are sincere, I think they are misguided. I thought he was
a very bad man.''
</P>
<P>
   Another group claiming the right to the property is led by
Charlie Pace, who also is not a follower of Koresh, but who is an
outspoken opponent to Amo Bishop Roden's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Pace, a construction worker, lives in a mobile home on the east
end of Mount Carmel. He was a part of the Branch Davidians during
the Roden era. But his loyalty extends to Lois and Ben Roden, the
early leaders of the Branch Davidians. He claims that their son,
George Roden, deserted the movement.
</P>
<P>
   All three groups consider the property hallowed ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is holy ground, made even holier by what happened here,''
said Pace.
</P>
<P>
   Pace said he believes Koresh was a false prophet. But he
believes he had an important role in Bible prophecy and that his
life and death were predicted by Scriptures. He says Koresh and his
followers' violent end is referred to in Ezekiel 9:1-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Scripture declares: ``Cause them that have charge over the
city to draw near, even every man with a destroying weapon in his
hand. And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate,
which lieth toward the north, and every man with a slaughter weapon
in his hand. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Pace had held his own separate Sabbath Day worship
service at Mount Carmel. His group has its own church in a concrete
block building marked with a sign, ``The Branch. Congregation of
the Lord (YHVH) Our Righteousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace, Amo Roden, the Doyles, Sheila Martin and other Branch
Davidians around the world disagree on many things. But all have
complicated end-of-the-world theology. All believe that God will
someday return and establish the kingdom of heaven on earth.
</P>
<P>
   And many believe that a peaceful prairie in the heart of Central
Texas _ the holy ground of Mount Carmel _ will be the center of
that heavenly kingdom.

ANTHEM LEAVES RUSSIAN ATHLETES AT A LOSS FOR WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Oh, say, can't you sing the Russian national anthem?
</P>
<P>
   That question could come to mind at the sight of tight-lipped
Russian athletes on the winner's pedestal at the upcoming Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Russian athletes hope to win more than 30 golds in Sydney. But,
as they are painfully aware, they cannot sing along to Mikhail
Glinka's ``Patriotic Song,'' because there are no words.
</P>
<P>
   And not because no one has tried to write them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing quite so eloquently captures post-Communist
Russia's struggle to find an identity as the inability to find
words to go with Glinka's 1833 composition, which former president
Boris N. Yeltsin decreed the national anthem after the collapse of
the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, composers, poets, blue-ribbon commissions, and even
a soccer coach have submitted a total of 500 proposed texts, but no
one has been able to agree on a final version. Glinka's music has
been criticized by specialists who say it is impossible to
remember, hard to write words for, and possibly not Glinka at all,
but a rip-off of a 17th-century Polish Catholic hymn. Kremlin
musicologists are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament, which until recently was dominated by Communists,
has refused to approve even Glinka's music, just as it rejected the
other Czarist-era symbols Yeltsin chose for the new Russia _ the
white, blue, and red tricolor as Russia's flag and the
double-headed golden eagle to replace the Soviet hammer and sickle
as the state symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Parliament has given preliminary approval for the
Soviet hymn commissioned by Josef Stalin in 1943, popularly known
by its opening phrase, ``Indivisible Union'' _ with new words, of
course, that someone would have to write.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Russia's Olympic athletes with the same wordless
anthem for the Sydney games that the winners of 26 gold medals had
to hum in Atlanta. This is only marginally better than standing on
the pedestal listening tight-lipped to Beethoven, which gold
medalists from former Soviet countries did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're up there on the pedestal, you're full of
emotion,'' said runner Natalya Nazarova, a member of Russia's
four-by-400 relay team, which has gold-medal ambitions. ``If we had
words to sing, that would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   To speed the process up, players of the Spartak soccer club,
some of whom also play on Russia's national team, in July sent
President Vladimir Putin a letter asking him to give them something
inspiring to sing before international matches. The team told Putin
their coach had suggested words for the work.
</P>
<P>
   But the request went unanswered, partly because this country has
so many more important things to do, but also because responsibilty
for writing words to the anthem seems to have been lost in the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is now dominated
by a pro-Putin party, one of whose leaders is wrestler Alexander
Karelin, who is a favorite to win gold in Sydney, and who
presumably would like to have something to sing when he does. But
an aide said Karelin was too busy training to worry about anthems
now. Another Duma spokesman said it was the government's business
to propose words.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Rozhkov, chairman of Russia's state committee on sports,
said it was a matter for the Culture Ministry. A Culture Ministry
spokesman passed the buck on to Putin's administration. And there,
no one can find the person who is responsible for anthem-writing.
</P>
<P>
   Various unconfirmed press reports, meanwhile, have indicated
that Putin also prefers giving new words to the old, Soviet
national anthem. Rozhkov thinks that would be a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all remember the Soviet anthem of course,'' he told
reporters last week. ``We remember the feeling, and we miss it. If
some words were apprvoed we would all be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But who can find the proper words, if neither Yevgeny
Yevtushenko, one of Russia's best-known poets, nor a commission
that includes the author of ``Indivisible Union,'' have been able
to?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that question misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   The words to national anthems, as Americans know, are not
necessarily written by a culture's greatest poets. Nor do they need
to convey only universal ideals shared by all a nation's citizens
at all times _ surely, not everyone in France is always thinking
about ways to fill the furrows of our fields with the impure blood
of invaders.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have to somehow encapsule some event, some feeling,
some sense of nationhood, something patriots can rally around for
generations to come. And that has been missing in Russia the past
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that could become such an event has been overshadowed
by something worse. Take the August, 1991 coup attempt by Soviet
hardliners, which ended in a victory for Yeltsin, who had made a
brave stand in the Russian parliament building. Down came the red
banner of the Soviet Union, up went the Russian tricolor, as the
symbol of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, Yeltsin sent tanks to the same parliament
building to blast away at legislators who were resisting his
(unconstitutional) order to disband. What could anyone write about
that?
</P>
<P>
   Any progress towards turning the old Soviet system into a sleak,
new market has been overshadowed by the fact that most of the
country is poorer, and the few people who have become really rich
have preferred offshore havens to investing at home.
</P>
<P>
   And while the perceived success of last year's offensive against
separatists in Chechnya seemed to many Russians a turning point,
that enthusiasm has dimmed as the second campaign against the
rebels has turned into the same costly quagmire that the 1994-1996
war was.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say, why even bother, when times are so hard? And
anyway, what is so important about words?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy to come up with the words of the national
anthem,'' said Georgy Vilinbakh, chairman of Russia's State Herald
Council, said in an interview published here last week. ``The main
thing is not the words, but the music. . . . There's nothing
terrible about a government with no words in its national anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. Take Spain, a perfectly stable, Western democracy,
whose national anthem has no words.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only Russia could decide about the authenticity of that
Glinka.

LOUIS THE FIRST: BOXED SET REMINDS JAZZ FANS WHY ARMSTRONG WAS
KING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis Armstrong is defined in the memories of many by two songs
that really don't represent his talents all that well.
</P>
<P>
   Born 100 years ago this past July 4 (or so the story goes; his
birthday has also been listed as Aug. 4, 1901), Armstrong always
will be linked in the public consciousness to two novelty songs,
``What a Wonderful World'' and ``Hello Dolly,'' done when he was
far past his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to such sentimental numbers, Armstrong was widely _ and
somewhat accurately _ seen in his later years as a gravel-voiced
relic of a previous age, his signature New Orleans swing/Dixieland
sound long before supplanted by everyone from Charlie Parker to
Miles Davis to John Coltrane. His mugging and smiling were almost
embarrassing, maybe even a bit Uncle Tomish, to youngbloods who had
embraced the cool _ almost cold _ elegance personified by Davis
turning his back on his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was simply the old man with the hanky and the big
smile and the quaint sound. Dixieland? Who the heck still listened
to Dixieland?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years after his death, the world does. The music of
Louis Armstrong is providing one of the best boxed sets of the
year, and one of the very best ever for fans of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The four-CD, 89-cut ``The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven
Recordings'' (Sony//Columbia, $54.97) brings together all of the
seminal recordings Armstrong and his bands cut between 1925 and
1929 in a well-annotated package that includes a wealth of
information and vintage photos.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because everything old becomes new again. Maybe it's
because we've been primed for this set by fellow New Orleans native
Wynton Marsalis, who's championed older forms of jazz. Whatever the
case, this music sounds as fun, sweet-natured and marvelous now as
it did back in the day when Armstrong and his band were _ along
with Duke Ellington _ defining jazz in its first great era.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans always has been a great melting pot of sounds and
cultures, and thus right from the start Armstrong's music was an
inventive stew of the Dixieland and blues that were often heard in
the city's many rough-and-tumble dance halls.
</P>
<P>
   And Armstrong was highly adept at transferring the feel of a
live performance to wax. He'd call out to different musicians
before their solos, do give-and-take vocals with band members,
throw in asides such as ``Aw, hear me talkin' to ya!,'' and mix
funny song-stories such as ``Sugar Foot Strut'' or sentimental
ballads alongside instrumental showcases such as ``West End
Blues.'' He was, first and foremost, an entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, like Ellington, Armstrong understood (and this is
surprisingly rare) that a bandleader/lead singer can only look
better when he surrounds himself with truly great players. And you
just don't get any better than those who would earn their
reputations in his band, among them trombonist Kid Ory and
clarinetist Johnny Dodds.
</P>
<P>
   His band would, at different times, include pianist Earl
``Fatha'' Hines, banjoist Johnny St. Cyr,
arranger/multi-instrumentalist/songwriter Don Redman, drummer
Warren ``Baby'' Dodds, trombonist Jack Teagarden and guitarists
Eddie Lang and Lonnie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A finer collection of American musicians in the 1920s is
impossible to imagine _ and that includes Ellington's band, which
boasted players such as Cootie Williams and Johnny Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   Taken altogether, then, Armstrong's work of this period was as
influential as Duke's, as anybody's. Armstrong's vocal style easily
can be heard in the recordings of both blueswoman supreme Bessie
Smith (with whom he recorded) and jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald, and
his inventive trumpet solos are a virtual textbook of unexpected
triplets, economy and liveliness.
</P>
<P>
   Here we had the complete package: A man of astonishing
instrumental finesse _ check his introduction to ``West End Blues''
_ who could make music both ribald and achingly sentimental, all in
the same breath. His blues, as heard on ``St. James Infirmary,''
had depth. His ballads, such as ``I Can't Give You Anything But
Love,'' are lovely. His funny, or novelty, songs were sometimes a
bit ribald but never dirty, and his band's instrumental attack was
second to none.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his strengths, Armstrong was not particularly adept
at change. His music remained resolutely stuck in the '20s, and in
his later years would suffer for it. He kept busy to the end,
recording with big bands and smaller groups, but essentially he was
recycling. ``Dolly'' and ``World'' were of a piece with the vocal
numbers he'd done way back when, except not as good.
</P>
<P>
   Do yourself a favor. Forget that stuff. Go back to his golden
days, when he and his bands were defining jazz in its formative
stages. What you'll find is a treasure trove. Armstrong was dubbed
``King Louis'' because he was an absolute titan of his era. As this
box set shows, he might still hold the title now.

REAL SURVIVOR CHALLENGES AREN'T TAPED FOR TV
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I watched only one episode of ``Survivor,'' the much-ballyhooed
television series about a bunch a people stranded on a desert
island for a month, or however long they were there. I really don't
even care enough to look it up.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I felt compelled to watch the final episode when I
stopped to get my morning cup of coffee at the local convenience
store. That's when I noticed that the program had managed to make
the headlines of the three daily newspapers on the stand by the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, I thought, this is really big stuff. I guess I need to
tune in and see what all the hoopla is about.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I understood the basic objective.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows I had seen enough commercials, previews and
articles about it. But the idea of taking a bunch of yuppies to an
island and following them around with cameras while they
back-stabbed each other with piercing words just didn't appeal to
me. I have better stories than that in my diary.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been different if they had mounted a bunch of
cameras in the trees and actually just left the people there until
they surrendered to the elements, one by one, begging to be
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   However, while I found the final episode quite entertaining, it
was hardly a contest to determine the survival of the fittest mind
and body. The craftiest mind? Perhaps. Darwinism in the jungle?
Definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   So in the ensuing week, I have been trying to think of a contest
that would really and truly test the contestants' personal
preservation skills. How about this:
</P>
<P>
   Let's find a young boy in elementary school, say the fourth or
fifth grade. Why don't we give him an unwed mother, three younger
siblings and an unknown father? Have him live in the inner city,
surrounded by gangs and drugs. Send him to a school where he has to
share textbooks because there aren't enough to go around. Even more
challenging, what if there aren't enough teachers, so the
classrooms are crowded? Let's put up a nice government-funded
recreation center in the neighborhood, even though walking down the
street in this community is as safe as walking in a mine field.
</P>
<P>
   The objective for our young contestant is to become an
investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to graduate from high school without becoming a
member of a gang or getting killed by a stray bullet. As he grows,
he also has to control his raging hormones so he doesn't become a
teen-aged parent like so many of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides going to school, he has to work to help his mother
support the family because her minimum wage job covers only half of
their bills. The temptation to deal drugs for easy money is strong,
but our young contestant has to resist because if he succumbs, he
loses the game.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, against insurmountable odds and with few, if any, role
models, this little boy has to get accepted into college and earn a
degree while working a full-time job. You know his grants or
scholarship won't cover all his expenses, and he's still got his
mother and siblings to think about.
</P>
<P>
   Now that, my friend, is a true test for a survivor. But who
would want to watch such a difficult struggle on prime-time
television? No, I dare say that this program would be canceled
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this scenario is being continuously played out on stages
across America whether we're watching or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' was entertainment: part comedy, part drama and part
mystery. The lives of this boy and so many like him are a tragedy.
The chances of anyone not surviving on that island were extremely
slim.
</P>
<P>
   As slim as the chances of this boy becoming an investment
banker, I suppose.

&HT;     WINE COUNTRY MAKES QUICK RECOVERY AFTER QUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNY STRASBURG and ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ The earthquake that struck Northern California's
famed Wine Country last weekend could not have happened at a more
hectic, vulnerable time.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded with Labor Day tourists and migrant farm workers, its
restaurants and spas booked and fermenting tanks filling up with
the spoils of harvest, the wine-saturated Napa Valley landscape was
ripe for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tourists seemed to stick to their plans, despite initial
fears from Sunday's earthquake and the threat of aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   For the region's celebrated vintners, the damage could have been
much worse: Some awoke to the early-morning tremors and imagined
broken glass, shattered oak barrels and millions of dollars of wine
soaking their cellar and tasting-room floors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they arrived at their wineries to find a few broken
glasses here, a toppled bottle of Sauvignon there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a total of $36. I'm very lucky. Very lucky,'' said Andy
Gridley, sales manager at the Napa Wine Co., where 65 Napa wineries
make their wine.
</P>
<P>
   Gridley lives on Howell Mountain, about 10 miles north of the
winery, and slept through the quake. When he heard about it in the
morning, he immediately pictured his tasting room and its 2,700
racked bottles as a mess of broken glass and wasted liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Only two bottles of wine broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-six bucks,'' Gridley sighed. ``I envisioned it could be
thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frank-Rombauer Larkmead Cellars in Calistoga, which in June
lost an estimated 85,000 cases of wine in a devastating fire,
suffered no earthquake damage, said Alan Cannon, a retail salesman.
Neither did the company's other sites in St. Helena and Napa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it woke a few of us up; that was it,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar relief settled upon Domaine Chandon Winery, south of
Yountville and much closer to the epicenter of the 5.2-magnitude
quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in harvest. All our tanks are full with fermenting wine,
and nothing broke,'' Susan Azevedo, an exhausted but relieved wine
educator, marveled Sunday afternoon as visitors crowded the Domaine
Chandon tasting room, creating just the kind of scene expected on
Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists pour about $650 million into the Napa Valley every
year, according to the Napa Valley Conference and Visitors Bureau.
Labor Day weekend is one of the busiest of the year, when the
aromas of harvest attract thousands of visitors.

the two sides remain both closer to and further than ever from a

proposed a fundamental overhaul of Medicare, giving elderly people
the option to purchase a prescription drug benefit and offering
subsidies for lower income people to buy private health insurance.
Bush unveiled his Medicare plan after weeks of pressure from Vice
President Al Gore who considers health care one of his strongest
issues and who has been hammering his rival for avoiding specifics.
In doing so Bush took a sharply different approach from Gore who
would dedicate more money to the current Medicare system and then
add a new government prescription drug benefit on top of it. By

   HURON, Calif. _ They are among the oldest cultivated foods on
earth, the stuff of Greek myths, a prized ingredient of the
pharaohs' breads, a staple of Biblical feasts. They are believed to
have originated in China and Central Asia, and their pinkish white
blossoms and graceful branches call to mind the cherry trees whose
botanical family they share. Transported to the Mediterranean by
the traders of the Silk Road, they have been an important commodity
since the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the flat, hot, rich farmlands of California's
Central Valley, almonds are nothing so much as big business. The
state's 6,000 growers produce more than 600 million pounds a year,
more than 70 percent of the world's supply and virtually 100
percent of domestic production. Almonds far outpace wine, oranges,
apples and raisins as the United States' top horticultural export,
worth close to $800 million annually. Eat marzipan in Germany or
almonds salted in the shell like ballpark peanuts in India or
China, and odds are high the nuts came from California.
</P>
<P>
   These late summer weeks are crunch time in the long endless
groves. The fruit has ripened, its outer gray-greenish hull has
cracked open to reveal a pale, crackly perforated inner shell,
inside which a jewel is nestled: the moistly crunchy, brown-skinned
nut itself. The harvest, from early August to Halloween, is a
7-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day affair, as growers rush to get their
crop hulled and shelled, packed and shipped before the fall rains
come and make the groves a soggy mess.
</P>
<P>
   The groves are vast, more like factories than farms, stretching
up the spine of the state for 400 miles. Though the landscape is
broken by the occasional cottonwood tree, it is not a place of
roadside stands. Here the tomatoes lie in great heaps waiting to be
processed into paste, and cotton grows in endless seas. There are
no mom-and-pop shops with bags of almonds, the way one finds paper
sacks of boiled peanuts in Georgia. Even a family farm, like Chris
Woolf's, is an industrial sort of operation. The tidy farm
lunchroom, a small building with whitewashed walls, Mexican tile
floors and Fiestaware plates, does not feature almonds on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, workers walked the groves tapping trees with tall
poles to shake the fruit to the ground. Now an armada of
diesel-powered mechanical shaking machines (one leading model is
the ``Shock Wave Shaker'') grip trees with rubber-coated hydraulic
pincers, creating custom-made mini-earthquakes of trembling trunks
and branches and hailstorms of falling nuts up and down the orchard
rows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you compare that to?'' asked Stacey Kollmeyer, the
communications manager of the Almond Board of California and a
third-generation almond hand. The ground rumbled and a tornado of
dust rose from a shaking Sonora almond tree on the Woolfs' farm
here the other day. ``It's like the tree's being electrocuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolf, 38, is the very model of a modern major almond grower,
producing something on the order of 6 million pounds of nut meat a
year on a couple of thousand acres of family owned and leased land
about an hour southwest of Fresno, just off Interstate 5. His
family has been farming almonds (and cotton, tomatoes, pistachios,
garlic, onions and oranges) since 1973, and now has a full,
vertically integrated operation, starting with an almond nursery of
some 300,000 seedlings and ending with a processing plant (owned in
partnership with the Harris cattle ranching family) that hulls,
shells and ships about 20 million pounds a year, most of it for
direct overseas export.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so important not to have a breakdown at this time of
year,'' Woolf said as he checked in with Jose Jimenez, a worker
operating a new $95,000 shaker, one of six in the Woolf family
fleet, from inside its compact, air-conditioned cab.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, with a
degree in history, Woolf also has an M.B.A. in agribusiness from
the University of Santa Clara, and is what's known in the trade as
a handler, one of about 100 growers officially responsible for
recording the weight and quality of growers' almonds, collecting
assessments for the Almond Board; his farm also serves as a site
where the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors assess the
crop. He is also in the middle of a one-year term as chairman of
the Almond Board, created in 1950 to help market almonds.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Woolf is squarely astride what has amounted to an
explosion in the California almond crop. Almonds were first brought
to the state in the 18th century, by the Franciscan padres who
founded the chain of coastal missions, but the trees suffered in
the misty, moist conditions near the Pacific, and only a hundred
later were successfully planted inland.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Valley has been prime almond terrain for most of the
20th century, but the crop has quadrupled over the last 30 years as
efficient production, ideal growing conditions, economies of scale
and growing demand for almonds in everything from breakfast cereal
to specialty oils have given the state a virtual corner on the
world market, with countries like Spain, Italy and Greece together
producing not even a third of California's yield.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Gingrass, the chef at Hawthorne Lane in San Francisco, uses
almonds year-round, and in ways that are not always obvious. In a
risotto with dried red chilies and goat cheese, she chops up
almonds and cooks them with the rice so they attain a similar
texture as the grains and, she added, they round out the flavor and
heat of the chilies. She also uses them to thicken chicken soup,
pureeing the almonds with the broth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hazelnuts are so strong, pine nuts are unpredictable _ you
don't know if you're going to get a bad one, and they're really
fatty,'' she said. ``Almonds are subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almonds, long touted in culinary lore as a hedge against
intoxication if eaten with wine, have also benefited from a recent
wave of nutritional and dietary revisionism. Like all nuts, they
are high in fat, but mostly in mono-unsaturated fat, the kind that
predominates in canola and olive oils and avocados, and is
celebrated for its ability to lower harmful cholesterol. Several
current diets, like the Zone, by Barry Sears, celebrate almonds for
their satiating qualities and their ability to help satisfy
cravings for less healthy fats.
</P>
<P>
   Almonds contain beneficial calcium, potassium and magnesium, all
protections against high blood pressure, and are also potent
sources of anti-oxidants, intended to keep their fats from turning
rancid but a source of vitamin E for humans. An ounce of almonds,
about 24 whole nuts, has 164 calories.
</P>
<P>
   An almond tree in commercial production today begins with a
hardy root stock grown from a peach pit (another botanical
relative), onto which a more delicate almond cutting is grafted.
Trees can begin producing nuts in about five years (two or three
years shorter than pistachios) and reach peak productivity at about
10 years, tapering off to almost nothing by about age 25. The
annual production cycle _ and forecast of the year's yield _ begins
romantically around Valentine's Day with the bloom, when orchards
are transformed into spectacular oceans of pale pink blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Because almonds are not self-pollinating, different varieties
are planted in alternating rows and more than 1 million beehives
are brought by commercial beekeepers into the state each winter to
pollinate trees. It is a fraught time, and a whole year's crop
depends on the vagaries of wind and weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bees won't fly if it rains,'' Woolf said, talking of this
year's spotty bloom, which is expected to produce a crop about 25
percent below last year's record yield. ``They won't fly if it's
under 54 degrees. We knew we'd have a lower crop.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the nuts have been shaken to the ground, another set of
machines, a bit like street sweepers, blow and rake them into neat
rows between the trees, and still others with whirling
rubber-toothed paddles come and pick them up into a wagon. They are
taken to the Harris-Woolf processing plant nearby and piled in like
batches, covered with plastic sheeting and fumigated.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the hulling and shelling, which is the province of
Dean Nelson, a former banker from Arizona who used to handle the
Woolf family account and decided a few years ago to return to his
roots as a Utah farm boy by coming to run the almond plant. It's a
spiffy operation, worthy of Rube Goldberg, in which the almonds
move along a series of elevators and conveyors, under rollers and
over shaking perforated trays with a series of successively finer
holes. Nothing (except dust) gets wasted. First the hulls are
cracked off completely and piled in giant mounds to be hauled off
as a feed supplement for dairy cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Then the brittle, almost papery inner shells are cracked and
separated, in part using air blasts and suction. They become
livestock bedding. Finally, the brown nuts fall through a series of
slots to be sized, graded, weighed and, ultimately, packed for
shipment in 2,000-pound wood containers or 50-pound cardboard
boxes. The plant's annual electric bill is about $130,000, most of
it racked up in the hundred days of harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, as Nelson puts it: ``Every time you move an
almond, you take a chance of chipping it up.'' The chipped ones
fetch less at market, and go for products from candy bars to
blanched almonds for baking and cooking. The unscarred nuts are
reserved for snacking and fancy use, with the most popular variety
_ _ the nonpareil, the fat, perfectly shaped nut in a can of smoked
almonds or atop a fine pastry _ accounting for nearly 40 percent of
California's total production.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nuts hulled at Harris-Woolf are bound for shipment
to Blue Diamond, the giant cooperative that handles about 35
percent of all the state's production and is the single largest
processor. Most are sent directly to brokers for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The big growth market at the moment is China, which now accounts
of 25 percent of U.S. export sales. In the 1998-99 crop year, China
accounted for just 8.2 million pounds and now buys more than 25
million pounds a year. So the almond growers are thrilled at the
prospect of lower tariffs once China enters the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf may sell globally, but he still grows locally, something
he made clear as he walked a row of ripening trees the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' he said, ``but a lot of farming is
just checking. The best sign of management is seeing the owner's
footprints in the dirt.'' &QL;

   ALMOND-AND-HAZELNUT-CHIP MACAROONS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Desserts: Mediterranean Flavors, California
Style,'' &QL; 
by Cindy Mushet (Scribner, 2000)  &QL; 
Time: 1 hour  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup whole hazelnuts, shelled
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole natural almonds, shelled
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons apricot jam
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced lemon zest.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spread hazelnuts across baking
sheet and bake until skins are lightly browned, about 5 minutes; do
not turn off oven. Roll nuts in a clean kitchen towel. Pressing
lightly on towel, roll back and forth to loosen skins of nuts.
Transfer skinned nuts to a food processor. Chop until nuts are the
size of chocolate chips. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Spread almonds cross a baking sheet and bake until lightly
browned, about 5 minutes; remove from heat. Reduce oven to 350
degrees. Allow nuts to cool, and place in bowl of a food processor.
Add sugar, and process until almonds are very finely ground, 30 to
40 seconds. Add 2 egg whites, jam and lemon zest. Pulse until
blended; mixture should be thick and tacky when pressed with a
fingertip. If dry, add a teaspoon of remaining egg white, and
pulse; repeat if necessary to reach desired consistency.
</P>
<P>
   3. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Add hazelnuts, and knead by
hand until blended. Lightly wet hands to prevent sticking. Divide
dough in half, then divide each half into eight pieces, for a total
of 16 pieces. Shape pieces into balls and place eight balls on each
of two parchment-lined baking sheets.
</P>
<P>
   4. Position oven racks in top and center thirds of oven. Bake
macaroons until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, reversing baking
sheets from front to back and top to bottom halfway through cooking
time. Store for up to one week in an airtight container, or freeze
for up to one month.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: Sixteen 3-inch macaroons.

   HYDE PARK, N.Y. _ On a road with suburban homes, swimming pools
and minivans, a 12,000-year-old mastodon has turned a quiet
backyard pond into a pit of scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after Larry Lozier, 40, decided to dredge and
deepen the pond in his backyard on Haviland Road here, he came upon
what looked like a large muddy log. Under the mud, however, Lozier
discovered a knobby joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh my God, there is something really unusual
here,''' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a piece of an unusually well-preserved
mastodon skeleton, which is attracting the attention of scientists
from around the country to a backyard in Dutchess County.
</P>
<P>
   But back on that July day, all Lozier knew was that the bone was
heavy, brownish-red and more than 3 feet long. Maybe it was just a
cow or horse bone, he told himself, something from a Clydesdale,
maybe. So he called a neighbor who is a horsewoman, thinking she
might know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry,'' she said, ``that's no Clydesdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Lozier began telephoning local colleges, trying to find someone
who might come over to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   No luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believed me,'' he said. ``They thought some guy from
Hyde Park found a cow bone and thinks it's a dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   For days, he drove around with what turned out to be the top
part of a mastodon's leg in the back of his pickup truck. He took
it to a barbecue where friends stood around and gawked. He took it
to work at the sheet metal shop he owns with his brother, Tom. From
there, he called Dr. Christopher R. Lindner, the archaeologist in
residence at Bard College in nearby Annandale-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded likely to me that they really had found
something,'' Lindner said. ``So I drove over, had a look at it, and
sure enough, it did seem like a leg bone of a large, extinct
elephant. So I went back to the college and began to call people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the tidy backyard of the nearly four-acre property
where Lozier has lived all his life has been torn apart. Pumps run
all day to drain the pond, where Lozier fished and skated as a boy,
so that scientists and volunteers can crawl through the mud,
looking for more mastodon bones.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, though, it was still just family and friends turning
up a piece of tusk here, a bit of shoulder blade there. The
Loziers, Larry and Sheryl, were eager to share the news of their
discovery with neighbors, and began toting the bones around in the
red wagon of their 6-year-old daughter, Laura. They even took them
to Brownie meetings, the local middle school and the Dutchess
County Fair.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, things took a more professional turn when
scientists from the Paleontological Research Institution in Ithaca,
set up camp. On Aug. 21, their first day of digging, Elizabeth
Humbert, 26, the assistant to the director of the institution,
found the mastodon's pelvis and lower vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it with the shovel and could tell a difference right
away,'' she said. ``So then I started digging with my hands, and
then when I couldn't reach down any further into the mud and I
could still feel it, we knew this thing was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, at the institution's request, Wayne Mallen,
who usually digs pits for septic tanks, brought his backhoe over
and found the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this work, I've found lots of things _ chicken bones,
cow bones, zillions of bottles _ but nothing prehistoric,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lozier says he now has about 80 or 90 muddy mastodon bones, some
of them stowed in Ziploc bags. All the bones are being stored in
his garage as the digging continues. Eventually, the scientists
expect to have a nearly complete skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   College and high school students come by every day to help with
the digging while Lozier hands out beer and soda to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible preservation,'' said Dr. Warren D. Allmon,
director of the institution, standing knee deep in the thick,
smelly mud. He said he planned to make the Hyde Park bones, donated
by Lozier, a major exhibit in the institution's soon-to-open museum
in Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
   Allmon usually deals with extinct mollusks, so the mastodon is
an eye-opener, even for him. ``Once you're down there in the mud
with it, it's just transcendent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lozier's neighbors are also fascinated by the creature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come over here every single day to check it out,'' said Gene
Toohey, who lives across the street. ``It's great. I've got the
same gray mud at my house. Maybe I got one of these in my backyard,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said they believed that the Loziers' pond was
created 18,000 years ago as the last Ice Age was ending and that
the mastodon, a 35-year-old male about 9 feet tall at the shoulder,
died 12,000 years ago. It might have become stuck in the mud. It
might have been butchered by the first humans in the Hudson Valley.
Or both. The circumstances of its death are among the questions to
answer, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of such a creature in the middle of suburbia may
seem bizarre, but it is not unheard of. The remains of more than
100 mastodons have been discovered in New York state (though 1899
was the last time one was unearthed in Dutchess County), and they
often show up where people dig for large development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there's this boundary between urban, suburban and
rural, but of course, these are pretty arbitrary in terms of
geology,'' said Daniel C. Fisher, curator of paleontology at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a nationally recognized
expert on mastodons. ``What's interesting here is that this is a
well-preserved specimen, and it has the potential to contribute
quite a bit to our understanding of what was going on in the area
12,000 years ago.''

 &HT;    MIDEAST PEACE TOPS CLINTON'S AGENDA AT GATHERING OF WORLD
LEADERS
 &HT;    EDs: Lede must be updated later to show Clinton's expected
arrival in New York after 10 p.m. ET.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking his quest for Middle East peace before the
largest gathering of world leaders in history, President Clinton
was to arrive here late Tuesday, using a United Nations summit to
try to break the latest stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his role as senior statesman one last time at the U.N.
podium, Clinton is scheduled to give a keynote address Wednesday
morning opening the body's Millennium Summit, expected to draw more
than 160 heads of state from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   After a luncheon hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Clinton was slated to hold back-to-back closed-door talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and, separately, with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the talks, Clinton's national security adviser,
Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, told reporters that the president still
believes an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is within reach,
though the odds for attaining it are long and growing longer as
next week's deadline for the end of the 1993 Oslo peace process
looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very, very difficult, and I don't know whether
we can do this,'' Berger said, speaking to reporters at the White
House before leaving for the summit. ``But I think conceptually,
the ideas exist for progress if there is the political will to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meetings with Arafat and Barak form the cornerstone
of a day of almost frenzied U.N. diplomacy for Clinton. He is also
scheduled to meet Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin,
for wide-ranging talks touching on regional issues such as the
Balkans, the Korean Peninsula and the Middle East, and on the
prospects for future reductions in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Clinton is to meet with King Abdullah of Jordan
and Crown Prince Abdallah of Saudi Arabia, for separate talks
centered on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's bilateral meetings would be Clinton's first
get-togethers with Arafat and Barak since he hosted them for two
weeks of peace talks at the presidential retreat at Camp David in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations collapsed after Arafat rejected Barak's offer
of partial sovereignty over disputed portions of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to bring the two leaders together to close a peace
deal, but only if Barak and Arafat are prepared to reach further
than they did in July toward a compromise over the future of the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who traveled to Cairo last week to seek Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's assistance in the matter, said in July
that Arafat had further to go than Barak in the quest for
compromise, a view Berger reiterated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Barak obviously is deeply committed to making
this process work if he can find an honorable, principled
compromise,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed Chairman Arafat is also interested in an
agreement,'' he added, ``but there are some very hard decisions
that need to be made, and he has to make them in a way . . . he can
accept as a matter of principle and he can sell as matters of
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The best Clinton could hope for in Wednesday's meetings is an
agreement by both leaders to participate in another summit, Berger
said, but ``only if both sides are prepared to give some, to make
principled compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Barak) needs to have a meeting of the minds with Chairman
Arafat,'' Berger said. ``I don't see that happening this week. What
I hope will happen . . . is that we see a distinct way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has been the chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, or PLO, since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Barak and Arafat are working against a series of
deadlines, some flexible, others far less so.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, leaves office in January and becomes an
official lame duck after the Nov. 7 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces a number of political challenges at home and a
possible parliamentary call for a new government, and his ouster as
early as the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Even more urgently, Arafat has threatened to unilaterally
declare an independent state of Palestine on Sept. 13 unless he and
Barak can settle on solutions to the disputes near the heart of 52
years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He is to meet Saturday with elected Palestinian representatives
in Gaza to discuss whether to carry out that threat or to continue
moving forward with the U.S.-brokered peace process.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, there were conciliatory words from the speaker of
the Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmed Korei, and from the
speaker of Israel's Knesset, Avraham Burg.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is good is that there is a spirit of continuing
negotiations,'' Korei told reporters in Strasbourg, France, after
speaking to the European Parliament. ``If the success of the
process needs more time, we are ready to give it more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Korei also said Palestinians would accept placing Jerusalem
under some sort of international jurisdiction, an idea Israel has
so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the same forum, Burg, signaled flexibility on the
part of Israel over the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Burg quoted the late King Hussein of Jordan, who once suggested
that sovereignty over Jerusalem be given back to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy that this concept has not yet been rejected by
either side,'' Burg said. ``Let's explore it.''
</P>
<P>
   With multiple impending deadlines, Berger said Wednesday's talks
would be pivotal in determining whether to expect a Mideast peace
accord on Clinton's ebbing watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we see a decisive way forward from this week,'' Berger
said, ``I think it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops captured heavily-Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967
Israeli-Arab war.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli sovereignty over that territory has never been endorsed
by the international community. After the collapse of the Camp
David talks, however, Clinton said he would decide by December
whether to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from its present
location in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that would grant tacit
recognition of Israel's sovereignty over all of Jerusalem.

DRY MUSCADET, THE OYSTERS FOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hard to imagine a better meal on arriving in
Paris than a plate of oysters and a carafe of Muscadet, the house
white of many cafes. The wine's dry, almost saline quality seems to
come directly from the sea. In fact, the vineyards, at the western
end of the Loire around Nantes, are close to where the river
empties into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It galls me that so few shellfish restaurants in New York offer
a decent Muscadet. The most likely reason is that it has a plebeian
reputation, and many people assume that a luxury item like oysters
requires a wine of equal status. But if you try both a Muscadet and
an expensive California chardonnay with a dozen on the half shell,
the wisdom in saving a few bucks becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Muscadet is one of those rare French wines named for a grape
rather than for a region. Confusingly, the muscadet grape is also
known as the melon de Bourgogne, reflecting its origins in
Burgundy. The best Muscadets come from three appellations: The
largest is Muscadet de Sevre-et-Maine, followed by Muscadet Cotes
de Grand Lieu and the Muscadet des Coteaux de la Loire.
</P>
<P>
   The best Muscadets are also made sur lie, meaning the newly
fermented wine is left in contact with the lees, or sediment of
fermentation, which can include dead yeast cells and grape
fragments. This contributes carbon dioxide, which accounts for the
pleasant sparkle in many bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various
Manhattan wine shops.

 &HT;    MIDEAST PEACE TOPS CLINTON'S AGENDA AT GATHERING OF WORLD
LEADERS
 &HT;    EDs: Lede must be updated later to show Clinton's expected
arrival in New York after 10 p.m. ET.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking his quest for Middle East peace before the
largest gathering of world leaders in history, President Clinton
was to arrive here late Tuesday, using a United Nations summit to
try to break the latest stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his role as senior statesman one last time at the U.N.
podium, Clinton is scheduled to give a keynote address Wednesday
morning opening the body's Millennium Summit, expected to draw more
than 160 heads of state from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   After a luncheon hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Clinton was slated to hold back-to-back closed-door talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and, separately, with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the talks, Clinton's national security adviser,
Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, told reporters that the president still
believes an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is within reach,
though the odds for attaining it are long and growing longer as
next week's deadline for the end of the 1993 Oslo peace process
looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very, very difficult, and I don't know whether
we can do this,'' Berger said, speaking to reporters at the White
House before leaving for the summit. ``But I think conceptually,
the ideas exist for progress if there is the political will to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meetings with Arafat and Barak form the cornerstone
of a day of almost frenzied U.N. diplomacy for Clinton. He is also
scheduled to meet Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin,
for wide-ranging talks touching on regional issues such as the
Balkans, the Korean Peninsula and the Middle East, and on the
prospects for future reductions in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Clinton is to meet with King Abdullah of Jordan
and Crown Prince Abdallah of Saudi Arabia, for separate talks
centered on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's bilateral meetings would be Clinton's first
get-togethers with Arafat and Barak since he hosted them for two
weeks of peace talks at the presidential retreat at Camp David in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations collapsed after Arafat rejected Barak's offer
of partial sovereignty over disputed portions of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to bring the two leaders together to close a peace
deal, but only if Barak and Arafat are prepared to reach further

TIPS FROM A CERTAIN ISLAND VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: A 250-word recipe from the book appears at end of
review.) 
 By MATT LEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a T-shirt concession replaces the cloakroom in your
favorite restaurant, it may be time to find a new hangout.
Institution status, for even the best-run brasserie, can be lethal
to the spirit of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Dog Tavern Summer on the Vineyard Cookbook,'' by
Joseph Hall and Elaine Johnson (Little, Brown; $25.95), appears at
first be just another extension of a successful brand, like the
restaurant's famed T-shirts with canine motif. Its busy,
magazine-style design, smiling photo subjects and breathless prose
make it read like a resort brochure for Martha's Vineyard or an
Orvis catalog. Recipes are printed in a rustic ``Olde Yankee''
typeface that might have been chiseled from Plymouth Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the slick exterior beats the heart of a genuine
cookbook. The 100-plus recipes, a collaborative effort of past and
present employees, are categorized by breakfast, lunch, dinner and
dessert, followed by an exceptionally detailed index.
</P>
<P>
   Historical notes, sequences on how to flip an omelet and how to
clean squid, and profiles of the restaurant's suppliers (like ``the
chicken lady'') are interspersed throughout. It is all written with
the restaurant's easygoing style: folksy, and playful as a kitchen
full of college kids on summer break.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Dog was founded in 1971 as one of the first year-round
restaurants on Martha's Vineyard serving three meals a day, seven
days a week. Like many restaurants of its generation _ identifiable
by their blackboards and espresso machines _ it was the first to
bring ingredients like couscous and fresh ginger to the area.
Keeping an island restaurant in top form, staffed and supplied with
fresh ingredients (and ideas) year-round is a supreme challenge,
and in many ways the book reflects the hard-won wisdom and
flexibility required to weather 30 years in such an environment.
</P>
<P>
   The book emphasizes basic techniques like grilling and making
fish stock and marinades, and widely encourages sensible
substitutions. A recipe for linguine with pesto, for example, also
suggests using the pesto sauce to prepare a simple pizza, topping
it with slices of fresh beefsteak tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sturdy New England cod, bluefish and potatoes in the
table of contents, there are plenty of Asian, Mexican, Italian and
Middle Eastern influences that the restaurant has embraced as its
rotating chefs brought new flavors to the island. Littleneck clams
with spicy black bean sauce is a tasty variation on a Vineyard
staple; hot and sour soup, with kimchi, tamari and dried lily buds,
has more than a ring of authenticity to it.
</P>
<P>
   Most recipes contain a delicious twist. A roasted eggplant and
tomato soup seasoned with fresh herbs calls for a garnish of
ricotta and roasted garlic puree that adds richness to each
spoonful. Summer ingredients in particular are well represented,
and fresh herbs are positively worshiped: a simple red wine
marinade calls for no fewer than four _ parsley, thyme, savory and
chives.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the book's shortcomings flow from its origins.
A few recipes presume the cook has a restaurant's access to
ingredients and labor. While all the recipes are written with a
brisk efficiency that suits the style of the cooking, they can
sometimes skirt important details, like how big a vegetable should
be. All onions, after all, are not created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Some good general tips on subjects like slicing and curling
scallions, preparing lobsters and cleaning quohogs do make this a
very serviceable all-purpose cookbook, even if its sunny photos of
the good life don't inspire you to hop the next ferry.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, the mercury fell to 27 degrees at Saranac Lake in
upstate New York as a cold high-pressure system settled south from
Canada. At daybreak Wednesday, scattered frost will coat many of
the sheltered valleys of the interior Northeast before
scintillating sunshine boosts readings close to seasonal levels by
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a stiff wind from the northeast circulating
around a New England high-pressure system will direct chilly air
into the southern Middle Atlantic and Southeastern States. Beneath
a thick canopy of clouds and patchy rain, daytime highs will stay
below 70 degrees in much of the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary heat that has stricken the southern Plains and
Texas will ease as slightly cooler air arrives from the east.
Nevertheless, daytime highs will approach 100 in spots.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of sultry air reaching the northern Plains will ignite
strong thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TORRID TEXAS &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Extreme heat of historic proportions has stifled much of eastern
Texas the past several days, with records dating from the early
part of the last century shattered in many places. On Monday, the
temperature reached 109 at the Houston airport, the hottest ever
recorded there. Records were also broken at Corpus Christi, Austin
and Galveston. One-hundred-degree heat is uncommon along the Texas
Coast, since prevailing onshore winds usually temper the extreme
heat often found farther inland. &QL;

   (UNDATED) From his office perch on the 37th floor of Four
Embarcadero Center, 73-year-old Claude Rosenberg Jr. views the
splendor of the San Francisco Bay and envisions the wealthy writing
bigger checks for charity.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite coast, at a Virginia hotel just outside the
byteway of the nation's capital, 57-year-old Mario Morino works a
crowd of young ``netpreneurs.'' Offering a smile here and a touch
on the shoulder there, Morino realizes that many will exceed his
$200 million in net worth, and lays plans to tap that worth for
society's greater good.
</P>
<P>
   Retired mega-money manager Rosenberg and technological tycoon
Morino have never met. But they are philanthropic pied pipers of
the upper classes, motivating the rich and super-rich to share, not
just to accumulate, wealth.
</P>
<P>
   One has established a new standard of giving that draws upon
previously sacrosanct investment assets; the other is trying to

spirit of the ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the concentration of wealth in this country,
because there's so much of it, and because it's growing so rapidly,
a very slight shift in giving of a point or two among the affluent
would transform the face of nonprofit activity in America,'' said
Karen Maru File, associate professor of marketing at the University
of Connecticut and co-author of ``High Net-Worth Psychology,''
published in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 9 million American households with a net
worth of more than $1 million, and these are the targets of
optimists like Rosenberg and Morino. The new millionaires, the pair
hopes, will rise to the challenge if given gentle guidance, time to
mature and the freedom to become charitable in their own way.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's crusade began with an unsent letter.
</P>
<P>
   As the former manager of billions of dollars in investment
portfolios at RCM Capital Management, the firm he founded and sold,
Rosenberg knew the fortunes that many people on the West Coast had
built up, sometimes with his advice. Yet as he encouraged giving a
portion of that wealth to charity, too many refused, hanging on to
stocks and bonds as if they were off-limits security blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and more than a little angry, Rosenberg sat down at
his computer and fired off a public letter, hoping The San
Francisco Chronicle would print it.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenberg -- who was known for his thorough research of
stocks -- read his diatribe and realized that before he spouted
off, he'd better have his facts straight. Over several weeks, he
culled data from the Internal Revenue Service, analyzed statistics
such as the previous year's average stock market return, performed
some algebraic equations, and figured out what the wealthy could
``comfortably'' give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted to learn how little the highest level
persons were giving when compared not only to their income, but
their investment assets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg wrote a book, ``Wealthy and Wise,'' first published in
1994, explaining his findings. He formed a nonprofit organization,
NewTithing Group.
</P>
<P>
   His intent is not to replace the biblical notion of ``tithing''
-- giving 10 percent of annual income to charity -- but to provide
a modern guide on what people can give based not only on income,
but on the market value (after debt) of investment assets,
excluding housing and retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing the data, Rosenberg considered what the stock
market has done over the last 50 years, not just during the recent
bull market. He defines ``comfortable'' as what one can give while
keeping asset wealth steady, even if the market returns to less
sensational performance. If the market continues as it has
recently, the wealthy can increase giving and still become much
wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I mean by comfortable giving is they can do it without
any real sacrifice, without stretching at all,'' said Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   This month, NewTithing will unveil a personal calculator linked
to its Web site (www.newtithing.org) enabling individuals to
determine what they can give based on their own comfort levels.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Rosenberg has also done state-by-state rankings,
comparing what people on average actually give to what they could
afford to give. Utah givers rank first, contributing 68 percent of
what Rosenberg thinks they could afford, and Delaware givers rank
last, donating 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, released in June, analyzed national giving in
1999, a record year for contributions. It showed that if Americans
considered their earning assets as well as their income, they could
more than double their total giving, with virtually all the
increase coming from the highest tax brackets. Those earning less
than $75,000 are already giving at appropriate levels, according to
Rosenberg's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   What about the super-wealthy, the nearly 150,000 households from
the highest tax bracket, with adjusted gross income exceeding $1
million annually? By Rosenberg's measure, if they considered their
investments, which average more than $19 million, the average they
gave to charity would increase nearly tenfold, from $129,000 to
$1.2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people with a lot of investment assets to give simply from
their income and their income alone is shortsighted, outdated,
outmoded and basically unfair,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said he has donated 50 percent of his income and 3
percent of his investment assets to charity in the last two tax
years, a total over and above what he gave to the Louise and Claude
Rosenberg Jr. Family Foundation. He declined to provide specific
total figures.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg knows he hits a nerve when he talks about giving from
investments that some consider untouchable. In preaching the
NewTithing gospel, he tells the fictitious story of a man in New
York City who thinks he has spotted his cousin dressed as a lady of
the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The man crosses the street, taps the woman on her shoulder, and
is shocked to discover it is, indeed, his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin Bertha,'' he says, ``how could you possibly do such a
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin George,'' she replies, ``I think you will understand.
It was either this, or dip into capital.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by Rosenberg's data, a Minneapolis group has formed
with the purpose of dipping into capital for charity. They call
themselves the One Percent Club, with members promising to
contribute 1 percent of net worth annually. After two years, more
than 300 have signed pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working,'' said Joe Selvaggio, the club's executive
director. ``It's just a lot slower than I thought it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one guy yesterday who is wealthy and young. He
said his net worth fluctuates in his high-tech business. I said we
can make it easy for him to join by just looking at the low end of
his business. He ultimately joined. But some don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Community Foundation Silicon Valley has
condensed Rosenberg's book into a 32-page, $1 booklet. More than
32,000 copies have been mailed.
</P>
<P>
   If the heart of the new national economy is California's wealthy
high-tech valley, a 1998 survey by the foundation gives a peek into
the region's soul. While the news wasn't all bad (83 percent of
area households gave to charity, versus 69 percent nationwide), the
survey identified what some might consider the wealthy
cyber-stingy.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of those with net worth exceeding $1 million,
not including their homes, gave less than $1,000 a year to charity.
Of those earning more than $100,000 annually, 7 percent gave
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Another finding: About one-third of high-net-worth people in the
valley were compensated with an employer's stock, but only 7
percent gave any of that away to charity, despite potentially
significant tax advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who have made money haven't even figured out
what to do with their lives, much less what to do with their
money,'' said Peter deCourcy Hero, president of the Community
Foundation Silicon Valley. ``John Rockefeller didn't give the
enormous amount of money he gave away the moment he made it, and I
think it's unrealistic to expect these new philanthropists to
immediately start pouring out these enormous sums when they haven't
had time to research it and figure it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say be a little bit patient.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Virginia's Fairfax County, with more than 2,000 high-tech firms
and a median household income of $90,937, is the most affluent
county in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hilton Hotel on a morning in midsummer, Morino worked a
crowd of about 300, many of them 30-somethings in bluejeans and
golf shirts, as he hosted another session of coffee and
``dough-nets.'' Most guests were there to gain business connections
and perhaps to glean some wisdom from Morino, founder of
Netpreneur, an acclaimed organization for digital start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Morino is glad to help, and has been dubbed ``St. Mario'' for
his willingness. But what these young business owners with dollar
signs in their eyes don't know is that Morino's ``primary
motivation'' is to cultivate them for future philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a master strategy for this, I'm serious,'' Morino
said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to introduce the subject of giving this fall by
recognizing someone who has been an agent for social change in his
or her community. The idea is to celebrate philanthropy quietly,
without applying the hard sell or guilt trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can predict when it happens,'' Morino said
of the decision by the e-wealthy to give generously. ``What you
want to do is be on their radar screen when it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're doing here, earning the trust of a lot of
young entrepreneurs. At some point later in their careers, they're
likely to turn to us for advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Morino sees -- and has experienced -- four stages in becoming a
philanthropist:
</P>
<P>
   First, after making your fortune, you decide to do some good.
Next, you encounter frustration and disillusionment as you are
overwhelmed with requests to give to good causes. Third, you slow
down, reflect and ``think through what the hell you want to do.''
Finally, you step out with a philanthropic strategy of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Morino ``retired'' eight years ago and founded the nonprofit
Morino Institute, which uses business and technology ``for the
social, educational and economic benefit of communities.'' His
personal philanthropy plan for this year alone is to give 5 percent
of his net worth to charity.
</P>
<P>
   His investments continue to grow. In 1992, he was worth $100
million, he said, while today he's worth double that, meaning he
has more money than he can spend on himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question then becomes, what do I want to do with it?''
Morino said. ``Do I buy yachts or sports teams, or do I put it to
something that does some real good?''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   File, the marketing professor, said these questions typically
occur when wealthy people are in their 50s. That may explain why
much of the new economy's new money hasn't yet been given away.
</P>
<P>
   File said it's already evident that high-tech money often
bypasses traditional charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many types of wealth, but when we're talking
e-wealth it's a forward-looking community,'' she said. ``Their
technology has enabled them to peer around the corner and see the
world that's emerging. They believe they're on the new frontier, on
the edge of space, building the next new thing. It wouldn't make
sense for them to be part of something traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ``What's it all about, Alfie?'' questions emerged for
Art and Kathy Bushkin, who are now in their 50s, they met with
Morino as well as with other friends to try to sort it out. The
Bushkins had profited handsomely from stock in America Online, as
well as from successful careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest question wasn't where to give money, but what do I
want to do, how do I want to spend my time?'' said Art Bushkin, a
former Bell Atlantic executive.
</P>
<P>
   With a $3 million gift, the couple formed The Stargazer
Foundation, which, among other things, awards $100,000 ``genius''
grants to ``encourage the creative spirit.'' Art Bushkin runs
Stargazer, which also has started investment funds in which profits
are funneled directly into charities, part of a movement called
``venture philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushkin said he considers his wife and himself to be ``wealth
custodians,'' a new category of people ``who have accumulated
wealth and have discretionary income that exceeds the amount of
municipalities and, in some cases, countries.''
</P>
<P>
   These custodians, he said, could replace governments as the
primary agents of social change. But first they must decide to
donate their money, develop their own plan, and just do it. That
takes time.
</P>
<P>
   Morino predicts that the next 10 to 15 years ``will be
staggering for philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have moved mountains in their lifetimes and they
want to continue to do that,'' he said. ``There's going to be a big
difference between the old money and the new money and if the new
money isn't more effective in its philanthropy, we have failed.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) From his office perch on the 37th floor of Four
Embarcadero Center, 73-year-old Claude Rosenberg Jr. views the
splendor of the San Francisco Bay and envisions the wealthy writing
bigger checks for charity.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite coast, at a Virginia hotel just outside the
byteway of the nation's capital, 57-year-old Mario Morino works a
crowd of young ``netpreneurs.'' Offering a smile here and a touch
on the shoulder there, Morino realizes that many will exceed his
$200 million in net worth, and lays plans to tap that worth for
society's greater good.
</P>
<P>
   Retired mega-money manager Rosenberg and technological tycoon
Morino have never met. But they are philanthropic pied pipers of
the upper classes, motivating the rich and super-rich to share, not
just to accumulate, wealth.
</P>
<P>
   One has established a new standard of giving that draws upon
previously sacrosanct investment assets; the other is trying to
create a culture of generosity that recognizes the entrepreneurial
spirit of the ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the concentration of wealth in this country,

   ``These people have moved mountains in their lifetimes and they

`DARK HORSES AND BLACK BEAUTIES':   WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS,   HORSES
ARE FROM HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There comes a time in almost every girl's life when she falls in
love with horses. This phenomenon, this quality of nature, is
easily observable, but Melissa Holbrook Pierson more than observes
it; she muses on it to deep and lyrical effect in ``Dark Horses and
Black Beauties,'' her new collection of slender and delicate essays
on horses and women. Pierson loves horses, and they are a major
subject here, but a deeper concern is for the human animal, its
need for love, its propensity for cruelty, its habit of imposing
ardently wishful meanings on brute or tender nature.
</P>
<P>
   Along her somewhat meandering path Pierson does provide a few
hard and interesting facts about the special relationship between
girls (and women) and horses. ``Facts?'' she writes. ``Of the
United States Pony Club's 14,000 members, four-fifths are girls.
... A survey taken a few years ago by the British magazine Gallop!
found that three-quarters of women who own horses would as soon
give up their husbands as their horses; 90 percent would rather
have a new horse than a new baby. ... Only 22 percent of Canadian
horse owners are male.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is less persuasive than Pierson makes it out to be;
after all there is a difference between what 90 percent of female
horse owners might want and what 90 percent of women want. There's
no point in arguing the general proposition that many women love
horses.
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment is behind a vast literature, thousands of novels,
and Pierson cites a few of them to give a bit of the spirit of the
woman-horse love affair and the trembling fantasies that it
creates. She covers historical issues like the fierce 19th-century
debate over whether women should ride astride or sidesaddle. She
makes telling observations on what might be seen as the connections
among aristocratic thinness, money, social snobbery and horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping a horse in Manhattan is the epitome of expansive
wealth,'' she writes in one passage, ``and of the weird perversions
that money can buy, as if money were of such little concern that
you might consider installing a half-acre of grass lawn with a
stream and a waterfall somewhere on East 58th Street.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes a woman she knows who cannot stand not to see her
horse, which she keeps at the Claremont Stables in Manhattan, every
day. ``She is investigating the possibility of having fresh alfalfa
flown in from the West, because it is the finest in the land,''
Pierson writes, maintaining a sympathetic distance from what has
turned love into narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   Horses, in other words, are elements in the great vain comedy of
human affairs, and Pierson has a good eye for foibles. But her
essays mostly have an autobiographical edge to them, she being a
woman who loved horses as a little girl and has fallen in love with
them as an adult. Her writing has a austere quality to it, a formal
restraint that, given the subject, makes one think of dressage, of
riding crops, leather boots, of subtle motions in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Several themes are evoked, among them ruminations on the
character of horses and on the reasons girls become so smitten.
``We are attracted to horses, in particular, because they echo our
own tentative whispers but do so in a bold, ringing call; they
speak with certainty of exactly those things we are most unsure of
in ourselves. For the qualities that most define the equine species
are the ones most suppressed currently in the human: raw sexuality,
fear, open vulnerability and need, uncomplicated drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that the explanation? Certainly it is an interesting
hypothesis, the horse as a kind of echo of the deeper female
qualities. But Pierson offers it only as a thought, a possibility,
and that is characteristic of this writer whose intellectual
delicacy seems inconsistent with aggressive opinions. ``I myself
have become almost addicted to the taste of the unknowable, and
sometimes gorge on it in the middle of the night, straight out of
the container and with no sauce,'' she writes. ``With this
revelation, I hereby give up all pretense of offering some final
explanation of why girls love horses with the abiding passion they
do. Instead, I invite you to the feast of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   In her autobiographical mode Pierson recounts her efforts to
learn to ride and to listen to horses. She is not an
anthropomorphist, being wise enough to understand that humans do
not generally know what is going on in a horse's mind. She does,
however, verge on the sentimental at times, or at least on the
mystical, as when she wants to believe that horses are more
intelligent than we are, or that they can read our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Her most impassioned remarks have to do with cruelty to animals,
and she brings us, with her usual poise, into the very abbatoir,
the dog food factories where most horses end their lives. ``We
decide who lives and who dies,'' she writes, with a resigned sort
of acceptance of human supremacy. ``The worthless die.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is sentimentality in this, Pierson puts up a spirited
defense of it. Anyway you don't have to be persuaded by everything
she says to appreciate the play of her mind, which is subtle and
quick; coltish, one wants to say, and one would be right.

 &HT;    Building a better banana
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - It's a world few know or imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the mammoth new Randalls warehouse in Dallas, six tall
garage-type doors open to long skinny rooms. The doors are bright
yellow _ a hint of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know better, you might think the rooms held
Grandma's antiques or a sailboat in drydock. But lift up the garage
doors and you'll see towering boxes of bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The double rooms are 30 feet deep and more than three stories
high. Stand in the aisle running the length of the narrow room _
about 10 to 12 feet wide _ and you can reach out and touch bananas
on either side. Lots of them. More than 2,000 boxes, or 80,000,
pounds of bananas. It's here and in a similar setup in Houston that
Randalls ripens its bananas before shipment to the chain's 125
stores, including, this year, the ones in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   This is the modern world of the nation's most popular fruit,
where an increased number of store chains have built banana
ripening rooms designed to turn out fruit just the right colors at
the right time. In these climate-controlled places, computers and
temperature probes, forced air and pressurized doors combine to
bring bananas to a buff condition 365 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's cool enough for a jacket in the ripening rooms, with
moisture and ethylene gas (the naturally occurring gas given off by
bananas and other fruits) dispensed inside to help control the
process from starchy fruit to cereal-bowl sweet. The moisture makes
your skin glow and finishes off what hair the hard hat doesn't
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Bananas enter the techie chambers totally green and spend about
three to five days in boxes with holes through which
ethylene-enriched air circulates _ you can actually feel it _ to
turn them light golden, ensuring even ripening, unlike a container
left on its own. When they achieve the desired ripeness, they are
trucked to the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Griesemer, Dallas-area director of transportation and
distribution, says that when he started with Randalls 15 years ago,
ripening assistance was more primitive. Water was sprayed on the
floor to provide humidity, temperatures were adjusted manually,
doors were opened to vent. Now, everything is high-tech and
computer-monitored via those probes inserted into the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can ripen two loads in the same room and have them
available for two different days,'' says Bill Motley, Randalls'
director of produce merchandising _ as proud of the system as a new
parent. ``The right side of the room can be one stage, the left
side another.''
</P>
<P>
   Adel Kader, who studies technologies to bring better fruit to
the table, says that while the basics of ripening haven't changed,
the work that has gone on recently has been directed at defining
and improving the ripening process and monitoring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bananas still have to be handled carefully from the beginning
of shipping in the tropics to the destination,'' explains Kader,
professor of post-harvest physiology at the University of
California at Davis. They have to be protected from temperatures
below 58 degrees, for instance. Even a few hours of exposure will
cause damage and bananas will not be as good. So the No. 1 issue in
ripening rooms is to bring the temperature of the fruit closer to
65 degrees, maintaining humidity in the 90 percent to 95 percent
range. Then add the ethylene gas, while monitoring the color change
of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The TLC is paying off. Bananas that have been carefully handled
and ripened have less interior damage, the fruit is less bruised
and lasts longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, 10 years ago, you would have to eat bananas in two
to three days. Now I have bananas last six or seven days,'' says
Charles Robinson, Randalls quality assurance manager, who has been
in the banana business 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Six days might be pushing it, others say, adding that three to
four days is more typical. However, a hand of such bananas,
purchased randomly in a store, lasted a week on this writer's
kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   In today's eat-more-fruit, eat-on-the-go, eat-low-fat society,
bananas are a big deal. In 1998, the per-capita consumption of
bananas was 29 pounds, _ almost 10 pounds more than fresh apples,
bananas' nearest competitor according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Some 65 percent of consumers buy bananas as least once a week,
reports The Packer's Fresh Trends trade magazine. And grocers don't
want to hear that any of their shoppers can't find the right
ripeness of bananas on the shelf. The item represents 10 percent of
the produce department sales, and a good display of bananas brings
people into the store on a regular basis. It sets the standard for
the produce department.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have the perception that if the bananas are good, the
rest of produce is good,'' says Griesemer.
</P>
<P>
   While a few bananas are grown in Hawaii, most are imported from
places like Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and
Colombia. Bananas don't grow on trees, but on plants, members of
the lily/orchid family. Picked green because they travel better
that way, the bananas are shipped by boat to various U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
   Some banana and distribution companies offer pre-ripening
services. Whole Foods Market, for instance, gets its produce from
Texas Health Distributors, which uses Quality Bananas Co. out of
Houston to ripen its conventional and organic bananas.
</P>
<P>
   But large grocery chains say it is cheaper to do it themselves,
there is less handling of the fruit, and they can control the
ripening process better for their needs, timing it for their
various stores and the season. The beginning of school, for
instance, generally sees a rise in banana consumption, whether for
lunch boxes or breakfast cereal bowls.
</P>
<P>
   When bananas arrive at the grocery warehouses, they are checked
for color, scarring, something called latex sheen, internal
temperature and other characteristics. But not sugar, because the
bananas are so green they are still starchy. The sweetness comes as
the bananas ripen.
</P>
<P>
   There is little banana smell in the ripening rooms. Aroma is
noticeable at the later stages of banana ripening, says Larry
Buchanan, H-E-B's quality assurance banana ripening expert. At the
H-E-B retail support center in San Antonio, 38 banana-ripening
rooms, each about the size of a 50-foot semi-truck, hold the fruits
for 272 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan compares commercial banana ripening to sleep. After
picking, the bananas are shipped at 58 degrees, a snoozing temp, on
the boat. In the ripening rooms, the gas gradually wakes them up.
They start changing color.
</P>
<P>
   In the banana world, the ripeness of the fruit is graded by
colors and numbers. Green bananas are 1s and 2s; 3 is half green,
half yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan likes to ship bananas from the rooms to the stores at
stages 3-4. ``You want a 4 in the store, more yellow than green.''
</P>
<P>
   That gives bananas a little holding time before consumers bite
into them at home, usually at a stage 5 (yellow, with green tips
and green necks), or even 6 or 7 for those who really go for the
gold, maybe flecked with brown spots.
</P>
<P>
   Banana ripeness is a matter of taste. And a guessing game for
suppliers. Bananas take nine months to grow, Buchanan notes. So
today the challenge is trying to figure out how many bananas
Central Texans will be eating in March.
</P>
<P>
   Stores go by records, seasons and history.''We're trying to
outguess the consumer in ordering everyday,'' Buchanan says.
</P>
<P>
   Ripening rooms have been so successful that H-E-B has added 20
more in San Antonio, plus 19 in Houston, to accommodate peaches,
pears, melons and mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased sales have been phenomenal with the pears and
peaches,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   But post-harvest fruit technology is not stopping there.
Researchers are studying different methods to pull more of the
ethylene gas out of the banana to slow ripening even more _ making
the fruit last longer at home.
</P>
<P>
   They are looking at ways to slow down yellow bananas when a
warehouse has misjudged and ripened more than it can sell. They are
experimenting with temperature sensitivity and how well specialty
bananas _ plantains, red, manzanos _ respond to ethylene gas.
</P>
<P>
   They are evaluating different methods of ripening room
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my colleagues in ag engineering has developed light
reflector sensors to sense the color change in bananas in the
ripening rooms,'' says Kader. The information from that measurement
could be relayed to the computer without anyone going into the
ripening rooms.
</P>
<P>
   All this effort for America's beloved yellow fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the perfect banana goes on.

   'Nana notes
</P>
<P>
   -Keep bananas at room temperature unless you want to halt the
ripening process.
</P>
<P>
   -While refrigeration will extend the life of ripe bananas, it
may darken the skin. But it will not hurt the fruit inside.
</P>
<P>
   -Don't place bananas in the bottom of a fruit bowl or basket.
They will become mashed.
</P>
<P>
   -A banana tree or stand supports the fruit, gives equal air
opportunity, and may extend the life of the bunch. But the fruit
might not ripen as quickly as it would in a bowl.

VEGAS CHEESE, OR JUST A SPREAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ ``A little bit of eye candy'' is how the
singer Kevin Aviance modestly characterized himself as he paraded
around the pool of the Hard Rock Hotel on a sultry desert night
wearing patent leather thigh-highs, a buttocks-baring leopard-print
jump suit and a glittery fedora rakishly cocked on his shaved
skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all about sparkle,'' he added. ``Out of the box and over
the top. That's why I love D&AMP;G.''
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;G, of course, is the Italian label run by Domenico Dolce and
Stefano Gabbana, whose idea of making their debut at the colossal
apparel convention known as Magic was to bypass so prosaic a sales
tool as a booth. Instead, they gambled on making their presence
felt with a poolside fashion show and a live performance by the
singer Mary J. Blige before an invited crowd of 3,500. Although
short on the Hollywood celebrities who attend their Milan runway
shows, the evening did feature a posse of drag queens to lend some
old-style Las Vegas glitter and oomph.
</P>
<P>
   It was needed. Las Vegas has been cleaned up, as everyone knows,
the raw frontier town of neon and naked ladies, of mobsters in
sharkskin suits and saurian pensioners yanking the slots rendered
family-friendly. But a certain conviction is missing from the
city's latest incarnation, with its fake Paris, its fake Monte
Carlo and its crude miniature fake New York. The root of the
problem also afflicts the twice-a-year Magic trade show and, for
that matter, American fashion itself. Someone mislaid the franchise
on Americanness.
</P>
<P>
   With 3,200 companies, 5,500 brands, 21,000 product lines and
96,000 attendees from 110 countries at the latest show, from Aug.
28 to 31, a visitor would expect an energetic surge, or, at the
very least, the appearance of a direction. But Magic _ ground zero
for mass market apparel, especially men's wear _ felt aimless and
mired.
</P>
<P>
   There were entire aisles of Hawaiian shirts. There was a section
given over to board sports, with skateboarders flying about
``catching air.'' There were the industrial majors _ Ralph Lauren,
Levi's, Tommy Hilfiger _ showing clothes guaranteed not to
surprise. There were thousands of variants on the T-shirt, still
the essential American contribution to world fashion. And there was
a larger-than-ever representation of hip-hop-inspired urban wear,
the clothes that have driven a revitalized apparel industry in
recent years, with brands like Fubu, Phat Farm and Sean John, and
now look as renegade as a button-down shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, one of the few manufacturers supplying some
certifiable cool at the latest Magic was Ben Sherman, a 37-year-old
British firm that introduced American-style poplin button-downs to
England in the '60s and was, for a while, shirt maker to the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones. ``Kids are into these shirts their
fathers wore,'' said Steve Collins, a sales representative for
Acupuncture, a trendy British shoemaker whose current ad campaign
features a man masturbating with a shoe. ``Ben Sherman is burning
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Very little else here is, unless you factor in the halfhearted
effort some manufacturers are making to revive the '80s, an era
you'd have to develop amnesia to lament. In fashion terms, the '80s
are a John Hughes film, a Cyndi Lauper video. Think of shiny
fabrics, moussed hair and skinny ties hanging loose from a shirt
with an oversize pointed collar.
</P>
<P>
   As stylistic detours go, this revival is a singularly perverse
one _ although possibly on the money. Vegas, too, is in the grip of
an unfathomable '80s revival, with casino headline acts like Sheena
Easton, Eddie Money and Andrew Dice Clay. Even T was spotted, on
opening night of Magic, strutting through the Mandalay Bay hotel
lobby and boasting, ``I kicked Rocky Balboa's behind!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all coming back, all together,'' said Bruno Derval,
president of California Sunshine Activewear, a licensee of Playboy
Enterprises. At Derval's booth in the immense Las Vegas Convention
Center, the main exhibition hall, buyers lined up to see denim wear
sporting Playboy bunny logos as centerfold models served Krispy
Kreme doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   The tone associated with the nattier days of Sinatra and the Rat
Pack, or even Playboy, reflected a town where high rollers were
expected to dress for play. Las Vegas is not that place anymore.
Maybe nowhere is, in the aftermath of casual Fridays. Heavy hitters
in Vegas are now mostly segregated in private betting suites, while
the lobbies of most casinos are given over almost entirely to the
slots that generate over 50 percent of gambling revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The dress code there is set by the ``worms,'' as the slots
players used to be known. Any visitor who expects glamorously
bejeweled women worn as armpieces by guys in Brioni is in for a
letdown. Even in VIP lines to casino restaurants and lounge shows,
customers turn up in tube socks and short shorts. ``Never in 100
years would you guess that these people have money,'' said a sales
representative at the Bellagio hotel's luxury mall, Via Bellagio
(Chanel, Gucci, Vuitton, Prada). Looking as if you'd hit the
jackpot now seems somehow beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't for Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, which is not only attuned to the
mythical cheesiness of this most American city, but enthusiastic
about American archetypes. In the D&AMP;G scheme of things, consumption
is axiomatically conspicuous, flash is good and the borders between
retail categories _ urban wear, sports, formal _ are permeable, to
say the least. The United States market currently accounts for just
16 percent of Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's overall business, but the company's
showing at Magic bids to change that by exposing D&AMP;G to a wide
range of retailers. The beneficiary of the coolly democratic vision
put forth by this Milanese and Neapolitan couple might be American
men's wear over all.
</P>
<P>
   Why, D&AMP;G seemed to suggest, segregate style into hip-hop or
preppy ghettos? As demonstrated at the runway show, staged on a
catwalk cantilevered over the Hard Rock pool, Perry Como cardigans
can look great with graffitied denim. Glitter isn't dead. Even a
mullet can be cool if you bleach it and add some post-Twisted
Sister attitude. And there's life beyond a Tommy Hilfiger logo in
Old Glory, now reworked as hip-huggers and worn with a denim work
shirt with artificial ``dirt'' stitched into the elbows, the whole
thing topped by a plaid fedora for some Vegas-y pizazz.

HE'S ENIGMATIC, HE'S INFLUENTIAL _ SO WHY HAVEN'T YOU HEARD OF
HIM?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian actress Cynthia Dale, attempting to research a part, is
shadowing George Findlay, a self-absorbed Toronto television news
director. Findlay, an ethically challenged chap who has already hit
on Dale, has a knack for speaking before he thinks _ as when he
tells Dale: ``I know you've never cracked the American market. But
you're as big as it gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Dale is real. George Findlay, however, is fictional _ at
least, he seems to be. Findlay is the creation of 54-year-old
actor-writer-director Ken Finkleman, a Winnipeg native who has
played the character in five TV series and counting. And when
Findlay offers Dale those words of, er, comfort during an episode
of the sitcom ``The Newsroom,'' Finkleman could be talking to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who has been called Canada's best satirist, and its
highest-thinking auteur. He has been compared with adventurous film
directors such as Robert Altman and Federico Fellini. He is
mentioned in the same breath as such iconoclastic writers as Dennis
Potter and Raymond Carver.
</P>
<P>
   But while he's a major star in his own country, he's barely
known anywhere else. He's a prophet with honor in his own country,
but not much honor anywhere else _ especially in the United States.
Even though PBS picked up ``The Newsroom,'' which compares
favorably to ABC's recently canceled ``Sports Night'' and HBO's
``The Larry Sanders Show,'' the sitcom never found much of a
foothold south of the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   But Finkleman isn't losing sleep over his inability to cross
over. He's simply trying to please his own creative muse.
</P>
<P>
   Making it in the U.S. market ``may matter to different people;
it doesn't matter to me,'' Finkleman says during a phone interview.
``It's not that I don't care about the audience. The audience is an
abstract, and if you write for the audience _ which you always do
in Los Angeles _ executives try to imagine what the demographic is,
who their audience is. When they look at scripts and ask, `Does
this work or doesn't it work?' that doesn't mean `Do they like it
or don't they like it?,' it means `Will the audience like it?' And
it's this guess at this abstract. It's a stupid game because you
can't figure out who this `audience' is.''
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't sound like anything a typical sitcom
writer/producer would say. It certainly doesn't sound like anything
George Findlay would say. Yet to know Finkleman, you have to know
Findlay. Finkleman's repetition of the character is a tactic
unusual even for a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Findlay first came to being in ``Married Life,'' a 1995 series
that earned an airing on Comedy Central. But he came to full
fruition on ``The Newsroom,'' an acclaimed 1996 series that was so
unconventional that Canadian celebrities like Dale and film
director David Cronenberg clamored to make appearances as
themselves. On the series, Finkleman brought Findlay to the heights
of self-obsession: Findlay is the type of guy who's so covetous of
a primo office parking spot that he feigns interest in a
heart-attack victim, in hopes that he'll get the man's spot in
return for his sympathy when the guy kicks off. The 1997 series
``More Tears'' gets its title from a scene in which Findlay, now a
documentary filmmaker, asks for a second take of an interview with
the mother of a murder victim _ and asks if the poor woman could
cry more tears this time.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who cover Canadian TV not only say that it's hard to
tell where Finkleman ends and Findlay begins, they also often
transpose the names in conversation _ saying Ken when they mean
George, and vice versa. You wouldn't think that Finkleman would
want to be identified so closely with someone as morally challenged
as Findlay, a guy who hires an attractive ski bunny as an assistant
even though she's less qualified than a lesbian feminist candidate,
and whose misguided flirtation with a young children's-show
producer lands him in sexual-harassment hot water. But it's enigmas
such as these that have made Finkleman a very big deal in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the appeal is really the mystery of whether it's
Finkleman or Findlay,'' says John Doyle, a TV critic for the
Toronto Globe and Mail, which named Finkleman one of the 40 most
influential people in Canadian television in 1999. ``Ken Finkleman
is very clever in offering this character who resembles himself
very much in physical presence, but the real Ken Finkleman can be
harder to pin down. He's an absolute chameleon; he can be utterly
different from George Findlay, and then he can be exactly the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonia Zerbisias, the TV columnist at the Toronto Star, is a
little more direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a character that's not really him,'' she says. ``I think
that Ken would like to put out the impression that he's a
lady-killer, but he's really quite dedicated to the woman he's been
with for several years. (The character) is just the worst of Ken
brought up to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at one point, Zerbisias describes Finkleman as a
giant egotist and refers to him with a seven-letter synonym for
``jerk,'' but then she goes on to say, ``The guy's an enormous
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkleman's series, which skewer the media, corporate politics,
modern notions of romance and whatever else catches their creator's
attention, reflect not only his chameleonic tendencies, but his
spongelike traits as well. He seems to soak up all that's around
him, especially the foreign films that he loves. He followed ``More
Tears'' with ``Foolish Heart,'' a dramatic anthology series that
looks at the darker side of love and offers a huge shift in tone
from his satires. The first two episodes _ one of which is largely
in French and Armenian with subtitles _ evoke images from works by
Altman, Potter, Carver, Michelangelo Antonioni, Francois Truffaut
and Jean-Luc Godard.

U.S. COMPANIES REACH FOR OLYMPIC GOLD

<P>
   (UNDATED) No one can buy an Olympic victory.
</P>
<P>
   But dozens of corporations are trying to buy the aura of pride,
hope, patriotism and success that surrounds the Olympic Games. They
will wear it like a gold medal, flashing their Olympic connection
at consumers to suggest their products are tops.
</P>
<P>
   The best doesn't come cheap. The Olympics rely on corporate
sponsors to fund quadrennial orgies of construction and
entertainment. The 2000 Games, which start Sept. 15 in Sydney,
Australia, will cost $2.28 billion -- 63 percent more than the $1.4
billion budget for the 1996 Atlanta Games. Nations, teams and
athletes sell sponsorships, too.
</P>
<P>
   American companies such as Nike and Adidas America each will
spend millions of dollars on marketing the Games and making
products for Olympic personalities. Nike alone will spend more than
$50 million on the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Top sponsors in Sydney paid far more than $100 million apiece.
That cost has more than doubled during the past two Olympics, said
Jens Bang, a sports marketing expert with Cone Communications in
Boston. And companies must pay lots of costs beyond the sponsorship
price for expenses such as advertising, TV time and sending
executives and guests to the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Such huge investments in the Sydney Games look risky for several
reasons. There are fears that many people, especially Americans,
will pay relatively little attention to these Games. But companies
and sports marketers alike say they have faith that the Games are
always widely watched and loved. They offer an unmatched chance to
associate your product with excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every product, if it's going to position itself well, has got
to be able to say it's the best something, even if it's the best
cheap beer,'' said Rick Burton, director of Warsaw Sports Marketing
Center at the University of Oregon. ``What the Olympics does is
deliver bestness.''
</P>
<P>
   Several spoilers could dim the luster of Sydney's games for
marketers. The Olympics have been tainted by scandals recently,
including allegations of bribery in the 2002 Winter Olympics in
Salt Lake City and a ticketing scheme in Sydney that siphoned the
best seats off to powerful companies. Australia is a relatively
small sporting goods market, its more than 18 million residents
about equal to the population of New York state. That means fewer
sales chances for sponsors in the Games' host market. Although most
Olympics draw lots of interest, U.S. residents won't see live TV
from Sydney because of the time difference. That could cut the
number of people who watch the Olympics -- and the related ads.
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard to measure how much benefit companies extract
from their pricey sponsorships, Bang said. Only extensive
before-and-after surveys can tell how many more consumers know a
brand, and that can be difficult to value. Meanwhile, competing
companies can get similar boosts on the cheap by skipping official
sponsorships and running less costly ads featuring sports themes or
a few athlete endorsers.
</P>
<P>
   But marketers and corporate executives brush aside such fears,
relying on a combination of past experience with Olympic marketing
and gut-level faith that the Games have qualities that are unique
and contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these Sydney games are going to be incredibly
well-celebrated,'' Burton said. ``The world is largely at peace,
and Sydney is a spectacular place.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Columbia Sportswear Co., based in Portland, Ore.,
hope to tap that spirit with an unusual marketing deal. The company
has paid an undisclosed amount to outfit the NBC broadcast crew for
this and the next Games. The company will send about 15,000 items
to Sydney. Officials say they get lots of TV time in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exposure that the Olympics generate for the brand ...
really puts it close to the top of brand-building efforts we have
planned in the next several years,'' said Dan Hanson, the company's
marketing communications director.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Big, global sportswear companies such as Nike and Adidas see the
Olympics as an important venue, marketers said. Some sports events,
such as the World Cup, are more closely followed than the Olympics
in certain nations. But Burton said no sports event is more broadly
followed around the world than the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cuts across different countries and sports,'' said Kathryn
Reith, a spokeswoman for Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore. ``As a
result, it really pulls in a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   By clothing athletes and teams from dozens of nations, and
tailoring their marketing campaigns to specific countries, Nike and
Adidas use the Olympics to pitch themselves as a local brand in
nations throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, Nike is hanging a 187-foot-high billboard on a
building overlooking Sydney's harbor. The ad for Nike, which has
paid to sponsor and outfit all the Australian teams, shows three of
the nation's athletes who are also Nike endorsers. Outside
Australia, Nike will run distinct ads tailored to other nations,
featuring local athletes. The company's Olympics-related Web site
will run in eight languages and feature athletes from the same
nation as the computer users accessing the site.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas is running a global ad campaign, stressing that it makes
products for 26 of the 28 Olympic sports. Like Nike, the German
company is tailoring other ads to specific nations. Within the
United States, for instance, Adidas America, also based in
Beaverton, plans ads and Web sites featuring U.S. athletes
discussing training.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the marketing, Nike and Adidas officials
say, is the Olympic opportunity to make and show flashy new
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really gives our designers a chance to stretch their
imagination and not worry about, `What is this going to cost?'''
Nike's Reith said. ``The work that went into choosing fabrics and
figuring out what's going to work was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Nike and Adidas spend years working on their Olympic
designs. They spend months making piles of products. Nike will send
about 120,000 pieces of clothing and several thousand pairs of
shoes to Australia for the 2,000 athletes with which it's working.
Adidas works with 4,000 of the Games' 10,000 athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The Games' wide range of events forces the companies to work on
some weird products. Nike had to make team handball shoes and
supply equestrian products. Adidas developed a Kevlar-laced
weightlifting suit to help strongmen roll weight bars up their
thighs and asymmetric fencing shoes -- one for the foot you lunge
with, one for the foot you drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't necessarily reap a lot of financial reward for that
product,'' Adidas America spokeswoman Nicole Vollebregt said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports companies will make sales on other products, though --
either on goods inspired by Olympic apparel or on souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the styles worn in competition go directly into stores
for sale. Nike will introduce a whole new line of track-and-field
shoes this holiday taken from its Olympic designs. The companies
also sell less-expensive versions of Olympic designs, or items that
incorporate some new Olympic features. Adidas will sell shoes
featuring a new Z-shaped track spike that debuts at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Such goodies provide a nice sales boost for the sports
companies, although just how nice is hard to say. The Summer
Olympics impact is mixed in with gains from the back-to-school
buying season, the sports industry's top sales time.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Ivester, Nike's global brand director for the Olympics,
said the company always sees its sales rise after the Olympics, but
she doesn't know by how much. She said the Olympics definitely
gives Nike its money's worth as a marketing investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at where the opportunity is to make a statement
about which is the brand for athletes, and a brand that pushes'' to
the cutting edge, she said, ``the Olympics is definitely the
biggest marketing opportunity.''

PUBLISHERS   OVERWHELM   THE FRENCH   WITH BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ So the long vacation is over, classes have resumed, and
the French are once again being bombarded with books. Not
schoolbooks, please note, but no fewer than 557 new novels, all
published within a two- or three-week period, all timed to coincide
with ``la rentree'' _ the return _ to work, to school, to the
theater, to restaurants _ that takes place en masse across France
in early September.
</P>
<P>
   True, publishers everywhere know the seasons that are best for
business, yet ``la rentree litteraire,'' or literary return, seems
peculiarly French because it is not good for business. Editors,
book sellers and critics agree that the market cannot absorb the
flood of new books, that many are doomed to sink even before they
appear. But the tradition goes on: since 1991, the wave of fiction
has grown by 50 percent, with a new record being set this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uneconomical,'' said Pierre-Louis Rozynes, the news
editor of Livres Hebdo, a French weekly devoted to the publishing
industry. ``It's simply illogical to bring out so many books at a
moment when the French have no money left after the vacations, when
they're busy readjusting to school and work. But it's like the
fashion shows: all the publishers want to parade their authors,
always hopeful that one will catch the public's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it is hard for the annual phenomenon to go unnoticed
by the reading public. As in previous years, since late August
weekly magazines and daily newspapers have been proclaiming its
arrival with special supplements and lengthy articles in which the
books of a lucky few novelists have been singled out for praise. No
less typically, articles have also been lamenting what Le Monde
last week called the ``permanent inflation'' of new books every
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Press coverage is itself one good reason to publish at this
time. A book is more likely to be reviewed and an author more
likely to be profiled now than at any other time in the year,
although Rozynes, for one, believes this does more for egos than
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press, book critics and authors belong to the same world
that is basically talking to itself,'' he said. ``But the
relationship between articles published and books sold is quite
disproportionate.''
</P>
<P>
   These articles nonetheless serve to draw up an initial list of
20 or 30 French novels _ this year's crop comprises 347 French and
210 translated novels, plus 460 nonfiction books _ considered
worthy contenders for the literary prizes awarded here every
November. Because these prizes, notably the Goncourt, Femina and
Renaudot, virtually guarantee sales of 200,000 or more copies of
winning novels, they too stimulate the onslaught. In reality at
least half the time the top prizes go to novels from one of the
three main ``literary'' publishers, Gallimard, Grasset and Le
Seuil, yet this does not prevent smaller or more commercial houses
from joining the race in the hope of a surprise. The ``literary''
three, though, frequently select and promote their novels for this
season with the prizes specifically in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is the choice of the publishers,'' said Antoine
Audouard, whose new novel, ``Adieu, Mon Unique,'' or ``Goodbye, My
Only One,'' has just been published by Editions Gallimard, ``and
what they have in mind _ and what I have in mind if I want to be
honest _ is one of the prizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Audouard is in an unusual situation, however, in that barely a
year ago he was on the other side as director general of Editions
Robert Laffont/Fixot. As an author, he admitted, he was delighted
that his book was one of Gallimard's 15 ``rentree'' novels. But
when he was a publisher, he recalled, he felt that the seasonal
tradition verged on the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term trend is smaller print runs and more new
titles,'' he explained, ``so it becomes like gambling. If you have
more chips your chance of having one that makes money is higher.
But it doesn't help the trade, the quality, the critics or the
readers. It's just a panic. If you talk to any publisher, they'll
say it's wrong. They think that in principle it's right to produce
less _ but that's for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Nora, who recently took over as president and publisher
of Editions Grasset, said there was an overproduction of novels
throughout the year, although the ``inflation'' was coming less
from established houses than from new publishing ventures, which
see the seasonal push as an opportunity to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   But many authors contribute to the autumnal glut by insisting
that their books be released then. ``That puts you in a delicate
position because you can lose them if you refuse,'' Nora said.
</P>
<P>
   For publishers, then, the scramble is to have their books
noticed, first by the press, then by booksellers. As a result books
are being printed earlier each year so they can be sent out, in
final form, by late June to give critics and booksellers time to
read them. ``Since it's costly to print just a few,'' Nora noted,
``you print all your fall books in the spring. That means you order
your print run before you know the views of your sales people.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, because bookshops have limited display and shelf
space, many books timed for the season are now distributed in
mid-August in the hope that they will beat others for good display
places. Struggling to manage the flood of new novels, booksellers
frequently complain that the situation is out of hand, and that it
is increasingly difficult to separate the good from the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``From June, we go to meetings organized by publishers, often
with authors present, to discuss `la rentree litteraire,''' said
Pierrette Berthaume, the fiction buyer for a Left Bank shop that is
owned by Gallimard but also sells books by other houses. ``We know
some authors have a following. Some salesmen may have a good track
record. I also took about 40 books home to read over the summer. We
order at least one copy of every new novel. But inevitably there
are good books that we miss.''
</P>
<P>
   With serious fiction, though, it is apparent that bookshops play
an important promotional role, less through eye-catching displays
common in, say, American book chains than through recommendations
to regular clients. Berthaume, for instance, said that she and her
colleagues gave a special push to books they admire in much the
same way that independent bookshops do in the United States.
``Booksellers have growing influence,'' Nora said. ``In the past
they'd call journalists for tips. Now journalists call them to ask
what is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the sales strategies, there is no disguising that ever
more books are chasing a fairly static number of readers. Further,
polls show that the number of ``big readers'' _ of more than 20
books a year _ is falling, while the number of ``small readers'' _
1 to 5 books a year _ is growing, figures that suggest that serious
fiction sold in bookshops is losing out to paperback potboilers
sold in supermarkets. Rozynes estimated that 60 percent of the new
novels (there are 76 first novels among this year's French crop)
would sell fewer than 5,000 copies each.
</P>
<P>
   Much as France's protected and subsidized movie industry
produces more films than the local market can handle, the abundance
of books also reflects rules designed to help French publishing.
Convinced that independent bookshops are good for society, the
government not only supports them with subsidies but also blocks
the emergence of discount chains by requiring that books be sold at
their cover price.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The government also believes it is helping authors by banning
book advertising on television, the theory being that television
advertising would encourage the phenomenon of best sellers to the
detriment of scores of other less-publicized books. The power of
television is nonetheless demonstrated by book programs that invite
authors to discuss their work, with competition particularly
intense to appear on Bernard Pivot's weekly ``Bouillon de
Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a cutthroat business culture in French publishing
is no less evident in the way editors and writers deal directly
with each other rather than through literary agents. A handful of
agents sell foreign books for publication in translation, but the
idea of a literary agent hawking a book to various publishers in
search of a mega-advance is still unheard of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to book fairs some of my foreign colleagues ask me
what I have bought,'' Nora said. ``My job is not to buy a book from
an agent. It is to convince an author to write a book. The right
question is, what have I commissioned?''
</P>
<P>
   For all the singularity of the way French publishing operates,
it does have the effect of defending French culture. Just as the
French can see more locally made movies than other Europeans,
French authors are featured more prominently on national
best-seller lists than their fellow writers in, say, Germany, Italy
or Spain. If ``la rentree litteraire'' is true to form, this will
be even more the case between now and Christmas.

 UNDATED: Jean-Luc Godard. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's funny to be called derivative,'' Finkleman says. ``Take
other successful shows on television _ `West Wing' or `Roseanne' or
any big show _ they don't say that they're derivative when they are
actually all derivative. But being derivative is an interesting
idea. Because you get things from the culture. This is part of the
culture. Those films are part of the culture. So yeah, I do it
shamelessly.'' So shamelessly that an episode of ``Foolish Heart''
not only makes a verbal reference to Godard's counterculture '60s
film ``Masculine-Feminine,'' it also shows a clip from the movie
and shoplifts from Godard's unconventional filmmaking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The Findlay character appears briefly in the first episode of
``Foolish Heart,'' with Findlay pretending to be a director named
Peter. The opening shots reveal a huge soundstage as the director
blathers on to an unseen interviewer. An actress goes through a
prop door, and suddenly everything has changed _ we've gone into
something that resembles a TV soap opera, and the story of a
star-crossed affair begins. By the sixth episode, Peter/George/Ken
has become part of the soap opera, as the director has an affair
with a writer who has been shadowing him on the set.
</P>
<P>
   It's house-of-mirrors television, and it doesn't aim at the
lowest common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that the only person in the audience is me,''
Finkleman says. ``That's my only standard. And I bet that to a
certain extent that I'm not a complete freak. I'm sure that to a
certain extent I have similar taste to a large number of people out
there. But why apply any other standard? It's senseless. What it
does is it seems to transform the material into something that is
similar to other material, rather than a sort of idiosyncratic
feeling and attitude. I tend to think that people actually like to
see something that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkleman knows what he's rebelling against, and in part, it's
his previous self: As a Los Angeles-based writer, he foisted the
legendary flop ``Grease 2'' onto an unsuspecting public. His first
feature directing credit was ``Airplane II: The Sequel,'' a
watered-down follow-up to the zany 1980 hit. His most high-profile
U.S. credit is probably the 1986 Judge Reinhold comedy ``Head
Office,'' a movie that actually has earned a small cult of
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That work in LA has as much influence on what I'm doing here
as when I was a parking-lot attendant during the summer going to
school,'' Finkleman says dismissively. ``They're the equivalent of
how much they influence what I'm doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkleman retreated to his native Canada, where he began working
on his string of series for Canadian Broadcasting Corp., a
public-broadcasting service. It was there, observers say, that he
got the freedom that he couldn't find in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is done for a public broadcaster that does not really
care about offending anyone,'' Zerbisias says. ``So it can be out
there in a way that it can't on American television.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it can _ it just seems to be taking the wrong route.
PBS may have picked up ``The Newsroom,'' but few affiliates gambled
on it, and many that did pulled it after as few as three episodes.
PBS has picked up some of Finkleman's other series, but their
airing is even more doubtful. That's unfortunate because the effect
of Finkleman's series is cumulative; one TV writer theorized that
critics love his shows more than viewers because critics can watch
whole series uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Zerbisias _ who dismisses PBS as ``the Mobil-funded network'' _
believes that Finkleman's work belongs on a pay-cable outlet such
as HBO. Right now, the easiest place to find ``The Newsroom'' is on
video _ it's available through Amazon.com _ though none of
Finkleman's other series has made it to tape.
</P>
<P>
   Finkleman's latest series, ``Foreign Objects,'' wrapped
production in late August and is expected to air on the CBC in
early 2001. It's another dramatic anthology series that promises to
indulge his obsessions even more than ``Foolish Hearts.'' Findlay
is back to documentary filmmaking this time, examining _ according
to a CBC Web site _ such subjects as God, evil, the body and
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very odd,'' Finkleman says. ``You couldn't tell from the
scripts what the show was about, because the scripts were simply
the first part of the process and the second part was the
directing. It was like having half a jigsaw puzzle put together.
You couldn't see it till it was directed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the jigsaw puzzle of Finkleman and Findlay, even
Finkleman doesn't seem to have figured that one out. Some people
say he's exactly like Findlay; other say he's the nicest, sincerest
guy in the world. Finkleman waves off the question by saying that
it's irrelevant _ and then makes an attempt to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Findlay changes from series to series, but at one point
during ``The Newsroom,'' I said, `Well, he's just sort of my darker
side _ he's my unedited id,''' he says. ``We all have thoughts that
we don't necessarily act upon because we're social people and we do
have a moral compass and an ethical compass, and no matter what
thoughts or ideas or impulses go through or heads, we tend to have
this other system which controls our behavior. So there's a little
bit of (my) id in George, I admit it.''

 &HT;    BUSH'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN UNVEILED
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling Medicare ``too vital to be neglected,'' George W. Bush
announced a $158 billion plan Tuesday to help seniors pay for
prescription drugs and to improve benefits and shore up finances of
the health program that ensures millions of elderly Americans. His
proposal, made in Allentown, Pa., would pay at least one-fourth of
the cost of prescription drug coverage, whether seniors choose a
new Medicare benefit or a private plan. The elderly poor would get
drug plans for free. And under the proposal, health plans that
participate in Medicare would be required to provide a prescription
drug benefit. Medicare currently offers no prescription coverage.
Al Gore, who wants a more expansive prescription plan added to
Medicare, said Bush's plan wouldn't do enough for millions of
middle-class seniors.
</P>
<P>
   GORE RETURNS TO INTERNET FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore urged massive new investments in technology education
Tuesday. He went to Resource Marketing Inc., a Web site development
company in Columbus, Ohio, to make his pitch to move the nation
into ``the new economy'' based heavily on information technology.
He said the cutting-edge focus on computers should make sure that
low-income residents are brought along. ``I'd like to see
storefront computing centers in neighborhoods where computers are
not readily available,'' he said. Gore often casts himself as an
advocate of emerging technologies, but after being stung by
criticism of his claims concerning creation of the Internet, he has
been relatively quiet on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   GORE BUDGET DETAILS COMING UP
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore plans to offer a new wave of budget details today. In
the meantime, his senior economic aides are laying out a detailed
critique of George W. Bush's tax cut and spending proposals, which
they claim would lead to huge budget deficits. In their analysis,
Gore aides assign numbers to various Bush proposals and the latest
projections of the nation's budget surplus to claim the Texas
governor's approach would create a trillion-dollar deficit problem
over 10 years. Bush aides challenged Gore's assumptions and
conclusions, saying his predictions aren't to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN FINDS PLACE FOR SCHOOL PRAYER
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman said today that religion should be part of public
life, and that politicians have an obligation to make America's
``moral future better by the tone we set.'' He acknowledged that
some of his comments about faith have been misconstrued, including
his use of a quote from George Washington's farewell address: ``I
never felt that he meant that religion was the only source of
morality, but in an open society he was saying religion is one good
source of good values,'' Lieberman said on ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' He voiced support for parents who launch independent,
public prayers from the stands before high school football games,
saying ``God bless them,'' but backed the Supreme Court's ban on
school prayer as ``an official authority, a government, saying you
must pray in this particular way.''
</P>
<P>
   NADER TAKES ON HEMP RESTRICTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader joined people who want to grow and market industrial
hemp in criticizing federal agencies for making it difficult for
farmers to grow the crop. The Green Party presidential candidate,
in Washington, also spoke out against a recent raid on a South
Dakota Indian reservation in which federal agents seized at least
2,000 plants described as industrial-grade hemp plants by the
crop's owner. Hemp cannot be grown commercially in the U.S. because
it belongs to the same family as marijuana, although Nader pointed
out that the levels of hallucinogenic THC are far lower in hemp
than in marijuana. ``It is analogous to consuming poppy seed bagels
or nonalcoholic beer,'' he said. ``Although these foods both have a
small psychoactive component, people do not abuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDS OF EARTH A FRIEND OF GORE
</P>
<P>
   The national environmental group Friends of the Earth endorsed
Al Gore Tuesday after agonizing over whether to support Ralph
Nader. The group, which has been critical of Gore and the Clinton
administration, ultimately sided with the Democrats after deciding
that endorsing Nader would only help elect Republican George W.
Bush, said Brent Blackwelder, head of the organization. ``There is
a Grand Canyon of difference'' between Gore and Bush, Blackwelder
said. But, ``while Nader has a platform with which we are largely
in agreement, the fact is that third parties don't win presidential
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN TALKS UP TARGETED TAX CUTS
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman sat at at a table at a coffee house in Peoria,
Ill., Tuesday, talking with families about challenges they face:
how to pay for long-term care for an elderly parent, how to afford
college expenses, what to do about child care costs. He sought to
reassure middle-class taxpayers that Al Gore's plans for targeted
tax relief would help them more than an across-the-board tax cut
proposed by George W. Bush. ``We've come a long way in the last
eight years, so we've got a lot to be grateful for, but now the
question is now how do we use the prosperity we have?'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ADS HIT BUSH HEALTH CARE RECORD
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee plans TV spots bashing George
W. Bush on health care this week, pointing to a federal court order
to improve poor children's care in Texas and insisting: ``Bush's
record: It's becoming an issue.'' The ad will begin airing Thursday
in nine key states, but Democrats unveiled it Tuesday as Bush was
announcing a plan to provide prescription drug coverage for
seniors. ``George Bush says he has a plan to improve children's
health care,'' an announcer says in the 30-second spot. ``But why
hasn't he done it in Texas?'' Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett countered
that Texas has enrolled a record number of children in the
state-federal Medicaid program under the governor's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS DOMINATE SUMMER AD WAR
</P>
<P>
   More than $1 million in TV ads poured into Detroit in August,
wooing voters in one of the presidential contest's most crucial
states. It was a lopsided spending spree: 69 percent of the ads
boosted Al Gore or criticized his rival, George W. Bush. It was the
same story in every corner of the country, helping explain how Gore
turned a solid lead by Bush into a deadheat race by Labor Day. The
Democrats spent $35 million over the summer compared to about $25
million by the Republicans. ``You just can't let the other side
spend that many more dollars than you,'' said Kenneth Goldstein of
the University of Wisconsin, who is analyzing the ad spending of
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-DEMOCRATIC TIES CLEARED
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission apparently has concluded that
close ties between organized labor and the Democratic National
Committee during the 1996 election campaign were not illegal. USA
Today reported today that FEC general counsel Lawrence Noble
concluded the level of coordination between labor spending and
party officials would have been illegal if not for a federal court
ruling last year that imposed a stricter standard for determining
illegal coordination. Republicans complained that the AFL-CIO spent
as much as $35 million to help Democrats in the 1996 elections,
much of it on TV ads, and that the level of coordination between
labor and party officials made the spending illegal.
</P>
<P>
   MIXING IN WITH POLKA AND KIELBASA
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney danced the polka with a Polish beauty queen, spoke a
little Polish and dished out a few plates of kielbasa and stuffed
cabbage in Chicago on Labor Day. Cheney, whose campaign style has
sometimes been described as aloof in recent weeks, shed his
motorcade and rode the El to the Taste of Polonia festival. At the
festival, he greeted the crowd in Polish. ``Sto lat,'' Cheney said,
or, ``May you live 100 years.'' Then he spoke about his role as the
secretary of defense under President Bush. ``We were proud to work
with all of you to help bring down the wall and free the peoples of
Eastern Europe,'' he said, to applause.
</P>
<P>
   STEPPING OFF IN DIFFERENT PATHS
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates for the Senate from New York could not have
found two more disparate neighborhoods to mark Labor Day, what is
traditionally viewed as the first day of the general election
campaign. Rick Lazio was in Clarence Center, a Republican dot of a
town 20 miles outside Buffalo, stepping briskly down narrow streets
lined with trees and single-family homes in a firefighters' parade
to waves of applause and shouts of support. At the other end of the
state, Hillary Clinton marched in a West Indian parade through one
of the most solidly Democratic parts of New York, the Crown Heights
section of Brooklyn. She crisscrossed the street reaching for hands
amid the cacophony of shouts of support and calypso music blaring
from floats.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARIES IN FLORIDA AND NEVADA
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas faced nine candidates in a bid for
a second term today after months of tumult over the Elian Gonzalez
case. But primary elections featuring open Senate seats in Florida
and Nevada promised little suspense as favored candidates in both
parties faced lesser-known opponents or none at all. In Florida,
Rep. Bill McCollum should have an easy time in the Republican
primary to fill retiring Republican Sen. Connie Mack's seat. On the
Democratic side, Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson also is
expected to breeze to victory. In Nevada, Republican John Ensign, a
former House member, is the overwhelming favorite against two
little-known opponents in a GOP primary for the Senate seat being
vacated by retiring Democrat Richard Bryan.

</P>
<P>
   THEATER-NEW-SEASON (New York) _ Ben Brantley surveys the
upcoming Broadway season, which includes the return of Edward
Albee, one of the handful of working American playwrights to whom
the word ``great'' adheres easily and a dramatist who rarely fails
to exasperate and never fails to intrigue, as well as the return of
Alan Bates in ``The Unexpected Man.''

<P>
   SEUSSICAL-THEATER (New York) _ Broadway is becoming more
preoccupied with the needs of an age group that in the past it
rarely catered to _ children _ while holding on for dear life to
the adult audience that has sustained it. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SEASON (Undated) _ Elvis Mitchell surveys the upcoming film
season, which he says will be a season of radical departures, with
an astonishing number of musicals from directors new to the genre
and an action film from a director who made his name with finely
tuned pictures based in the comedy of manners.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-LEAN-SEASON (Undated) _ The film industry's autumnal hopes
seem to be pinned, for the moment, on a live-action adaptation,
``Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' and an updating of
the '70s television show ``Charlie's Angels,'' which not even those
of us who decorated our bedrooms with pictures of its
crime-fighting stars ever considered a work of art. And there are
further signs that cinematic seriousness has fallen on hard times.
By A.O. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ZELLWEGER (Los Angeles) _ Renee Zellweger has all the
trappings of a rising Hollywood starlet: the blond hair, the thin
frame, the bee-stung lips, the homespun childhood in Texas, no
formal acting training and a boyfriend who gets $20 million per
picture. But Zellweger, though best known for playing Tom Cruise's
girlfriend in her breakthrough role in ``Jerry Maguire'' in 1996
and, more recently, Jim Carrey's girlfriend in this summer's ``Me,
Myself and Irene,'' is not simply another actress who has succeeded
by perfecting the art of playing herself. By Dana Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   AFFLECK-FILM (Hollywood) _ Since wafting into the public
consciousness three years ago in ``Good Will Hunting'' _ a film for
which he shared a screenwriting Oscar with his co-star and Little
League teammate, Matt Damon _ Ben Affleck has emerged as one of
Hollywood's major heart flutters. When his new romantic drama,
``Bounce,'' is released on Oct. 13, cardiologists across the
country will be on call. By Franz Lidz.
</P>
<P>
   BLAIRWITCH-FILM (Los Angeles) _ No matter who does it, making a
sequel to a hit film is one thing; making a sequel to a phenomenon
is another. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   DEVIL-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Lately, and almost unnoticed the
Devil has been getting his due on the silver screen. For the new
season, ``Bedazzled'' stars Brendan Fraser as a nerdy young man who
surrenders his soul to a very seductive Devil played by Elizabeth
Hurley. ``Little Nicky'' stars Adam Sandler as Satan's good son,
Harvey Keitel as Satan and Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father. In
``Lost Souls,'' a thriller, Winona Ryder plays a devout
schoolteacher who becomes aware of a Satanic conspiracy. And the
granddaddy of them all, ``The Exorcist,'' will be rereleased with
additional material never shown before. By Jamie Malanowski.
</P>
<P>
   VAMPIRE-FILM (Undated) _ When E. Elias Merhige's ``Shadow of the
Vampire,'' with its attention-snagging stars John Malkovich and
Willem Dafoe, opens Dec. 29, it will mark at least the fourth time
that filmmakers have resuscitated this particular version of the
vampire: Nosferatu, that disturbingly peculiar and apparently
iconic figure created by an odd little group of Germans 79 years
ago. By Jim Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   CROWE-FILM (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ For Cameron Crowe, it has
always been about rock 'n' roll. That has been the story of his
life and work, starting with his precocious stint as a teenage
journalist with Rolling Stone magazine in the '70s, right on
through his current filmmaking career as a writer and director. In
all his films _ from ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' which
details the normal adolescence he never had, to ``Almost Famous''
(his newest and most autobiographical film), which describes the
extraordinary adolescence he truly had _ rock helps people come of
age. By Bill Desowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS-FILM (Undated) _ Presumably, with the blurring of
once-rigid boundaries between male and female roles, the action
heroine is no longer the anomaly who has to be softened, made
acceptable, by precisely those ``feminizing'' qualities that
undermine her plausibility, threaten to turn her into a harmless
joke. ``Charlie's Angels,'' the movie, will no doubt give us the
real thing: powerful, enterprising women who haven't got time to
look perfect, whose fingernails crack and whose roots grow out, who
give their Bosley (Bill Murray) not girlish giggles but power-grrrl
guff. By Molly Haskell.

   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SEASON (Undated) _ The cleft dividing the composers of the
19th century from those of the 20th is arguably the most prominent
geographical feature of our musical landscape. Two attitudes _ on
how music should sound, how it should feel and what its purpose
should be _ have split audiences, musicians and commentators so
decisively that in still a third century, the 21st, the gap is only
marginally narrower than it was 100 years ago. On consecutive days,
March 2, 3 and 4, 2001, at Carnegie Hall, the sides face each other
in a format of rare concentration and potency. The Vienna
Philharmonic plays; Pierre Boulez conducts. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   SERKIN-MUSIC (New York) _ Peter Serkin has never been an
ordinary virtuoso. His deep concern with the music of living
composers has brought him to work more than most solo pianists in
collaborative contexts and encouraged him to be unconventional in
his programming. So he has all the qualities Judith Arron, the
executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall until her death in
1998, was looking for when she set about inviting a few musicians
to imagine coherent sequences of concerts that they and others
would give at the hall around the time of the new millennium. By
Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ The paradox of pop is that intentions
rarely correspond to results. The most carefully thought out,
elaborately realized musical opus may well be ignored or
repudiated, while a casually tossed off ditty can turn out to be
timeless. Listeners, not musicians, will make the final decisions
about what's worth saving. And in the meantime, fleeting pleasures
will do just fine. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   JOAN-OSBORNE-MUSIC (New York) _ The music business has a long
tradition of making over its female artists, whether it's the
Supremes in finishing school or just the latest battery of stylists
dispatched to a video shoot. What's odd about Joan Osborne's
situation is that she seems to have forced this transformation upon
herself. By Karen Schoemer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-NEW-SEASON (Undated) _ In a television season whose big names
include Bette Midler, Geena Davis and Gabriel Byrne, all starring
in sitcoms, the most promising series belong to Andre Braugher,
David E. Kelley and some guy who looks like David Letterman. Their
shows are not entirely original; let's be realistic, that is not
what most television series do. Yet they accomplish something
equally good, breathing fresh life into traditional genres. By
Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-TV (Undated) _ Two gentle, unobtrusive voices unite the
many seemingly disparate threads that are woven into Bill Moyers'
magisterial documentary on death, ``On Our Own Terms,'' which
begins September 10 on PBS. The first is the voice of Moyers
himself, the temperate sound of a compassionate understanding that
never treads roughshod on the boundaries of another's sorrow. The
other voice is one unheard and yet heard constantly, the more
powerful for being soundless, the more insistent for not needing
words. By Sherwin B. Nuland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PIERRE-GILLES-ART (Paris) _ When Claudia Schiffer posed for
them, she became ``Venus,'' framed by sparkling plastic flowers,
two lovely tears running down her porcelain cheeks. The pop singer
Nina Hagen metamorphosed, improbably, into a beatific Virgin Mary
and, in another image, into a bondage victim, dressed in latex and
roped to a kitchen chair. Catherine Deneuve turned into the ``White
Queen,'' floating among clouds in a gown and tiara. This is the
pop-culture paradise of the French artists Pierre and Gilles, who
use fashion, religion and the star system to create an idealized
universe of their own. Over the next year, that universe is coming
to the United States. By Amy Serafin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-DANCE (New York) _ Diversity, thy name is individuality.
That may well be the message of ``France Moves,'' a major festival
of French contemporary dance that will spread some 10 experimental
troupes in New York from April 24 to May 6. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RELATIONAL-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ The time has come to speak
of ``relational'' design _ buildings that interact with their
surroundings in full dimension instead of dumbly mimicking the
scale and form of their next-door neighbors. In the coming months,
there will be many opportunities to enrich the vocabulary for
talking about architecture in relational terms. Perhaps the most
spirited of these projects is the continuing development of
SPARCity _ Eric Owen Moss' name for the discontinuous loop of urban
development he has been designing for Culver City, Calif. By
Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-SEASON (New York) _ In the year ahead there will be an
amazing variety of private art collections starring in exhibitions
at museums across the country. Three in New York illustrate why
private art collections are formed, why museums exhibit them _ and
in some cases acquire them _ and why museumgoers find them
irresistible. One such show, ``The Embodied Image: Chinese
Calligraphy From the John B. Elliott Collection,'' opens September
15 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   BESTSELLERS, PAPERBACKS and BESTSELLERS-CHILDREN have all moved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Coded `t') &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-MISSISSIPPI (Undated) _ The French settled on the great
river as trappers and traders, and their sturdy colonial homes can
still be seen on both banks some 60 miles south of St. Louis. By
Shirley Christian.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-FRANCE (Undated) _ In Normandy's heartland in mellow
autumn, a traveler fills up with the hearty food and spirit of a
robust area. By Frederick Turner.

FOOD NETWORK OFFERS FOOD GARNISHED WITH A GENEROUS PORTION OF
ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: 2nd take contains brief descriptions of six new shows on
the Food Network.) 
 By   MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My biggest disappointment while previewing the Food Network's
new fall lineup last week was that the ``Naked Chef'' was dressed.
If I dedicate a full half-hour of my life to a scrupulous
inspection of a new Generation Z (yes, he looks that young) kitchen
whiz from England, I expect more in return than a winning smile and
a recipe for vodka-soused watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to concede that Jamie Oliver still managed to hold my
attention, even after he explained that ``naked'' referred to the
food: ``We're stripping down a recipe.'' At least I think that's
what he said; Oliver, who catapulted to BBC stardom after a
producer spotted him cooking in a British restaurant, has a heavy
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters. I wasn't watching the new shows to revel in
the wisdom of such cooking tips as Oliver's advice to ``just bash
the hell out of it.'' What captivated me was how far the Food
Network has evolved from trying to teach people to cook.
</P>
<P>
   While the glitz and silliness of shows like ``Iron Chef'' and
``The Two Fat Ladies'' may have alienated serious cooks, they have
been enormously successful for the network. After a financial
struggle that cost the cable startup an estimated $88 million in
the seven years since its creation, media analysts predict the
network finally will break even this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is thriving by replacing the shows with cooks standing behind
counters _ the sorts of programs that dominated the airwaves during
the first four decades of television _ with shows that are purely
entertainment. This fall's lineup will feature even more of the
escapades, exotic locales and celebrity chefs that have seized
control of the network's prime time schedule in the last couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   With instructional programs relegated to daytime hours, the Food
Network has reserved the coveted prime time slots for ``very sexy
programs that satisfy viewers' cravings for entertainment over
education,'' said Eileen Opatut, the network's senior vice
president of programming.
</P>
<P>
   That means lots of moody, jerky footage of the Naked Chef
wandering around rain-slicked streets buying cheese; think MTV
meets ``The Blair Witch Project'' over appetizers. On another new
show, ``Ming's Quest,'' the celebrity chef Ming Tsai travels around
the country in hot pursuit of the live ingredients he will later
cook on location. Along the way, he dresses in waterproof orange
slicks to haul in lobster traps or a wet suit to dive for abalone
off the California cost. On ``B. Smith With Style,'' the host,
Barbara Smith, barely talks about food at all. Sure, she can
squeeze in a quick segment with Bobby Flay, but count on the
program to focus more on such issues as container gardening and how
to braid hair (``Let's talk about extensions'').
</P>
<P>
   By sacrificing the serious to embrace the ludicrous (no, you did
not dream it, the ``Three Dog Bakery'' show did feature chefs who
cooked for pets), the Food Network has developed from a rinky-dink
channel with six hours of programming recycled four times in each
24-hour cycle into an infotainment colossus whose popularity
reaches far beyond the 50 million American households who subscribe
to its schedule of 31 television shows. Celebrity chefs now parade
around the country _ you can get the New Orleans chef Emeril
Lagasse's autograph if you happen to be in Las Vegas on Sept. 17.
The network's Web site, Foodtv.com, attracts 1.7 million visitors a
month and has a collection of every recipe on every program.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the television network is our core business and will
stay the core business,'' said Judy Girard, the network's general
manager, ``we are in the process of reviewing almost every
department to allow us to develop the brand beyond the actual
network.''
</P>
<P>
   The network bears little resemblance to the cable channel that
its creator, CNN's first president, Reese Schoenfeld, started in
late 1992 with two hours of programming and a jaunty motto: ``A
network for people who eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest programs included ``Getting Healthy,'' a program on
nutrition, ``Food News and Views'' with the co-anchors Donna
Hanover and David Rosengarten delivering updates on the drawbacks
of drinking too much liquor, and ``Eating Lite,'' which featured
low-fat ethnic recipes. The only recognizable celebrity ancestor
was Robin Leach's explorations of the food fetishes of the rich and
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I intended when we started, when it was less
entertainment-oriented than it was instructional, but they've done
a terrific job of broadening the audience,'' said Schoenfeld, who
is writing a book about the history of CNN called ``Me and Ted
Against the World.'' ``In prime time, they have more people under
55 watching them than CNN does.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the popularity?
</P>
<P>
   ``The network has managed to take food and turn it into in a
glamorous hobby,'' said Robert Thompson, the director the Center
for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. ``It
has the same effect as rock 'n' roll on a whole generation of
viewers. We've gotten to a point in our culture where you're hip if
you've discovered the latest hot program on the Food Network.''
</P>
<P>
   The channel's popularity is an indication that its programs
satisfy Americans with a voracious, if contradictory, interest in
food. On one hand, the number of restaurants in the United States
nearly doubled from the early 1970s to the mid 1990s, up to 815,000
from 492,000. On the other? Americans are cooking less. Almost half
of all weekday meals are prepared in a half hour or less, according
to the NPD Group, which studies consumer trends.
</P>
<P>
   But the real success of the Food Network is that despite its
current scarcity of instructional content, ``people kid themselves
into thinking that watching it is an educational experience,'' said
Garth Jowett, who directs the University of Houston's School of
Communication and is writing a book about the social history of
television. ``So while most people see the experience of watching
TV as a guilty pleasure, they feel justified watching these
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the network's current approach emerged in the
mid-1990s, when the network decided to revamp the image of Lagasse.
His ``Essence of Emeril'' had been among the most popular early
Food Network offerings. With ``Emeril Live,'' the network added a
band, a studio audience and celebrity guests to Lagasse's routine
and created the network's first superstar chef; an onslaught of
50,000 callers clamoring for tickets disrupted service at a New
Hampshire call center in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was obvious. ``During prime time, people want
entertainment and you're not going to get a significant number of
viewers with a chef behind the counter,'' said Eric Ober, who was
the network's president from 1998 until early this year and is now
the chief executive of the Internet career services company
Vault.com. ``My feeling was, let's get out of the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we made the decision to do that during prime time, food
would be fun, action, adventure and excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamble paid off. Overall, last year the network had a 0.2
rating, which means that 84,000 people were watching on any given
day, according to Derek Baine, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan
Associates. Before 1999, the network wasn't rated, which is not
uncommon for small operations. That rating doesn't put the Food
Network at the top of the heap _ the largest cable networks, like
USA or TNT, generate a 1 rating. The Food Network is solidly in the
second tier, with a rating more comparable to ESPN2 or Headline
News.
</P>
<P>
   But it is growing. In the last two years, the network has been
picked up by cable operators across the country, and the number of
homes where it is available has nearly doubled, up from 28 million
to 50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impressive that they've been able to sign on that many
subscribers in their short life, especially when you consider that
there are only 100 million TV households in the United States,''
Baine said. ``They're in half of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes me wonder: what are all those households eating for
dinner tonight? Not the vodka watermelon, I hope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Food Network is unveiling six new shows this season. Two
were not available for preview: a dessert show called ``Sweet
Dreams,'' scheduled for next month, and one yet unnamed starring
Wolfgang Puck, to premiere in January. I watched episodes of the
other four. All times are Eastern Standard Time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``B. SMITH WITH STYLE''
</P>
<P>
   Weekdays at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Smith, the lifestyle guru and owner of B. Smith's
restaurant in the Theater District, is the host of a show on
entertaining, lifestyle and cooking. Watch if you want to know
whether dry shampoos are an option for braided hair that comes
loose in water. Don't watch if you want to grill a chicken; in a
guest appearance, Bobby Flay promised it would take only 14 minutes
to cook. Mine was pink after 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``MELTING POT''
</P>
<P>
   Weekdays at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A rotating group of five sets of chefs explore various ethnic
cuisines. I watched two Manhattan chefs, Aaron Sanchez, the chef at
Isla, and Alex Garcia, the chef at Calle Ocho, prepare a Latino
cocktail party. The menu included white anchovy salad,
habanero-marinated shrimp and yucca fritters. Garcia confided, ``I
love to be a guest at my own party.'' Maybe that explains all the
dancing in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``MING'S QUEST''
</P>
<P>
   Thursdays at 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ming Tsai, the star of ``East Meets West With Ming Tsai,''
demonstrates his athleticism as well as his chopping skills as he
farms ostriches in Texas or dives for lobster in Massachussetts,
then cooks his catch. The lobster, for example, was grilled with
garlic and black pepper, with the sea in the background and the
wind ruffling his bangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAKED CHEF''
</P>
<P>
   Previews Oct. 29 at 10 p.m.; premieres Nov. 4 at 9:30 p.m.; and
will then be shown on Saturday at 9:30 p.m. &AMP; 12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The winsome Jamie Oliver is the latest cooking sensation from
the BBC. We see him shop for clothes, and for food. His parties are
casual, and so are his cooking techniques: for instance, to avoid a
spatter of lime juice and garlic from a monster-size mortar and
pestle, he grabs a plastic grocery bag and drapes it over the top
of the bowl. At the end of the show, he serves his guests on paper
plates. &QL;

`TURN IT UP': THE KILLER AS SUFFERING ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If your music is so important to you, why do you keep up this
Batman and Robin s--- with Gage every night?''
</P>
<P>
   The question is posed to our hero, aspiring rap artist and
part-time drug courier Diamond, or D for short (played by former
Fugees member turned solo rap star Pras), by his eternally
forgiving girlfriend Kia (Tamala Jones).
</P>
<P>
   You've seen it before in dozens of films: the childhood street
buddies turned adult best friends who hit the crisis point when one
of them, in this case D, wants to go straight and the other,
hot-headed Gage (rapper Ja Rule), aspires to become the baddest
gangsta on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe the warmed-over and contradictory cliches about
loyalty and responsibility served up in ``Turn It Up,'' a hip-hop
crime thriller about a guy torn between dreams of music stardom and
the .32-caliber muscle of blazing handguns. The real answer to
Kia's question is that for all D's lip service to leaving the life,
and for all the film's superficial moral lessons, he is a
cool-headed, criminally sharp gangster at heart. He just doesn't
know it, and the film is too embarrassed to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   D's absent father (Vondie Curtis-Hall), a musician who abandoned
his family to follow his music, comes back into his son's life to
hand out paternal advice just as Kia reveals to D that she is
(surprise!) pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't guarantee I'll be there for you,'' tortured, torn
artist D lamely sputters to Kia before heading back out for a night
of music and gunplay, coming to life with two-fisted ferocity as he
coolly empties clip after clip into rival gangs. (By the end of the
film, he has over a dozen kills to his credit without fear of
retribution or arrest, let alone any moral pangs.)
</P>
<P>
   Director/screenwriter Robert Adetuyi consciously apes John Woo
in flashy but half-hearted action scenes without ever getting it
right, and he never worries about reconciling them with the
wan-suffering-artist pose D strikes through the rest of the film.
Pras is too withdrawn to make that pose convincing. Looking more
sleepy than introspective, he's a burned-out match next to
firecracker Ja Rule, who plays the loose-cannon bad boy with
pent-up anger and a bullying sneer.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a trace of irony as this glib, sense-numbing action
fantasy has it both ways: violence without personal consequences
and decisions without repercussions. It's a rather irresponsible
position for a film ostensibly about responsibility.
</P>

&HT;     THE CAMPAIGN AS A MATHEMATICAL EXERCISE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The California earthquake on Sunday surprised
professional seismologists. In all their years of studying and
searching for possible tremblers they had missed the fault line
along which this one occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Well, well. The experts were fooled by Mother Nature _ just as
other so-called experts can be fooled by Human Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, too, is an inexact science. In fact, it is not a
science at all but a grand, erratic democratic experiment in the
conduct of ambitious but fallible humans under pressure as they
pursue legislative or executive power.
</P>
<P>
   This reality has not deterred seven political scientists from
creating mathematical formulas on which they base their ultimate
presidential year prediction. They conclude that the winner will be
Vice President Al Gore, based primarily on the current economic
prosperity, President Clinton's continuing high job approval
ratings and the candidates' standings on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   What a hoot. If these scholars are right, nothing Gore or Texas
Gov. George W. Bush does or says in the next two months will matter
to voters at all. So why are both men spending millions to smear
each other in advertisements, arguing intensely over debate formats
and wearing themselves to a frazzle running all over the country?
</P>
<P>
   Silly candidates. Where have they gone wrong?
</P>
<P>
   The numbers-crunching was presented in official scholarly papers
at a recent annual meeting of the American Political Science
Association. The theory behind this unrealistic exercise is that
numerical precision can be applied to the conditions that shape
public electoral decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush themselves have been trying to take some of the
mystery out of their tense contest by holding focus groups and
taking all kinds of polls to tell them what works with voters and
what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   But these sneaky efforts to figure out which potentially
unpopular positions to bland out and which likely winning stances
to highlight do not tell the whole campaign story.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes candidates get it right. Sometimes they don't. Tongues
get tangled. Messages get distorted. And voters are fickle. What
they want today may not be what they want tomorrow after mulling
over competing campaign claims.
</P>
<P>
   The personality quirks of the candidates, the quality of the
advice they get and the habitual intrusion of unexpected events are
not measurable quantities. The seven experts who predicted the
election outcome could not have anticipated, for instance, that
Bush would be accidentally overheard using an expletive to describe
a reporter he does not like.
</P>
<P>
   He called Adam Clymer, a respected veteran New York Times
correspondent, a term only a few media outlets had the courage to
repeat. Some delicately referred to Bush's aside as ``ass. . .e''
or ``...hole.'' Some said it was an unspecified ``obscenity,'' and
one called it a ``vulgar euphemism for a rectal aperture.'' This
columnist prefers to use the relatively classy ``donkey's bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential candidate who uses language considered too
scatological for the modesty of television viewers and newspaper
readers suddenly tosses a new, unpredictable factor into the White
House race. It may not matter, it may humanize Bush or it may
disgust voters demanding dignity in the presidency. But it was
clearly an unscripted incident that does not fit neatly into any
pre-determined mathematical formula.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial constructs by scholars cannot anticipate the dynamics
of a fast-moving campaign without precedent in past races. This
includes around-the-clock media sound bites and new Internet
venues, constantly changing interracial issues driven by increasing
immigration, uncontrolled, secretly financed spending on so-called
independent commercials, and new clandestine tricks by hidden
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can statistical models evaluate luck, personal weaknesses
and strengths, candidates' health, sudden scandals or unlikely
policy stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   The past may repeat itself, but it never repeats itself exactly.
</P>
<P>
   So why go through this academic exercise at all? The political
scientists claim that their statistical models came up with the
final result in every election since 1952 _ except those that were
very close. In 1996, their predictions were even more accurate than
the Election Day polls.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Anybody who didn't know well in advance that
pre-Monica-Lewinsky, sunny Bill Clinton was sure to beat grumpy
old-timer Bob Dole in 1996 wasn't living in this galaxy. And, gosh,
don't we have a close election on our hands this fall? Send the
professors back to their ivory towers and get on with the campaign.

BORDEAUX THAT REQUIRES NO BODYGUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are one of those pessimists who react with fear and
trembling to even the slightest sign that the economy is cooling,
take some comfort from Bordeaux wine. Prices are just as high as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a personal selection of Bordeaux wines, all of
them good and all of them selling for $30 or less. I won't call
them bargains; for many people $30 is a lot of money to pay for a
bottle of wine. It's only in comparison with top of the line
Bordeaux that this gathering of bottles will begin to look good.
The first growths continue to exist on another planet: the 1998
Lafite-Rothschild is around $175, and the 1998 Haut-Brion around
$275. Both the Petrus and the Chateau Le Pin 1998's hover around
$1,000 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The down-to-earth wines recommended here are mostly from the
1997 vintage, a very good year in Bordeaux if not a memorable one.
The classic Bordeaux ploy _ figure out what the market can bear,
and add 20 percent _ applied to 1997. The wines were overpriced.
But there are some moderately priced ones and, for the most part,
they are ready to drink now. After the movies and most restaurants,
isn't it pleasant not to have to wait for something?
</P>
<P>
   For good Bordeaux at reasonable prices, it's usually prudent to
look first to the lesser appellations like Fronsac and
Canon-Fronsac. But good wines can be found in more prestigious
places, too. In the Margaux appellation, for example, Chateaux
d'Angludet, du Tertre and d'Issan are all priced at $30 or less.
All offer the warmth, soft tannins, medium body and good fruit
characteristic of this vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Prieure-Lichine, in Cantenac, which is part of the Margaux
appellation, gained a reputation for good, occasionally outstanding
wines under the late Alexis Lichine. The 1997 is light, pleasant
and ... well, inconsequential. Better, perhaps, to opt for the
appealing and more substantial 1997 Chateau Giscours at about the
same price _ $27 _ and wait for the 1998 Prieure, which I'm told is
a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   From Moulis, one of the towns just west of Margaux, I like
Malmaison, a property rejuvenated by the late Edmond de Rothschild
as a companion piece to his Chateau Clarke. Poujeaux, long a worthy
competitor for wines far better known, is my favorite here for its
intensity. But for the price, around $20, the more rounded
Malmaison provides some very pleasant drinking. The Poujeaux is
selling for around $27.
</P>
<P>
   A third Moulis property worth mentioning is Chateau
Chasse-Spleen, whose 1997 is a bit more tannic than the two above
and a trifle leaner. Many people like that in a Bordeaux. It's
about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Among the famous communes of the Medoc, St.-Julien has always
been noted for its rounder, more approachable wines. Much in that
image is the 1997 Les Fiefs de Lagrange, the second wine of Chateau
Lagrange. Lagrange itself is a full, elegant wine with firm but not
harsh tannins. Les Fiefs has the same charm but is softer and more
one-dimensional. A most attractive wine at about $22.
</P>
<P>
   From Pauillac, I liked the Carruades de Lafite, at just $30.
This is the second wine of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and, as
expected, it offers Lafite finesse if not the Lafite depth or
length in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the scale is an interesting little
Pauillac property called Chateau Bernadotte. In 1997, May-Elaine de
Lencquesaing, the owner of Chateau Pichon-Lalande, bought
Bernadotte and set about reviving the house and vineyards. The wine
is getting better, and it's about $15.
</P>
<P>
   The Medoc road turns inland just after it passes Lafite, and the
vineyards of St.-Estephe, specifically Cos d'Estournel, come up on
the left. Cos is beyond reach here, but St.-Estephe is not without
its $30-and-under charms. Chateaux Meyney, Les-Ormes-de-Pez and
Phelan-Segur range from about $25 to about $30.
</P>
<P>
   Meyney at times can be rough and tannic. Not so this wine. Like
many St.-Estephes, it has a rough edge, but it is mostly supple and
rounded, with plenty of body and fruit and a long finish.
Les-Ormes-de-Pez is owned by Jean-Michel Cazes and his family, and
its wines regularly display qualities of their Lynch-Bages.
</P>
<P>
   As for Phelan-Segur, I liked it before the Gardinier family
bought it from the Delons in 1986, and I've watch it improve
steadily. The 1997 is solid, well made, with a lovely bouquet. It
is less concentrated than it might be and shows a bit of typical
St.-Estephe muscle, but it's worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Having mentioned Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac, I'm obliged to
suggest a wine from there. I particularly liked Chateau Canon
Moueix, a minor star in the Moueix family's collection of chateaus.
The wine displays the familiar 1997 softness, but there is richness
and some succulent fruit as well. It's about $20.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been much of a fan of half-bottles, but if you like
the idea, there are plenty around. Certainly, they're a way to move
up in quality. Among the 1997 Bordeaux in half-bottles hovering
around $25 are Grand-Puy-Lacoste, Leoville-Barton and
Leoville-Poyferre. Calon-Segur is about $15, Brainaire-Ducru $20
and Lafon-Rochet $15.
</P>
<P>
   Should you choose to go right to the top, in half-bottles, of
course, Haut-Brion and Lafite are both around $72; Chateau Margaux
is $110 and Mouton-Rothschild $129.
</P>
<P>
   They say good things come in small packages. OK, but I'd prefer
a Lynch-Bages at around $50 to any of these pint-size heavy
hitters.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary West stumbled across YourGrocer.com, an online
grocery store, one afternoon a few years ago and quickly became a
fan of its fresh blueberry muffins and fast deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering her groceries by computer made West like any other
shopper, and for this she was grateful. Now, West, who is blind,
does not stand out the way she once did in D'Agostino's or
Gristede's supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a place to do a lot of my shopping,'' said
West, 35, ``because I am visually impaired and I can't read labels
and things on the grocery shelves.'' In the past, she had to rely
on the help of store clerks and friends to shop for groceries and
perform other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Before she had access to online delivery services, shopping had
become so difficult that she had given up, ordering her favorite,
although much less healthful, takeout instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps me out because I have a bad back, bad knees,
diabetes and I can't really go the supermarket anymore,'' said
West, who lives in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. ``Four or five
years ago I was not able to cook my own food because I did not have
any, so I was ordering out, and that was not helping my health or
my pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she uses special voice recognition software to surf the Web
for everything from dishwashing detergent to vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   People like West, who have a temporary or permanent disability
that makes it difficult to handle everyday chores on their own, are
increasingly using online delivery services to rent movies, pick up
cleaning supplies and buy groceries.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of information technology are pronounced in
places like Manhattan, advocates for the disabled say, because
crowded streets, the lack of access for the handicapped to cabs and
subway stations, and other factors complicate their lives.
</P>
<P>
   To the disabled, the growth of online delivery services has been
empowering. To their advocates, it represents progress. To some
owners of such businesses, it has become another piece of a shrewd
business equation. Noble as it may be to help the disabled like
rent a movie from Blockbuster or buy fresh vegetables on their own,
to J. Maxwell Enoch, the chief executive of YourGrocer. com, it is
about capitalizing on a market his company's founders did not even
envision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, the sort of people we are talking about have
found a way to our service,'' Enoch said, ``and it is very
meaningful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   People with permanent disabilities, like West, and those who are
temporarily off their feet, like women recovering after childbirth
and runners with sprained knees, have created a new marketing niche
for Enoch's company, which is based in Eastchester, and serves New
York City and some of its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Manhattan, you are held hostage by the D'Agostinos and the
Gristedes of the world,'' Enoch said in a recent interview. He
noted that those grocery stores are often busy and cannot provide
much attention to a disabled customer. Even when the handicapped
are able to navigate these stores, he added, they often have
difficulty getting the items back home. ``A lot of the things we
carry are heavy,'' Enoch said, and for the disabled, the benefits
of delivery are magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of similar online delivery services said they were
not necessarily trying to attract disabled customers when they
started operating. Most of the businesses, based in Manhattan's
Silicon Alley, focused on reaching young urban professionals,
appealing to a simple desire for convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go where the customers lead us,'' said Skip Trevathan, the
chief operating officer at Kozmo.com, which is based in Manhattan
and delivers many consumer items, including toilet paper and
movies, in cities across the country. ``It obviously was in the
thinking behind the business model, but only in a narrow sense of
people who were homebound for a few days because of something like
pregnancy or an injury.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision has expanded, Trevathan added. Now, the first page
of Kozmo's employee training manual includes a letter from a
disabled customer, Cameo C. Massey. Massey, a single mother in
Seattle who suffers from Epstein-Barr syndrome and has severe nerve
damage from troublesome surgeries, wrote about her difficulties
doing everyday chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself at the mercy of my own limitations,'' Massey
wrote. ``Your service has helped make my life filled with more
quality time. By being able to order books, magazines, movies,
games and food from Kozmo, I find that I am able to feel more in
touch and up to date with normal people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many disabled New Yorkers echo those sentiments. West, who
teaches at the Computer Center for the Visually Impaired People at
Baruch College, said that for the first time in her life, she ``can
handle everything like a sighted person.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo.com officials said they believed that as more disabled
Americans gain access to computers, they would increasingly rely on
online delivery services. A recent Harris poll conducted for the
National Organization on Disability and financed by Aetna U.S.
Healthcare found that adults with disabilities were twice as likely
as the nondisabled to report that the Internet had significantly
improved their lives. But the poll also found that only 43 percent
of the disabled respondents had access to the Internet, compared
with 57 percent of the nondisabled respondents.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Kozmo.com has begun a campaign with the National
Cristina Foundation, a nonprofit organization that brings computer
technology to the disabled, to deliver donated computers to the
doorsteps of disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a partnership with General Motors, Kmart and Microsoft, Heidi
Van Arnem, a Birmingham, Mich., entrepreneur who has been a
quadriplegic since 16, began a national campaign this year, the
10th anniversary of the passage of the Americans With Disabilities
Act, to draw attention to what she calls the ``disability divide.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech she gave when the campaign started, Van Arnem, the
chief executive of I-Can Online, which provides consultant services
to commercial Web sites trying to reach the disabled, said,
``Disabilities disappear with advancements in technology.'' But the
fact that the people who benefit most are the ones most likely not
to have a computer is frustrating, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the online companies beginning to cater to the
disabled ``represent a growing awareness that there is great
opportunity to reach the 85 percent of people with disabilities who
are not online yet, and whose lives stand to be enhanced by
connecting to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harvey, the president of I-Can Online, said in a recent
interview that the disabled population is ``the most underserved
and underattended market in the country'' because the disabled
``are just not in public view. But they spend a trillion dollars a
year on our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four million Americans, about 20 percent of the
population, have disabilities, according to the latest Census
Bureau data. There are about 5.6 million disabled people in New
York City and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Most online delivery companies, Harvey said, began with a
``throw seeds out and watch to see if anything will sprout''
approach and quickly found that the disabled could become one of
their most solid customer bases. Their success has caused other
businesses to ``think about this population and how they want to
reach them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advantages that the Internet offers to the disabled,
technological problems persist. For example, the National
Federation of the Blind has sued America Online, claiming that AOL
violates the Americans With Disabilities Act because its software
is incompatible with many voice recognition programs, known as
assisted technology. The suit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   And advocacy groups have begun lobbying for an amendment to the
Americans With Disabilities Act that would require online companies
to give the handicapped access to the Internet, given the
importance the medium has become in commerce and communication.
</P>
<P>
   Several delivery companies, including YourGrocer.com,
UrbanFetch.com and Amazon.com, have had to deal with similar
technical issues. Even I-Can Online had problems, since corrected,
that made it difficult for voice recognition software to read its
Web pages. The software allows users to control their computers
with their voices instead of keyboards. The computer also reads
text from Web pages, as long as they are formatted properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not take us long to realize that we could not be the
advocates for people with disabilities and not have ramps for our
own people,'' said Harvey, the president of I-Can. ``One of the
elements we now put in our contracts is that the companies will
work to make their sites more accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Many online delivery companies have found, Harvey said, that
improvements that make it easier for the disabled to use their
sites can also appeal to nondisabled customers. For example, voice
recognition software compatibility could be helpful to someone
trying to shop on the Web while driving a car.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges notwithstanding, West sees the improvements for
disabled people as a monumental and empowering turning point. ``It
evens the playing field,'' she said.

THE MINIMALIST: SIMPLE SAUCE WITH A BITE 
</HEADLINE>
  By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creamy horseradish sauce is everywhere these days, from
fast-food joints to serious restaurants. It doesn't seem to be in
the repertory of many home cooks, however, even though it's
absurdly easy to make with not much more than horseradish and sour
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Horseradish-laced sauces are traditionally used with roast beef,
and this version would be wonderful with a good piece of meat. But
I love it on a fillet of crisp fish, sauteed, grilled or broiled.
The best fish is one with edible skin and good, firm texture _
local striped bass is perfect, as are sea bass, red snapper and
grouper.
</P>
<P>
   I use prepared horseradish for my sauce because it works fine.
You can use fresh horseradish if you prefer; just peel it and grate
it (don't touch your eyes until you wash your hands well). But it
won't make the sauce stronger. If you want more horseradish flavor,
use more horseradish.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want it to remain strong, don't cook it _ horseradish
loses its intensity as it cooks, becoming mild, even timid. (A chef
friend of mine cooks horseradish as a vegetable, simmering it in
water until it is tender, and then pureeing it. The result is not
unlike turnip puree; if anything, it's milder.) Add it to the sauce
at the last minute, and make sure the sauce is not too hot. Sour
cream is perfect for this, because it only needs to be gently
warmed to become saucelike. Once the horseradish is stirred in, the
sauce is done.
</P>
<P>
   The fish can be sauteed or grilled, but broiling is easiest. It
takes less than 10 minutes and so little attention that you can
prepare the sauce while the fish is cooking, making this one of the
quickest elegant dishes I know.
</P>
<P>
   STRIPED BASS WITH HORSERADISH SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon neutral oil, like canola, grapeseed or corn
</P>
<P>
   1{ to 2 pounds fillet of striped bass (or red snapper, sea bass
or grouper), skin on and scaled
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   \ cup snipped chives, plus a few chives for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the broiler and adjust the rack so that it is within
four inches of the heat source. Oil the surface of the broiling pan
and place the fillets on top, skin side down. Sprinkle with salt
and cayenne and broil until firm and lightly browned, 5 to 10
minutes, depending on thickness. (The fish is done when it is just
about opaque all the way through, and offers no resistance to a
thin-bladed knife.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, gently warm the sour cream over very low heat in a
small pan, stirring occasionally. While it is heating, add some
salt and cayenne. The sour cream need not get hot and it should
certainly not boil; you just want to take the edge off its chill
and thin it out a bit. Keep it warm while the fish finishes
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the fish is done, stir the horseradish and snipped
chives into the sour cream. Taste and add more horseradish, salt or
cayenne if necessary. Serve the fillets with a bit of the sauce on
each, garnished with a couple of chives.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 CHRON  
 Elegant Dinner Is Easier Than It Looks  &HT;       
 By Tara Duggan 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Hosting a dinner party is not by nature a
quick-and-easy prospect, but you can make even an elegant,
four-course, sit-down dinner a lot easier on yourself if you do as
much as possible ahead of time.
<P>
   At the risk of sounding like a self-help book, the first thing
to do is know your limits. How much time will you need on the day
of the dinner to not only cook but clean the house, wash dishes and
figure out what you're going to wear? How much do you want to
actually be cooking when your guests arrive?
</P>
<P>
   To avoid party-day stress, shop two nights ahead, then set aside
the evening before the dinner to complete the bulk of the prep
work. As notes on top of each recipe indicate, this menu was
designed to be done mostly in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Do yourself a favor and take as many shortcuts as you can. For
the appetizer, Toasted Cumin Pita Crisps with Hummus, I suggest you
buy a good ready-made hummus at a Mediterranean deli or supermarket
(although I include a recipe for die-hards). Then just bake the
pita crisps at the last minute so they come out of the oven hot,
crisp and smelling of toasted spices just as your guests arrive at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   The first course, Shrimp and Artichoke Skewers with Lemon
Tarragon Mayonnaise, uses skewers and is great for a crowd because
they're so easy to serve at the last minute. Look for packages of
shelled, deveined, uncooked jumbo shrimp in the freezer aisle to
avoid the messy task of cleaning them. Everything in this recipe
except the actual cooking _ which takes all of six minutes _ can be
done ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The main course, Roast Pork with Pomegranate Sauce &AMP; Wild
Mushroom Barley Timbales, is full of deep, woodsy flavors that are
the essence of fall. It also looks elegant when it's plated, with
slices of pork on top of a bed of greens. Set them alongside the
timbales, which are miniature drum shapes formed by packing the
cooked barley into ramekins and then baking them.
</P>
<P>
   Start roasting the pork when you serve the first course so you
won't have to wait between courses. When you're ready to serve,
prepare the sauce, dress the greens and reheat the timbales.
Appoint someone to help you rush the carefully composed plates to
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Figs in Rosemary Port Reduction With Vanilla Ice Cream might
sound complicated, but it's really easy. The port is infused with
rosemary and vanilla bean and thickened into a sauce, and then the
figs are gently poached. When you're ready to serve, just reheat
them and ladle them out over dainty scoops of ice cream. A rosemary
sprig garnish imparts a fresh, herbal scent that plays beautifully
against the dessert's rich, decadent flavors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUICK AND EASY DINNER WINES
</P>
<P>
   Keep this theme light and simple with wine as well as food. Here
are some nice wines that you can keep around the house for quick
dinners, and still pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Toasted Cumin Pita Crisps and Hummus.  &LR; The starter has thick
textures and savory flavors so lighten up with a bright sparkler.
Try Chandon Brut Fresco ($11), a fruity sparkling wine from
Argentina, and MezzaCorona Brut, dry and citrusy from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Shrimp &AMP; Artichoke Skewers with Lemon-Tarragon Mayonnaise. &LR; 
With the shrimp you can continue with the sparkling wine, or switch
to a light Chardonnay such as Callaway Chardonnay 1998 or 1999
($10). The crisp acidity will be a refreshing foil to the shrimp,
and the lemon-citrus varietal flavors will work beautifully with
the lemon dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Roast Pork with Pomegranate Sauce &AMP; Wild Mushroom Barley &LR; 
 &UR; Timbales.  &LR; This calls for a lively, flavorful red wine like Syrah.
It has rich, sensuous dry berry flavors, a hint of black pepper,
nuance of forest aromas and softly manageable tannins. One of
America's best, Geyser Peak Sonoma Shiraz 1998 ($17), is an
excellent value.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Figs in Rosemary Port Reduction &AMP; Ice Cream.  &LR; A dessert like
this would be great with an inexpensive port. Although the sauce is
made with Ruby Port, the finished dessert would be better with a
Tawny Port. The figs, with a burnt sugar undertone, and the
luscious flavors and textures of the cream makes the Tawny Port
flavors more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Fonseca makes Tawnies that are creamy and nutty, with hints of
caramel and coffee. For only $12, you can get the regular Fonseca
Tawny Port; for a little more, lose your heart to the seductive
Fonseca 10 Year Old Tawny Port ($24).

 &LR; ROAST PORK WITH POMEGRANATE SAUCE &AMP; WILD MUSHROOM BARLEY TIMBALES
</P>
<P>
   The timbales and ragout may be made 1 day ahead (cover and
refrigerate), and reheated just before serving. If you don't have
ramekins, use teacups to form the timbales. For ease in
preparation, purchase packaged cleaned arugula so you don't have to
fuss with washing all those little leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Timbales
</P>
<P>
   1/2-ounce dried shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound button mushrooms, halved and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, halved and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pearl barley
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   The Pork
</P>
<P>
   11/2-pound piece pork tenderloin, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   The Salad
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch arugula, about 1/4 pound, trimmed  &LR; _ &LR; 1 teaspoon extra
virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon pomegranate vinegar (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   The Sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pomegranate vinegar
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the timbales: &LR;  Soak the dried shiitakes in 4 cups
boiling water for about 20 minutes. Strain the mushrooms, reserving
the soaking water, then squeeze dry and chop.
</P>
<P>
   Butter 6 ramekins. Melt the remaining butter in a Dutch oven
over medium heat. Add the onion and thyme and saute for 10 minutes.
Add the button mushrooms and fresh shiitakes and saute for 5
minutes, stirring occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Add the barley and stir for about 1 minute. Add the
mushroom-soaking water, the dried mushrooms, salt and pepper. Bring
to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer until the barley is
tender but al dente and moist, about 35 minutes. Adjust seasonings,
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately pack the barley mixture into the buttered ramekins.
Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until
ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the pork:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Season the pork well on all sides with salt and pepper to taste.
Place in a heavy roasting pan that can be used on the stovetop.
Fold under the thin end of the tenderloin so the pork is uniform in
thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Roast for 30 minutes, or until the meat reaches at least 137
degrees (medium/medium-rare) on an instant-read thermometer
inserted into the thickest part of the meat. Let rest for 20
minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reheat the timbales in the oven (350 degrees) for 15
to 20 minutes, and dress the arugula with a little olive oil, the
pomegranate vinegar and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Arrange on
dinner plates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Discard the excess fat in the roasting pan,
then place the pan over high heat and deglaze with the pomegranate
vinegar and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, scraping up the brown
bits in the pan, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 10
minutes, or until the liquid has reduced a bit. Season to taste
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve:  &LR; Carve the pork into 1-inch-thick slices and place on
the greens. Use a small knife to loosen the timbales, then unmold
next to the pork. Drizzle the sauce over the meat and timbales.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Pomegranate vinegar is available at farmers' markets in
the fall, and at specialty supermarkets. If you can't find it,
substitute balsamic vinegar.

FIGS IN ROSEMARY PORT REDUCTION WITH ICE CREAM
</P>
<P>
   The port reduction may be made 1 day in advance and the figs may
be poached a few hours before the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 (750-ml) bottle Ruby Port (about 31/3 cups)
</P>
<P>
   3 rosemary sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, or 1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   15 ripe fresh figs (Mission or Calimyrna or a combination),
halved
</P>
<P>
   1 pint vanilla ice cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pour the port into a medium saucepan; add 1 of the rosemary
sprigs. If you're using a vanilla bean, split it and scrape the
seeds into the pan, then drop in the vanilla pod. Bring to a
simmer, then maintain a steady simmer for about 1 hour, or until
the mixture has reduced to about 1/2 cup and has thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the liquid and return it to the pan. If you're using
vanilla extract, add it now.
</P>
<P>
   Place the figs cut-sides down into the pan. They should be
crowded and partly immersed. Simmer for a few minutes until the
figs begin to soften, then turn the figs and poach for 5 to 10
minutes, basting with the pan juices from time to time, until the
figs are very soft but still hold their shape.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, reheat the figs, if necessary, over low heat (the
sauce will be thick, so watch carefully). Scoop ice cream into
dessert bowls, top with figs and drizzle with the reduced juices.
Break the remaining 2 rosemary sprigs into 2-inch pieces and
garnish each serving with a tiny spray.
</P>

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of
professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.  
 
 Taster's Choice: Cooking Sprays Differ Mostly in Their Cost   By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Many cooks replace cooking oil with nonstick
cooking spray to save fat, calories and time so today's panel
tasted nine of them to find the best. We were surprised by the
results.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The panel first tasted the sprays on their own, then sampled
boneless skinless chicken breasts sauteed in a nonstick skillet
with the spray. They noticed big differences in the flavor of the
sprays themselves, but little to no difference when they were used
in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no difference in the actual effectiveness of
cooking or in the clean up of the pans.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, prices varied dramatically, from $1.69 to
$4.09 for a 6-ounce can. The panel's reaction to that? Might as
well buy the cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   We did not include any flavored sprays or olive oil sprays in
this testing.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the results, but keep in mind that in the end, the
panel thinks these could all be used interchangeably. The ones
panelists liked best were the ones with the most neutral flavor.
</P>
<P>
   First place went to  &UR; Albertson's &LR;  (6 ounces, $2.69 at
Albertsons). Panelists described it as tasting ``neutral'' and
``bland.'' One thought it was probably the best for baking or
cooking because it had no flavor, even though another detected a
peppery aftertaste. Two would buy it, two might buy it and one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pam &LR;  (6 ounces, $3.69-$4.09 at many supermarkets) came in
second. Three panelists described the flavor as sweet, with two of
them also noticing a particularly strong alcohol flavor on the
finish. One thought the flavor was especially mild. Two would buy
it; three might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to  &UR; Spectrum &LR;  (6 ounces, $3.49 at Whole Foods).
Panelists liked the neutral flavor and the emulsified look. One
panelist said this would be his choice if he was replacing cooking
oil with a spray. Three would buy it, one might buy it and one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mazola &LR;  (5 ounces, $2.69 at Safeway) came in fourth. Most of
the panelists thought the flavor was fairly neutral, even though
one noticed a peppery aftertaste. Three might buy it; two would
not.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive brand,  &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (6 ounces, $1.69 at
Trader Joe's), came in fifth. One panelist described it as
``ordinary and plain'' but others thought it left a particularly
greasy mouthfeel. One would buy it, two might buy it and two would
not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Canola Harvest, Naturally, Mazola Pro Chef
and Safeway, but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Flo Braker, cookbook author and Chronicle food
columnist; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San
Francisco; Roland Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and
Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park; Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe
Kati, San Francisco. A perfect score for any prduct would be 100.
All products are tasted blind.

SHRUB BEAUTIFIES A DISH OR SATISFIES A THIRST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Va., Wash.)  (Editors: 2nd take contains 700 words of recipes.) 
 By LESLIE REVSIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shrub was the thing to drink in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Anyone who was feeling parched could add this acidic-sweet fruit
syrup to cold spring water, or splash a shot of it into rum or
brandy. It had real appeal in those days before refrigeration and
sodas. But shrub has merit even in this Sub-Zero world, and as much
more than a beverage.
</P>
<P>
   The odd name comes from the Arabic word sharab, meaning drink. A
vividly flavorful shrub begins with a fruit (or a spicelike
ingredient, like ginger) that has a naturally clear and incisive
taste. Raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, red and black currants
and cranberry are ideal candidates. Citruses like orange, lemon and
lime will also work, as will exotics like pomegranate, passion
fruit and lemon grass.
</P>
<P>
   The main flavoring is usually boiled with vinegar, then steeped
for 24 hours to create an infusion. A second boiling with sugar
turns it into a syrup. Tart fruits like cranberries will need more
sugar; sweeter ones, like oranges, will need less.
</P>
<P>
   Shrub can be a stunning dazzler of saturated color: deepest
scarlet, from raspberries, or shimmering red-purple, from
blackberries. But when a tablespoon or two is stirred into a glass
of seltzer, it becomes demure, turning a tall tumbler into a column
of the palest pink, apricot or melon hue. The result is a fruity
fizzy beverage that swings gently between sweet and acid extremes
and needs only a sliver of lime and a sprig of mint for garnish.
Served in champagne flutes, shrub becomes celebratory.
</P>
<P>
   A spoonful or two of shrub can add a bright touch to just about
any food. A saute pan can be deglazed with a shot of shrub to start
a sauce, or you can create a light glaze for a bird by basting with
shrub mixed with broth. Shrub can be substituted for the sugar and
vinegar in a barbecue sauce. A deeply flavored berry shrub mixed
with maple syrup becomes quite the topping for waffles, especially
with creme fraiche. Pecans and walnuts tossed in shrub and toasted
in a 350-degree oven emerge shiny and crisp, tasting faintly
fruity.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring in a spoonful of orange or ginger shrub adds subtle
flavor to sliced beets in butter, and carrots glazed in shrub pick
up a nice acid edge. Black currant or blackberry shrub makes an
intriguing replacement for balsamic vinegar in vinaigrettes, and
not surprisingly, a splash of shrub gives sweet support and verve
to fruit salad. Brushed over the top of just-baked quick breads,
shrub adds punch. Pulverized ice with drizzles of shrub could
almost pass for a granita.
</P>
<P>
   Shrub also still has a place at the bar. Ginger shrub can be
used as the foundation of rum punch cocktails. Raspberry shrub can
be mixed with Champagne and Cognac, while cranberry shrub is a
solid match for vodka.
</P>
<P>
   City Tavern in Philadelphia, has served shrub since its first
incarnation, in 1773, mixing it with Cognac, rum or Champagne.
Today the kitchen also offers a duck sausage with sweet and sour
cabbage, raspberry shrub contributing to the sweet and sour flavor.
</P>
<P>
   John Guattery, corporate executive chef of Clyde's in
Washington, says he uses shrub in sauces because its balance of
fruit and acidity instantly adds complexity. When shrub is
substituted for the traditional Marsala in sabayon, the sauce
resonates with berry flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Shrub can also be made without vinegar, with just water, sugar
and fruit juice. Two taverns in Colonial Williamsburg serve that
type: the King's Arms Tavern and Christiana Campbell's Tavern.
Anyone who orders a frosted cranberry shrub or frosted mango shrub
as an appetizer or intermezzo gets a tall glass filled with the
shrub and topped with sorbet _ raspberry for the cranberry and
lemon for the mango. Alcohol is added on request.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Yeo at AZ in the Flatiron district of Manhattan makes
what might be considered homages to shrub: her fruit syrups, like
rhubarb or gooseberry, are not built on vinegar but have the same
intense flavor. Gooseberry syrup forms the sauce for her salmon
baked in parchment on leek confit with sweet and tart gooseberries.
</P>
<P>
   Shrubs are easy to make, but they can also be ordered in various
flavors from Tait Farm Foods, a small, family-owned farm in
Pennsylvania. Fourteen years ago it was looking for a new way to
preserve a bumper crop of raspberries and stumbled onto shrub as an
old solution. The shrubs come in six flavors, and are $4.95 for 5
ounces, $7.50 for 12 ounces, and $11.50 for 25 ounces from (800)
787-2716 or taitfarmfoods.com

 Wine Potpourri: A Modest Stash of Wines Will Fit Almost Any 
 Occasion   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  A few years ago, a trend forecaster with the
trendy name of Faith Popcorn coined the term ``cocooning.'' She
meant that after a day on the fast track of modern commerce, folks
were retreating into the quiet and safety of their homes for meals
and entertainment. With today's hot economy and more disposable
income to go around, the cocoon may be unraveling a little, but
people still like to entertain at home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   An organized host or hostess will not only have a well-stocked
pantry, but a collection of wines to fit most every occasion. A
proper cellar with hundreds of bottles of all types of wines would
be nice, but the reality is that most people don't have the time,
money or storage space to build and maintain a large wine
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. With some basic guidelines, a modest collection
will handle the wine demands of most home entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Start by defining your personal style of entertaining. Casual
affairs work well with quick-and-easy wines, while more elaborate
dinners call for more serious wines, ones that are compatible with
specific dishes or entrees.
</P>
<P>
   Every home entertaining plan needs an all-purpose wine like
Champagne or sparkling wine. The range of styles, from ultra-dry
(Natural) to sweet (Doux) fits most food demands. Besides,
sparkling wines have a festive feeling; while the bubbles
contribute to the complexity and texture of the wine, a flute of
Champagne also sends a merry message.
</P>
<P>
   For inexpensive bubbly, try Freixenet Cordon Negro or Seaview
Australian Brut. California sparkling wines with class include Mumm
Napa Valley, Domaine Chandon, Gloria Ferrer, Domaine Carneros and
J. In general, Champagne is a bit more expensive, but try the
non-vintage bruts from Mumm, Moet &AMP; Chandon, Piper Heidsieck,
Taittinger, Pomerey and others.
</P>
<P>
   For casual dining or get-togethers, keep the wine light and
refreshing. Pinot Gris and its French soul mate, Viognier, share
similar flavors and both are good casual wines. Old standbys
include Riesling, Gewurztraminer and Chenin Blanc. More substantial
choices are lightly oaked Chardonnays and crisp citrusy Sauvignon
Blancs.
</P>
<P>
   California Pinot Gris tends to be lighter, more along the
Italian Pinot Grigio style. From California, try Callaway Pinot
Gris or Ivan Tamas Pinot Grigio.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon Pinot Gris, like Rex Hill, are more mid-range in terms of
flavor density and texture, while French Alsatian Pinot Gris
(Hugel, Trimbach) are fuller-bodied whites.
</P>
<P>
   The rising interest in Viognier has spread the wine's style
spectrum all over the board, but generally there are the more
fleshy-tropical fruit styles from California, Australia and
Washington, and the drier, more mineral styles from France.
California's Concannon and McDowell and Washington's Hogue Cellars
make very good Viognier. Oxford Landing Australia Viognier is one
of the best values on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Chenin Blancs from Chappellet and Pine Ridge are good choices,
or try a French Vouvray (Chenin Blanc) from Chateau Moncontour.
</P>
<P>
   Rieslings and Gewurztraminers are fresh and juicy from cool
growing areas like Anderson Valley. I like those produced by
Navarro, Husch and Greenwood Ridge. Also, try Trefethen Riesling
from Napa Valley and Fetzer's luscious Gewurztraminer.
</P>
<P>
   Any New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (Villa Maria, Brancott) or
lightly grassy California Sauvignon, like Raymond, St. Supery,
Navarro, Geyser Peak, Lambert Bridge, fit nicely into any casual
food event.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnays on the light side include Lockwood, Belvedere,
Fetzer Sundial, Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   Light casual reds usually include easy-drinking wines such as
California Gamays, French Beaujolais (Georges Dubeouf, Chateau de
la Chaize), Pinot Noir and some California Sangiovese. Lighter
Carneros Pinot Noirs like Saintsbury Garnet and Carneros Creek
Fleur de Carneros are great quaffers.
</P>
<P>
   More complex Pinots are available from both those wineries, plus
ones from Schug, Acacia, Etude, Edna Valley Vineyard, Sanford and
Keegan. A good alternative, especially with grilled meats is
California Sangiovese, like those from Swanson, Chappellet, Venezia
and Shenandoah Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate meals with multiple courses usually call for more
thought and planning _ and a more substantial wine budget. The
lineup of vintage Champagne, aged Chardonnay, Cabernet
Sauvignon/Bordeaux, Pinot Noir/Burgundy, Red Rhone/Shiraz/Syrah and
Italian reds from Piedmont and Tuscany often share the table with
finer meals.
</P>
<P>
   The process for selecting these wines, though, is the same. For
instance, if Viognier is your white wine of choice, you might want
to move up to a Northern Rhone Viognier from Condrieu (Guigal or
Chateau du Rozay), or even blow the wine budget on a bottle of
Chateau Grillet. German Rieslings and Gewurztraminers, or the drier
ones from the Alsace region of France, are about as good as it gets
from these two noble grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Although New World Chardonnays, especially from California and
Australia, are among the world's best, the ultimate Chardonnay
experience still comes from the Burgundy region of France. The list
of outstanding Burgundy producers, for red and white, is long, but
for value and reliability it's hard to top larger producers such as
Joseph Drouhin, Louis Jadot, Bochard P &LR; e &LR; re &AMP; Fils, Louis Latour
and Jaffelin.
</P>
<P>
   California's top Cabernet Sauvignon and Meritage reds are great
main-course wines. Look for Joseph Phelps Insignia, Beaulieu
Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, St. Supery Meritage and a host
of others.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux choices include a long string of top-rated chateaux
such as Pichon-Lalande, Palmer, Margaux, Cos d'Estournel, Cheval
Blanc and Ausone. If these are too expensive but you still want the
Bordeaux experience, drop back to the so-called petit chateaux of
Fronsac, Castillon, Bourg and Blaye.
</P>
<P>
   However you fill your collection, consult your local wine
merchant for help in selecting the best bottles to fit your budget.
And, your merchant likely will have a few suggestions for other
wines not mentioned here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, kick back, raise your glass and let the entertainment
begin.

 The Roving Feast: Racing to Summer's Sweet End   By Marlena Spieler  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; LONDON _  &LR; Summer evenings in Britain are long _ very long. At the
height of summer, the days will stretch until about 11 p.m., when
darkness finally falls. If it's not raining, it's simply delightful
to go to the races and sit outside sipping, nibbling, watching the
horses whizz by.
<P>
   Now in London it's heading toward fall, but in Northern
California the real summer is just beginning. In California, I grew
up going to the races at CalExpo and Golden Gate Fields. There is
something about the sound of the horses as they round the track,
the thrill of choosing your horse, oh, and what do they sell to
eat?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, though, I went to Ladies' Day at Royal Ascot. I got
lost in the endless crowds, rained on and sunburned, drank too much
Champagne, got muddy feet, and didn't win a penny. True, I saw The
Queen and her party in their carriage trotting to the races. Still,
I thought I'd give this year's Ascot a little break. So when one
day a London cab driver said to me, out of the blue, ``Have you
been to the Windsor Racetrack? Its small and lots of fun,'' I was
mildly interested. And when a second taxi driver asked me the same
thing a few days later I thought, ``OK, let's go to the races!''
</P>
<P>
   To get there, we rode a little train that chugs right into the
tiny town of Windsor and Eton, then grabbed a cab near Windsor
Palace and went into the countryside to the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor Racetrack, is, in a word, enchanting. It harks back to a
different, genteel era. There are no huge crowds even though the
place has a certain excitement. The grounds are green and
manicured, small enough not to get lost and, like a movie about
Olde Englande, swarming with characters from Central Casting. There
are men in bowler hats with umbrellas, women in summery frocks,
horsey folks, serious-looking jockeys and well as dodgy-looking
fellows munching on cockles and winkles and pouring over the Racing
Post.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MARLENA (59636 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In between the people you find the horses, with proud owners
brushing them, leading them around, and all admiring them. Everyone
had a moment for us, a few words, advice about a horse, a jockey, a
hot tip, a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the grassy knoll between the track and the winner's
circle is the important part of the place _ the food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   We spied a Champagne garden with wooden tables and benches set
on the grass. One of us wandered over to the winkles and cockles
stand and came back with jellied eels. There were fish and chips,
of course. Why do they always smell (and taste) so good? Another
stand sold sausages and ``beefburgers'' _ we gave that one a miss
(ask me sometime about British burgers).
</P>
<P>
   And there was a stand selling the most refreshing summer drink _
Pimms, bought by the glass or in great pitchers, served up with
handfuls of mint and cucumber and slices of orange, so refreshing
you don't know what hits you when it does.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I had a Pimms cocktail had been at a garden
reception at the British Embassy in Athens. The weather had been
hot and we had drunk heartily of the refreshing mixture to quench
our thirst. I think I have to accept the fact that I disgraced
myself, although I maintain that dancing on the tables and
imitating Janis Joplin is a friendly rather than disgraceful thing
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Pimms is such a convivial drink, especially sitting in the cool
shade of the warm evening at the races. Chunks of fruit, thin
slices of cucumber and leaves of fresh mint bobbed at the surface,
beckoning innocently. We drank, we placed our bets. I used the
method that works for me _ the cuteness of the name.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering my old favorite from the Grand National rodeo a few
years back, Benny The Dip (who rewarded me generously), I went for
Mon Dieu! Fantastic Light! Sweet Girl! We won first in the first
race, we lost in the second and placed in the third _ a more
profitable evening than any of us had had at work all day. I
decided to give up the day job and just bet on the races, a
decision I've since, sensibly, given up. And I decided that next
warm evening it was definitely going to be Pimms Cup.

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; note  &LR; Pimms cup is slightly bitter, quite alcoholic, and the basis
for Britain's quintessential summer refreshment. Nothing says
summer in Great Britain more than a Pimms. Being a freewheeling
drink, this is as close to a recipe as it gets. Serve on a hot
afternoon or evening. If you have access to borage flowers, with
their pretty blue color and cucumber-y flavor, freeze them in ice
cubes and float them in your Pimms. You can make as much of this as
you like _ say, in a big punch bowl, and as you need more, just add
to the bowl as the party progresses. It is that sort of drink. I
like the salad-in-a-glass quality, too _ so refreshing on a summer
evening.

 Secrets Of Success: Brix's Sticks Make Snappy Party Bread   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Brix is a beautiful restaurant in St. Helena
serving delicious, innovative East-West food. Unfortunately, I
always fill up on the breadsticks _ I even ask for seconds and then
pick at them the rest of the meal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The breadsticks from former chef Tod Michael Kawachi are thin,
crisp and salty, with an almost nutty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-seat dining room, broken up by partitions, is given an
expansive feel with a peaked wood ceiling and airy yellow and green
color scheme. Ironwork shaped like branches and leaves form the
backs of chairs, which are surprisingly comfortable. A large open
kitchen featuring a wood-fired oven stretches along two walls at
the back.
</P>
<P>
   It all works to create a visual package that fits the casual
sophistication of the valley.

<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup lukewarm water (about 100)
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   21/4 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Dissolve the yeast in the water in a large bowl. Let stand for
about 5 minutes, until the mixture is foamy.
</P>
<P>
   Add the flour, olive oil and 11/2 teaspoons of the salt; mix by
hand using a rubber spatula until a smooth dough forms. Cover the
bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm, draft-free place
until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cheese, black pepper, cayenne and the remaining 3/4
teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll each piece on a lightly
floured surface into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick and 14 to 16
inches long. Sprinkle the dough with the cheese mixture and fold in
half.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the dough again to its previous size. Cut the dough
into very thin, long strips measuring 1/8 inch wide by about 16
inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Place the strips on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10 to
12 minutes, or until golden.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the breadsticks to racks to cool. Serve at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 48 breadsticks.

 Alfresco Menu Celebrates Autumn  &HT;       
 By Joanne Weir  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; This time of year always makes me nervous. The
summer fog has cleared from the bay and the winds have subsided
somewhat. But will autumn bring its usual perfect weather? How many
more lunches can I expect to enjoy outside?
<P>
   This is the time I try to take advantage of the weather and
seasonal ingredients, and spend as much time as possible at the
table _ not just eating, but talking and enjoying the company.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, I try to get as much done ahead as possible, and
that's how I've created this al fresco menu. The first course _
Endive with Gorgonzola, Caramelized Onions and Fig Jam _ can be
made ahead and passed while guests are standing and talking and
makes a terrific entree to the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Recently in France, I saw tartine salads on just about every
menu. A tartine is simply an open-faced sandwich topped with
anything from smoked salmon, grilled tuna with aioli, roasted
peppers or grilled fresh sardines, to this one made with roasted
tomato tapenade and creamy goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   All summer long, when I find good Roma tomatoes, I oven-dry or
roast them and store them in sealable plastic bags in the freezer
to use year-round. For this dish, make the roasted tomato tapenade
up to a couple days in advance. A few hours before serving, wash
the greens and make the vinaigrette. Minutes before, toast the
bread, top with goat cheese and the tapenade and toss the salad.
Simple!
</P>
<P>
   During late summer with early hints of autumn, I start to cook
dishes that are a bit more substantial. Veal Chops with Olives,
Capers and Crisp Sage fill the bill. This is a dish that should be
done at the last minute, but don't let that scare you. It's easy
and the results are impressive. Serve the veal chops with roasted
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, the polenta custard cake is a breeze. The polenta,
flavored with sugar and orange zest, is creamy and delicious and
can be made a day in advance, as can the pears.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it _ a simple menu that will impress your guests
without spending hours in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ALFRESCO DINNER WINES
</P>
<P>
   Although casual in style, this Mediterranean menu is chock full
of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Endive with Gorgonzola, Caramelized Onions &AMP; Fig Jam.  &LR; The
topping on the endive leaves is dense, salty and sweet. Your best
bet is a fresh wine with crisp acidity to stand up to the cheese
and yet enough fruit concentration to balance and marry the sweet
and savory flavors, like Cakebread Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc 1999
($21). It's classic in style but abundant in flavor and texture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Tartine Salad with Goat Cheese &AMP; Roasted Tomato Tapenade. &LR; 
Goat cheese and tomatoes are classic companions for Sauvignon
Blanc. The like acidities balance each other on the palate to
produce a delicious marriage of food and wine. You could continue
with the Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc through this course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Veal Chops with Olives, Capers &AMP; Sage.  &LR; An aggressive white
wine such as a white Chateauneuf-du-Pape will best show off this
dish. The Vieux Telegraphe Chateauneuf-du-Pape Blanc ($33) from the
Rhone Valley is dry, full-bodied and flinty, with earthy mineral
flavors, and satin textures that beautifully complement the
caper-olive sauce and the veal.
</P>
<P>
   If you insist on red wine with meat, try Marc Bredif Chinon
1997. This Loire Valley wine is made of Cabernet Franc grapes,
which give a touch of herb and pepper to the dry red fruit flavor.
The tannins are low enough to meld with the sauce for a delightful
match.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Polenta Custard Cake with Cinnamon Poached Pears.  &LR; Try Delas
Muscat Beaumes de Venise ($23, 500 ml) from France. Lusciously rich
fruit flavors complement the pear and cake with orange rind, while
matching the spicy cinnamon-clove flavors of the poaching liquid.

 &LR; ENDIVE WITH GORGONZOLA, CARAMELIZED ONIONS &AMP; FIG JAM
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 yellow onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 large heads of Belgian endive
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fig jam
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Warm the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
onions, sugar and thyme; season with salt and pepper. Cook,
stirring occasionally, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the onions
turn a caramel color and are very soft. This mixture may be made 1
day in advance. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator.
Rewarm before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Cut 1/2 inch off the bottom of each head of endive. Discard the
outer leaves. Separate the remaining leaves (except the inner tiny
leaves, which may be discarded) and place them in a single layer
under damp towels. This may be done up to 4 hours ahead of time.
You should have approximately 36 leaves.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, fill the base of each endive leaf with warm
caramelized onions. Top with 1/2 teaspoon Gorgonzola and a dollop
of fig jam. Arrange on a platter and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 36.

&HT;     HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY PUSHES CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a month left before Congress is set to
adjourn, the high-tech industry urged lawmakers Tuesday to move
quickly on immigration, trade and tax measures before leaving for
their final campaign push.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the election season now upon us time is running short, so
speedy action is paramount,'' said William T. Archey, president of
the American Electronics Association, a Washington-based trade
group representing more than 3,000 high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Archey said that for his group the most important pending
legislation is a bill that would boost the number of so-called H-1B
visas that allow college-educated foreigners to work in the United
States for up to six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortages of high-tech workers continue to shortchange the
American economy by limiting the capacity of high-tech firms to
grow and innovate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the law limits the number of H-1B visas to 115,000.
It would fall to 107,500 in 2001 and 65,000 in 2002. The proposed
legislation would increase the H-1B visa cap to 200,000 a year for
2001, 2002 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``With unemployment at record lows, high-tech companies are
literally putting projects on hold as they wait for more workers,''
Archey said.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of high-tech visas initially had bipartisan
support in both the House and Senate. But consensus broke down when
some House Democrats sought to link the issue to the granting of
amnesty to some 2 million undocumented immigrants from some Latin
American countries _ a move opposed by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Archey said the high-tech industry also wants to the Senate to
pass a bill granting China permanent trading privileges with the
United States, which most other countries enjoy, without annual
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``America simply can't turn its back on legislation that will
open up the world's largest market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which the House passed, 237 to 197, in May after
heated debate, is expected to reach the Senate floor for a vote
next week. Although the measure is opposed by organized labor, it
is a top priority of President Clinton and Senate Majority Trent
Lott and is expected to pass. However, the vote on it could be
slowed by debate over a controversial companion measure by Sens.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., that would
urge the White House to impose sanctions if China continues to give
weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations.The high-tech leaders
also asked Congress to pass bills that would extend for five years
the current moratorium on new Internet taxes and expand a tax
credit for technology companies that engage in research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the survival for brick-and-mortar retailers is clearly
important to the nation's economy and entrepreneurial spirit, we
shouldn't be too hasty in implementing taxes on the Internet that
would otherwise have a far more drastic effect on the growth of our
thriving economy,'' Archey said.

   NEW YORK _ Right now, I'm harvesting young fennel on my farm.
Unlike the swollen, tough bulbs you find in supermarkets, these
tiny ones are tender and their flavor is more intense. The bulbs
are small enough to fit into a child's palm.
</P>
<P>
   A few slivery slices of these young bulbs will add real
personality to a leafy salad, but when you're serving fennel on its
own, I think its licorice kick needs to be tamed. I usually add
some acidity, in the form of citrus or white wine, as in the
Italian salad made with sliced fennel and oranges.
</P>
<P>
   And although I like fennel raw, I think it is more intriguing
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled or roasted fennel can be lovely, but neither of these
cooking methods does much to improve the texture. Like celery,
fennel can be stringy. I often marinate it in lemon juice, salt and
olive oil, which helps break down some fibers, but many still
remain after cooking.
</P>
<P>
   And that's one reason why I prefer to braise fennel. A brief
browning in a pan on the stove top adds color and flavor, and then
I deglaze the pan with wine, add chicken stock and place it in the
oven. The fennel absorbs the liquid and becomes totally tender,
almost creamy. Best of all, the stringy fibers melt away in the
moist heat.
</P>
<P>
   Besides improving texture, braising really concentrates the
fennel's natural sugars. It emerges from the oven rich with the
flavors of the wine and stock.
</P>
<P>
   I often braise fennel with thin baby leeks, since their
sweetness takes up some of the anise flavor. A moderately sweet
white wine, like a dry riesling, adds acidity and reinforces the
sweetness. Like fennel, leeks become amazingly tender when braised.
</P>
<P>
   Baby fennel and baby leeks can be found at farmers' markets, but
this recipe can be adapted for larger vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Just peel off the outer layers from larger fennel bulbs and cut
them in half from top to bottom. With larger leeks, strip away
several outer layers. In either case, use fewer vegetables so that
the leeks and then the fennel will fit in the pan in a single layer
for browning.
</P>
<P>
   Braised fennel and leeks works well with fish like striped bass
or swordfish. Or it can be part of a vegetarian platter, perhaps
with roasted or sauteed potatoes and roasted peppers.
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED BABY FENNEL AND LEEKS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   12 baby leeks (\ inch thick or less) or 8 small leeks (no
thicker than { inch)
</P>
<P>
   16 baby fennel bulbs (about 2{ ounces each when trimmed)
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   } cup white wine, preferably dry riesling
</P>
<P>
   } cup chicken or vegetable stock.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Trim dark green portions and
roots from leeks. Starting at light green ends, halve leeks
lengthwise almost to (but not through) root ends. Wash leeks in
successive bowls of cold water until clean. Pat dry. Trim stalks
and cut the thin slice from the bottom of the fennel bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large ovenproof skillet or braising
pan. Add salt and pepper to pan. Add leeks and cook over
medium-high heat, turning once, until lightly browned, about 4
minutes. Transfer leeks to platter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil to empty pan and heat
briefly. Add fennel and cook, turning once, until lightly browned,
about 7 minutes. Add wine to pan. Place leeks on top of fennel and
add any juices on platter to pan. Simmer for about 1 minute. Add
stock, bring to a boil, cover, and transfer pan to oven.
</P>
<P>
   4. Braise the fennel and leeks for 20 minutes. Remove cover and
continue cooking until vegetables are extremely tender and most of
the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Adjust seasonings and
serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

&HT;     TRAIL OF KILLINGS LEADS TO YOUNG SUSPECT: MORGAN THE OTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICKI HADDOCK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSS LANDING, Calif. _ The placid waters of Elkhorn Slough are
host to the things that make Monterey Bay a natural treasure:
gliding pelicans, twittering sandpipers, lounging sea lions and
frolicking harbor seals. But all is not well here: a serial killer
may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect: an adolescent male known by the name ``Morgan.''
His apparent method: molesting his young victims before drowning
them.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Morgan are sketchy: Separated from or abandoned by
his mother soon after birth, he was raised by rehabilitation
specialists before graduating to life on his own. His motives
remain a mystery. As for his physical description, tourists who
have seen him in and around the slough describe him as frisky,
whiskery and curiously ``cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is a sea otter. He was one of the star graduates of the
prestigious Monterey Bay Aquarium Sea Otter Rescue and Conservation
program until he hit puberty and somehow went awry. Now his
exploits are posing a serious ethical quandary for the scientists
and officials charged with protecting Monterey Bay's extraordinary
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   His reported victims are young harbor seals. Information
gathered by the aquarium, a boat captain who leads daily tourist
expeditions into the slough, and researchers at the Moss Landing
Marine Laboratories suggests he plays too rough with the seals and
ultimately may shove their snouts underwater so long that they
drown or die of shock trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe, I know,'' said Andy Johnson, director of
the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Sea Otter Research and Conservation
Program. ``Harbor seals are not without defenses. They have teeth,
they have claws, they can hold their breath underwater for a long
time _ typically longer than sea otters. It's amazing that they
succumb to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against Morgan is circumstantial. Unlike many
rehabilitated otters, he does not carry a radio transmitter and is
identifiable only by his distinct flipper tag. But researchers
report he has been observed assuming a mating position with a seal
and then been seen roughing it up. Soon thereafter, Morgan has been
spotted floating with the dead seal in his grip or nonchalantly
grooming himself alongside its body.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen unconfirmed victims have been recovered this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot more seal pups turning up dead in Elkhorn
Slough this year than ever before,'' said seal expert Jim Harvey,
an associate professor at the Moss Landing labs, which train
students from the California State University system.
</P>
<P>
   The labs have performed necropsies on several seals. Harvey
noted that quite a few appeared to have been in excellent health,
with no signs that they were malnourished or afflicted by
parasites. In other words, their deaths were sudden and suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were reversed and a seal was attacking sea otters,
there's no doubt that animal would already be out of the wild by
now,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   But because Morgan is an otter, he enjoys a kind of diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Fur traders had culled the southern sea otter population to the
brink of extinction off the Big Sur Coast before the International
Fur Seal Treaty of 1911 intervened. Now sea otters are classified
as ``threatened'' animals under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to preservation efforts and the unique otter research,
rescue and rehabilitation efforts of the aquarium, the official
year 2000 count indicates there are 2,317 otters today. Previously,
a stranded sea otter pup had little hope of survival. But the
aquarium's ambitious program has taken in some 189 otters,
providing round-the-clock care. Caregivers tend to and groom
rescued pups, feeding them a baby otter formula that includes
clams, squid, half-and-half, fish oil and vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Later they escort the pups into Monterey Bay for supervised
swims and start to break bonds so that the otters can make a better
transition into the wild. Otters that demonstrate survival skills
are outfitted with tracking gear and then returned to the natural
world.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's caregivers had high hopes that he would mature into a
prolific breeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a roll of the dice with every animal we
release,'' Johnson said. Some have been success stories. None have
acted out like Morgan, behavior Johnson concedes is ``aberrant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while we thought (Morgan) might just be going through a
phase on the road to sexual maturity, and that a few harbor seal
pups might die and then he would grow out of it,'' Johnson said.
Sea otters typically hang out in bachelor groups, he said, and ``we
were kind of hoping the local dominant male would just kick his
butt and he would shape up.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Morgan, approaching his 5th birthday, appears to be
moving up from pup victims, targeting larger juvenile seals. Among
his unconfirmed victims: two seals being tracked in research
projects by the Moss Landing Marine Labs.
</P>
<P>
   Otters can be quite ferocious. Their jaws are powerful, designed
to crack shellfish, and full-grown males weigh in at an average of
65 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the authorities would try to move Morgan to another
location to stop the killings. If that does not work, Morgan would
be sent to a public aquarium, museum or aquatic park.

with a banana. Mom's a trendsetter. Bananas are the most frequently
scanned item in the grocery store. That's one reason chains are
getting their own banana ripening rooms. Randalls has ones in
Dallas and Houston, with multiple chambers, from which where Austin
bananas will soon be coming. At its new produce warehouse in San
Antonio, HEB has a series of ripening rooms where they are working
on a variety of fruits in addition to bananas. The rooms are the
size of an 18-wheeler trailer so they can hold an entire load and
our testers do samples and taste tests throughout the day. What's
behind these new ripe rooms? The challenge of building a better

COMMENTARY: NOBODY SHOULD EXPECT TO LEARN MUCH FROM DEBATES

<P>
   This campaign needs fewer debates, not more. It certainly
doesn't need a debate about the debates, but we can't avoid those,
either. How many? Where? What subjects? Larry King as moderator?
Peter Jennings? Regis Philbin? Lifeline calls permitted for foreign
policy questions? Lovely parting gifts for the loser?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has weighed in: ``What's needed,'' Gore said, ``is to
respect the right of the American people to see these debates on
all the networks in prime time the way it has been done since
1988.'' Of course, we must respect these ancient, time-honored
traditions, particularly those that stretch back to the
mist-shrouded era of 1988. But do the American people really have a
right to see the debates on all the networks in prime time?
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution is remarkably silent on the matter. One could
extrapolate from the ban on ``cruel and unusual punishment'' that
the Founders would be opposed to the debates taking place at all.
Certainly putting them on all three channels is cruel to the poor,
who cannot afford cable and thus are stuck, like the protagonist of
``A Clockwork Orange,'' staring in horror as one rhetorical
atrocity after another streams from the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs them? Who needs a stilted debate to make up their
mind? People who are undecided haven't been paying attention, or
they don't care. Please, no balderdash about how folks are too busy
to pay attention to the issues. Anyone who wants to know what Gore
or Bush is all about is perfectly capable of doing so. Put down the
People magazine, pick up a political journal. Put down the remote,
read a newspaper. Or point the remote to a channel that doesn't
consist entirely of greased men hitting each other in the head with
folding chairs. It's amazing what you learn when you forswear
sports and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll learn little from the debates. The formats are so
dull, so strict, that nothing really gets said. Every exchange can
be boiled down to this:
</P>
<P>
   Larry King: Vice President Gore, tell us about your drug plan to
help working families.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: My drug plan is good for working families.
</P>
<P>
   Larry King: Very well, then. Gov. Bush, tell us why your drug
plan won't kill every American over the age of 12, as some are
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Larry, my drug plan is good for America.
</P>
<P>
   Larry: Mr. Gore, a response?
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Larry, he's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there might be a ``spirited exchange,'' in which someone
gets a little peppery and lands a feather-light quip. But what we
really want is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug plan? Bush, your idea of a drug plan used to be telling
your dealer when and where you'd meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Mr. Vice Lackey, given that lip-chewing sex maniac you
work for, I'd rather have a white nose than a brown one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the ties come off and it's out to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wouldn't be the level of Lincoln-Douglas, but those days
are gone for good. We'll never get people to sit in the hot sun
slapping horseflies while two men discuss weighty ideas in barely
audible unamplified voices. Besides, that was all there was to do
back then. People had fewer entertainment options in those days. No
TV. No radio. No movies. On Saturday night Pappy made
shadow-pictures of rabbits on the wall with candlelight. And if
Pappy lost both his hands in a farming accident, well, then it was
The Adventures of Log and Stump again, and quitcher complainin'.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we don't have issues like they had back then. The issue
of slavery has been settled. We lost; it's just a question of
whether we work for the government until May 17 or July 9.
</P>
<P>
   This is where you really need the third-party candidates. They
should all be part of the debate _ Ichabod Nader, Pat Buchanan,
Harry Browne and his Goblet of Flaming Libertarianism, and all the
rest. Third-party candidates have nothing to lose; they throw bombs
and poke their cutlasses in the fatty shanks of the mainstream
candidates. The events might devolve into a free-for-all, but who'd
complain? The debates are little more than pro wrestling for
political junkies. Just as scripted. Just as thrilling. And just as
real.

URBAN SPRAWL THREATENS SOLITUDE AND FRAGILE LANDS OF GEORGIA STATE
PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTERSVILLE, Ga. _ Before metropolitan Atlanta began its
relentless march north, bulldozing forests of loblolly pine and
soybean fields, the Etowah Indian Mounds here was a remote state
historic site where children visited the ancient burial grounds,
and astronomers viewed the stars.
</P>
<P>
   But now the site, about an hour northwest of Atlanta, borders a
subdivision of 500 houses, whose roofs are visible from the
ceremonial mound and whose lights obscure the constellations. Two
other subdivisions are on the drawing board, off Old Alabama Road,
which is soon to become a four-lane highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's closing in on us,'' said Libby Bell, the site's manager,
who frets that a sod farm and a pasture flanking the mounds could
give way to urban sprawl, despite promises from the owners that
they will not sell. But Bell worries that when land is money,
promises can be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens next?'' she asked. ``We could have subdivisions
right up to the fence line.''
</P>
<P>
   The development at the perimeter of the Indian mounds, and at an
additional 24 of Georgia's 63 state parks, earned the state the
designation as most threatened in a recent survey by the National
Park Trust, a Washington-based private land conservancy. According
to the report, 8,212 of 74,542 acres of state parkland here is
endangered by sprawl, commercial and residential development,
traffic and rising land values, which all make it difficult for
governments to buy open land.
</P>
<P>
   The parks said to be in jeopardy, in states including Nevada,
Florida and Ohio, are not themselves at risk of disappearing.
Rather, they are ringed, or soon will be, by buildings, rushing
traffic and neighbors who may consider fragile areas extensions of
their backyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solitude you expect in a park is now being lost to
high-rises, second homes and lawn mower noise,'' said Paul C.
Pritchard, president of the National Park Trust. Urban
encroachment, Pritchard said, turns ``conservation areas into city
parks, and historical sites into playgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   That Georgia was at the top of the list came as no surprise to
conservationists, urban planners, political leaders and residents
here, who have watched their state _ and especially the 16-county
greater Atlanta area _ explode in the last decade, unfettered by
geographic barriers like mountains or oceans, and encouraged by the
region's laissez-faire attitude toward regulating land use.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to the parks, said Lawrence Frank, a professor of
city planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is ``one of
the unthought-out, less measured impacts of rapid, unplanned
growth,'' more often discussed in terms of choking traffic,
unsightly strip malls, cookie-cutter subdivisions and air like
ozone soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to laugh at Los Angeles,'' said Vince Taylor, manager
of the Sweetwater Creek state park in Lithia Springs, the closest
to downtown Atlanta and destined to be ringed by office parks and
condominiums. ``Now we  &UR; are &LR;  Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, whose park is a 2,050-acre oasis just 15 miles from city
skyscrapers, is more resigned to development than Bell, who grew up
in Lilly, Ga., (population 50) and assumed when she came here 21
years ago that the Etowah Mounds would remain pristine and that
adjoining lands, also troves of Indian artifacts, would not be
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who grew up in Decatur and witnessed Atlanta's sprawl
from its earliest days, had no such expectations. ``The certainty
is we will be surrounded,'' he said, from the bait shop at
Sweetwater, which includes a 215-acre manufactured lake stocked
with fish, the ruins of a Civil War-era textile factory, hiking
trails and a butterfly garden. ``The uncertainty is by what.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are small subdivisions at the edges of Sweetwater
Creek and a few apartment complexes, including one with placards
promising that ``luxury living is a walk from the park.'' As he
inspects his territory, Taylor is dismayed to find deer blinds,
children's forts and yard cuttings on park property.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, ground was broken on the park's southern border for a
mini-city called New Manchester, which will occupy 3,350 acres on
both banks of Sweetwater Creek, a tributary of the Chatahoochee
River. New Manchester, named for the ruined textile factory, is to
include homes for 9,000 people, office space for 25,000, a golf
course, a hotel, a school and paths that connect to the trail
system at the park. The enormous project does not disturb Taylor or
his superiors in the state Department of Natural Resources because
they say it is thoughtfully designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have a lot worse neighbors,'' Taylor said, ``and
eventually we will.''
</P>
<P>
   He worries about an untouched tract of land adjacent to New
Manchester, approved for multifamily dwellings, that has changed
hands several times. Then there is the vast acreage, already bought
by speculators, that is yet to be connected to the Douglas County
sewer system. Once it is, Taylor said, dirt roads are likely to
become four-lane highways, and forests of oak and hickory will give
way to office parks.
</P>
<P>
   But office parks, ``if they are nicely done,'' may be preferable
to housing, Taylor said, because they are in use only from 9 to 5
and tenants are unlikely to use, or misuse, the parkland.
Residents, by contrast, make it difficult to ``control our
borders,'' he said, and wear footpaths through delicate areas.
</P>
<P>
   The development at the edge of both the Etowah Indian Mounds and
the Sweetwater Creek state park might have been prevented had
adjoining property been bought by the state or donated by
landowners. Donations of this kind are less common since changes in
the tax code in 1986 made deductions for philanthropy less
generous. And purchases have been stymied recently by rising costs
and static public financing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's governor, Roy Barnes, a Democrat, is widely praised
for initiatives to make land acquisition easier, including one that
provides $300 million to the state's most rapidly developing
counties for buying green space, with a goal of 20 percent per
county. But Barnes is playing catch-up. ``He inherited a total
mess,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Help could also come with the resurrection of a ballot measure,
which Georgia's voters rejected two years ago, to add $1 to the
real estate transfer tax for land acquisition in natural areas. The
fund would have yielded $30 million in its first year, said Bert
Weerts, director of the state's parks and historical sites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is pending federal legislation, the Conservation
and Reinvestment Act, which has passed in the House of
Representatives and is expected to be considered soon by the
Senate. The bill would give $450 million to the states for land
acquisition, with $10 million to $18 million coming to Georgia,
Weerts said.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts was one of 32 state park executives who responded to the
survey by the National Park Trust. In those 32 states, the report
said, there are 94,306 acres of threatened parkland. The top 10
states _ Georgia, North Carolina, Minnesota, Nevada, West Virginia,
Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Montana _ account for 62,013
acres, about two-thirds of the total. Among the 18 that did not
respond were California, Texas and New York, the nation's three
most populous states, and Alaska, its largest.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials here took no offense at their ranking, instead
hoping that it would draw attention to their plight. Bell, for one,
would jump at any new state or federal money that would make it
possible to buy land at the edges of her 54-acre historical site.
The Etowah mounds were purchased for preservation in 1953, for a
nominal fee, from the Tumlin family.
</P>
<P>
   The Tumlins, major landowners in Cartersville since 1838, have
sold most of their 3,000 acres, including a 23-acre sod farm owned
by Shaw Industries, one of the nation's largest carpet mills. Henry
Tumlin, 83, who lives next to the park, which he once managed, has
known the ``Shaw boys,'' as he calls them, since childhood, and is
confident they will keep their vow to leave the land undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   Given the wealth of Shaw Industries, Bell is reasonably sure
that the agricultural land will not be sold. She is less confident
about the 50-acre pasture that Tumlin still owns, where cows graze
within sight of a 63-foot ceremonial mound, home to Indian priests
and chieftains 1,000 years ago. Tumlin and his wife, Charlsie, 84,
have no children but have willed the pasture to two nephews on the
condition that they keep the land in the family. One nephew is a
dentist, Tumlin said. The other is a builder.

EWING DESERVES BETTER OF HIS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether he really did say it first, or whether he borrowed it,
Wilt Chamberlain certainly had it right.
</P>
<P>
   For it is to Wilt we attribute the phrase, ``Nobody loves
Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger they are, the more we resent them. At least, that's
the way we regard our basketball players. Being tall in other
sports is actually viewed as a handicap. Randy Johnson, for
example, is one of the few very tall pitchers of note in the
history of baseball. 'Tis said the mechanics of a windup get too
complicated when a man is much bigger than, say, 6 feet 4 inches,
which also happens to be plenty tall enough for either a football
or a hockey player. But being tall in basketball is the ultimate
unteachable asset.
</P>
<P>
   But being tall also brings expectations, and fans very often
refuse to acknowledge that not all big guys are inherently created
equal. Being tall helps, but being tall without the accompanying
benefit of being athletic makes for a very perilous basketball
existence. There can be few lonelier existences on this earth than
that of the klutzy, lumbering big man. It's hard enough just
getting through the day as the Brobdingnagian in the world of the
Lilliputians without being subjected to the verbal abuse of angry
fans when you are outplayed on the basketball floor by someone half
a foot smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Big men are seldom accorded the benefit of the doubt. When
things go sour, the first targets are the big men. People can't
relate to them, on any level. They think that what these people do
must be easy, and, of course, it isn't. On a personal basis, they
just can't, well, relate to them the way they can to medium-sized
players or small players.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up and big men just aren't inherently lovable. The
one conspicuous exception may be Shaquille O'Neal, whose distinct
personality has caught on with young people. But almost every other
big man has either been mysterious or actively disliked.
</P>
<P>
   Would that Patrick Ewing were merely ``actively disliked.'' The
feelings pouring out of fans and press during the ill-fated attempt
his team made to trade him a couple of weeks back were just plain
venomous. How could a man who plays hard all the time, competes
when injured, is never in trouble with the law, and has
accomplished so much become such a reviled figure?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Ewing has always needed a good personal publicist, but
he is hardly the inept and evil figure he was made out to be by
segments of the New York press and fandom. The New York Post, a
paper without boundaries, actually managed to out-Post itself with
the back page headline ``GOOD RIDDANCE.'' Ewing may not have been
able to deliver an NBA championship to New York, but one may quite
legitimately argue that he is the best player in the history of the
franchise. Isn't such a bitter sendoff just a teeny bit over the
top?
</P>
<P>
   It was written that he was poisoned by John Thompson. It was
written that he made too many foolish ``guarantees'' he was unable
to back up. It was written that he had become an impediment to a
quicker, younger Knicks team and was unwilling to alter his game to
suit the changing situation. It was written that he had demanded
the ball too often and missed too many big shots. It was written
that he was arrogant and aloof and that he had never tried hard
enough to make himself accessible to the media and, therefore,
understandable to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   There is some truth in all of this, but only some. The further
truth is that the team's record with him, even in the past two
years when he was supposed to be such a drag, was far superior to
its record without him. The further truth is that he is an
old-fashioned low post center who scores, rebounds, and clogs the
middle, even at age 38. The truth is that his exemplary work habits
make him a model for all young players.
</P>
<P>
   It is regrettable that he did not do a better job of selling
himself. Friends say he is warm and witty, and he would never show
that side to either the press or the fans. Much was made from an
incident last season when he refused to sign an autograph, saying
he never signed on game day, when he wasn't even activated at the
time. If it happened, it was a dumb thing to say and there is no
defense. But should that foolish action outweigh 15 years of
valiant service to his team?
</P>
<P>
   Just because a man is not a saint does not necessarily mean he
must be a villain. You never would have thought Ewing had scored
more than 20 points a game for 13 consecutive seasons or become the
all-time team leader in scoring, rebounding, and shot-blocking, or
been an original Dream Teamer or been voted as one of the 50
greatest players. Vilifying such a man is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad in New York that last week support eventually
materialized in a very curious place. In an editorial headlined ``A
Sour Fadeout for the Ewing Era,'' The New York Times (known in
these here parts as ``Daddy'') came passionately to Ewing's
defense. ``The failure to win,'' it said, ``is attributable less to
Ewing than to the coaches who misused him and to the executives who
failed to provide him with a credible supporting cast until too
late in his career . . . As a star with the big paycheck, Ewing has
been a convenient target for these failures. His stoic style, which
strikes many people as surly, also left him exposed. But the blame
for the missing championship lies elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing is one of the great big men of all-time. This is
beyond dispute. Rather than bemoan his shortcomings, the fans
should ponder how bad basketball life in New York would have been
this past decade and a half without him. Were he a guard or a
forward, he would be revered. But Patrick Ewing is 7 feet tall, an
unloved Goliath.

 &HT;    WorldCom buying Intermedia to get Web-hosting Digex
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WorldCom has agreed to a $6 billion deal to buy Intermedia,
mostly as a way of gaining control of Digex, a hot firm
specializing in Web hosting.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will give WorldCom the lead in a still-nascent
market that is expected to explode along with the Internet, said
John Stupka, president of ventures and alliances for the
Mississippi-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow WorldCom to have a first-mover advantage, to
let WorldCom become a category leader,'' he said. ``The name Digex
in managed Web hosting is a `wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Digex deal is the first since WorldCom's purchase of Sprint
was blocked by federal and European regulators in July.
</P>
<P>
   While falling far short of that gargantuan merger _ which would
have been worth well over $100 billion _ Digex shines a light on
WorldCom's plan to extend its reach into business use of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The market remains modest. Digex has annual revenue of less than
$200 million. However, Forrester Research predicts managed Web and
application hosting will account for $17 billion in spending by
2004. Gartner Research consultants are even more bullish,
predicting the market will be $22 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies with a Web presence manage the infrastructure used
in their own sites. Instead, control of the high-speed lines and
powerful servers needed is farmed out to others. WorldCom's UUNet
subsidiary is already a leader in providing high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of Digex will let WorldCom handle more of a
customer's needs, Stupka said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for WorldCom to pay $39 a share for Intermedia
stock and to take on $2.4 billion in company debt.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom will wind up owning 55 percent of Digex stock but with
94 percent of the company's voting interest.
</P>
<P>
   The companies expect to complete the transaction early next
year. All three boards have approved the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Digex, based in Maryland, was purchased in 1997 by Intermedia
for $150 million. A portion of Digex shares was sold publicly last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa-based Intermedia is one of dozens of competitive local
exchange companies, or CLECs, that offer businesses
telecommunications services, often as a rival to incumbent firms
like BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Because WorldCom in many places offers some of those same
services, some units or operations will be shed, Stupka said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is one of the markets in which offerings of the two
companies overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Like some other CLECs, Intermedia has of late run into financial
trouble and has projected a decline in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company reportedly entertained _ and rejected _ a
$22-a-share acquisition bid from Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   An offer from Exodus Communications to buy just Digex also was
spurned, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Intermedia stock jumped briefly in June after reports of a rumor
that it was in talks to be bought by Broadwing.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom stock dipped $3.13 a share Tuesday to close at $33.81 _
close to its 52-week low and down from a high of more than $61 last
fall. A.G. Edwards upgraded WorldCom to a buy recommendation from
maintain.

LANGHAM CORNERED ON PATRIOTS OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Tampa Bay was back on its own 10-yard line,
doing nothing but going backward early in Sunday's game. The Bucs
had a first down, and Antonio Langham, the Patriots' cornerback,
was in his zone coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing in that coverage is that if we see the ball thrown,''
said Langham, ``we break on it. ``(Jacquez Green) ran his route and
I saw him go, and I was coming in, and the ball sort of went
through his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The pass from Tampa Bay quarterback Shaun King, not one of the
most accurate passers in the National Football League, was off
line, perhaps a step or two ahead of his receiver at about the
20-yard line. As Langham jumped inside the slant route, King's pass
``hit me in the chest a little bit,'' said Langham. ``I almost had
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game might have turned on that play, or as New England coach
Bill Belichick put it, on one of ``30 other plays.'' Langham might
have been able to return the interception for a TD, the Patriots
could have been up, 10-0, and Tampa Bay would not have been able to
bounce fullback Mike Alstott off tackle all afternoon long.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Langham's week, if not his season, might have turned
if he had made the interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been sweet music,'' said Langham. ``The pass
was tipped and it went through Jacquez's hands and it hit me right
in the chest. And I thought I still had a chance for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham has been battered and bruised the last few seasons,
battered and bruised in his ego and his confidence. If a receiver
went by him, he'd quickly go into a shell ``and I'd be wondering
what's going to be happening next.'' He had played very poorly,
most notably in San Francisco, but Belichick gave him another
chance here in New England. A last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, as far as training camp went, as far as the
exhibition season went, my confidence is back,'' said Langham.
``And it was back (Sunday). I was out on the field saying, `Hey,
don't worry about this stuff no more. You all right. Just keep
playing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And an interception only five minutes into his return from the
deepest of depths would have been proof of that. But Langham did
not hold onto King's pass, Langham did not make the interception,
Langham did not dance into the end zone with the football. The ball
bounced off his chest.
</P>
<P>
   And . . .
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, when the Bucs had a third-and-9 from their
11-yard line, Green again went downfield and Langham again was on
the coverage. The Patriots put heavy pressure on King, and a stop
by the defense in this situation, against a young quarterback and
with the home crowd in a full uproar, was almost expected. Again
King threw to Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, that was just a good pass, a good throw and
catch,'' Langham said of the back-breaking 33-yard completion that
took the Bucs out of the shadow of their goalposts. ``He put it
right where I couldn't get it. Still, that's one of the two plays I
wish I could take back because I was so close. It'd be different if
I was playing the coverages and I was out of position and they
burned me deep. But it was good coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham was right; he was not badly beaten on the play. Yet the
pass was completed. Just as so many passes have been completed
again him the last few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   `` `They get theirs,' '' Langham recalled thinking, `` `and next
time it'll be my turn.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The game played on. Just before the half, Langham was on Green
and once again came close to making a drive-stopping play. King
threw a short pass to Green from Patriots' 41, Langham went for the
ball but did not tip it, and Green caught it. The receiver then
spun free of Langham's tackle and went 33 yards down the sideline.
The next play was the fake spike play by King and the Bucs had a
TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a situation where we were playing man and we were
trying to be aggressive,'' said Langham. ``He tried to run a slant
on me and I had him _ I had good coverage _ and I went for the
ball, to break the ball up. But he caught it and I tried to lock
him with my outside hand, but he spun out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, close to a making a good play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah,'' Langham muttered with disgust. ``There's a slim
margin of error in this business. It can go either way, something
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Every offensive coordinator the Patriots face this season would
be foolish not to test Langham. Is Langham the efficient and
aggressive cornerback who played for Belichick in Cleveland five
years ago or is Langham the shell of an NFL corner that he was the
last few years?
</P>
<P>
   Langham knows this. Langham expects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there'll be times when they'll be coming at me,''
said Langham. ``Like (Sunday), later on in the game, they started
to come at me again to see, well, see if he is the same person. Is
he the same type of person who'll go into a shell or not?''
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, there was no shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started to come at me and I started to come, too,'' said
Langham. ``I'm a different person, I'm in a different place, and
I'm in a place where I'm a whole lot more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   And which person is now in New England? The Antonio Langham of
the Cleveland Browns from the mid 1990s or the Langham who could do
nothing in San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the Antonio who first came with the Browns,'' said
Langham. ``And I said, `Maybe a couple of plays went against me,
but the Antonio of the last couple of years, even though I had good
coverage, would have gone into a shell.' But now it's just a matter
of, `Hey, you were there; you just have to make the play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Patriots can ever find a semblance of a professional
offensive line is now the question of the moment for the team. But
a much more personal question is whether Antonio Langham once again
can find himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're going to keep coming at me,'' said Langham.
``There were times when they tried to come at me and I made some
plays. And that's what I've got to do _ just keep working.''

<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The costumes, props and scenery used in the
Santa Fe Opera's five summer productions are being packed for
storage, and the singers and choristers who held the spotlight are
en route to their next engagements. But as the company's backstage
staff wraps up the loose ends, a more figurative curtain is
descending, slowly and gracefully, on a long stretch of the
company's history. On Sept. 30, just as the new concert season gets
under way in the world's arts centers, John Crosby will step down
as the general director of this adventurous company, which he
founded in 1957 and has run since.
</P>
<P>
   Having built an opera house in the middle of the Southwestern
desert then quickly establishing it as an important stop on the
summer festival circuit, Crosby, 74, will turn over the reins to
Richard Gaddes. As the associate general director for the last five
years, Gaddes has been Crosby's right-hand man; and as the founder
of a similar venture in St. Louis, he knows about running an opera
company. He has invited Crosby to return to conduct Strauss operas,
his specialty, next summer and in 2002. Otherwise Crosby is to
exert no influence on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you stop, you stop,'' Crosby said, speaking
barely above a whisper throughout an interview in his office on the
company's grounds here. ``I think it's very important that you
recognize that you can't manage in the background. You can't be
breathing down somebody's neck.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that relinquishing the company will be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I haven't thought about anything else for 45
years,'' he said. ``I fall asleep worrying about it and wake up
worrying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to the company's comfortable, technologically
up-to-date theater might not fully appreciate how daring was
Crosby's notion of establishing a company here when he began
contemplating it in the early 1950s. The wide highway that connects
Albuquerque, the closest major airport, to Santa Fe was then a
rustic two-lane road, and the drive that now takes 50 minutes took
two and a half hours. More to the point, Santa Fe itself was not
clamoring for an opera company. But Crosby said it had the kind of
audience that would support one.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, and very important, Santa Fe had a long history
of what I like to call hospitality to the arts,'' said Crosby, who
was born in New York but began visiting Santa Fe as a child because
its dry climate was good for his asthma. ``It was a community that
had a flourishing art colony, if you will: painters, poets,
writers, sculptors. And strangely, from that galaxy of the arts,
music was rather missing. So it seemed to me that the community
would receive this missing link warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   He assembled a company of 65 performers for his first season,
which opened with ``Madama Butterfly'' on July 3, 1957, just a few
days short of his 31st birthday. The budget that summer was
$110,000, about $60,000 of which he had raised in donations, with
the rest covered largely by ticket sales. For the season just ended
the company had a payroll of 550 and a budget of $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its home has expanded as well. Its first house was a 480-seat
open air theater, which burned down in 1967. A theater seating
1,890 served the company for 30 years and was replaced in 1998 by a
new 2,130-seat house designed by James Stewart Polshek and Partners
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The company's real attraction, though, is its programming.
Although it by no means neglected the standard repertory,
contemporary and rarely staged works _ from Handel to Henze _ have
won it an international audience. An early coup of Crosby's was
persuading Igor Stravinsky to oversee the production of his
``Rake's Progress'' during the company's first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that it would not make sense to try to run a museum of
opera in a small mountain town like Santa Fe,'' Crosby said. ``You
can have all the `Bohemes' and `Carmens' you want in New York all
winter, with brilliant international casts, and you don't have to
come here to see them.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   All told, the company offered nearly 50 world and American
premieres during Crosby's tenure, including works by Hindemith,
Hans-Werner Henze (his ``Venus and Adonis'' this year was his sixth
work to be given its United States premiere by the company),
Gian-Carlo Menotti, Krzysztof Penderecki, Martin David Levy,
Carlisle Floyd, Peter Lieberson, David Lang, Judith Weir and Tobias
Picker.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's ``Jakobsleiter'' and ``Von Heute auf Morgen,''
Shostakovich's ``Nose'' and several rarely heard Strauss operas
also had their first American performances here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Fe has been a huge influence on the American opera
scene, the way Glyndebourne influences opera in England, and
Aix-en-Provence influences opera in France,'' said Matthew Epstein,
the artistic director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and for the
last 20 years a consultant in Santa Fe as well.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of confidence here about the company's future.
For one thing, there is not much mystery about Gaddes. He began
working here as an artistic administrator in 1969 but left to found
the Opera Theater of St. Louis in 1976. There are many similarities
between the Santa Fe and St. Louis companies; both perform in the
summer and present a similar repertory mixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not a coincidence,'' Gaddes said. ``I always say that
John Crosby sired the Opera Theater of St. Louis. The whole concept
was modeled on Santa Fe, and part of the idea was that the
apprentices here would feed into St. Louis. Which they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaddes returned to Santa Fe in 1988, first as a consultant, then
as associate general director, a title that Crosby said was meant
to give him authority but not necessarily to make him his chosen
successor. That decision, he said, was the board's.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddes seems intent on maintaining many of the traditions that
Crosby has established. Among the works he has announced for next
season are Berg's ``Wozzeck,'' Strauss' ``Egyptian Helen'' and a
Mozart rarity, ``Mitridate.'' He has commissioned new works from
Aaron Jay Kernis, Bright Sheng and Kaija Saariaho and is bringing
in the director Peter Sellars.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby is keeping his own plans to himself. He has given up the
New York residence he maintained for many years, and will split his
time between Santa Fe and Palm Springs, Calif. And he is thinking
about writing what he calls ``a journal'' about the company.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the only activity he said was on his agenda was
driving around in the silver Rolls-Royce convertible he bought last
year. A visitor noted that a convertible seemed an odd choice for
someone living in a climate where a half-hour's drive is likely to
take one through four short rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's true,'' he said. ``But I so much enjoy pulling the
top down that I do it too frequently. It's an old one, a 1985, and
I had to do a lot of work on it. But it will outlive me; that's all
I care about. And you see that's something I can do: I can spend my
time washing it.''

SIMMS VS. APPLEWHITE ON EVERY TEXAN'S MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He can't run from it. He can't ignore it. Go out
to eat, people ask him about it. Walk around campus, people want to
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the gas station the other day,'' says Chris Simms
with a smile that can light up a room. ``And when I went to pay,
the guy says to me, ``Hey, you're that Simms kid. Are you going to
beat out Applewhite?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In some places in this capital city that bleeds orange during
the football season, the power conversations speculate on whether
Texas Gov. George W. Bush can make the quantum leap to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But with another college football season upon us, even in the
backrooms of Texas politics the question du jour seems to be, who
will be the starting quarterback for the University of Texas
Longhorns? Chris Simms, the precocious, highly touted sophomore? Or
Major Applewhite, the talented, experienced veteran and 1999 Big 12
Offensive Player of the Year who holds 37 school records but is
coming off a knee injury that sidelined him all spring?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mack Brown says he won't announce the starter until
Saturday's opener against Louisiana-Lafayette, but insists it
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two starters,'' says Brown. ``And one will walk out
there before the other. And if that one's struggling, the other
will come in and try and give us a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people think the ultimate choice will be ``that Simms
kid,'' who also happens to be Simms's kid. As in Phil Simms, the
former New York Giants quarterback and current CBS NFL analyst who
has a pair of Super Bowl rings and a Super Bowl MVP award on his
resume.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You look at Chris Simms, you talk to Chris Simms, and you see
and hear Phil. The blond hair, the wide smile, the easygoing
personality that hides a toughness necessary to survive in the
business world of college and professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids would duck the comparisons. Chris Simms does not. In
fact, he embraces them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if people try to compare me to my dad,'' he says.
``If they do, it's great. I love him. That's just part of the
situation and how I grew up and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Simms was a small-town kid from Kentucky who made it in New
York, which means he could make it anywhere. Early in his NFL
career, he had to deal with a situation like the one Chris is
dealing with now.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, the coach of the Giants, was waffling on his
starting quarterback. The choice was Simms, who had been plagued by
injuries early in his career, or Scott Brunner, a low draft pick
from Delaware who had shown some promise filling in.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells chose Brunner, whose tenure as starter turned out to be
temporary. Chris Simms, though he was not born at the time, is
still angry over the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Parcells's first year,'' says Chris. ``And he chickened
out. I tell you, I'm still bitter about it to this day. I'm also
bitter about the Hostetler one (Jeff Hostetler won another
coin-flip choice by Parcells to be starting QB). If someone wants
to make me angry and get my blood hot, all they have to do is bring
that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil never talked publicly about his anger or disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad doesn't have a mean bone in his body,'' says Chris. ``I
have more respect for him for biting his lip and not saying things
when most QBs would have come out and laid into you. I don't know
how he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that cool detachment is evident in Chris as he endures
the speculation and questions about the Texas starter. It's even
tougher in some ways for Chris, since he knows that if he had kept
his original commitment to Tennessee, there probably would be
little question about his starting status.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it, Simms laughs and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the choice I made,'' he says. ``And I'll live with it.
I am happy here beyond belief. We've got good fans. It's a great
city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simms also shows his competitive side in his next breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could come here and cause some ruffles my freshman
year,'' he says. ``It didn't happen. But I didn't plan on coming
here and sitting on the bench for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miello remembers the first time he saw Chris Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in sixth or seventh grade,'' said Miello, who is the
football coach and athletic director at Ramapo (N.J.) High School.
``He was just bigger and more mature than everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what blew me away was when I saw a game he played in
seventh grade. He came up to the line of scrimmage and he was
checking plays off and calling audibles. It was unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris took it for granted. He had been around pro football since
he could walk and he felt comfortable with who he was and who his
dad was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of kids would have tried to break away,'' said Miello.
``But Chris never did. He took advantage of what his dad had. He
thrived in that environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Simms is reticent in talking about his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a less intrusive parent,'' said Miello, ``and,
Lord knows, he has more of a right than most people to say things.
In fact, I go to him and say, `Phil, what do you think about this?'
And he'll just say, `Coach, you know what you're doing,' and leave
it at that. But let's face it, Chris has had the best quarterback
coach in the world for a lot of years and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed in the summer before Chris's freshman year of high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three other quarterbacks, all more experienced,'' said
Miello. ``But Chris just blew them away. He started his first game
as a freshman and never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time Chris did look back was when it came time to pick
a college from the hundreds that had recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mannings were all over him about going to Tennessee,''
said Miello. ``And the media barrage was constant. He liked it
there, but a couple of weeks after he made the decision, when
things had quieted, I got a call to go over to his house. He had
changed his mind. He said Texas felt like a family to him and he
wanted to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been waged in the media throughout the spring and
on the field through training camp. The consensus seems to be that
the emerging leader is Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Going by the preseason scrimmages, there was little to choose
between. In one of the final tuneups last week, Simms completed 5
of 8 passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns, while Applewhite was
10 of 13 for 171 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you're going to see a huge separation
between them,'' said Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis.
``We've said all along we've got two good ones. Two No. 1s.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite says the knee he injured at the end of last season is
fine, but he also knows that it may be the ostensible reason given
if he is not the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been taught it's not how you start but how you
finish,'' says Applewhite. ``If Chris and I had our way, we'd want
to be the starting QB and starting every game and win every game.
But the reality of it is that there hasn't been a QB here to start
the season and finish the season since 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms says he understands the two-QB concept; he has seen it
tried at places such as Michigan and Penn State and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see it staying that way through the season,'' he says.
``I don't think it could work. It's too much turmoil for a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms has adjusted well, taking the normal grief that every
freshman must take _ particularly a Yankee freshman and especially
one with the fanfare that accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they adjusted to me,'' he says with a laugh. ``I came
in and they made fun of every word I said. I was like, `I'm
speaking English here. What are we fixing to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simms is fixing to be the starting quarterback at Texas, and
despite the heated competition _ which will only increase as the
season unfolds _ he sees a unity on the team no matter who plays
QB.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no `Chris camp,' '' he says. ``I would never let that
happen. The team is first. I don't go out and try to win guys over.
I just try and go out and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this team is that everyone wants to win,
and if you go out on the field and do it, they are going to be
happy with you.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Chris Simms, every bit his father's son, went out
into the Austin night, very much secure in who he is and where he
is going.

THE GALVESTON HURRICANE REMAINS THE NATION'S WORST NATURAL
DISASTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ On the morning of Sept. 8, 1900, Galveston
residents awoke to rising tides and blustery winds, but with little
sense of alarm. The city had weathered hurricanes before and was
confident it would survive this one, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in less than 24 hours, Texas' most dazzling city _ the first
to have electricity and telephones, the most cultured and exciting
_ was almost destroyed by a horrific storm that took more than
6,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Galveston hurricane remains the worst natural disaster in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   As Clara Barton, founder and president of the American National
Red Cross, wrote when she arrived to offer assistance: ``It was one
of those monstrosities of nature which defied exaggeration and
fiendishly laughed at all tame attempts of words to picture the
scene it had prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Galveston was a city in ruin. The sand island, 30 miles long and
1 1/2 to 3 miles wide, was 97 percent damaged or destroyed. About
3,600 buildings were demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Some Galveston historians believe that the death toll estimate
of 6,000 is woefully low. An estimated 37,000 people were on the
island when the storm struck. Weeks later, 12,000 of them were
still missing. Many families simply packed up what little they had
and left.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the City of Galveston will begin a weekend of
commemorations, starting at the local high school football field
where CBS News anchor Dan Rather will be the featured speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, wreaths will be placed at appropriate
spots, community choruses will sing in concert, and monuments will
be dedicated. It will be the first time since the storm that
national attention has focused on the Galveston tragedy. Many
Galveston residents say that such disasters as the Johnstown flood,
the Chicago fire and the San Francisco earthquake have a greater
place in American history than the Galveston storm because the
people of Galveston were not eager to broadcast their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Wygant, publicist for the Galveston Historical Foundation,
says she believes that the city didn't want the world to know what
happened because ``it's hard to promote a city as a resort when
people know they could be blown away at a moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the turn of the century, there was never much notice. The
U.S. Weather Service was in its infancy, and there were no
ship-to-shore communications to alert cities like Galveston of
impending storms.
</P>
<P>
   When hurricanes blew up from the Caribbean, Cuban authorities
would notify U.S. officials, but they were often condescending to
their Latin counterparts, paying them little attention.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Isaac Cline, chief of the Galveston Weather Bureau, received
notice of the impending storm as early as Sept. 4. But the weather
service believed that the storm was heading for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, Cline raised the black-and-red hurricane warning
flag above the city, but few people paid attention. Galveston and
its residents had little respect for hurricanes. Since its founding
in 1839, Galveston had been hit by only a couple of storms and the
city quickly rebounded from the limited damage.
</P>
<P>
   But by daylight on Sept. 8, the morning winds were driving the
waves onto the beach with unusual force, flooding the south beach
area. Along the shore, the elevation was only 2 1/2 feet above sea
level. Downtown was 41/2 feet. The highest point in the city was
only 8.7 feet.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., Cline was on the beach and was quickly becoming
fearful. The north wind was still blowing, but huge swells were
rolling in from the south. As one Galveston resident recalled, ``If
we had a north wind, you could usually walk half way to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on Sept. 8. The hurricane was beating the Gulf of Mexico
into a frenzy and the north winds were building a wall of water on
the city's north side. Eventually, the two forces would meet and
the entire city would be awash.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, a nurse at John Sealy Hospital wrote in a letter
to her lover: ``It does not require a great stretch of imagination
to imagine this structure a shaky old boat out at sea, the whole
thing rocking. ... Like a reef, surrounded by water ... water
growing closer, ever closer. Have my hands full quieting nervous,
hysterical women.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 p.m. Cline called his brother Joseph at the weather
bureau. ``The Gulf is rising rapidly. Half the city is under
water,'' he said. He told him the city was fast going under water
and that great loss of life would result. ``I stressed the need for
relief,'' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cline tried to relay the message to Houston, but the
telegraph lines were down. His last opportunity was the
long-distance telephone line, but the operator told him that
thousands were waiting ahead of him. He asked for a supervisor and
pleaded his case. His call was put through. Moments after he hung
up, the line went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston was cut off from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse at John Sealy wrote: ``Am beginning to feel a
weakening desire for something to cling to. Should feel more
comfortable in the embrace of your arms. You hold yourself ready to
come to us should the occasion demand?''
</P>
<P>
   Between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., the two walls of water _ one from the
Gulf, the other from the bay _ met in the heart of the city, and,
as one journalist wrote, ``the waters joined in a bacchanalian
dance through the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Large brick buildings were swept from their foundations,
flattened. Victims who weren't drowned were killed by debris
rocketed by the 150-mph winds. Survivors later said they thought of
their impending deaths, not in any frenzied, delirious way, but
calmly and rationally.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to open their mouths and fill their lungs with
water when death seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Judson Palmer, secretary of the local YMCA, remembered
his feelings as much of his home collapsed around him and water
inched up his legs, to his neck and finally near his mouth. He
clung to his son, Lee, with one arm, and a shower pipe with the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just then, the whole north end of the house fell in; the roof
settled on us, and we went into the water together,'' he recalled.
``I thought, `It takes so long to die.' I was possibly unconscious
for a time. Then I had another thought: I wonder what heaven will
be like.''

CHENEY DEFENDS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AS `APPROPRIATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. _ Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential
candidate, Tuesday defended his charitable contributions as
``appropriate'' and insisted he should be given credit not only for
direct contributions but for speaking fees he directed to charity
and for corporate gifts that matched his own donations.
</P>
<P>
   Answering reporters' questions on a campaign flight from
Washington, Cheney challenged the suggestion that his generosity
should be measured by comparing his direct contributions of
$209,832 over the last 10 years to his income of $20,677,742, a
standard by which he gave 1.01 percent of his income.
</P>
<P>
   He also counted $89,500 in speaking fees and $142,820 in
matching grants. Neither is considered a charitable contribution
under the federal tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 440 some thousand dollars were directed to charity,
either direct contributions or honorariums or matching funds from
the boards that we sat on,'' he said. ``I thought that was
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   By his measure, that would equal 2.14 percent of his income.
Asked if he considered that level ``generous,'' Cheney replied, ``I
answered your question.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter, noting that he is a multi-millionaire, asked
him, ``What do you think is a proper level of giving for someone
who has millions of dollars, in terms of percentage?'' Cheney
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a choice that individuals have to make in terms
of what they want to do with their resources. It's not a policy
question. It's a private matter. It's a matter of private choice.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service, average taxpayers
gave about 2 percent of their income to charity. In 1997, the last
year for which figures are available, those with incomes of $1
million or more gave an average of 4.5 percent. The last year that
the income of Cheney and his wife, Lynne, was below $2 million was
in 1992, when he was secretary of defense and they earned $258,394.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, an aide explained that Cheney's first concern
when he started making lots of money in the private sector was
providing for his children and grandchildren, and that the $442,154
represented only the beginning of substantial lifetime
contributions he expected to make to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who last week released the first two pages of his tax
returns for each of the last 10 years, although not the full
returns, said he and his wife had decided not to identify the
charities they had given money to. But he said, ``It was everything
from the United Way to Capital Partners for Education in
Washington, which provides scholarships for inner city kids to go
to parochial school, and a whole range of things in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also said he had rejected an opportunity to have $3.5
million worth of stock options in the Halliburton Co. vest before
he might become vice president because ``that is traditionally not
the way we do business at Halliburton.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while he had received hundreds of thousands of
dollars when he left the board of Electronic Data Systems to run
for vice president, as The New York Times reported last Saturday,
that money was deferred earnings from previous board service.

 &HT;    BUSH OFFERS UP $158 BILLION MEDICARE DRUG REFORM, CRITICIZES
CLINTON-GORE
 &HT;    Moving in both (p) Politics and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush offered an insurance-based
prescription drug plan for Medicare Tuesday while slamming the
Clinton administration for failing to reform the financially
troubled program.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an audience of senior citizens in Allentown, Pa.,
the Republican presidential nominee outlined a $158 billion,
10-year plan that would pump more money into Medicare and allow
seniors to buy private insurance plans with mandatory prescription
drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a Medicare reform bill, to be financed out of
projected future federal budget surpluses, would be his second
legislative proposal _ after education reform _ and blamed the
Clinton-Gore White House for letting the program languish during
the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago, Bill Clinton and (Vice President) Al Gore
promised Medicare reform. Four years ago they did the same. This is
a patient country, but our patience is wearing thin. This is not a
time for third chances, it's a time for new beginnings and new
leadership,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush's Democratic rival for the presidency, shot back that
the Bush plan would leave roughly half of America's seniors without
a Medicare prescription drug benefit and would ``force seniors into
HMOs ... even if they don't want to go into them.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, campaigning in Columbus, Ohio, said the plan
would leave ``millions of seniors without any prescription drug
coverage _ middle class seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is there's no money to pay for it if you
give away all of the surplus in the form of a giant tax cut to the
wealthy at the expense of the middle class,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal comes a week after he began running ads
criticizing the Clinton-Gore record on Medicare and promised to
offer his own detailed plan.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal health-care program for 40 million elderly
and disabled Americans, is expected to go bankrupt in 2025. In
1993, when Clinton and Gore took office, it was scheduled to go
bankrupt in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As he has on a series of issues, including education and
military readiness, Bush criticized the Clinton-Gore record while
offering his own solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president said he's been involved with every decision
for the past eight years, and after eight years of his active
involvement, 8 million more Americans are left without health
insurance than in 1993, a 20 percent increase ... 2.4 million more
children have no health insurance, and, of course, nothing's been
done to reform Medicare or provide prescription drug coverage,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered a two-part proposal that he said would provide
immediate assistance to the elderly most in need through state
governments, and a long-range reform of the entire Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would give states $48 billion over four
years to help cover prescription drugs for low-income seniors. The
grants also would cover out-of-pocket drug costs in excess of
$6,000 per year. Currently, 20 states offer such a program
according to the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA).
</P>
<P>
   The second part of Bush's plan would use $110 billion of the
projected budget surplus over 10 years to reform the Medicare
program and subsidize the cost of premiums for low-income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, following a proposal offered by Clinton last year, has
proposed spending an additional $253 billion over the next 10 years
to cover 50 percent of prescription drug costs up to $2,000 in 2002
and up to $5,000 when fully implemented in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference between the Bush and Gore plans is how they
would be administered. Bush relies on private insurance companies
to offer a variety of benefit plans at various costs. Gore would
offer a new, voluntary Medicare benefit in addition to the current
program.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, legislative and policy director for the AARP, the
nation's largest senior group, said that because Bush's proposal
relies on plans offered by private insurers it would be impossible
to tell his members how much they would pay for coverage and what
benefits they would receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally gotten to the point where both parties are
talking about a prescription drug benefit in Medicare, but there
are real differences in how those benefits would be delivered, when
they would be effective and how much money out of the federal
surplus would be used to support it,'' Rother said. ``(But) I'm not
sure we will be able to make a direct apples-to-apples comparison
before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coorsh, spokesman for the HIAA, called Bush's plan ``a
serious proposal. It will help the seniors who need it the most pay
for their drugs faster than any proposal that has been offered so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Coorsh said Bush's plan ``would not run the risk of bringing
about the prospect of price controls which could potentially
inhibit the development of life-saving drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters Tuesday that he
liked Bush's plan but has asked Finance Committee Chairman William
Roth to draft a prescription drug bill that can be considered by
Congress this fall.

 &HT;    Optimistic words from Coke send shares up 3%
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Shares of Coca-Cola jumped 5.7 percent Tuesday
afternoon, right after the company tried to soothe investor
concerns about its earnings and case sales.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola shares ended the day at $56, up $1.75, or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, the Atlanta-based beverage giant saw
its stock decline as much as 12.7 percent, primarily because
analysts have been reporting that North American case sales have
been weaker than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While the company said Tuesday that its North American sales
``have been soft,'' it also announced that many other markets
``reflect improving economic conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Coca-Cola said it is comfortable with analysts'
estimates of its third-quarter earnings and added that its own
outlook for full year 2000 and 2001 profit is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it ``remains comfortable with the
previously established objective of growing worldwide unit case
volume in the range of 5 to 6 percent for the full year 2000 and 6
to 7 percent for the full year 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts predict that Coca-Cola's earnings per share
will increase 13 percent this year to $1.45. They also predict an
increase of 21 percent next year to $1.75.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Bill Pecoriello of Sanford Bernstein said markets in
Brazil, China, Mexico, Japan and Eastern Europe are offsetting
weaker sales in North America, where supermarket prices have been
rising.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Dunn, Coca-Cola's deputy group president of North America,
said the company will employ ``innovative marketing activities'' to
try to turn around the situation. That includes a ``significant
advertising and promotional presence during the Summer Olympic
Games'' for Coke Classic, PowerAde, Dasani and Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-week period ending Aug. 13, Coca-Cola's U.S. case
sales in the important food, drug and mass merchandising segment
declined 7.7 percent, said analyst Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs.
That was largely because prices were up 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed Tuesday, Coca-Cola's largest bottler,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises, said it expects North American
case sales to decline about 2 percent in the third quarter,
compared with the same period last year. For all of 2000, CCE's
case sales are expected to approach those of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, meanwhile, CCE predicted case sales would drop 2
percent to 3 percent in the third quarter. The decline is related
to the substantial increase in volume the company had in the fall
of last year when it replenished retail shelves following a massive
product recall in Belgium and France.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 2000, CCE's European case sales are expected to
increase 4 percent to 6 percent.

&HT;     HAVING BIG FISH IN A LITTLE POND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For people who can never catch a big fish, a new
grow-your-own phenomenon is creating a shock among fishermen across
America _ starting with a world-record 5-pound bluegill grown and
caught in a private pond.
</P>
<P>
   This world-record bluegill is 15 inches long, 12 inches tall and
3 1/2 inches thick, and according to the fellow who grew it in his
pond, there's plenty more where that one came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go out and catch 500 of them in an afternoon, all 2, 3
pounds and up,'' said Ken Holyoak, 63, who is selling fingerlings
from the progeny of that bluegill for 25 cents apiece for people
who want to try to grow their own world records.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor that Holyoak had successfully created a strain of giant
bluegill, or bream (pronounced ``brim'') as they are called in the
South, started circulating a year ago. But the idea of a 5-pound
bluegill seemed as credible as a 10-pound hamster, especially for a
fish that averages about 4 to 5 inches in most lakes.
</P>
<P>
   But then these two pictures arrived in the mail, proof of the
giant fish, sent to a few outdoors writers across America. Holyoak
was then tracked down at his small fish farm in Alapaha, Ga. In one
mudhole of a pond, just 30 feet wide and 75 feet long, every
bluegill was 2 pounds or bigger. At other ponds at the fish
hatchery were fingerlings from this ``continuous bloodline'' of
giant bluegill, as Holyoak termed it, which are sold and shipped
out across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody told me I couldn't do it,'' Holyoak said. ``All the
fish people, biologists, all the people who know more than I do,
said it was impossible. It took me 10 years before I pulled it off.
I almost gave up, and right then, the first really big ones started
showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   What Holyoak did at his warm-water fish hatchery was to cull
only the biggest fish to pass on their genetic traits, then keep
them in warm water and feed them heavily. So not only would the
bluegill have the bloodlines of big fish, but would have the
conditions (warm water) and food to grow year-round.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of culling, this strain of bluegill can reach 12
inches and weigh a pound in only one year. Holyoak calls them
``Georgia giants.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him about his education, training and science
background, in other words, the guidance he had received in the
process of this experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he answered in his deep Southern drawl, referring
to any formal training in science and biology. ``I was just born
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added, ``I've been doing this, working with
fish, for 37 years now. I started working on a strain of giant
bream (bluegill) about 10 years ago. Just kind of kept at. I can't
help it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've done it, I can make more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire affair started as a private experiment in his own
pond, many years before genetic engineering became a hot button
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a half-acre to three-quarters acre pond is big
enough to grow 3- to 5-pound bluegill, and that many warm-water
lakes also provide excellent habitat conditions to provide similar
results.

MAN CONVICTED IN BOY'S MURDER SEEKS RETRIAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One of two men convicted of killing 10-year-old Jeffrey
Curley in 1997 will ask for a new trial, arguing that the judge at
his murder trial gave faulty jury instructions and improperly
excluded the public and the media during the jury selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Ruth Greenberg, who is handling Charles Jaynes' appeal
of his 1998 second-degree murder conviction, said closing the
courtroom during jury selection was a grave error by then-Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Judith Cowin, now a justice of the state
Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional guarantees to a public trial are very
important guarantees,'' Greenberg said Tuesday. ``They are so
important that denial of a public trial requires reversal, even in
the absence of prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is also expected to argue before Superior Court Judge
Regina L. Quinlan that Cowin improperly instructed the jury on one
key point and failed to tell them about another.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg alleges that Cowin should have told the jury that _ as
a matter of law _ it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the
crime happened in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors insisted that the murder occurred in
Massachusetts, Jaynes and his co-defendant, Salvatore Sicari, also
reportedly traveled to New Hampshire and Maine, where the boy's
body was dumped in a river.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Greenberg said she will argue that Cowin gave a faulty
manslaughter instruction that effectively prevented Jaynes from
being found guilty of the lesser charge.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Kimberly Diaz Peterson, however, has
said in court papers that Jaynes waived his right to a fully open
trial by not objecting at the time, and that the judge could
properly close jury selection to the media and public in certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Peterson has also filed court papers insisting that the
evidence overwhelmingly showed that Curley, who lived in East
Cambridge, was killed in Massachusetts and that Greenberg is
``misquoting'' the judge's actual manslaughter instruction in her
arguments.

</HEADLINE>
  Singer-songwriters create a sound that's pure, personal and
provocative 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAILY NEWS STAFF 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tired of the jingle-jangle of the current music scene? Boy
groups, boy-toy groups, heavy metal, heavy pop, heavy sighs from
everything sounding (BEGIN ITAL)sooo(END ITAL) packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're plugged in or willing to spend hours on the
Internet listening to samples of songs or reading gossip, you're
likely to miss a lot of talented singer-songwriters whose work
falls through the cracks of radio's rigid formats.
</P>
<P>
   So our staff got together and came up with a listing of our
favorite singer-songwriters. This is not to be construed as a
definitive list, and we apologize to all those terrific ones we
missed _ and there are a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   What these artists have in common is a willingness to go their
own way. Many of them put out their own albums, hawking them over
the Internet or at their concerts. Some are on smaller labels (and
are still hawked at concerts). It may not make them rich, but it
gives them the freedom to follow their own muse rather than some
record company's formula for riches. And maybe freedom is another
common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   Some, unfortunately, are no longer with us, but their music
lives on.
</P>
<P>
   So take a look at our suggestions (you may even want to keep
this around for reference). Finding some of the music may be tricky
at some record stores; so we've included some Web sites. You can
always try sites like amazon.com, musicblvd.com or some of the
label sites. Hopefully, you'll give a listen to some of these
artists, many who we regard as old friends. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
---NICK DRAKE: &QL; 
(Timeless quality) If you've watched television lately, you've
probably heard Drake's music. There's a visually intriguing
commercial for a Volkswagen Cabrio in which four friends are
driving at night to a party and then decide to keep going. The
music accompanying it is the spare, ethereal Drake song ``Pink
Moon,'' also the name of one of his albums. Drake's music has also
appeared almost constantly, it seems, on the WB's teen series
``Young Americans.'' Both the ad and the show exude hipness that
says today _ so you'd probably be surprised to learn that Drake
died from a possible overdose of anti-depressants at 26 in 1974,
two years after ``Pink Moon'' was released.
</P>
<P>
   A recluse throughout much of his life, Drake's three albums met
with poor sales. His isolation, however, must have contributed to
the uniqueness of his music. Anyone who plays the guitar will tell
you it's nearly impossible to play his music like he did. He used
his own tunings, and even his vocals _ because of their timing _
are hard to duplicate. Yet everything fits together seamlessly in a
sound that is both familiar and exotic at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Drake has become a cult figure with fans all
over the world, and his albums have continued to sell.
Hannibal/Rykodisc Records is releasing remastered versions of
Drake's three albums _ ``Five Leaves Left,'' ``Bryter Layter'' and
``Pink Moon'' later this month. On Sept. 11, a documentary on
Drake's life, ``A Skin Too Few,'' will premiere in Amsterdam. &QL; 
-Rob Lowman &QL; 
---RICHARD FARINE: &QL; 
(Stuff of legends) In 1966, at the age of 30, depending on which
bio you read, Richard Farina died in a motorcycle accident, going
off a cliff after attending a party for the publication of his
novel, ``Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.'' The tale of a
youth in search of himself has been reissued over the years and now
sports a wonderful introduction from no less than novelist Thomas
Pynchon, an old friend from Farina's Cornell University days.
</P>
<P>
   Before his college days, though, the half-Cuban, half-Irish
Farina ran guns as a teen for the Irish Republican Army before
being deported by the British. Along the way, he developed an
interest in the burgeoning folk music scene of the early '60s in
Greenwich Village. He then married the youngest of the Baez
sisters, Mimi. The pair recorded two albums _ ``Celebrations for a
Grey Day'' and ``Reflections in a Crystal Wind,'' most of which can
be found on ``Pack Up Your Sorrows: Best of the Vanguard Years''
(Vanguard _ www.vanguardrecords.com).
</P>
<P>
   The music often has a neo-Appalachian-bluesy flavor (Richard
played the dulcimer), reflecting a social conscience as well as a
lyrical beauty. Farina could be sweet (``Pack Up Your Sorrows''),
funny (``Hard Loving Loser''), and cutting and rocking (``House
Un-American Blues Activity Dream''), and those who know of him
wonder what else this poet-novelist-songwriter could have been. &QL; 
_ Rob Lowman &QL; 
---ERIC ANDERSEN: &QL; 
(Unsung in his own country) It's interesting that Eric Andersen's
new album is titled ``Can't Relive the Past.'' Andersen arrived on
the folk scene in the early '60s and for more than 30 years has
been turning out his unique songs. It's hard to figure out why
Andersen isn't better-known (he is more likely to be cited by other
artists as being influential rather than by critics). Perhaps his
personal songs didn't translate into record sales. One of his
record companies even lost one of his best albums, ``Stages,'' in
the early '70s, and it was 20 years before it was found and
released. Along the way, Andersen, who now splits his time between
the United States and Norway, hasn't been reliving the past but
turning out wonderful albums. Vanguard has a compilation album of
his early work called ``Violets of Dawn,'' but don't overlook his
classic album ``Blue River,'' remastered and released on Sony last
year. Also check out his more recent works.
(www.ericandersen.com). &QL; 
_ Rob Lowman &QL; 
---JANE SIBERRY: &QL; 
(Unbounded) You know that anybody who can write a song called
``Everything Reminds Me of My Dog'' has an offbeat view of life,
and Jane Siberry's music reflects that. You may have heard her
gorgeous ``Calling All Angels,'' on which she duets with k.d. lang,
but that is only the surface of Siberry's eclectic spin on life.
Though she has a song and album called ``Bound by the Beauty,'' she
seems to have no limits in her music. Her early works on Reprise
Records, such as ``When I Was a Boy'' and ``Maria,'' sparkle with
inventiveness. The idiosyncratic chanteuse now releases albums from
her own label (www.sheeba.com) and has a new disc, ``Hush,'' coming
out Sept. 26. &QL; 
_ Rob Lowman &QL; 
---PETER CASE: &QL; 
(Hooks to roots) In the early '80s, Peter Case led the rock band
called the Plimsouls and had a hit with ``A Million Miles Away.''
But Case, who has a great talent for catchy hooks, wasn't
satisfied. Having started as a street musician, Case returned to
his roots and American musical roots in his self-titled ``Peter
Case,'' a terrific combination of both his pop sensibility and his
sense of tradition. Case has continued to turn wry, fun songs ever
since. His latest, ``Flying Saucer Blues'' (released this year on
Vanguard _ www.vanguardrecords.com) is no exception. &QL; 
_ Rob Lowman &QL; 
---DAVID WILCOX: &QL; 
(Poetic vision) About six years ago, I heard a live cut on KCRW
(89.9-FM) from their ``Rare on Air Vol. 1'' (Mammoth) of a David
Wilcox's ``Chet Baker's Unsung Swan Song'' that just takes your
breath away. It's a hauntingly beautiful piece about the death of
the legendary trumpet player. On his latest CD, ``What You
Whispered'' (Vanguard _ www.vanguardrecords.com), Wilcox does a
funky little number called ``This Tattoo'' that could be construed
as his philosophy: ``Make your clear and solemn vow before the age
of compromise ... this tattoo will hold your vision, always looking
back at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Through eight albums Wilcox has kept his vision, turning out
songs that have been poetic and philosophical with clever turns of
phrase and catchy, memorable melodies. &QL; 
_ Rob Lowman &QL; 
---RICHARD SHINDELL: &QL; 
(Goodbye anonymity) The cover of his latest album, the hauntingly
beautiful ``Somewhere Near Paterson'' on Signature Sounds Records,
features a photo of Richard Shindell looking away into the shrouded
distance, his back to the camera. Shindell ascribes the cover's
anonymity to a profound dislike of having his picture taken, but
we'd prefer to find the deeper meaning. The man The New York Times
describes as America's best singer-songwriter would rather let his
extraordinary songs do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paterson'' is Shindell's fourth solo album. He, along with Dar
Williams and Lucy Kaplansky, also belonged to Cry Cry Cry, a folk
supergroup that lived up to its name in terms of quality and ticket
sales. But even after cracking Pollstar's Top 50 concert tours in
1998, the group decided to disband in order to focus on their own
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Good move. ``Paterson'' is Shindell's most accomplished work to
date, his bittersweet tenor and complex narratives revealing
modern-day emotional bankruptcy and distress. Tormented
stockbrokers, road warriors in minivans and transcendent nuns
changing flats on the New Jersey turnpike are just a few of the
memorable characters, their lives told with telling and empathetic
detail. This is the voice of a master. (www.richardshindall.com) &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
---RAY WYLIE: &QL; 
(Don't call him a redneck) Ray Wylie accidentally made a name for
himself as a young pup by writing ``Up Against the Wall, Redneck
Mother.'' The song poked fun at hard-drinking, barely thinking good
ol' boys, but, of course, was misread and became a party anthem for
that very same crowd. Never mind, Wylie himself was too busy
tipping Lone Stars and snorting cocaine to notice.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Wylie got clean and sober in 1987 _ he was 41 at
the time _ that he began to take his craft seriously, and everyone
(especially Ray) is the better for it. No longer a joker (although
he can still write a beautifully ridiculous tune, check out
``Conversation With the Devil'' on his excellent last album,
``Crusades of the Restless Knights'' on Rounder Records), Wylie has
transformed himself into one of Texas' great singer-songwriters by
blending the profane with the profound. It's a potent mix from a
survivor who, today, has a lot to live for. (www.raywylie.com.) &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
---JOHN GORKA: &QL; 
(Voice of experience) You start with the voice, which is supposed
to be beside the point when it comes to songwriters, but try
telling that to anyone who has seen James Taylor a dozen times in
concert. Gorka's soulful baritone envelops you like a warm bath and
invites you into his humorous and heart-rending (sometimes in the
same song) sketches of ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Gorka became a husband in 1996 and a father a year later. (His
son's name is Bocephus Mahatma Sinatra Gorka, which tells you a lot
about the man.) Some say bliss has dulled Gorka's craft. We beg to
differ, believing it has only deepened his sense of life's
preciousness. (Check out ``Cypress Trees'' and the title track on
his 1998 tour de force ``After Yesterday'' on Red House Records.)
Besides, while pop music revels in songs glorifying familial
violence and discord, Gorka's musings about how his little boy
``looks like Charles Bronson when he cries'' impresses us as a
beautiful thing. (Go to www.flemtam.com for more information.) &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
---GREG BROWN &QL; 
(A quarter century of excellence) Greg Brown has been writing
contemplative, sharply observed songs for more than a quarter of a
century, and listening to the lead track from his latest album,
``Covenant'' on Red House Records, it's abundantly clear he hasn't
lost his touch. ``Half the people you see these days are talking on
cell phones / Driving off the road and bumping into doors,'' he
sings wearily. ``I guess nobody's lonely anymore / 'cept you and me
babe.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prolific career, Brown has appeared on ``A Prairie Home
Companion,'' recorded an album of children's music (``Bathtub
Blues'') and set William Blake's poetry to music (``Songs of
Innocence and Experience''). Along the way, he's picked up two
Grammy nominations and a legion of loyal fans that thrill to the
bluesy folk-country that Brown ably delivers with a charismatic
growl. You can't go wrong buying any of this man's albums _ they're
all gems. &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QL; 
---SLAID CLEAVES: &QL; 
(Pro-depression troubadour) Like Bruce Springsteen without the
bombast, melodious Maine-born, Ireland-educated and Austin-based
folkie Cleaves has a straightforward yet haunting knack for
detailing everyday people's personal struggles. On ``No Angel
Knows'' and ``Broke Down,'' his two striking, Gurf Morlix-produced
Philo albums, Slaid swings his clean, empathetic tenor from the
most intimate (``Dance Around the Fire's'' love-leached marriage)
to mythic (the Canadian logjam saga ``Breakfast in Hell'')
narratives with consistent sensitivity and authority. But his
greatest strength is his loving embrace of fatalism; the guy
unerringly pinpoints any strength or beauty to be found in the most
devastating circumstances. And he plays McCabe's in Santa Monica on
Sept. 23. (www.rounder.com) &QL; 
_ Bob Strauss &QL; 
---TOM RUSSELL: &QL; 
(Six-string John Ford) For years, Topanga, Calif.-reared Russell
has shared top contempo cowboy honors with Canada's Ian Tyson. But
along with such intricately told western stories as ``Hallie
Lonnigan,'' ``The Sky Above, the Mud Below'' and ``The Banks of the
Musselshell,'' Russell has also actively accessed Mexican music and
his Celtic and Scandinavian roots for thematic variety and stirring
sonic flourishes. This approach reached its apex on his last album,
``The Man From God Knows Where,'' a collection of original and
classic songs that traces his forbearers' progress from Ireland and
Norway to the frontier plains and on to our elusive Eden, where the
promise of the West either plays out or dies. (www.tomrussel.com) &QL; 
_ Bob Strauss &QL; 
---NEKO CASE: &QL; 
(Heaven sent honky-tonk hellcat and self-immolating torchbearer of
the awful truth) Whether it's the notion that love is an acid bath
or that religion is the opiate of those who can't accept the former
premise, Case loves the sound of her own claws scratching out the
blackboard lessons of traditional country idioms. With her echoing,
girly/grrl vocals _ she sounds like a latter-day Brenda Lee after
her heart's been ripped out and dragged down a few miles of bad
road _ and training as a punk band drummer, Case is prone to
writing songs with titles like ``High on Cruel'' and ``Mood to Burn
Bridges.'' But dang, there's a born entertainer inside that angry
wailer, too, one who's not averse to falsettoing, yodeling,
hiccuping and naming her act Neko Case &AMP; Her Boyfriends for fun.
``The Virginian'' and ``Furnace Room Lullaby,'' her two raucous
albums on Chicago's irreverent but musically serious Bloodshot
label, define the Insurgent Country movement in a nutshell ...
emphasis on the nut. (www.bloodshotrecords.com.) &QL; 
_ Bob Strauss &QL; 
---TRENT SUMNAR: &QL; 
(Mick &AMP; Keith's hillbilly bastard son) With his high-octane band
the New Row Mob, Sumnar injects wild-haired rock energy into
traditional honky tonk idioms. Redneck pride comes first in most of
the compositions on his group's recently released, self-titled
album (``I'm Country'' being the signature anthem), but wit and
wordplay don't lag far behind. His voice is all coiled snarl, but
can be sweet and sensitive when necessary for appreciative love
songs like ``Starletta.'' Overall, this guy matches funny with
ferocious like nobody's business, while always keeping true to the
spirit of assorted Hanks and the ``Country Honk'' era Stones.
(www.trentsumnar.com.) &QL; 
_ Bob Strauss &QL; 
---IRIA DEment: &QL; 
(Folkie with heart) With a distinctive voice that seems to sum up
the history of American folk music and a talent for storytelling
that can move you to tears, DeMent delivers her story-songs with a
down-home twang that never sounds forced. Influenced by Kitty Wells
and Joni Mitchell, DeMent has some high-profile fans, including
Emmylou Harris and Nanci Griffith. John Prine wrote the liner notes
to her 1992 debut album, and Merle Haggard co-wrote a song for her
third disc. DeMent, the youngest of eight children born in Arkansas
and raised in California in a strict Pentecostal family, never
imagined being a songwriter until her late 20s. Best album: 1994's
``My Life,'' a sad and moving collection of autobiographical and
fictional sketches. (www.irisdement.com.) &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QL; 
---CHANTAL KREVIAZUK: &QL; 
(Soul-searching piano prodigy) A fast learner on piano who started
playing at age 5 after watching her older brothers practice,
Kreviazuk began writing commercial jingles as a teen at home in
Canada. A horrible car crash while visiting Italy in 1994 left her
with a new enthusiasm for music, and she cut a demo of personal new
songs. Her first album, 1997's ``Under These Rocks and Stones''
(Sony) with its standout track, ``Surrounded,'' dealing with a
boyfriend's suicide, became a favorite of Sarah McLachlan and the
Lilith Fair set. Her latest, ``Color Moving and Still'' has brought
raves and critical awards in her native Canada.
(www.chantalKreviazuk.com.) &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QL; 
---ALEX CHILTON: &QL; 
(On a soulful self-destruction derby) It's often said nobody has
more completely betrayed his talent than Chilton, with the possible
exception of Rod Stewart. After the demise of the almost totally
ignored but supremely wonderful '70s power-pop band Big Star,
Chilton set out to ignore his talent for bittersweet r&AMP;b-informed
pop and blue-eyed soul by cutting drunken covers of songs like
``Volare'' and jazz standards on must-avoid albums such as the
aptly titled ``Like Flies on Sherbet.'' But if you check out
compilations like the recently issued ``The Best of the Box Tops''
(a teen Chilton's Memphis soul band _ hits included the late-'60s
classics ``The Letter'' and ``Cry Like a Baby''), anything by Big
Star or the fine 1991 anthology ``19 Years: A Collection,'' you'll
find a great talent that sparks up in surprising places.
(www.barnone.com) &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QL; 
---MICHAEL HEAD &QL; 
(Best of British) Unless you're a Britpop obscurist or a dedicated
follower of UK fashion, you've probably never heard of Head or his
heartbreakingly good pop band, Shack. Head, who grew up in a tough
Liverpool housing project, formed his first band, the Pale
Fountains, in 1981, mixing pastoral psychedelia and bossa nova. It
was a good indication of where he would go with the far-superior
Shack, which issued its wonderful fourth album, ``H.M.S. Fable,''
last summer and then promptly refused to tour behind it in the U.S.
His folk-tinged Merseybeat on such genuinely touching songs as
``Streets of Kenny,'' ``Comedy'' and ``Captain's Table,'' sung and
played in Shack with his brother, John, should have been a shoo-in
for radio play. No such luck. A live album with Shack backing its
biggest influence, Love's Arthur Lee, was recently issued in
Britain. (www.shack.org.uk/pacific.) &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QL; 
---BRUCE COCKBURN: &QL; 
(Vaguely Christian lefty folk-popster) The Canadian Cockburn
(pronounced Coe-burn) has recorded more than two dozen finely
wrought albums of thoughtful, often achingly beautiful, sometimes
fiercely political music, and has won Canada's equivalent of the
Grammy, the Juno, numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   But Cockburn has never been able to get much attention south of
the 45th Parallel, other than a teensy bit of notice for
``Wondering Where the Lions Are'' in 1978 and ``If I Had a Rocket
Launcher'' in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his problem is the unusual artistic journey he's
followed. His Christian faith was more explicitly spelled out in
many of the songs of his first decade in the business, but he
de-emphasized that strain in his work in the 1980s in reaction to
the extremes of the Religious Right.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, his world traveling had brought him to places such
as Central America, and to the leftist politics of songs such as
``Rocket Launcher.'' More recently, his concerns have become more
environmental in nature, and a gentle romantic side, always evident
in his music, has become more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   He creates lovely tone poems backed by snazzy guitar and smart
instrumentation. Unlike a lot of artists easing into their fourth
decade in the business (his first album was released in 1970),
Cockburn remains vital and interesting, continuing to put out
challenging and thoughtful pop. (www.rykodisc.com.) &QL; 
-David Bloom &QL; 
---DAVID GRAY: &QL; 
(English-Welsh Internet-fueled eight-year overnight discovery) Gray
was born in England, finished his upbringing in Wales and is huge
in Ireland, where his most recent album, ``White Ladder,'' has gone
10 times platinum. Yes, that's only 150,000 albums, but that's
still something like one copy of the record for every third Irish
household. He's also gone to No. 2 on the quirky UK music charts,
and double platinum in England, which is another 150,000 records.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be a secret much longer in this country either, as
``White Ladder'' has won several increasing levels of notice in an
Internet success story.
</P>
<P>
   Gray had recorded three albums in the 1990s for various labels
that met with indifferent success, eventually costing him any deal
with a major U.S. record company. He tried to shop another disc
around with no luck, then shelved it and began work on ``White
Ladder'' with his drummer, who helped him build his gorgeously
crafted introspective songs about relationships on a series of drum
machine beats that work surprisingly well with his otherwise spare
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting work got a deal in Ireland, and Gray also made the
record available on his own Web site, www.davidgray.com, where he
soon was selling enough records that he also made it available
through Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Airplay on eclectically programmed public radio stations, such
as KCRW-FM in Los Angeles, helped fuel interest enough that he got
a deal this spring with ATO Records, the label partly owned by
musician Dave Matthews, a Gray fan. In the past couple of weeks,
RCA (for whom Matthews records) has partnered with ATO to begin
pushing the record stateside, and he's leaping up the charts in the
small but influential AAA radio format.
</P>
<P>
   You could go see his second L.A. show in three months at the
Palace on Sept. 8, but it sold out two weeks ahead of time. A
shame; he's an engaging performer live, and his songs are tough to
beat. &QL; 
_ David Bloom &QL; 
---VICTORIA WILLIAMS: &QL; 
(Cool Louisianan) Williams writes great songs that other musicians
love. She sings them in a squeaky-cool voice that grows on you. She
has multiple sclerosis, which led to a celebrated 1993 all-star
tribute album (with artists such as Lou Reed and Soul Asylum
singing her songs) that was a bigger success than anything she had
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The album did so well, in fact, that it not only paid for her
medical bills but led to the creation of the Sweet Relief Fund, a
still-functioning charity (they took part in an event at the
Knitting Factory Hollywood just two weeks ago) that benefits other
musicians facing medical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Louisiana in 1959, played in a jug band with
Case, busked on Venice Beach and just put out her best album yet,
``Water to Drink'' on Atlantic. What else do you need to know?
(www.victoriawilliams.com.) &QL; 
_ David Bloom &QL; 
---BEN HARPER: &QL; 
(The funky folk rocker whose day has finally come) He's just as at
home playing the Delta blues as he is riffing Hendrix-style on the
Weissenborn lap slide guitar. But Inland Empire-born and -bred
Harper resists characterization. He is simply a musician that
weaves American folk, the militancy of Bob Marley and shredding
guitar into a sound so earthy its roots can only come from the
down-home blues of greats like Son House. This has been the base
for all four Harper recordings, including his latest, ``Burn to
Shine'' on Virgin. This album finds Harper contemplating alienation
(``Less''), love (``The Woman in You'') and spirituality (``Two
Hands of a Prayer'') over a range of sounds created by his unusual
choice of instrumentation. But it's the playful Harper (``Steal My
Kisses''), a side the tarnished singer doesn't always show
musically, that has earned him attention from a mainstream that had
shunned his music for so long. And they ain't even seen nothing
yet. (BenHarper.com.) &QL; 
_ Sandra Berrera &QL; 
---beth orton: &QL; 
(A voice of the 21st century) Her earlier collaborations with
Madonna's Ray of Light producer William Orbit and the Chemical
Brothers got her dubbed a techno-folkie. She was the human voice
kids in Clubland could take listen to on their way down from a
hangover _ that is, until Orton became a solo artist. She has since
flexed her singing muscles over strummy songs that bookmark her
endearing emotional songwriting about longing (``Galaxy of
Empitness'' off her ``Trailer Park'' debut album), loss (``Pass'')
and romantic breakups (``So Much More'' off her latest album
``Central Reservation'' on Arista). These bittersweet portraits are
contrasted by Orton's plaintive voice, an achy and husky tone that
has been compared to the likes of English folkie Sandy Denny and
American country singer Bobbie Gentry. (www.arista.com) &QL; 
_ Sandra Berrera &QL; 
---PATTY LARKIN: &QL; 
(A far-out folkie) Some performers are good at doing everything,
and Larkin happens to be one of them. She's a prolific lyricist and
accomplished musician who straddles the genres of folk and rock,
though her latest album, ``Regrooving the Dream'' on Vanguard,
finds the singer-songwriter steeped in a melting pot of sounds from
Celtic to jazz and bossa nova to r&AMP;b. This musical stew she's
cooked up is made all the more interesting by her frequent use of
electronic looping and sampling of her own instruments and voice.
Larkin even tempers her own voice in a way that befits the mood of
each song, be it the airy samba of ``Only'' or her parched
``Rivers.'' She makes music an art, again. (pattylarkin.com.) &QL;

CLINTON HOPES TO NUDGE ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS ON LONG TREK TO
PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ None of the three parties engaged in the
long-suffering Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations are
optimistic that President Clinton can nudge the leaders closer to a
deal when he meets with them, individually, in New York on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He will certainly try to impress upon them, particularly on
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, a sense of urgency. But as
they did at the close of the Camp David summit meeting in July, the
two sides remain both closer to and further than ever from a
permanent peace agreement, frozen at a decisive moment that
represents a test of their political strength and their will.
</P>
<P>
   Before them on the negotiating table still lies Jerusalem,
waiting to be carved up. Only an unexpected shift in either side's
position on the holy city's future status will allow them to
progress to another summit meeting at the close of the United
Nation's gathering of world leaders, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several Israeli and U.S. proposals for sharing
sovereignty, Arafat has remained immovable from his longtime demand
for full sovereignty over what is known in Arabic as Haram
al-Sharif _ the sacred, bitterly contested nerve center of
Jerusalem's walled Old City that Jews call the Temple Mount. And
Barak is unwilling and too weak politically to go that far, to
concede what is considered the holiest Jewish site.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, the parties had all forecast a gloom-and-doom
scenario for September if this standoff continued. But the Israelis
and the Palestinians are not, as predicted, at the precipice of
bloody conflict. After failing to win international backing for his
stance, Arafat appears prepared to postpone the unilateral
declaration of statehood from his pledged deadline of Sept. 13.
That eliminates the prospect of an imminent collapse of the peace
effort and a spasm of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a matter of at most a few months before another
moment of reckoning is upon the leaders. The Palestinian Central
Council will meet this weekend to debate whether the statehood
deadline should be pushed back to Nov. 15 or year's end. Clinton's
presidency is drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak, his government in tatters, is starting to give up on
reaching an agreement, close associates say. Publicly, he puts his
chances at 50-50. ``But I feel him shifting focus,'' said a close
associate. ``Not that he's lost interest. Obviously peace has been
his obsessive priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``But his political situation is desperate, and he has to be
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Israeli officials say that they are having trouble
reading Arafat right now. Is he engaging in brinkmanship, or is he
genuinely unwilling to be budged from his longtime core positions?
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, however, say that Arafat's feelings seem quite
clear. ``I think he's developing some negative attitudes toward
your American president,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian
political analyst. ``And if he's going to give the honor of a peace
agreement, he'll give it to someone else at a later time.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's public statements, Palestinians say, represent a
genuinely unwavering stance on East Jerusalem _ ``the heart of
Palestine, the heart of Arabs, the heart of believers,'' as he told
the Arab foreign ministers in Cairo last weekend. His speech in
Cairo emphasized that he would not be rushed into a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian experts say that Arafat thinks it less risky to
protract the conflict than to seal a deal that would be perceived
as selling out not just Palestinian, but also Arab and Muslim,
rights. Many in the Arab world still believe that the Palestinians
have the right to all of the former Palestine, not only the West
Bank and Gaza Strip but what is internationally recognized as
Israel, too. Arafat, the experts say, has been putting forth the
compromise position of U.N. resolutions that call for Israeli
withdrawal from all territory occupied in the 1967 war _ which
includes all of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been fighting the extremists by the argument you have
to abide by international legality _ not more,'' Khatib said. ``How
can he tell them to live with less?''
</P>
<P>
   Experts also say that Arafat is calculating that he can
out-bluff Barak and outlive him politically. At the helm of a
minority government, Barak is holding on to office by a thread _
one legislative vote _ until parliament reconvenes at the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are portraying Barak, who is willing to
reconfigure Jerusalem along ethnic lines, as Arafat's dream peace
partner. But the Palestinians are not as appreciative of his
concessions as the Americans and the Israelis would like them to
be, and they contend that the U.S. and Israeli positions have
become indistinguishable _ and allied against them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Having offered to guarantee unlimited access to the Western
Wall, the Palestinians do not see why the Israelis cannot concede
to them legal sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which they already
control in practical terms. They dismiss as ideologically
unacceptable and impractical the proposals on the table, which
include declaring ``divine sovereignty'' over the Temple Mount _
that is, both sides would agree that God owns the site in all its
layered history.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is reportedly under serious consideration, although
many Israelis, too, scoff at it. ``Would God then pick up the
garbage?'' an Israeli columnist asked this week. ``Whose God?''
another asked.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, some Palestinian experts say, Arafat does not
necessarily fear a right-wing Israeli government. Under the
rightist government of the former Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Palestinians enjoyed the embrace of ever fuller
international support for their claims. Barak, on the other hand,
has courted world opinion and regained Western world backing for
Israel, successfully portraying himself as a peacemaker willing to
risk his hold on power to secure peace.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But world opinion cannot keep Barak in power, and his domestic
problems are severe _ so severe that it is unclear whether any
agreement he achieved could stand the test of time. This is
something else that the Palestinians know, robbing the moment of
its urgency for them.
</P>
<P>
   Barak remains confident that he can win the Israeli public's
backing for a far-reaching agreement that includes the
reconfiguration of Jerusalem. Getting parliament's support,
however, would be difficult _ if not impossible. So Barak would
probably call for new elections, using an agreement as a platform,
political experts say. Then, in order to get a more supportive
parliament elected, he would have to campaign not only for himself
but for a center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement, Barak is on unsteady ground. He has
indicated that he may put aside his peacemaking efforts and shift
to his domestic agenda, undertaking the so-called ``civic
revolution'' he proposed two weeks ago that would challenge many of
the powers and privileges of traditional religious parties. He
would seek to accomplish this by forging a unity government with
the rightist Likud Party and others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is problematic. ``It is almost impossible to shelve the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for starters, and then the Likud has
said that it is not interested,'' said Joseph Alpher, an expert on
Israeli diplomacy who served as Barak's adviser during Camp David.
Still, Ariel Sharon, the former general who heads the Likud, might
be tempted into a transitional alliance if he is assured that no
territorial concessions to the Palestinians would be made in the
near future, Alpher said.
</P>
<P>
   These complexities are sobering for peace advocates who believe
that Camp David was a breakthrough, engaging the Israelis and the
Palestinians in their most substantive discussions to date of the
thorniest issues.
</P>
<P>
   While some with a long lens think those discussions broke ground
that will eventually bear fruit, others say they cannot help but be
downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even veterans of the peace process who didn't lose hope during
the Netanyahu years have been talking about the need to save the
peace process from total collapse,'' Aluf Benn wrote in the Israeli
newspaper Haaretz on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And a senior diplomat here said glumly, ``I've always tended to
be optimistic, but I'm not very at this moment.''

NATIONAL GRID TO BUY NEW YORK UTILITY FOR $5B IN DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, the British utility giant that bought the former
New England Electric System continued its march westward,
announcing plans Tuesday to buy the New York electric and gas
utility Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. for over $3 billion in cash
and stock, plus assumption of $5 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The move by NEES's parent, National Grid USA, left many analysts
underwhelmed. Several said it appeared the company was so eager to
buy anything that it settled on a mediocre utility in an
economically stagnant region.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk serves more than 1.5 million electric customers
and about 540,000 natural gas customers, in a swath of New York
State including areas around Albany, Syracuse, and Buffalo _ only
barely contiguous to the service area of National Grid's
Massachusetts Electric operating unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bailout case,'' energy consultant Steven Maloney
of Devonrue Ltd. said of ``NiMo,'' as the utility is commonly
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their territory is a weak territory with no real growth
opportunity, and it's a (hell) of a place to get power in and out
of'' from a transmission-line perspective, Maloney said. ``It's not
really a strategic move, in any sense. You could argue that Grid
just picked up some loose change that was lying on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Massachusetts utility executive said: ``This looks a lot
like the Brits wanted to do something _ anything _ to live up to
all the talk they would use NEES as a springboard'' to begin
building a cluster of utilities across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid's chief executive, David Jones, said, ``This, our
third acquisition in the United States, builds perfectly on our
successful US strategy,'' which has included spending over $3.8
billion to buy NEES and Eastern Utilities Associates, owner of the
former Eastern Edison, now part of Massachusetts Electric.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Niagara Mohawk, we double the size of our US business,
reinforcing our position as a leading player in the Northeast
region and becoming a top-tier utility in the US as a whole,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid is offering about a 37 percent premium over NiMo's
Friday closing price. NiMo has lagged average utility stocks by 30
percent, according to Reuters Securities 3000 analysis.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, Niagara Mohawk rose
$1.88 to $15.75; US shares of National Grid fell $1.13 to $40.63.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid said it expects to eliminate about 750 of the
combined companies' 10,000 jobs, probably chiefly through
attrition, and reap $90 million in operating savings over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid expects to offer about $1 billion in cash to
NiMo's owners, plus $2 billion in US-traded shares of National Grid
Group PLC, the English parent. The deal leaves an option to
increase the cash share.
</P>
<P>
   It will also take on about $5 billion in debt, including looming
payments on the Nine Mile Point nuclear plants NiMo has been trying
to sell. It unloaded its fossil-fuel power plants last month.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid said it expects it will take 12 to 15 months to
close the deal because of the multiple US regulatory approvals
required, and predicted it will increase earnings per share, after
goodwill expenses, in the first full year after the merger closes.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Coventry, England, National Grid was created in 1990 by
the privatization of the electric distribution infrastructure in
England and Wales.

 GALVESTON, Texas: will be like.''

   Palmer lost his son and wife. For three hours, he drifted atop a
floating shed.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse at Sealy wrote: ``Darkness is overwhelming us, to add
to the horror. Dearest, I reach out my hand to you _ my heart, my
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge of water from the sea reached a height of 15.7 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Mary's Orphanage, near the south beach, 10 nuns from the
Congregation of the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word
gathered the more than 90 orphans who lived there. The sisters
tried to calm the frightened children by singing an old French
hymn, Queen of the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the dormitories collapsed under the pounding storm
surge, the sisters moved the children to the remaining dorm. Each
sister took lengths of clothesline and tied themselves to the
orphans in an effort to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   As the surge reached its peak and the violent winds whipped the
shore, the dormitory was lifted from its foundation, floated a
short time, then sank killing everyone inside.
</P>
<P>
   Today, sisters of that order, wherever they are in the world,
pause on Sept. 8 to sing Queen of the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galveston Swept by Tidal Wave, The City Said to Have Been
Wiped From the Face of the Earth,'' cried the Fort Worth Morning
Register on Sept. 9. The next day it reported, ``City A Desolate
Ruin Where Dead Outnumber the Living.''
</P>
<P>
   Word spread quickly of Galveston's ruin, and city leaders
immediately met to begin restoration. By 11 a.m. Sunday, the day
after the storm, six men set out for Houston to tell of the city's
condition. They took a boat to Texas City, found a rail hand-car
and pumped 15 miles to League City, where they hailed a train to
Houston. At 4 a.m. Monday, 250 volunteers boarded a rail car filled
with provisions and headed for Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the dead was the foremost problem, one that turned
men's heads. One Roman Catholic priest, a temperance man, resorted
to giving whiskey to workers so they could steel themselves against
the ghastliness of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies were stacked on wagons and carts and taken to a temporary
morgue for identification, but the September heat hastened the
decay. Bodies could not be buried in the water-filled sand. In
fact, the floods had caused many of the already-buried to be
floated from their graves.
</P>
<P>
   Burial at sea was considered the only possibility and three
barges were loaded with 700 bodies and towed 18 miles out in the
Gulf. Many of the bodies were weighted with chains before being
dumped into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bodies washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wrote: ``The sea as though it could never be satisfied
with its gruesome work washed these bodies back upon the shore, the
waves being the hearses that carried them back to be buried under
the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   But they could not be buried in the sand. Nevertheless, people
tried. The sight of their loved ones being tossed onto funeral
pyres along with island livestock was more than they could stand,
and many stole the bodies of their kin and tried to place them at
rest under the sodden sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many dead, you would sink into the silt onto a
body at every other step,'' P.G. Tipp wrote. Later, after he helped
tend the fires that incinerated as many as 12 corpses at a time, he
wrote that he had ``done so much burning, and so much work that I
just gave out. I was sick for a long time. I can still smell the
dead, and the burning bodies, like burnt sugar. I will never forget
those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Ward, a Red Cross worker, recalled: ``The peculiar smell
of burning flesh, so sickening at first, became horribly familiar
within the next two months, when we lived in it and breathed it,
ate it and drank it, day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press wrote: ``The City of Galveston is wrapped
in sackcloth and ashes. She sits beside her unnumbered dead and
refuses to be comforted. Her sorrow and her suffering are beyond
description. Her grief is unspeakable.''
</P>
<P>
   Galveston did recover, although many people lost everything. A
sea wall was built to protect the city from another catastrophe,
and an impressive and exhausting plan to elevate much of the city
was undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 structures of various kinds were elevated,
including heavy, majestic churches and public buildings. Channels
were cut through town so dredge boats could bring sand from the
Gulf into the city and pump the fill under homes and buildings that
had been raised on timbers and jacks.
</P>
<P>
   The ``grade raising,'' as it was called, was not officially
completed until 1926, but by 1911 the city claimed itself ready to
open for business again by building the luxurious Galvez Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of businessmen built the hotel,'' said Wygant of the
Historical Foundation. ``It was their way of saying, `We're back
and we think the city is safe enough to make this huge investment.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding effort took ``incredible tenacity,'' said Michael
Doherty, chairman of the 1900 Storm Commemoration Committee. ``I
think the sea wall and grade raising are among the greatest
municipal feats of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The community decided that it wasn't going to be beaten down,
Doherty said. The people realized what a wonderful port this was,
what a great place it was to live and they decided not to give it
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still take pride in the recovery,'' Wygant said. ``People
take pride in how many generations of their families have lived
here. People run for office on a platform of how many generations
their family have been B.O.I. (born on the island). Some people
actually wear jewlerly that says B.O.I. on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of a funky, odd place. It's not your homogeneous
suburb. Galveston, whether you like it or not, is different. It's
laid back. Probably because of that storm.''

   GALVESTON, Texas _ On the morning of Sept. 8, 1900, Galveston
residents awoke to rising tides and blustery winds, but with little
sense of alarm. The city had weathered hurricanes before and was
confident it would survive this one, too. But in less than 24
hours, Texas' most dazzling city _ the first to have electricity
and telephones, the most cultured and exciting _ was almost
destroyed by a horrific storm that took more than 6,000 lives. The

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS OUTLINE CONGRESSIONAL WISH LIST
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Democratic congressional
leaders Tuesday outlined a set of election-year legislative
priorities that overlapped only slightly with a similar wish list
unveiled by Senate Republican leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   In separate appearances as the Senate returned from its August
break, Clinton and Lott agreed that their troops should cooperate
to pass a China trade law, the remaining 11 appropriation bills,
some tax cuts, a minimum wage increase, conservation legislation
and a reduction in the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   But each firmly rejected several of the other's specific
proposals, and emphasized their deep differences over how to
provide prescription drug benefits to seniors and protect the
rights of patients served by health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another list of priorities is to be unveiled Wednesday by
House Republicans, who will be the third participant in
negotiations that will determine how much work the 106th Congress
can complete before it disbands in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri outlined Democratic
priorities in the Rose Garden of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to say is that we are committed to breaking
the legislative logjam, but we have to move forward with fiscal
responsibility, with responsible tax cuts and with public
investments that give all our people a chance and fuel our
prosperity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first priorities of the Democrats are to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Block ``massive and reckless tax cuts'' passed by the
Republican-controlled Congress
</P>
<P>
   _ Reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pass a modest package of ``sensible tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise the $5.15 minimum wage by a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approve a ``strong'' patients' bill of rights and ``an
affordable, voluntary, Medicare prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress should also pass gun-safety and hate crimes
bills, fund the hiring of more local police, strip
``anti-environmental riders'' from appropriation bills, combat
global warming and earmark education funds for more teachers and
for moder classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Lott outlined Senate GOP priorities after a private luncheon
with the other Republican senators in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that the White House wants to create a mess at
the end of the session for pure political reasons,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   If the House somehow achieves the two-thirds majority needed to
override Clinton's veto of tax-cut bills that would have eliminated
estate taxes and reduced the marriage penalty, the Senate will then
try to do the same, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll focus the greatest time commitment'' on four other
priorities, Lott said. The four were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Approval of permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Completion of the 11 remaining appropriation bills for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising the annual limits for tax-protected savings in 401-K
and IRA retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elimination of ``some unfair taxes, like the telephone tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, he would like to reach agreements on
bankruptcy reforms, better military benefits, a water resources
bill, a conservation bill, minimum wage increases tied to tax
relief for small businesses, and education bills with fewer
earmarks. He said prescription drug benefits should be only for
``the needy seniors _ not just a massive entitlement program for
everybody, even those that can afford to pay for their own.''
</P>
<P>
   He said tentative agreements have already been reached on bills
to fund schools and roadwork in national forests and to make it
easier for the victims of state-sponsored terrorism to recover
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the efforts of House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
to reach a compromise with Clinton on a patients' bill of rights,
Lott seemed skeptical. ``So far it hasn't been possible'' for
Senate and House Republicans to agree with each other, much less
the Democrats, about the details of such a bill, Lott said.

`NIGHTLINE': NIGHTLINE EXPLORE'S HIP-HOP IN SAUNTERING 3-PART
REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Krulwich, a ``Nightline'' correspondent, shows a group of
teen-agers a snapshot of Al Gore and draws from them a collective
blank. Then he pulls out a photograph of Russell Simmons, a
corporate executive. Instant recognition all around!
</P>
<P>
   If you do know who Al Gore is, you may not know that Simmons was
one of the founders of Def Jam Records, the rap music label. He is
also chairman of Rush Communications, whose holdings include Phat
Farm. With these overlapping music and fashion franchises, you
could call Simmons the CEO of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   In his three-part impressionistic series on hip-hop for
``Nightline,'' Krulwich almost immediately establishes himself as a
Gore-recognizing fogy. He begins his wry report with the image of
the rapper LL Cool J grinning from his limousine at his
enthusiastic fans in New York, who include a fawning policeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``LL Cool J has been famous for 15 years, or that is what I'm
told, because frankly I am not a rap fan and I am a little old,''
declares Krulwich. Later he says with puzzlement, ``If you're over
40, this world's a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   But the music that came shouting defiantly out of the ghetto 25
years ago has become a huge international business, and economics
is one of Krulwich's reportorial specialties. So he plunges in _ or
rather, saunters in, approaching his subject in the deliberately
confounded style of Peter Falk as the eccentric detective on
``Columbo.'' (That series went off the air in 1977, just as rap was
taking hold.)
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night's episode, ``Hip-Hop Grows Up,'' using
Simmons and his Phat Farm as the centerpiece, Krulwich slyly
demonstrates how roaring capitalist success has harnessed this
revolutionary form of gangster-celebrating music (or co-opted it,
depending on your point of view).
</P>
<P>
   Simmons began his career 20 years ago as a young man promoting
raucous parties in the Bronx. Now, at 42, he has become a
caricature of a nouveau riche mogul. He has a much younger _ and,
of course, fabulous-looking _ wife, the 23-year-old fashion model
and television hostess Kimora Lee. He shops with The Robb Report,
which specializes in brands like Boucheron and Cartier
(``ridiculously lavish'' brands, to use Krulwich's description). He
denies his own fallibility, as rich people tend to.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean my body's going to change shape?'' he
responds defiantly when Krulwich asks him if, as a trendsetter for
people ages 15 to 25, he's worried about growing older and wider.
Luckily, Phat Farm's baggy hip-hop fashions give middle-aged men
plenty of deniability in the love-handles arena.
</P>
<P>
   Krulwich captures the supreme self-confidence and accessibility
that has helped Simmons acquire a net worth of $200 million. As
supremely self-confident people do, he has a trademark outfit _ a
baseball cap and sparkling Adidas, even when he's otherwise dressed
in more-or-less conventional evening clothes. Yet when young
recording star hopefuls greet him at the elevator in his sleek
corporate office building, he listens politely to their rap and
takes their demo tapes. He met Kevin Leong, the 23-year-old former
graffiti artist who is now Phat Farm's chief clothing designer, on
the elevator. ( Leong is featured in the third episode.)
</P>
<P>
   On camera, as Krulwich follows him through his workday, Simmons
is breezily arrogant, as if he had been bred in Hollywood instead
of in Hollis, N.Y., in Queens County, by middle-class teachers.
Asked why a white 50-year-old banker in Des Moines isn't hip-hop,
Simmons replies dismissively _ and quickly because he's about to
pick up the phone (again): ``You are going to buy at Old Navy,
you're going to be corny, you ain't got no flavor, you don't know
what's new and hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Krulwich, whose fashion preference is the rumpled look, gives
Simmons' emphasis on clothes and on what's ``new and hot'' a
friendly sociological spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-hop culture was born in poor neighborhoods where people
dream of owning things that instantly confer status _ the right
clothes, hot logos, brand names,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   But he does seem to wince when a clothing designer describes the
Simmonses' personal extravagance as an important marketing tool for
Phat Farm. Becoming what you buy, the designer explains, is ``the
American dream.'' The correspondent says dubiously, ``Well, it's an
American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing how enmeshed rap has become in the culture, the issue of
rap-related violence doesn't emerge until Part 2, to be shown
Thursday night. Listening to the lyrics of a Jay-Z song about rough
sex with a prostitute and murder, Krulwich says, ``I find this
music offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the cagey reporter, stating an opinion is just another
way of opening an inquiry. Lyor Cohen, Simmons' partner in Def Jam
Records and the son of Israeli parents, says that Krulwich should
find the music offensive because destroying the establishment is a
time-honored tradition in music.
</P>
<P>
   That acknowledged, Krulwich still distinguishes rap from other
once-revolutionary forms of music like rock 'n' roll, jazz and
ragtime. He questions the merits of rap lyrics that are often dirty
and graphically violent. ``How could this have any lasting value?''
he asks. (You'll have to watch the program to learn the answer. The
second half of Part 2 wasn't available for screening.)
</P>
<P>
   This is an amicable investigation, however, so in Friday's
episode Krulwich also manages to find a quiet, poignant figure in
the highly charged, materialistic hip-hop world. Joseph Sadler,
known as Grand Master Flash, was the man who found his calling in
the breaks between the grooves in records. For three years in the
1970s he sat in his room spinning records, composing riffs that
could be tucked inside the beat. He developed ``scratching,'' an
improvisational style that became intrinsic to hip-hop music. There
was no money in it then, just an idea about music. Imagine that.

<P>
   It's gotta be the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Only the double-plus-killer-degree temperature possibly can
explain, not just all the political silliness of the Labor Day
weekend, but the public's reaction to all of it.
</P>
<P>
   So, there actually have been pleasant, at least quite bearable,
temperatures in much of the country, and maybe it's just the
inclination of so many Americans to empathize with Texans that
explains a lot of the screwy doings.
</P>
<P>
   How else to account for so much that's occurred with not even a
noticeable public shrug in reaction?
</P>
<P>
   It just has to be the heat that kept Bill Clinton from being
laughed out of the presidency with his veto of a bill repealing the
federal estate tax because, he said, it was fiscally irresponsible
and unfair to the 98 percent of Americans who would be left out.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? A bill that ends the practice of taxing, in the views
of Democrats Clinton and Al Gore, 2 percent of the public isn't
fair to the 98 percent who don't pay the tax? If it's not the heat,
what in the occasional thunderstorm is it?
</P>
<P>
   Was the temp in Washington actually bearable, the air
conditioning in the White House working when Clinton, in what The
New York Times called an echo of Gore's repeated charges at his
Republican presidential opponent, George W. Bush, vetoed the repeal
of the estate tax?
</P>
<P>
   According to the Houston Chronicle, the hottest it got in
Washington that veto-day was 81 degrees, and there was no
indication his publicly sponsored air conditioning was out of whack
when Clinton vetoed the bill and warned its passage would prevent
the federal government from paying down the debt and investing in
education, health care, the environment and other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it was the heat of some kind, somewhere that kept most
Americans from scratching their heads in great alarm that paying
for all those things is dependent on 2 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while it indeed seems it was the heat that kept America
quiet about this bill, one round of errands in the 107-degree heat
of Houston that veto-day found the veto was being discussed.
Certainly, it was far behind the weather in most conversations, but
if your errands take you to family-owned businesses, bring up the
topic the next time you're out and about.
</P>
<P>
   As for other effects of the heat on Labor Day politics:
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have been in a pretty cool Chicago suburb when he stuck
his proverbial foot in his political mouth by insulting _ over an
open microphone _ a New York Times reporter. What's to say? That he
was not long gone from the horrid heat of Texas when he, aided and
abetted by his running mate Dick Cheney, pointed out, ``a
major-league anatomical expletive'' from the Times?
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows where Al Gore spokesman Chris Lehane was when he
was quick to comment on Bush not knowing how far to be from a mike
to ensure you're safe. But he sure should count himself lucky he
wasn't struck by lightening when he had the nerve to say, with,
presumably, a straight face: ``We hold virtually all members of the
Fourth Estate in the highest regard, and we believe they should be
part of the democratic process day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   This had to have been the heat. Geez, the whole careless
coarseness and evaluation of it had to have been the products of
heat-struck brains.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there was Gore and his Labor Day gimmick of a
28-hour political tour, flying about the countryside in an awfully
comfortable government plane to tell folk how he's for the people
while his GOP opponent is for the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he staged this marathon excursion to demonstrate he
can work long hours.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more example of how the heat surely had to be a
contributor to Labor Day politics. That's the one about the
presidential debates. The temptation is to say Bush blazed a bit
ahead when he offered to do three debates with Gore, but with only
one to be run by the Presidential Debate Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who really has, as Bush contended, gone just about
everywhere, challenging and begging and bugging Bush to debate him,
turned down Bush's offer. Seems Bush now has to do the three
debates proposed by the commission or Gore, who's coming way up in
the polls, doesn't want to play.
</P>
<P>
   So both sides had an awful lot of Labor Day silliness. What both
sides need to understand now is: It may still be as hot as the
plain old hell, but it's getting on toward too late to keep all
this up.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, guys, if you all don't cool down and start acting like
adults, Lord knows how hot the voters will be by Election Day. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYS CLINTON USING UN SUMMIT TO REVIVE PEACE
TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more than 150 world leaders gathered in New York
for a summit on global problems, the White House downplayed the
likelihood that President Clinton can use the event to revive
Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in New York for the United Nations Millennium Summit,
plans to meet separately with Israeli and Palestinian leaders
Wednesday in his bid to rejuvenate talks that collapsed at Camp
David earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But national security adviser Sandy Berger said Tuesday there is
little chance that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat will have a ``meeting of the
minds'' before their Sept. 13 deadline for reaching agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a make or break week,'' Berger said
during a White House briefing on the president's trip. He added,
however, that unless there is some progress in New York, ``it
becomes increasingly difficult to imagine'' a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope will happen this week is that we see a distinct
way forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that trilateral talks were not expected this weekend.
Arafat is to leave New York in time to attend a meeting with the
Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Gaza
City on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Clinton addresses the largest-ever gathering
of kings, presidents and prime ministers at the United Nations,
kicking off a whirlwind three-day schedule in which he will shuttle
between the United Nations and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to meet
with leaders from Russia, China, Korea, the Middle East and Africa,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the president and his Middle East envoy, Dennis
Ross, have spent the past few weeks assessing the situation and
urging both sides in the 52-year-old conflict to avoid unilateral
moves that might jeopardize the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a week in which the president can take stock of where
we are in this process, whether there is the possibility here for
progress beyond where we were in Camp David,'' he said. ``I think
that we're all quite conscious of the fact that there is not an
enormous amount of time left for the parties to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. mediators have downplayed the urgency of completing
an agreement in the next seven days, Arafat has threatened to
declare an independent Palestinian state if the Sept. 13 deadline
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has come under fire at home for concessions he
offered Arafat this summer, has said it is now up to the
Palestinians to compromise. Israel's Foreign Ministry said Monday
that the prime minister was not planning to present new ideas to
Clinton this week.
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point is over the future of Jerusalem, which
both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital. Disagreement
on that crucial point caused the Camp David peace talks to fizzle
after 15 days of negotiations at Clinton's retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern part of Jerusalem has been held by Israel since
Jordanian troops were expelled in the Six-Day War in 1967. Barak
had tentatively agreed to give up major portions of east Jerusalem
and made other concessions, but he was not willing to meet Arafat's
demand that the old walled city be placed under Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   Since those talks ended, Clinton has been in contact with other
regional players. Last week, he made an impromptu stop in Cairo for
a 90-minute meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. After
the meeting, both said they were committed to helping Barak and
Arafat find a solution, but they cautioned that the two sides did
not appear to be nearing a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the time is short for resolving this,'' Clinton said
then. ``...We're going to work together and see if we can find a
way to help the parties get over this next big hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said Clinton and Mubarak were ``keeping in very close
touch'' to share information on the peace process. The envoy has
spent the past week drafting a paper summarizing points of
``near-agreement'' at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that, based on discussions we've had at Camp David,
that it is possible to reach an agreement,'' Ross said in Cairo.
``The real question is how do you translate that possibility into a
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton had earlier praised Barak, saying he had made
deeper concessions than Arafat, Ross said there's ``no question''
that a genuine effort is being made by both Barak and Arafat to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we can do that, I can't yet say,'' he said. ``That we
think it's possible, I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also
expressed optimism. ``I don't think the two parties have ever been
closer than they are today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan urged all leaders arriving for the summit to use the
unprecedented meeting to end poverty and make peace.
</P>
<P>
   But some heads of state are expected to use the event to push
their own agendas, including some United States-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro, who arrived in New York Tuesday,
is expected to rail against American dominance of the United
Nations in his speech Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea denounced the United States as a ``rogue state''
Tuesday. And Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin are expected to use the gathering to rally
support against U.S. national missile defense plans.

<P>
   As the race for the Republican presidential nomination quickened
last fall, George W. Bush said: ``I still have time to screw this
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps over the last three weeks, as Bush's lead in polls
vanished and Al Gore gained a clear upper hand in the national
race, the Texas governor recalled that observation, which he made
to the Washington Post's David Broder.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost always some ebb and flow in a presidential race
without an incumbent, but Bush's at least momentary fade in the
wake of the Democratic National Convention has been startling.
</P>
<P>
   As we wait for the rest of the post-Labor Day polling to reveal
the kind of fix Bush really is in, let's examine the governor's
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Bush chief strategist Karl Rove legitimately can point out that
he was firmly on the record predicting that the race would likely
narrow and that Bush could slip behind. But if that's the case, why
were Bush and his campaign seemingly so unprepared to respond to
what were hardly surprise Gore turns to populist bombast and to the
reliably Democratic issue of health care, specifically a
prescription drug benefit through Medicare?
</P>
<P>
   Republican insiders say that the Austin high command was stunned
by the strongly positive response to Gore's selection of Joe
Lieberman as his vice-presidential running mate. Rove's publicly
expressed view that there was nothing Gore could do to shake up the
race was proved wrong. Bush leaders watched in virtual silence as
the Gore campaign whipped up attention to Lieberman as the first
Jew on a national ticket _ instead of focusing on Lieberman as a
fanny-covering device that Gore needed to deflect the Clinton
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush, Rove &AMP; Co. breathed easier as public polling during
the first three nights of the Democratic convention, including
President Clinton's self-indulgent performance, produced little, if
any, movement to Gore. But that changed dramatically with Gore's
acceptance speech, which played much better with the general public
than with many delegates and commentators (including me).
</P>
<P>
   Gore hasn't looked back. What was Bush thinking? Did he believe
the Democrats would pack it in for a couple of weeks? Politics
abhors a vacuum, and Gore and his campaign filled it, both
nationally and in some states where Bush should have been breathing
easily by now.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming for Republicans is Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's prescription drug message, which Bush only got around to
answering Tuesday, has been aimed directly at Florida's plethora of
older, persuadable &QL; 
voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the national front, there was a panicky look to the Bush
campaign's handling of the first Republican National Committee
attack ad against Gore. The governor ultimately canned the spot,
but not until it had been beamed out to television stations.
Perhaps that's what made Bush defensive about the second RNC ad, a
medium-sharp send-up of Gore and, among other things, the Buddhist
fund-raising fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have a number of things of late to be modest about, but
running an ad with Gore at the Hsi Lai Temple shaking down the
faithful is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lapses on the trail have been more than verbal gaffes.
He's missed some easy pitches, including an odd reluctance to
endorse Alan Greenspan for another term as Federal Reserve chairman
_ even though his latest term has only begun and the seat won't be
up again until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. If Bush were at the top of his game he might have
recalled that there are two Fed vacancies likely to be there in
January and proposed cloning Greenspan for both spots.
</P>
<P>
   For some Bush partisans, the lackluster response from Austin in
late August was reminiscent of the all but non-existent effort to
counter John McCain's build-up in New Hampshire which began about a
year ago and climaxed with his drubbing of Bush in the Granite
State primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin operatives don't have much time to decide how to
respond now. For there is something else Bush told Broder last fall
that the governor and his campaign might want to keep in mind:
``This is going to be over before a lot of people realize &QL; 
it's begun.''

   Optics a hot topic among venture capitalists
</P>
<P>
   By Kathy Brister
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Ask a venture capitalist what his eye is on these
days, and he's likely to say optics.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of optic technology is that it can make fiber now
being buried at a furious pace by telecommunications and cable
companies efficient enough to handle bandwidth-hungry applications
for years.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is if these companies can do more with the fiber
they've already got in the ground, it'll be a long time before they
must undertake the costly task of burying more.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some of the same venture capitalists and Wall Street
pundits who last year touted business-to-business Internet firms as
sure things now are singing the praises of optics. The market has
switched from being interested in what people will do with the
Internet to the plumbing of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Internet infrastructure) does feel much more viable than
content or applications,'' said Alan Taetle, a venture capitalist
at Noro-Moseley Partners of Atlanta. ``It's tangible. You can
identify the customer base. You can clearly see coming revenues''
based on an ``insatiable demand for bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining with the monied chorus are companies positioning to
profit from selling optic technology. They make the hardware _
transmitters, amplifiers, receivers _ needed to push light-based
data streams down a fiber strand.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta has gone on an investing spree to ramp up its
optics expertise, putting about $31 million in the past few months
into three firms on the leading edge of the technology.
Scientific-Atlanta now touts its optical amplifier as one of the
most powerful on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Through the investments, the Norcross company gained more than
tech know-how. It also capitalized on Wall Street's fondness for
optics. Scientific-Atlanta's $13 million investment in U.K.-based
Bookham Technology, made in mid-1999, now is worth more than $300
million based on a soaring valuation of the optical-component
maker, said Paul Connolly, vice president of network architectures
for Scientific-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value to us is not the gain on investment. We really
wanted to keep a close eye on (Bookham's) technology,'' Connolly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Duluth-based Antec Corp. has tapped into the optics marketplace,
selling equipment that boost light-based transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stanzione, Antec's chief executive officer, contends
Internet site Napster _ which lets user exchange digital music
files _ is all the proof he needs to see bandwidth demand has the
potential to outpace fiber capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Napster, the cat's out of the bag. (Napster's) given
people an idea what it's like to easily share files,'' and
ultimately those files will include bandwidth-draining video, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced that fiber going into the ground
today will need the efficiencies of optic technology soon. The idea
that burgeoning applications _ video-on-demand, in-home video
conferencing, houses wired for remote control by out-of-town owners
_ will suck up the capacity of available fiber is a myth, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly no possibility of fiber exhaustion,'' said Tom
Nolle, president of New Jersey-based telecommunications consulting
firm CIMI Corp. Nolle _ who bases his research on Federal
Communications Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission
filings by large telecom companies and on industry interviews _
contends just 13 percent of fiber in the ground is being used.
</P>
<P>
   Nolle said it would take years for burgeoning bandwidth-heavy
applications to use up available fiber capacity. Investors and
industry players are creating an irrational frenzy around the idea
that fiber will run out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems to be a minority view and the development of the
new technology continues rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest optic technologies is wavelength division
multiplexing, which uses laser technology invented in the 1950s but
largely shelved until the 1980s. In WDM, lasers push light through
prisms. The resulting rainbow then is separated into color-coded
channels, or wavelengths. Each of these colors _ numbering from a
dozen to hundreds _ carries a stream of information with a single
purpose or destination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a shade of blue can carry all the voice traffic
leaving an office tower. A red channel can carry all the data
heading out of the building. Or, a yellow stream of light can carry
all the voice and data traffic traveling from that building to a
satellite office.
</P>
<P>
   Wavelength division multiplexing has at its core another
fiber-enhancing technology _ time division multiplexing. TDM has
been in use via copper lines since the mid-1970s and via
fiber-optic cables since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It uses pulses of light generated by a laser to transmit data.
</P>
<P>
   While wave division multiplexing increases the number of
channels simultaneously running across a fiber, time division
multiplexing increases the speed at which each bit of information
travels over that fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't manufacture enough (fiber) to keep up with demand,''
said Kathy Szelag, vice president of marketing for Lucent
Technologies' optical networking group. That's why Lucent is
looking beyond simply producing more fiber _ as 3,600 of the
company's employees do at its fiber-production plant in Norcross _
to making the fiber that customers have do more.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's New Jersey-based optical group creates equipment for
building optical networks. A single strand of Lucent's
highest-grade fiber combined with its state-of-the-art optics
transmission equipment can carry all telephone voice traffic in the
United States, Szelag said.
</P>
<P>
   Antec's Stanzione contends the number of Internet users sending
truly heavy-duty information across today's networks is
``minuscule.'' But that will change once cable and
telecommunications companies deliver the high-speed Internet
connections people want, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antec's customers (cable companies) aren't having trouble
selling these services, they're having trouble keeping up with
demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies who will foot the bill for optic technology
aren't rushing to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Time Warner Cable and Atlanta-based Cox Communications
predict it'll be a while before they'll need wavelength division
multiplexing to expand the capacity of their fiber. And even then,
it'll only be used in high-use homes or businesses within high-use
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has included optical equipment in 95 percent of its
upgraded cable markets, but the company doesn't expect to use wave
division multiplexing soon, said Paul Gemme, vice president of
plant engineering for Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   For Cox, ``it'll be three to five years before we have enough
subscribers and enough high-powered applications to need to look at
more efficient fiber use,'' said Alex Best, Cox's executive vice
president of engineering. Cox Communications is majority owned by
the same company that owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   CIMI's Nolle predicts it'll take even longer and that the wait
will cool growth in optics-based firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation in the industry is not for a gradual change,
it's for an immediate change,'' he said. ``But vendors who are
entering the market in optics today are not going to find the
buyers they expect.''

NASA BEGINS COUNTDOWN FOR ATLANTIS MISSION TO SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ NASA on Tuesday began the countdown for
the launching of the shuttle Atlantis on a mission to prepare the
international space station for the arrival of its first resident
astronauts and cosmonauts late this year.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle is scheduled to lift off from NASA's Kennedy Space
Center on Friday at 7:45 a.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters offered a 60 percent chance of favorable weather,
warning that showers or cloudy skies could thwart efforts to begin
the 11-day flight.
</P>
<P>
   Once they dock with the station, the seven-member Atlantis crew
will unload 5,000 pounds of cargo from the shuttle and from an
unmanned Russian Progress cargo capsule that has been parked at the
orbital outpost since early August.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo includes mechanical devices to generate and recycle
air aboard the space station, a toilet, exercise equipment and
other gear future residents of the station will require.
</P>
<P>
   During a lengthy spacewalk, two of the fliers are prepared to
install an external guidance device called a magnetometer as well
as to connect communications cables between two of the station's
three modules.
</P>
<P>
   The activities are intended to prepare the slowly developing
station for the arrival of American commander Bill Shepherd and
cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev in early November. The
three men are prepared for a four-month stay, kicking off at least
a decade of permanent occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone was made possible in July with the long-delayed
launching of the Russian-built Zvezda crew module, a 43-foot-long
compartment that equipped the station with its first living and
working quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic problems slowed development of the Zvezda
module by more than two years. The difficulties brought all major
construction of the station to a halt after the first major
components were joined in orbit in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis mission marks the first in a wave of nine supply
and construction flights planned by NASA this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all excited. There are an awful lot of launches coming
up in the next year, and the space station will really begin to
take shape,'' said Atlantis astronaut Ed Lu as the shuttle crew
arrived at Kennedy late Sunday for the countdown. ``We're all
looking forward to getting this off on the right foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis commander Terry Wilcutt's crew includes pilot Scott
Altman, flight engineer Rick Mastracchio, mission specialist Dan
Burbank, Russian cosmonaut Boris Morukov, Lu and his spacewalking
colleague Yuri Malenchenko, also a Russian cosmonaut.
</P>
<P>
   The seven men will fly NASA training aircraft, attend mission
briefings, undergo medical exams and rest during the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, space agency officials reported near trouble-free
launch preparations. Over the weekend, lightning damaged a runway
navigational aid that furnishes shuttle crews with distance and
directional measurements during the landing phase of their flight.
The ground system was repaired Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Why don't I talk about short-selling more? Why don't I spend
more time hacking down stocks? Two reasons: one is that America is
not yet ready for people knocking stocks. I know that from
Wavephore, the stock I knocked on CNBC a while back at $15. It's
now at less than a buck. I don't hear any cheers.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to pay my $50,000 legal bill for the
investigation into whether I profited from the decline _ I didn't
and was never short the stock _ be my guest.
</P>
<P>
   There's no public service award for knocking stocks, even if in
your head and heart you think they should be lower.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason I don't talk about short-selling is because
it's dangerous. It's too hard for people, even professionals, at
times, and so should be discouraged, not encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the tragedy that falsely felled Emulex tells you
that. Mark S. Jakob, who allegedly dropped this highflier, didn't
approach this ruse, which will now destroy his life, because he
wanted to profit from buying low into Emulex. He issued the release
because he was short Emulex.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of being down so much on a stock that looked like it
was going to go to infinity _ the shorts' real nightmare _ was the
motivating factor behind this amazing fraud. It was at the root of
Jakob's downfall from honest short-seller to perhaps soon-to-be
convicted felon.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, if he'd been long a stock and it was getting
hammered, he would have dealt with the pain in a much less
felonious manner.
</P>
<P>
   I've been there. I've been short a stock and watched it go up
and up _ and I don't mean Amazon, which is just a few points from
my basis _ and daydreamed about some fraud or debacle that might
bring the target low. I have watched, in horror, as a stock I've
been short gravitated up endlessly. I have lost millions shorting.
But I have also made millions shorting. And I know the risks and
the pains. Most don't.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife and I were reading about the unraveling of Jakob,
she said to me, ``You could do a real service and write about how
people who aren't pros should never short. They don't know that the
pain of a bad short is so much worse than the pain of a bad long.''
That's the understatement of the year.
</P>
<P>
   When you sense that the whole world is high-fiving a short of
yours, which I'm sure Jakob felt because Emulex has had a
staggering run, the burden can be with you every waking second. You
can see Emulex everywhere. You wake up with a chart of Emulex going
to $2000 in your head. You imagine splits. You fantasize about
horrible new contracts that might come Emulex's way.
</P>
<P>
   When you're short a stock like Emulex, you see your whole
financial life pass before your eyes. You start thinking about how
it has wiped out two or three years of earnings. And that's before
tax. You think your parents will turn their backs on you, as they
would never understand shorting anyway. You wonder whether anything
will ever bring the stock down.
</P>
<P>
   Then you take matters into your own hands.
</P>
<P>
   And you get caught in no time.
</P>
<P>
   What was the short case on Emulex anyway? That it was ``too
high?'' In a world where stocks routinely sell at 500 times
earnings, or have no earnings at all, who's to judge whether Emulex
is too high? That it was about to miss? It had just shot the lights
out with its quarter. That it was going to be downgraded? With rare
exceptions, stocks only get downgraded because everybody knows that
they've become dogs, unworthy of the sponsorship machine.
</P>
<P>
   There was no great short bet here other than one that would
apply to dozens of other stocks: It went up real fast, so maybe it
will come down real fast.
</P>
<P>
   What's the conclusion you should reach if you're playing this
game at home or from an underfunded perch as a nonprofessional
trader at work? How about don't short if you aren't a pro. The pain
isn't worth the potential gain.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, stocks are meant to go up. They are promoted and
flogged and pushed and loved. Respect the ``UP'' machine.
Short-term, it almost always wins. And all you have, when you are
shorting, is the short-term.
</P>
<P>
   It's just too hard to do.

   BUSH-DRUGS (Allentown, Pa.) _ Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday
proposed a fundamental overhaul of Medicare, giving elderly people
the option to purchase a prescription drug benefit and offering
subsidies for lower income people to buy private health insurance.
Bush unveiled his Medicare plan after weeks of pressure from Vice
President Al Gore who considers health care one of his strongest
issues and who has been hammering his rival for avoiding specifics.
In doing so Bush took a sharply different approach from Gore who
would dedicate more money to the current Medicare system and then
add a new government prescription drug benefit on top of it. By
Alison Mitchell.

   BUSH-DRUGS-COMPARE (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's proposal

of insurance companies and giving elderly people more choices. By

   HMO-COSTS (Undated) _ Health insurance premiums are increasing
anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent across the country, the
steepest increase since the early 1990s, according to employers,
insurers, and regional business groups. The increase is driven in
large part by a rapid increase in drug costs, analysts and
employers said. By Milt Freudenheim.

   RAMPAGE-ITHACA (Ithaca, N.Y.) _ In rampage killing cases around
the country, people who knew the killers often said they alerted
police about strange behavior beforehand, but were told by police
that their hands were tied. Ithaca, in a system that policing
experts say is unmatched in the country, has tried to deal with
this problem. When police here receive a report that someone is
behaving bizarrely, making threats or talking suicide, a police
officer and a mental health clinic supervisor are sent together to
assess the situation. They can intervene when the case is
potentially dangerous, such as when someone is threatening murder,
but also in cases that seem less serious, as when a woman recently
reported seeing Martians. By Laurie Goodstein.

 &HT;    TIME WARNER AND AOL FACE REGULATORY PRESSURES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - As regulators in the United States and Europe
increase scrutiny of the proposed merger of Time Warner Inc. and
America Online Inc., consumer advocates may be getting closer to
winning the safeguards they want on the deal
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are alarmed about
this merger and its consequences to competition,'' said Jeffrey
Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education, a
non-profit group pushing for government-imposed restraints on the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Thursday, European regulators will be holding
closed-door hearings to grill AOL and Time Warner executives about
their plans to create a global interactive media giant. A
confidential report, issued by the European Commission and leaked
to the U.S. media, suggests the hearings will be less than
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the European Commission, which sets anti-trust
policy for 15 countries, has reached the ``preliminary view'' that
``competition would be significantly impeded'' if the merger were
to proceed as proposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are stepping up their
investigations, and the House subcommittee on telecommunications
plans to hold a hearing on the merger later this month. The date
has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Chester said that if AOL, the world's No. 1 Internet company,
and Time Warner, one of the world's biggest cable and media
companies, were to join forces, the combined company could force
captive cable customers to take AOL Time Warner's services and
content.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that, Chester said regulators must insist AOL Time
Warner offer its cable customers an unlimited number choices among
Internet service providers. It also must offer a full array of
content, without bias for its own material, and end all joint
ventures with AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest cable operator, to
ensure tough competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced Jan. 10, executives of AOL and Time
Warner have repeatedly said they would offer their content and
services via digital subscriber lines and satellite, as well as
cable, to give customers plenty of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of
America, said even that assurance rings hollow without a consent
decree, enforceable in court. AOL and Time Warner executives
``obviously have not convinced anyone'' they will keep their word,
he said. As a result, consumer advocates are gaining ground with
the regulators. ``We're getting there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that unnamed sources
said the FTC may ask AOL to sell its $1.5 billion stake in General
Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics unit, a maker of satellites. And
the Wall Street Journal reported that regulators might restrict AOL
Time Warner's relationship with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC spokesman refused to comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory reviews may be rattling some investors. Shares of
Time Warner fell $2.88, or 3 percent, to close at $81.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where shares of AOL were unchanged at $57.50.
</P>
<P>
   Scott B. Davis, a Wall Street analyst with First Union
Securities, said he believes that while some consumer safeguards
may be imposed, the merger is in no danger of being killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at what issues have been raised, I don't see
anything...that would be anywhere close to a deal breaker,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Time Warner executives ``are going to have to provide strong
assurances that they will do what they have said'' about giving
consumers many choices, he said. ``But at the end of the day, the
merger will close on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for AOL and Time Warner say the reviews do not
threaten the deal, which is ``on track to close this fall.''
Shareholders of both companies already have approved it
overwhelmingly.

   Three Discounters Open New Air Routes
</P>
<P>
   Three discount airlines are establishing new routes this autumn
_ AirTran Airways is adding service to Toledo, Ohio, from its hub
in Atlanta; JetBlue Airways is expanding its service between
Kennedy International Airport and Florida; and the Las Vegas-based
National Airlines will begin flying to Ronald Reagan National
Airport in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, (800) 247-8726 or www.airtran.com on the Web, is
introducing service between Atlanta and Toledo on Oct. 3 with three
daily nonstops using DC-9 jets. A one-way ticket starts at $79 if
purchased 14 days in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 18, JetBlue, (800) 538-2583 or www.jetblue.com,
will offer daily flights from Kennedy Airport to West Palm Beach,
Fla., aboard Airbus A320s. On Nov. 18, that service will increase
to twice a day, and a daily flight to Fort Myers, Fla., will begin.
A one-way ticket for either destination starts at $79 14 days in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   National Airlines, (888) 757-5387 or www.nationalairlines.com on
the Web, will begin offering daily nonstop flights on Boeing 757's
to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington from Las Vegas on
Oct. 26. The 14-day advance round-trip fare starts at $328.
</P>
<P>
   London Museum Addresses Digital Age
</P>
<P>
   London's Science Museum has recently opened a
107,640-square-foot addition that explores such topics as genetics,
digital technology and artificial intelligence. Designed by
MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, the four floors of the new Wellcome
Wing contain six exhibition areas and a 450-seat Imax theater. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A first-floor exhibition called Antenna presents the latest
developments in science. It covers drugs in sports, among other
subjects, and looks at how engineers study sea life such as sharks
and seahorses with robotic submarines. Pattern Pod, an area for
children 8 and younger, allows participants to explore patterns
that occur in nature, like those in a butterfly's wings, through
hands-on games and interactive wall and floor panels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who Am I, on the second floor, presents the latest developments
in biomedical research. Visitors will see equipment used for the
Human Genome Project and will be able to find out how DNA was used
in identifying living relatives of the Bleadon Man, a
2,000-year-old Iron Age man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the new wing is the computer that Tim Berners-Lee
used to design the World Wide Web at the CERN physics laboratory
near Geneva, writing the first software for it in 1990 and 1991; it
can be seen at Digitopolis on the third floor. In Future, on the
fourth floor, allows visitors to use interactive games to explore
how science and technology can affect the future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Science Museum, Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London
SW7 2DD; (44-207) 942 4455, www.sciencemuseum.org.uk. Open daily 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission $10.40, free for children under 16.

   Nob Hill Landmark Unveils Renovations
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Hopkins Inter-Continental Hotel in San Francisco is
scheduled to complete a yearlong renovation by the end of this
month. Although the 19-story hotel, a Nob Hill fixture for more
than 75 years, has remained open during the project, up to 75
percent of its rooms were closed at a time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Improvements include expanded bathrooms, a renovated lobby, new
decor and the installation of high-speed Internet access and
high-tech lighting and temperature controls in each room. To
accommodate 10 new suites, the number of rooms has dropped from 389
to 380. Other than a cleaning, the renovations did not involve the
hotel's landmark facade, which was restored about 18 years ago.
Also untouched was its well-known Top of the Mark lounge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Built in French chateau and Spanish Renaissance styles, the
hotel opened in 1926 on the site of the former mansion of Mark
Hopkins, one of four magnates who founded what eventually became
the Southern Pacific Railroad.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Hopkins Inter-Continental is at 1 Nob Hill, (800)
662-4455; on the Web at www.markhopkins.net. Doubles run $320 to
$410, with suites $510 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Offer Advice On the Web, for a Fee
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site allows travelers to consult with guidebook
authors to plan their trips and make reservations with specialists
on particular destinations. The site, 12degrees.com, which went
online in June without fanfare, is not a search engine for
discounts but rather is a way to plan customized travel.
</P>
<P>
   The site lists more than 30 writers who are available for
consultation in planning a trip. These freelance authors have had a
name-brand guidebook published _ by Fodor's, Lonely Planet or
Frommer's, among other series _ in the last three years, according
to Steve Bisset, the chief executive officer. These consultations,
generally by phone or e-mail, cost $75 to $125 an hour, with an
estimate given before the consultation. The authors also provide
the site with suggested itineraries, which are available free to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site lists 60 travel specialists, wholesale
companies of 2 to 10 people, who plan and book travel to areas they
know intimately. Pallavi Shah, for example, who specializes in
India and Italy, operates Our Personal Guest, a custom travel
agency in Manhattan. She grew up in India and has returned more
than 80 times, and has been planning trips to Italy for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   There is no extra charge for the service of the specialists, who
work on a typical commission basis with hotels, airlines and other
providers, according to Mark Campbell, 12degrees' marketing
director.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, go to www.12degrees.com or call (888)
390-1919.
</P>
<P>
   French Towns Compete With (and for) Flowers
</P>
<P>
   There's a fairly common road sign in France that guidebooks and
maps aren't much help with. Wherever a major roadway enters a city,
town or village, there is a sign stating the name of the community
in bold black and white _ easy to understand. But right under the
name of about 1,600 communities, you will also see one to four
cartoonish flower symbols, five-lobed daisies of the sort that used
to adorn VW Beetles 30 years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   If you are lucky, your map might tell you that the symbol means
``award-winning floral environment,'' an indication that in the
town ahead, you should plan on stopping to smell the roses ... and
the cannas, petunias and other flowers. The town has won a
nationwide competition for horticultural excellence called Villes
et Villages Fleuris, which has been under way for more than 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   This year 185 towns in France have proudly hung new signs _ in
bold red and yellow. Recent winners are Bandol, on the Cote d'Azur,
and Houlgate, in Normandy, both of which won a one-flower sign last
year. The highest rank is four-flower Grand Prix, which means a
second sign, in white and green, is added. Last year Colmar in
Alsace won such a rating.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a town enters the competition, the citizens, businesses and
government agree to cooperate in planting flowers and gardens in
all sorts of places visible to the public, including front yards,
traffic circles and residential windowboxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 11,000 communities compete each year. Last year, 129
cities and villages were awarded the four-flower sign (the number
changes each year).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A free booklet (in French and updated annually) describes the
four-flower villages. ``Ballades: 129 Villes et Villages Fleuris''
is distributed by the French Government Tourist Office, 444 Madison
Ave., 16th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10022.
</P>
<P>
   By the Casinos, a Casbah (Las Vegas Style)
</P>
<P>
   The word ``bizarre'' has been applied to Las Vegas more than
once. Now ``bazaar'' has entered the local lexicon, too, with the
opening last month of Desert Passage, a shopping mall with a Middle
Eastern theme.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a ``shopping adventure,'' rather than a
``shopping mall,'' if one is to believe the promoters of the
500,000-square-foot retail center, which is connected to the
Aladdin Resort and Casino, across Las Vegas Boulevard from
Bellagio. How adventuresome most shoppers will feel as they walk by
such mall regulars as Ann Taylor, Clinique and Hugo Boss is
anybody's guess. Then again, there's probably a limited market for
figs, dates and exotic spices in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Passage, much like the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, is
designed to apply the theme-park touch to spending and getting. The
130 stores and 14 restaurants are set amid Moorish archways,
authentic antiques and other Moroccan decor, all of it aimed at
making shoppers think they are strolling in the markets of Tangier,
Fez and Marrakesh. A 115-foot freighter is ``docked'' inside the
building, and there is an eight-story re-creation of a hillside
village.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight, although the
restaurants and nightclubs will operate later. Even when all the
businesses are closed, Desert Passage will remain open for visitors
to walk through.
</P>
<P>
   As with any good casbah, the pace barely slows at night. The
restaurants in Desert Passage will include branches of Commander's
Palace, the New Orleans restaurant; Bice, from Milan; and Anasazi,
from Santa Fe. The Blue Note Jazz Club, a haunt of Manhattan jazz
aficionados, also has a branch there.
</P>
<P>
   But even though there is a rug merchant, Desert Passage will
never pass for an authentic souk for at least one reason: No
tourist touts.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Now that decisions on deploying a missile
defense system will be put off until at least early next year, it's
time to deal with a less sweeping but more immediate life-and-death
issue: the crumbling of satellites that can prevent accidental
launches of Russia's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For a picture of what these satellites are intended to do,
consider a famous near-disaster on the American side in 1979. A
training tape simulating a massive Soviet nuclear attack was
accidentally run on the computers of the North American Aerospace
Defense Command. Everyone thought it was real, and crews prepared
to launch American missiles in retaliation. What stopped them were
our early-warning satellites, which showed there were no Soviet
missiles in the air.
</P>
<P>
   On at least two other occasions, once each in the United States
and Russia, space-based sensors played the same lifesaving role
after other systems sent mistaken warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States still have thousands of missiles
ready to launch at each other on a few minutes' notice. American
leaders still have satellite warning systems to prevent accidental
launches when other systems give false warnings. But most of
Russia's early-warning satellites have stopped functioning or
wandered out of their assigned orbits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the Russian system was still in good repair, some
Russian military people misinterpreted a NASA research rocket as an
attack designed to blind their radars to incoming American
missiles. Fortunately, their satellite warning system, still
providing 24-hour space-based surveillance of American missile
fields, showed them they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites and sensing devices are expensive and technically
complex, and they need regular maintenance and replacement. Russian
factories that produced the parts have closed, and scientists who
know how to work with the systems have been forced to seek other
jobs. Clearly, it's in the American interest to step in.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should immediately spend about $160 million to
get five Russian early-warning satellites _ ready to go but
languishing on the ground _ into space. Next, we should make a firm
commitment to financing joint research with Russia into new, less
costly satellite missile sensors that Russia could more easily
afford. The Clinton administration has tied its backing to demands
for Russian concessions on missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Russian satellites functioning would be far more
effective than a joint early-warning center in Moscow that was also
proposed by the Clinton administration. At this center, American
and Russian military personnel would sit side by side, looking at
computer screens displaying the data from their own early-warning
systems but free to look over each other's shoulders. If Russia
suspected the United States was launching a missile attack, would
its leaders really believe American computer screens that did not
show it?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether a missile defense is eventually approved,
the relatively inexpensive safety systems needed to prevent a
mistaken attack from Russia's still powerful missile force cannot
be allowed to fail.

   WASHINGTON _ Every four years the men who would be president
squabble over the presidential debates. What format? Which
journalists should ask questions? Stools vs. lecterns?
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the debate over the debates has more
consequence. The four major television news networks have allowed
themselves to be sucked into the game in ways that will only weaken
presidential debate and bring more disparagement to journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, not for the first time, is that members of the
press have allowed short-term commercial self-interest to overwhelm
the long-term welfare of their profession.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than accept the proposal of the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates, which called for three debates to be
broadcast widely, the Bush campaign agreed to just one commission
debate and two alternatives: ``Larry King Live'' on CNN, and a
prime-time edition of ``Meet the Press with Tim Russert'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Rival TV networks are balking at using their airwaves to
broadcast a competitor's show, a reaction the Bush campaign may
have counted on. If this state of affairs plays out, relatively few
Americans may see the men who aspire to lead us engaged in one of
the few long, face-to-face moments of this campaign that is not
completely scripted.
</P>
<P>
   The excluded networks will ``counter-program'' with game shows
and sitcoms and make more money, while the network with the
exclusive debate will tout its commitment to public service and
hope that in the end, the publicity will boost the ratings of its
news shows. The lot of them will rationalize their actions in the
public's name, and all of it will be disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the networks helped create this problem. NBC
actively promoted ``Meet the Press'' as a debate alternative,
according to one executive, and CNN lobbied for Larry King. Bush
took them up on their offers. CBS lobbied for ``Face the Nation''
but lost out.
</P>
<P>
   The networks should put citizens' interests first, and it's not
too late for them to do so. To ensure that all the networks will
air the debates, NBC and CNN should offer Russert and King as
moderators, but promise that the debates would be independent
programs and not some network product.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement would mean that more of the public would see
the two candidates discuss the issues. The networks would also not
undermine the Commission on Presidential Debates, which was set up
in part to prevent candidates from gaining advantage by playing
journalism organizations off against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives have justified their attempts to gain
exclusivity by claiming that they are trying to create alternatives
and save the debates. That is bunk, and they know it. When network
news executives start trying to one-up each other, they play into
the candidates' hands. Bush and Gore will get away with whatever
advantage they can.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes here are greater than they might appear. If the
independent commission is replaced by a commercial free-for-all,
debates in future campaigns may serve the candidates much more than
the voters. Or there may be no debates, which is what happened from
1964 until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, what we have now is another example of the
press confirming the public's worst suspicion of journalists: that
we are in it only for ourselves and for the money.

CONNECTICUT DIRECTOR TO LEAD NEW ENGLAND ADL EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nine months after the death of its revered regional
director, the Anti-Defamation League Tuesday chose the longtime
director of its Connecticut office to replace Leonard Zakim as the
civil rights organization's top official in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Leikind, a former Essex County assistant district
attorney and a graduate of Boston College Law School, will begin
work Wednesday as executive director of the organization's New
England region, based in Boston. The Anti-Defamation League is a
Jewish community organization that fights anti-Semitism with a
variety of programs aimed at preventing and responding to prejudice
and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Zakim had directed the ADL's New England region for 15 years
before his death of cancer last December at the age of 46. Zakim
was well regarded by a variety of community and religious leaders
for his efforts to battle prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously difficult whenever you have someone as
charismatic and as important to an organization who you lose, but
Rob is going to be a terrific executive director,'' said Carl E.
Axelrod, regional chairman of the ADL. ``He knew Lenny, and that
will help, but Rob will be his own person and Rob will be
different. He will have his strengths as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Leikind, a 47-year-old native of Great Neck, N.Y., has been the
director of the Connecticut office for 11 years. In that capacity,
he has been an advocate of laws against hate crimes, an opponent of
school vouchers, and has worked with Jewish insitutions on security
concerns after a rash of bomb threats last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Leikind said that although numerous people have
suggested to him that following Zakim will be difficult, he views
succeeding such a visible leader as a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny was an extraordinarly gifted and heroic leader who had a
creative mind and a passion that was second to none,'' Leikind
said. ``He instilled a vision in people, and that gives me an
advantage and a leg up that few professionals have.''
</P>
<P>
   Leikind takes over the Boston office at a time when it is
strong, having enjoyed fundraising and programming successes over
the last year. He declined to offer any specific proposals for
Boston, saying he would spend the next months familiarizing himself
with the office and the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to understand the programs that are already running and
existing, but a big part of my job will be to sustain the momentum
and the excitement that surrounds the work of the ADL,'' Leikind
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Leikind spent his energy working on diversity
training programs for adults and children, including using
theatrical programs to discuss prejudice. He also attempted to help
local communities to create anti-bias coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Leikind was active in pushing the Connecticut legislature on a
variety of proposals to stiffen punishment for bias crimes and to
promote freedom of religious expression.
</P>
<P>
   As a resident of New Haven and an active member of Connecticut's
Jewish community, Leikind is friendly with Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
who is the Democratic nominee for vice president. Asked whether he
supported the ADL's decision last week to take Lieberman to task
for some of his comments about religion in public life, Leikind
said he thought the ADL had ``raised an important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as our religious values and faith are a very important
avenue for hope and healing in our society, historically religious
differences have become forces of divisiveness, and that means
public leaders, who exercise enormous power, need to operate with
care,'' he said.

<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ It was nearly four years ago when the police
climbed the creaky stairs to Deborah Stagg's apartment in response
to calls from neighbors who had heard her screaming and raving
alone in there. Stagg was known around town as a woman so disturbed
she had once delivered her own baby by cutting her womb open with a
penknife.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a steak knife in hand, Stagg bolted from her
barricaded bathroom and stabbed Inspector Michael A. Padula in the
neck, a fatal wound. The police opened fire, killing Stagg. The
double deaths were a pivotal trauma in Ithaca, where Padula was the
first police officer killed in the line of duty. In the grim
aftermath, the police blamed the mental health department, and
mental health advocates blamed the police.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the mourning and finger-pointing, a policeman
and a mental health clinic supervisor who were distant
acquaintances got together over beer to talk about whether they
could prevent such occurrences, jotting down ideas on bar napkins.
Out of it grew a collaboration between the Ithaca police and mental
health departments that some policing experts say is unmatched
anywhere in the country because of its focus on pre-empting
problems in addition to responding to crises.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the police department receives a call that someone is
behaving bizarrely, making threats or talking of suicide, it is
usually the two men who brainstormed in the bar _ Lt. John Beau
Saul of the police department and Terry Garahan, the mental health
clinic supervisor _ who drive to the scene together in a worn
police van to assess the situation. They have paved the way for
other police officers or county sheriffs and mental health workers
to regularly go out on calls together.
</P>
<P>
   They intervene when the case is potentially dangerous, as when a
young man threatened to kill the staff at a temporary employment
agency and then kill himself. But they also intervene when the case
might appear frivolous, as when a woman called to report Martians
invading through her ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out and find these people and try to get them to get the
help they need,'' said Saul, steering the van down a leafy street
to visit an elderly man who had called the police to report a jar
of peanut butter stolen from his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to other places,'' Saul said, ``people like this are
avoided like the plague. We actually go out of our way to find
these people and engage them.''
</P>
<P>
   Garahan said, ``The theory is, you solve problems even when
they're not problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely team, one a clean-cut cop, the other a long-haired
social worker, uses a carrot-and-stick approach, sometimes cajoling
a person into getting mental health treatment or contacting other
social services, and sometimes, where criminal behavior is
involved, using the threat of arrest or imprisonment. The result is
that even Ithaca police officers who were initially cynical about
the approach now say they have seen a steep decline in the number
of chronic phone callers tying up police lines and time, and fewer
untreated mentally ill people out on the streets. In several cases,
they succeeded in defusing emotionally disturbed people who were
armed and threatening violence, prodding them into psychiatric care
rather than prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of ``Rampage Killers'' conducted earlier this year by
The New York Times, family, friends, and neighbors of killers
repeatedly said in interviews afterward that they had observed the
killers behaving strangely or making threats before the crime, and
had tried to alert the police or mental health officials, to no
avail. The police often say their hands are tied, and they can
intervene only after the person has demonstrated a danger to
himself or others. Mental health services and hospitals in most
places are stretched so thin that they too are unequipped to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Ithaca has dared to move beyond this ``hands are
tied'' response. A maverick university town in upstate New York at
the southern tip of Cayuga Lake, Ithaca has committed the resources
of its police and mental health departments to respond even when
there is no immediate crisis. It allows the sharing of information
between the departments about past criminal and mental health
histories, treading close to a line that could raise the hackles of
civil libertarians and advocates for mental health patients.
</P>
<P>
   The approach in Ithaca goes beyond that of other cities in which
police departments have begun policing programs for dealing with
the mentally ill. The model most commonly copied is from Memphis,
Tenn., where a specially trained police unit responds to crisis
calls about emotionally disturbed people, referred to by the police
as EDP's). Other cities, like Los Angeles and Birmingham, Ala.,
have paired social workers with police officers who respond to
crises involving the mentally ill, said several experts who study
policing.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual in Ithaca is the emphasis on prevention, and the
decision to devote police resources to following up on people with
chronic problems who do not always want to accept help. Over the
course of the summer, they revisited several cases, including those
of a mentally ill crack addict who is resisting drug treatment, an
angry schizophrenic who had threatened his ex-wife and was making
harassing phone calls to public officials at their homes, and a
paranoid factory worker who wanted the police to investigate ``mind
intrusion machines'' he insisted were planted in his home and
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   By Labor Day, Saul and Garahan had succeeded in steering two of
them into treatment and were still making weekly visits to persuade
the crack-addicted man to enter a drug detoxification program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty unique. I haven't heard of that type of
follow-up before,'' said Melissa M. Reuland, a research associate
at the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit group in
Washington whose members include chiefs from the nation's larger
police departments. ``This really is problem-solving in action,
identifying hot spots and partnering with service providers in your
community who have expertise where you don't. If we could subject
this to a really critical legal and ethical analysis, I think it's
got some promise.''
</P>
<P>
   But such aggressive police involvement has a risk, said Henry J.
Steadman, the president of Policy Research Associates, who studies
mental disorders and the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a potential invasiveness there for individuals who
would feel coerced into mental health services because the police
are still checking up on them in the role of police officers,''
Steadman said. ``If the person is simply seen as in need of
treatment, then why should the police be hanging around forcing the
person into treatment?''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Honberg, director of legal affairs at the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill, said, ``I think it's great that Ithaca cares
enough to do something creative. I just worry that if it's done the
wrong way it conjures up images of Big Brother at its worst.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The police are often on the front lines of mental health care in
this country, like it or not. For instance, the Ithaca police
department was called on Aug. 26, 1999, when the managers at
Stafkings, a temporary employment agency, arrived at work to hear
two chilling messages on their answering machine from an unemployed
man who said he was frustrated that he had not been offered a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll kill all y'all up in there. I ain't playing, man,'' he
said, spitting out his words in the recorded message. ``The day
that I kill all you I'll probably kill myself because I'm upset
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In many smaller police departments that have not been trained in
threat assessment, the routine response would be to document the
complaint, and leave it at that. In Ithaca, the police department
contacted Garahan, who, as supervisor of the county outpatient
mental health clinic, knew the man who had left the message. Jason
James, who is 21, suffered from psychotic episodes and had received
a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder at the clinic, but had quit
treatment. The phone threats indicated he had reached a critical
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Found at his house, James was charged with aggravated harassment
but was told he could avoid jail by committing to a program of
counseling and psychiatric medication. James, accompanied by
Garahan, appeared in court before Judge Judith A. Rossiter, who
often works closely with Garahan and Saul to devise alternatives to
prison for emotionally disturbed people. Rossiter discontinued the
charge on the condition that James resumed treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One day last month, James rode his bicycle to Ithaca's mental
health clinic to receive his daily medication. Soft-spoken and
serious, James said that now that the voices have faded, he knows
he needs the treatment. He said he still struggles, however, to
explain his illness to his family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just wave their hands and say, `He's sick,' `He's crazy.'
I want people to see that I am getting treatment, that I am living
a better life,'' he said, before riding off to a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   Often, however, people are far less compliant, even when facing
arrest. All summer, Garahan and Saul worked on the case of Nicholas
Celia, a 44-year-old man with a record of arrests on charges of
assaults on civilians and police officers, and a history of alcohol
and drug abuse as well as psychiatric problems and hospitalizations
_ the three factors that experts say indicate a potential for
future violence. Recent studies have found that the mentally ill
are no more violent than other people, except when they are off
their medications or have been abusing drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a pirate in a blue bandanna and hoop earring, Celia
wandered the Ithaca Commons, the city's open-air street mall,
sometimes mellow and bumming cigarettes, sometimes screaming and
menacing. He was repeatedly arrested on charges of harassment and
assault, once on Garahan, who got an order of protection against
Celia and began to carry pepper spray. Even some of Celia's friends
at the regular Wednesday night dinner of the local mental health
advocacy group said in interviews that Celia was starting to scare
them, and needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Garahan and Saul decided to use the newest, most aggressive tool
they had to compel Celia into treatment: Kendra's Law, named for
Kendra Webdale, who died after being pushed in front of a New York
City subway train by a mentally ill man. They filed a petition
asking a judge to order Celia into outpatient drug treatment and
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   At his hearing, Celia interrupted a psychiatrist testifying that
he had examined Celia and diagnosed bipolar disorder, or
manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like to say, Your Honor, I am getting a little
upset hearing these lies and innuendo, and this is what happens
when I am under stress and this is a farce to me,'' Celia said,
speaking loud and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Celia to report to the outpatient clinic for
injections of Haldol.
</P>
<P>
   In his police car after the hearing, Saul volunteered that he
was uneasy at the idea of forcing psychiatric drugs on someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a miniature soul-search about it, but then maybe if
Deborah Stagg had been forced to take medication, Mike would still
be alive,'' said Saul, who wears a small pin on his uniform in
honor of Michael Padula, the dead policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Celia's response was to flee. He went to New York City, checked
in to Bellevue Hospital's psychiatric ward, returned to Ithaca, was
arrested, hospitalized again and released, returned to New York
City, was arrested and sent again to Bellevue before being
transferred to a county hospital for long-term treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Bellevue in August, Celia, now
more subdued, insisted he needed no treatment, saying, ``What's
happening to me is an injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in this politically liberal college town, however, it is
hard to find a civil libertarian or mental health consumer who
objects to the work of Garahan and Saul. Some do oppose the law
stemming from the Kendra Webdale killing, but all said in
interviews that they were glad there were officials with mental
health experience to call in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Much of Garahan and Saul's work boils down to protecting
emotionally disturbed people from hurting themselves, or from being
victimized by others. After months in which they tried to convince
the woman obsessed with Martians to seek treatment, she set a fire
in her apartment to exorcise the extraterrestrials. She walked to
the police station and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   And when Garahan and Saul responded to the elderly man who had
reported a jar of peanut butter missing, they found him living in a
basement apartment swarming with flies, with feces tracked across
the floor and a bare light bulb that had burned through a
lampshade. They called building inspectors, who condemned the
place. They called an ambulance for the man, in keeping with their
approach that ``medicalizing'' a mental illness is less threatening
for the person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it doesn't look like compassion, but it is for his
best, and for the neighborhood's best,'' Saul said to neighbors
curious about the ambulance. The landlord has since renovated the
apartment, Garahan said.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether they have ever stopped a rampage killer, Garahan
said: ``You do this stuff and you don't know whether you prevented
something or not. But I do know that the ability of the two
disciplines, police and mental health, to work together has a
tremendous effect on a lot of people's lives.''

UMASS TO BEGIN COSTLY PREPARATION FOR UNCERTAIN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The costs of preparing for a presidential debate are
mounting for Massachusetts taxpayers, even though it is
increasingly uncertain whether the event will take place.
</P>
<P>
   University of Massachusetts officials say they are about to sign
a contract for electrical work that will cost between $120,000 and
$165,000, on the assumption that a debate will be held on the
school's Dorchester campus.
</P>
<P>
   And unless the Commission on Presidential Debates pulls the plug
_ which it said Tuesday it does not want to do _ the university
will soon face an even costlier decision: In two weeks, it is
scheduled to sign a contract to complete the production work needed
to accommodate the press and nationally televise a debate. The
labor and materials for that final phase of construction would cost
between $250,000 and $400,000, according to school officials.
</P>
<P>
   They expressed hope that Governor George W. Bush, who has
proposed a debate schedule that doesn't include Boston, will either
change his mind or that the commission sponsoring the event will
scrap its plans before UMass enters into that last financial
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective spending would come on top of $250,000 the
university has already laid out for infrastructure improvements and
other preparations for a planned matchup between Bush and Vice
President Al Gore on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money is expected to come out of $900,000 that the
state Legislature appropriated for this purpose after the
bipartisan Commision on Presidential Debates chose UMass-Boston as
one of three sites for presidential debates. Any additional funding
presumbably would have to be made up by the school itself, since it
would be contractually obligated to return the $1.6 million it has
raised from corporate sponsors if the debate doesn't take place.
</P>
<P>
   Annemarie Lewis-Kerwin, the UMass spokeswoman, said Tuesday that
the university is contractually bound to continue preparations
until the commission decides to call them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to stop,'' said Lewis-Kerwin. ``We're going to
keep going until someone tells us to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has accepted an invitation to participate in the Boston
event, as well as the commission's proposals for debates in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Sunday announced he would attend only that last debate.
In lieu of the others, he proposed that he and Gore appear next
week on a prime-time edition of NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' and on
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   All the major television networks have agreed to air the three
events run by the commission, as well as one it proposed for the
two vice presidential contenders. But CBS and ABC said Tuesday they
would not broadcast debates that would effectively shine a
prime-time spotlight on their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's offer not only raises questions about this year's
presidential debates _ and threatens to cost Massachusetts hundreds
of thousands of dollars _ but appears to undercut the commission's
authority for the future as well. Most analysts believe the
Democratic and Republican candidates will reach some compromise,
but that might not include a stop at UMass-Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On campus Tuesday, national and local media were given a tour of
the facilities they would use if a debate is held. But many of
those who took the tour grumbled that they were wasting their time
because the prospect appeared to be dimming.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference at UMass yesteray, the debate commission's
executive director, Janet Brown, said Gore had accepted a
commission invitation to discuss the debate schedule in Washington.
She said Bush had not yet replied.
</P>
<P>
   Brown stressed that the commission is amenable to any sort of
suggestion about format to accommodate the candidates' concerns.
And she expressed optimism that, ultimately, Bush's would be met
and the debate at UMass-Boston will take place.
</P>

   Quest for the Grail
</P>
<P>
   Q. For my sister's 30th birthday, I would like to take her on a
King Arthur tour of England, since this is one of her interests. Do
any tour companies, American or English, offer such a program? _
Amy Hoddick, Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. A number of companies will squire you around southwest
England in search of King Arthur, with prices ranging from the
princely to the pedestrian. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gothic Image Tours are led by Arthurian scholars. Highlights of

Castle, on a rocky cliff above the Atlantic; the desolate Dozmary
Pool, one of several spots where Arthur is believed to have thrown
his sword, Excalibur, to be received by the Lady of the Lake;
Stonehenge, said to have been transported by the wizard Merlin from
Ireland; the Glastonbury Tor, where legend has it that King Melwas
held Queen Guinevere captive until Arthur rescued her; and what is
generally agreed to be King Arthur's grave, in Glastonbury. The
cost of the trip, which includes transportation by minicoach and
lodging in three-star hotels featuring traditional British fare, is
$2,150 a person, double occupancy. Call (44-1458) 831281.

   Christmas in Vienna
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 7 years old. I would like to know what my family and I
can do in Vienna during Christmas vacation. Are there any puppet
shows or concerts for children? _ Emma Hitchcock, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Vienna is a wonderland for children at Christmastime.
Beginning Nov. 18, the traditional Christmas market will open in
front of the Rathaus, or City Hall, featuring more than 140 booths
with presents, games, sweets and pony rides, with a magic lantern
show of woodland creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Events for children will include a Christmas Workshop to be held
in the Volkshalle of City Hall, where kids can make their own
Christmas presents and bake gingerbread cookies. There will also be
a games tent, featuring characters from Austrian children's books
and television.
</P>
<P>
   On the four Sundays before Christmas, choirs from all over the
world will sing carols from their homelands under a lighted tree at
City Hall. There will also be a life-size Nativity scene, and eight
creches from the southern province of Styria. Another highlight is
the mechanical dolls of Vienna Waltz World, an exhibit in City Hall
Park, which are based on historical models.
</P>
<P>
   Trees in City Hall Park will be lighted and trimmed with
fantastical decorations, including an all-Santa tree. The Christmas
market is a 700-year-old tradition, where candied fruits and hot
roasted chestnuts (called maroni in Vienna) are served in small
wooden stalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic of Advent 2000, including the market and City Hall
events, will be open daily Nov. 18 to Dec. 23, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
and until 5 p.m. on Dec. 24. For information, and a brochure, call
the Austrian National Tourist Office at (212) 944-6880, or visit
www.christkindlmarkt.at.
</P>
<P>
   Health Coverage Abroad
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand Medicare does not cover injuries or illnesses
that are treated outside the United States. What are the insurance
choices for someone who travels outside the United States three or
four times a year for a month or so at a time? How do tourists in
countries with socialized medicine pay for illnesses that occur and
are treated there? _ Rita H. Irons, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The original Medicare plan, with a few exceptions, does not
cover medical care outside the United States. The exceptions are if
the condition occurs within the United States, and the most
accessible hospital is across the border with Mexico or Canada, or
if you are in direct transit to the continental United States from
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare HMOs do cover emergency procedures abroad, but not
routine care. Eight of the ten Medigap policies that are available
provide 80 percent of the cost of emergency care during the first
two months of a trip outside the country. The deductible is $250,
and the coverage is up to $50,000 in a lifetime. The cost of
additional premiums varies from carrier to carrier and state by
state. In New York State, monthly premium prices for Medigap plans
that cover foreign travel can range from $101.15 to $296, depending
on other features of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the consumer group, the Medicare Rights
Center, (800) 333-4114, or go to its Web site,
www.medicarerights.org. You can also call the New York State
Insurance Department at (800) 342-3736 for information about
insurance companies and premium prices.
</P>
<P>
   Countries with socialized medicine, such as those of the United
Kingdom, will treat you free in case of an accident or emergency,
but will charge for after-care and convalescence.

MINORITIES LOSING OUT ON SENIOR POSTS AT MED SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minority faculty members are less likely to be promoted to
senior professorships at US medical schools than their white
counterparts, even among junior faculty who have won prestigious
research awards, according to a study in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's incredible,'' said Ernest Moy, director of
research at the Association of American Medical Colleges and one of
the study's authors. ``These are the best people in the country in
research, and they're not being promoted at the same rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Moy said the study proves that the ``glass ceiling'' in academic
medicine cannot be blamed on a notion that minority professors are
less productive than others.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes at a time when medical schools are struggling to
hold on to recent gains in minority admissions, in the face of
affirmative action cutbacks in California and Texas. Medical school
applications declined 6 percent overall this year, falling 6.8
percent among the groups medical schools designate
``underrepresented minorities'': African-Americans, Mexican
Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Another study in the current JAMA found that minority
representation on medical admissions committees, while up from the
last major study in 1972, is still small. Dr. Douglas G. Kando of
the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan., reported that 51 percent of
schools have zero or one committee member from an underrepresented
minority group.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are intertwined, according to Moy and Boston-area
medical faculty. Deans want _ and local communities demand _
minority representation on every committee, said Dr. Alvin
Poussaint, a psychiatrist and associate dean of Harvard Medical
School. So the handful of minority professors ``are asked to do
more than their share of administrative duties. . . . That pulls
them away from their department and research and other things that
will get them promotions.'' They also spend a disproportionate
amount of time mentoring minority students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Moy said, minority students who see that minority
faculty members are ``not rewarded'' for their work may be more
likely to seek careers outside academic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A commentary accompanying the articles said that while the
problem reflects broader societal issues, that is no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As members of a profession dedicated to caring, listening and
sensitivity, physicians may rightfully ask whether it is
professionally appropriate to fail to intervene in such systematic
disadvantages for certain individuals,'' wrote Dr. Stanley S.
Bergen Jr., of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey, in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Moy's study looked at 50,145 full-time U.S. medical school
faculty who became associate or assistant professors between 1980
and 1989. By 1997, 46 percent of white assistant professors had
been promoted, compared to 37 percent of Asians and 30 percent of
underrepresented minorities, with similar numbers for associate
professors.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, this year's first-year class of 167 medical students
has 48 underrepresented minorities, up from 30 last year. And in
1995, the medical school strengthened programs to support minority
faculty, said Dr. Joan Reede, associate dean of faculty development
and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, minority representation is lowest at the senior levels.
Among senior faculty, there are five blacks (0.8 percent), no
Native Americans, five Hispanics (0.8 percent) and 22 Asians. Among
assistant professors 20 are black (1.3 percent), one is Native
American, 19 are Hispanic (1.3 percent) and 160 are Asian (11.4
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint, who came to Harvard in 1969 to help recruit minority
students, said that in the ultra-competitive world of medical
schools, it is easier for white faculty to embrace increasing
minority student ranks than to actively recruit minority
professors, who are ``peer competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a bit of cronyism that goes on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing heavy competition for minority faculty, the University of
Massachusetts Medical School decided to ``grow our own,'' said
associate vice chancellor Deborah Harmon-Heins. She runs the
Worcester Pipeline Collaborative, which works with 6,000 children
from kindergarten through high school to get poor and minority
children prepared for careers in the health sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Underrepresented minority students entering U.S. medical schools
increased 27 percent between 1991 and 1994, according to the
Association of American Medical Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But the organization now worries those gains will be eroded with
affirmative action under attack and the smartest students being
lured into other professions _ a problem magnified by studies that
show minority physicians are more likely to work in medically
underserved communities.

LYCOS HOPES OLYMPICS DEAL WILL BOOST IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. hopes a global deal with the sponsors of the 2000
Summer Olympic Games will provide a major boost to the company's
worldwide visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos has been selected to run more than 200 Internet community
sites related to the Olympic games, which will take place in Sydney
later this month. The Waltham, Mass. company will operate 199
sites, one for each of the countries represented in the games, as
well as 35 sites devoted to particular sports, such as gymnastics
and soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics are probably the most well-known sporting event
in the world,'' said Lycos chief executive Bob Davis, adding that
the popularity of the games should help his firm cement its image
as a worldwide Internet power. Growing its non-US audience has long
been a major priority for Lycos, which already offers Web portal
services in 30 countries and is in the process of being acquired by
Spanish Internet firm Terra Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Lycos Olympic communities will be based on the online
community system already used at the Lycos Web portal. Visitors can
create their own communities devoted to particular interests, such
as politics, movies, or sports. Anthony Antonuccio, director of
Lycos Communities, said the service currently hosts about 200,000
such user-created communities.
</P>
<P>
   But the Olympics communities will be created by Lycos and
overseen by about 50 moderators, who will screen incoming messages.
Most of this screening will involve the sites' photo albums, where
visitors will be able to publish favorite pictures. Antonuccio said
all pictures will be checked by the moderators to ensure no
inappropriate or offensive images appear on the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the sites will also need a basic knowledge of
English, because Lycos has not translated the home pages of each
community site into the various national languages. ``It takes
great time and expense to do it properly,'' said Antonuccio, ``and
we only had two weeks.'' Basic navigation links on each site will
be written in English, but users of the site's chat room or message
board will be able to write in his or her own language.
</P>
<P>
   The Lycos Olympics community sites will be advertiser-supported,
with ads provided by various companies sponsoring the games.
Antonuccio predicted advertising at the site would provide more
than enough revenue to cover the costs of running the communities.
The main Sydney Olympics Web site, at www.olympics.com, is expected
to receive 1.4 billion page views during the games, he said, and
Lycos will have a prominent link to its communities on the Olympics
home page. Vistors also will be able to get to the Lycos Olympics
communities by going to clubs.lycos.com.

 &HT;    Coverdell's widow helping Mattingly
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly seven weeks after her husband died, Nancy
Coverdell is taking an active role in the race to select his
successor in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign mailing over the holiday weekend, Coverdell
encourages voters to support Mack Mattingly, a former U.S. senator
and longtime family friend, to carry on her late husband Paul
Coverdell's conservative philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   And she could become more of a presence as the campaign goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever I think might be a need for me, I will offer my
services,'' she said Tuesday. ``I would prefer a conservative
Republican filling my husband's seat. It seems to me Mack Mattingly
is closer in philosophy to Paul than Zell Miller could ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the popular two-term Georgia governor, was appointed to
the seat by Gov. Roy Barnes, a fellow Democrat, until a Nov. 7
special election to fill the remaining four years in the Senate
term. Coverdell died July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's involvement in the race is welcome news to
Mattingly, who has been working the state, trying to bolster
familiarity with a name that hasn't been on the ballot since his
unsuccessful Senate re-election bid in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   And he's hoping endorsements from well-known Republicans will
provide a powerful reintroduction and the built-in politician
organization he will need during the short, intense campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mattingly introduced Republican vice presidential
nominee Dick Cheney to a group of high-dollar Republican donors in
Atlanta, remaining onstage with Cheney during his brief address.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Mattingly accompanied Republican U.S. Rep. Nathan
Deal on several campaign appearances through North Georgia's 9th
Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Mattingly has campaigned in the home districts of four
of Georgia's eight congressional Republicans. He's expecting visits
from several Republican U.S. senators, including Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big plus,'' Mattingly said of the GOP notables. ``The
way I look at it, I've got eight (congressmen) and Zell's got
three. They help bring people to the polls _ along with the
presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But political scientists say Mattingly must reach beyond the GOP
base and connect with millions of Georgians to win the nonpartisan
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's too big to shake every hand,'' said Charles
Bullock, a University of Georgia political scientist. ``He's also
got to get on TV if he's going to cut into the percentage of the
public who don't know who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly has hired a media firm, but he declined to discuss TV
or radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he doesn't need TV ads to secure the support of voters
like Paul Stringer, one of about 25 Lumpkin County residents who
turned out to hear Mattingly speak Thursday. ``National-level
politics is what's going to fuel this race,'' Stringer said. ``With
the direction of the Democratic Party, people are looking at
changing and moving Republican.''

REDRESSING GRIEVANCES IN THE CORPORATE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICKEY MEECE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the U.S. Postal Service had an employee
crisis on its hands. Not the workplace shootings that made
headlines and added the phrase ``going postal'' to the American
vocabulary of violence. Those incidents, while often deadly, were
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   What really threatened the agency's productivity and morale was
an avalanche of complaints by angry, frustrated employees to the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. For years, charges
of racial discrimination, sexual harassment and other management
abuses poured into the watchdog agency from the Postal Service, and
the backlog of informal complaints had built up to an incredible
30,000 filings a year, more than from any other single employer.
Some of the complaints escalated into costly litigation, while
others festered.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994 as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit,
lawyers at the Postal Service, the nation's largest employer,
started one of the most ambitious experiments in dispute-resolution
in American corporate history. They created a program called
Redress to settle disputes using outside neutral mediators, and
tested it in a few cities before rolling it out nationally in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The results were spectacular: in the first 22 months of full
operation, from September 1998 through last June, 17,645 informal
disputes were mediated under Redress and of those, 80 percent were
resolved. During the same time, formal complaints, which peaked at
14,000 by 1997, dropped 30 percent. The lawyers estimate the
program has saved the agency millions of dollars in legal costs and
improved productivity, to say nothing of the gains in intangibles
like job satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two of the Postal Service's lawyers, Cynthia J. Hallberlin,
former chief counsel, and Mary S. Elcano, former general counsel,
have left for private practice at the Brown &AMP; Wood law firm in
Washington, and are taking a similar program, which they have named
Wins, on a road show. They reckon that that if mediation worked
wonders for the Postal Service, it could do so at any company or
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the World Bank has signed on for a review of its
mediation program, and others, including investment banks, dot-coms
and recognized brand-name manufacturers, are interested, the
lawyers say. What is selling them, they say, is Redress' record.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America certainly needs the help. High-profile racial
discrimination and sexual-harassment class-action lawsuits filed in
recent years against industry giants like Texaco and Coca-Cola are
only the tip of the litigation iceberg. Employment discrimination
cases nearly tripled between 1990 and 1998, to 23,735 filings in
federal district courts, according to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, companies are not sitting on their hands. A survey
of Fortune 1,000 companies in 1997 by the Cornell Institute on
Conflict Resolution found that the majority were doing some form of
what is known as alternative dispute resolution to avoid
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Elcano and Hallberlin say they possess one thing that no one
else can offer, a huge database of statistics and exit surveys,
which they say proves how valuable their form of mediation, called
transformative mediation, was to postal workers. In it, the parties
involved control the process and the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that companies are very interested in
transformative mediation,'' Hallberlin said, ``because of its
promise to not just solve the problem at hand, but to help the
parties communicate more effectively in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Redress was created, Postal Service employees embroiled
in disputes with their bosses followed procedures that could drag
on for years. Generally, they would begin by filing an informal
EEOC complaint. They then had the choice of dropping the matter or
going down the bureaucratic path of filing a formal grievance and
causing an official investigation with all its affidavits and
hearings. Ultimately, they might file a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Redress program aimed to short-circuit that process by
offering disgruntled workers mediation. If a person who filed an
informal complaint agreed, a meeting would be set up, a mediator
would hear both sides of the dispute and, in most instances,
propose a solution within a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, all the worker wanted was for his boss to say he was
sorry. ``The power of an apology became very significant,'' Elcano
said. ``People would walk away from litigation with that because
they felt it was an honest give and take.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, one supervisor called all of his mail carriers by a
number, Hallberlin said. One carrier thought it was demeaning and
filed a complaint. When confronted about it in mediation, the
supervisor said he had had no idea that some people found the
practice offensive and said he would stop it immediately. Case
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to get rid of conflict,'' Hallberlin said,
``you just want to handle it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Baruch Bush, a law professor at Hofstra University who
helped design a training program for the 3,000 outside mediators in
Redress, said the goal was to shift conversations between employees
and their supervisors from destructive to constructive. ``If that
happens,'' he said, ``it becomes a more open corporation, and then
the parties themselves in most cases will be able to define what's
bothering them and how to fix it.'' Resolution is a byproduct, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Redress was designed to make mediation available at any stage of
the grievance process, not just at the beginning. In one
class-action racial-discrimination lawsuit that had originated in
an EEOC complaint, black postal workers in Florida accused a white
postmaster of making racist remarks about their work habits. They
sought his dismissal, Hallberlin said.
</P>
<P>
   It never came to that or to a dollar settlement, she said,
because both parties agreed to bring in an outside mediator. In the
end, the postmaster apologized, wrote a check to the NAACP and
joined the Postal Service's diversity committee.``In future
dealings, he had a more harmonious post office,'' Hallberlin said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kirsch, an outside mediator working in New York, recalled
a case involving a postal supervisor and an employee, both women,
one white and one black, neither willing to back down. The dispute
was over the employee's repeated lateness, Kirsch said, but really
it was about a lack of communication. After yelling at each other
for one-and-a-half hours, she said, the two became quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch said she took the opportunity to point out that the two
had more in common than they thought. Sometime after that, she
said, the supervisor and employee returned to hammering out
particular issues and rehashing events. Finally, one said words to
this effect: ``You never lied. You always say what you mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The ice was broken, Kirsch said, ``and from then on it was easy
as pie.'' It turned out that the employee was often late because
she had trouble finding care for her asthmatic child. She agreed to
call her supervisor when this happened and her supervisor agreed to
be more understanding.
</P>
<P>
   To keep tabs on Redress' progress, the Postal Service contracted
Lisa Bingham, director of the Conflict Resolution Center at Indiana
University. Her exit-survey research showed that postal employees
and their union representatives and supervisors were highly
satisfied with the process and the mediators. And, to a lesser
degree, the parties were satisfied with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Mary P. Rowe, an adjunct professor at the Sloan School of
Management at MIT, said Redress ``was large, elaborate and better
evaluated than virtually any other component or system like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is a big fan of mediation, of course, least of all
the plaintiffs' bar. ``Damages are often the best way to make up
for how someone has been harmed,'' said Pamela Coukos, a lawyer for
Mehri, Malkin &AMP; Ross, the Washington firm handling the class-action
lawsuit against Coca-Cola. ``Money can be a measure of how much
respect you are given by a company.'' At the very least, Coukos
said, workers with grievances should have a choice between
litigation or some type of nonjudicial dispute resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Today, said David B. Lipsky, the Cornell professor who conducted
the 1997 survey with Ronald L. Seeber, companies are moving from a
piecemeal approach to unified programs.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, for example, Prudential Insurance
Co. of America in Newark, N.J., started its own program called
Roads to Resolution. Oliver B. Quinn, the program director, said
Prudential took the proactive step to develop a system that offered
mediation and arbitration in light of the litigation erupting
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And as part of its settlement of a multimillion racial
discrimination case, Texaco created an Ombuds Program in February
1998. Later that year, the company folded it and other programs
like mediation and arbitration into a problem resolution system. As
a result, Carole A. Young, director of the Ombuds program, said a
court-appointed task force had determined that litigation had been
reduced by nearly half in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the good news continues for the Postal Service.
Karen Intrater, one of the lawyers who came up with the idea of
Redress, said the program has been so successful it is catching on
among government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a magic pill, but you can see the difference,''
Intrater said. ``I've never seen anything that has such a potential
for change as this.''

OUSTED CHIEF OF FILENE'S BASEMENT SUES NEW OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ohio)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a lawsuit filed last week with in Massachusetts,
former Filene's Basement chief executive Samuel J. Gerson says he
is owed at least $1.5 million in bonus and severance benefits after
his termination by the chain's new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Alleging breach of contract and fraud, the suit claims the new
owner, Value City Department Stores Inc. of Ohio, repeatedly misled
Gerson into believing that he would continue to run Filene's
Basement after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   A Value City spokesman said the company would have no comment
Tuesday on Gerson's lawsuit, filed in Middlesex Superior Court on
Aug 28.
</P>
<P>
   When it was announced in June that Gerson was leaving Filene's
Basement after 16 years at the top job, it seemed to be a mutual
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But in the lawsuit, Gerson said he was ``terminated without
cause'' after about three months of working for a new boss; based
on the employment agreement he said he had reached with Value City,
Gerson claimed the Ohio retailer owes him ``in excess of $1.5
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing fierce competition, Filene's Basement Corp. of Wellesley
filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, in consultation with the chain's board
of directors and its creditors, Gerson concluded that the only way
to save the legendary retailer was to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   In February it was announced that a Value City subsidiary would
buy some of Filene's Basement's assets for about $15 million in
cash and stock and also assume about $74 million of Filene's
Basement debt. The deal was completed in March.
</P>
<P>
   At the time when the proposed sale was made public, Gerson said
that he expected he would continue to run Filene's Basement, only
now as a separate division of the Ohio retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Between the sale's announcement in February and his departure in
June, Gerson said he closed several Filene's Basement stores and
cut staff in an effort to improve the chain's productivity.
</P>
<P>
   During this period Gerson also said he had entered negotiations
with Value City over an employment contract that would pay him a
base annual salary of $500,000 and entitle him to performance
bonuses equal to a year's pay as well as severance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, despite improvements at surviving Filene's Basement
stores, Value City terminated Gerson and replaced him with Alan R.
Schlesinger, Gerson said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to pay him, Value City breached the employment
agreement it had reached with him, Gerson said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during bankruptcy proceedings, Gerson noted that
Filene's Basement owed him at least $4.3 million in severance
benefits. The lawsuit filed last week against Value City is a
separate claim.

MARKET PLACE: A SOFT LANDING WITH MORE GROWTH THAN USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the summer ends, the corporate earnings outlook is being
undermined by signs that the economy is slowing. And some stock
market analysts are warning that while profit growth will remain
strong, the current projections for the last quarter of this year
and the first of next year are too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The employment data released on Friday reinforced the belief
that the economy is cooling after six rate increases by the Federal
Reserve. In August, nonfarm payroll jobs, excluding census workers
and strikers, rose just 140,000, well below the 222,000 average for
the first seven months of the year. Manufacturing jobs actually
declined, and manufacturing activity shrank after 18 months of
growth, according to a purchasing managers index. The major
automakers are cutting production. Home appliance manufacturers,
like Whirlpool, say slowing demand will cut into their profits the
rest of the year. Department stores, already beleaguered, are
warning of a weak end to the year.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, surges in the prices of crude oil and home heating
oil for this winter will cut into consumers' ability to spend.
Crude oil is now $33.38 a barrel, near a 10-year high and up 30.4
percent since the end of last year. Home heating oil is also near a
10-year high, at 97.64 cents a gallon, and already 40.8 percent
above the average price of last fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   While these factors suggest slower economic growth, the good
news is that a slowdown does not have to be as sharp as in the past
to be successful in curbing inflation. Put another way, the soft
landing that the Federal Reserve desires can come at a higher
growth rate than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the economy could be growing at a pretty brisk
pace of 3.5 percent or 4 percent when the soft landing arrives and
that the Fed could be finished with interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fair point,'' said Thomas McManus, the equity
strategist at Banc America Securities. ``The economy may not slow
down that much.'' Even though he has one of the more bearish
earnings forecasts, he still thinks the weakest quarters for
corporate profits in the near future will be a 7.5 percent increase
in operating earnings in the fourth quarter of this year and no
increase in the first of 2001. Then he expects earnings to begin
growing again, with an 8 percent jump in the second quarter of next
year and a 10 percent rise in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   According to First Call/Thomson Financial, the consensus among
Wall Street analysts is that third-quarter operating earnings,
which exclude one-time charges and other nonrecurring items, will
be 17.3 percent higher than a year ago for the companies in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. While that estimate has been trimmed
from an 18.1 percent forecast in April, it is still very strong.
For the fourth quarter, the growth forecast is 15.8 percent. The
expectations of 17 and 15 percent gains follow a very strong first
half, in which earnings surged 23.6 percent in the first quarter
and 21.6 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One reason an economic slowdown has not showed up strongly in
the numbers collected by First Call/Thomson Financial is that it
has been offset in part by the surging expectations for companies
in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings prospects for the energy sector, including
companies like Exxon Mobil and Texaco, have more than doubled with
the rise in oil prices. Earnings are now expected to surge by 77
percent in the third quarter, up from a 29 percent growth
expectation in April and 62 percent in July. Excluding the energy
sector, the earnings growth forecast for the S&AMP;P 500 would be 14.7
percent, instead of 17.3 percent, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   But after breaking down the averages, there are signs that Wall
Street analysts are beginning to factor in an economic slowdown.
For consumer cyclical companies, including Caterpillar, Dow
Chemical and International Paper, analysts have reduced their
earnings growth estimates to 6 percent for the third quarter, from
14 percent on April 1 and 12 percent on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings estimates for companies making consumer staples,
including General Mills and Kellogg, are also falling. The current
forecast is for growth of 7 percent in the third quarter, down from
15 percent in April and 12 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Another drag on earnings, though it is difficult to calculate,
is the impact on Ford from the tire recall by Firestone. Because
Ford recently went through a recapitalization, measuring the
decline in earnings estimates cannot be easily done, said Chuck
Hill, the director of research at First Call. ``Clearly, analysts
are lowering estimates,'' he noted, ``because Ford is cutting back
production because of the Firestone issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology earnings estimates have held up, despite warnings of
a weak second half from several companies, including Lucent
Technologies, Xerox and Unisys. The current forecast is for growth
of 35 percent in the third quarter, compared with expectations of
33 percent in April and 36 percent in July. Generally, as the
quarter approaches, analysts trim their estimates as they get more
information from technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that the economy need to slow only modestly to
curb inflationary pressures is a result of the surprising increase
in worker productivity over the last couple of years. Because
productivity has grown, the potential, noninflationary growth rate
of the economy has risen, a fact that had been acknowledged by
Federal Reserve policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   When productivity gains were running at 1.5 percent to 2
percent, the noninflationary growth rate of the economy was thought
to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent. The total allowed for about a
percentage point from the normal annual growth in the country's
labor supply. So to get a soft landing, economic growth would have
to be slowed to about 2.5 percent, or less, to take the pressure
off wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Federal Reserve officials seem to agree that the
noninflationary growth rate for the economy is as high as 4.5
percent because the trend line for worker productivity is
approaching 3.5 percent. And Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, indicated that he was confident the economy can
continue growing at a high, noninflationary pace when he said in
August that it was ''still difficult to find credible evidence in
the United States that the rate of structural productivity growth
has stopped increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   James E. Glassman, the senior United States economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank, sees beauty in a modest slowdown. ``Corporate
earnings don't have to slow down so much,'' he said, ``if achieving
a soft landing today means slowing growth to 4 percent instead of
2.5 percent.''

HAEMONETICS BUYING TRANSFUSION TECHNOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Haemonetics Corp., a developer of equipment to automate red
blood cell collection from volunteer blood donors, has agreed to
acquire privately held Transfusion Technologies Corp. of Natick,
Mass. in a cash deal.
</P>
<P>
   Final terms of the deal were not divulged although Haemonetics
said the purchase will be completed by Sept. 29, subject to
regulatory approval. Last November, Haemonetics spent $15 million
for a 19.8 percent equity stake in Transfusion, a seven-year-old
developer of portable blood separation systems used in orthopedic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Lopez, a Haemonetics vice president, stressed Tuesday than
in acquiring the remaining 80.2 percent of Transfusion, ``the price
for the purchase is at a valuation substantially below what we
intitially paid last year.'' She declined to comment further on the
financial details.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine A. Martinelli, a vice president at Merrill Lynch
Global Securities, said: ``This deal makes sense for Haemonetics
because they get a complementary technology that gives them new
flexibility in mobile blood collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Transfusion's decision to sell was based largely on an offer
earlier this summer by Haemonetics. Transfusion was looking to
raise additional cash before launching an initial public offering,
according to Terrance J. Bieker, Transfusion president for the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply ran out of time,'' said Bieker, noting the company
had revenues last year of $1 million. ``In this business cash is
everything, and we needed to raise $10 million to $15 million more
before we could go for an (initial public offering). We were in the
process of talking with various blood bank partners for the
additional funds when Haemonetics approached us with their offer.
So our board of directors agreed that it was better to take a bird
in the hand now rather than wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Bieker acknowledged that the announcement was bittersweet, since
Transfusion was formed by former Haemonetics employees. Their goal
was to develop new blood separation equipment that would compete
against their former employer's products.
</P>
<P>
   Haemonetics officials said Transfusion's forthcoming products
will help it leverage its global presence in the $300 million
automated red blood cell collection market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of Haemonetics's resources and Transfusion
Technologies's propietary technology and product development
capabilities will enable us to accelerate delivery of systems which
are smaller, lighter and more user-friendly, allowing our customers
to reach donors through the use of transportable blood collection
equipment,'' said James L. Peterson, Haemonetics president and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many of the nearly 60 employees will join Haemonetics,
Lopez said offers were made to nine Transfusion employees. She said
a dozen were asked to work during the six- month transition period
that will shut down the Natick operation and transfer everything to
Haemonitcs' Braintree headquarters, and 23 will be asked to
consider applying for unfilled Haemonetics jobs. She said the goal
is to help find jobs for all Transfusion employees.
</P>
<P>
   Haemonetics employs 1,300 people, including 700 in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bieker said the company's founders have accepted jobs at
Haemonetics, including Transfusion chairman Thomas D. Headley, who
will now be an executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Haemonetics shares closed at $24.75, down 50 cents.

 &HT;    TIME WARNER AND AOL FACE REGULATORY PRESSURES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - As regulators in the United States and Europe
increase scrutiny of the proposed merger of Time Warner Inc. and
America Online Inc., consumer advocates may be getting closer to
winning the safeguards they want on the deal
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are alarmed about
this merger and its consequences to competition,'' said Jeffrey
Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education, a
non-profit group pushing for government-imposed restraints on the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Thursday, European regulators will be holding
closed-door hearings to grill AOL and Time Warner executives about
their plans to create a global interactive media giant. A
confidential report, issued by the European Commission and leaked
to the U.S. media, suggests the hearings will be less than
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the European Commission, which sets anti-trust
policy for 15 countries, has reached the ``preliminary view'' that
``competition would be significantly impeded'' if the merger were
to proceed as proposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are stepping up their
investigations, and the House subcommittee on telecommunications
plans to hold a hearing on the merger later this month. The date
has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Chester said that if AOL, the world's No. 1 Internet company,
and Time Warner, one of the world's biggest cable and media
companies, were to join forces, the combined company could force
captive cable customers to take AOL Time Warner's services and
content.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that, Chester said regulators must insist AOL Time
Warner offer its cable customers an unlimited number choices among
Internet service providers. It also must offer a full array of
content, without bias for its own material, and end all joint
ventures with AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest cable operator, to
ensure tough competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced Jan. 10, executives of AOL and Time
Warner have repeatedly said they would offer their content and
services via digital subscriber lines and satellite, as well as
cable, to give customers plenty of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of
America, said even that assurance rings hollow without a consent
decree, enforceable in court. AOL and Time Warner executives
``obviously have not convinced anyone'' they will keep their word,
he said. As a result, consumer advocates are gaining ground with
the regulators. ``We're getting there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that unnamed sources
said the FTC may ask AOL to sell its $1.5 billion stake in General
Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics unit, a maker of satellites. And
the Wall Street Journal reported that regulators might restrict AOL
Time Warner's relationship with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC spokesman refused to comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory reviews may be rattling some investors. Shares of
Time Warner fell $2.88, or 3 percent, to close at $81.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where shares of AOL were unchanged at $57.50.
</P>
<P>
   Scott B. Davis, a Wall Street analyst with First Union
Securities, said he believes that while some consumer safeguards
may be imposed, the merger is in no danger of being killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at what issues have been raised, I don't see
anything...that would be anywhere close to a deal breaker,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Time Warner executives ``are going to have to provide strong
assurances that they will do what they have said'' about giving
consumers many choices, he said. ``But at the end of the day, the
merger will close on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for AOL and Time Warner say the reviews do not
threaten the deal, which is ``on track to close this fall.''
Shareholders of both companies already have approved it
overwhelmingly.

   LALO (Undated) - For more than 60 years, Lalo Guerrero has sang
songs in English and Spanish rooted in the deep love for his
Mexican-American heritage. Known as the father of Chicano music,
Guerrero has been honored by three Presidents and called a national
treasure by the Smithsonian institute. On a recent day, a reporter
accompanied Papa Lalo, as he is affectionately known, through a
tour of the Barrio Viejo in Tucson, where Guerrero was born in 1916
to Mexican immigrant parents. In front of one house, Lalo became
emotional as he recalled standing outside the window of his first
love, where he and two friends used to serenade her with Spanish
love songs. As a child, Guerrero endured ridicule from neighborhood
kids who made fun of the pock marks left behind by a bad bout with
small pox. But Lalo was inspired to become someone by the affection
shown him by his first love. On Sept. 6, the Phoenix-based
organization, Valle del Sol, will honor Lalo during a luncheon at
the Arizona Biltmore recognizing the contributions of several
Latinos in Arizona. Lalo will be inducted into the organization's
Hall of Fame. By DAVID GONZALEZ. Story will move in the ``A''

FBI TO RELEASE `SCHOOL SHOOTER' THREAT ASSESSMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to prevent future Columbine-type
massacres, the FBI has created a ``school shooter'' threat
assessment that it said will help teachers spot potential killers
among their students.
</P>
<P>
   But some child advocates and teacher representatives are
expressing concerns that the guidelines are too vague and could
label a normal adolescent a budding psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI Wednesday planned to issue a two-year study called,
``The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-page report said there are personality traits common
among school shooters, as well as family dynamics and even school
characteristics that can be looked for when deciding whether a
threat of violence by a student should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment, by the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of
Violent Crime, said it does not create a ``profile'' of the
teen-ager likely to gun down his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   But the study does say it can help schools, ``assess a threat
and a threatener, evaluate the risk, and respond appropriately and
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 28 behaviors listed in the report that may signal a
potential for violence were low tolerance for frustration, a lack
of resiliency, a failed love relationship, narcissism, an attitude
of superiority, intolerance and an unusual interest in sensational
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Other warning signs include anger management problems, a change
of behavior, use of inappropriate humor, or having negative role
models like ``Hitler, Satan or others associated with violence and
destruction,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study also listed ``family dynamics'' that can contribute to
a child becoming violent in school. Those included an acceptance of
a child's pathological behavior by parents, access to weapons, a
lack of intimacy and even no limitations on television and internet
use.
</P>
<P>
   And schools also could contribute to a potential violent episode
by tolerating disrespect, having an ``inflexible culture'' or
unfair discipline habits, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The study said those characteristics were common among cases
like the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colo., in
April 1999. But the report was actually begun a year earlier, in
May 1998, and studied 18 school shootings that occurred before
Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine case created, ``a new urgency'' with Attorney
General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh to complete
research into identifying common traits of school shooters, and
giving schools guidelines on how to react to that threat, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers,
said she believed the report would be of limited use to local
educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those categories are so broad you could apply them to a number
of adolescents,'' she said. ``The average 13-year-old loves blood
and gore, the more the better. It is very easy for me to see a lot
of normal adolescent behavior in that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Schiraldi, a children's advocate with the Justice Policy
Institute in Washington, worried that the report would be used to
prejudge normal kids as potential killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this opens the door for a tremendous amount of false
positives,'' Schiraldi said. ``The ramifications for the kids being
misidentified as dangerous would be huge. Frankly, I see no role
for the FBI in America's schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno acknowledged that ``the risk of unfairly labeling and
stigmatizing children is great.'' But she said, ``If we use this
threat assessment model judiciously ... we will be able to fight
and win the war on two fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the assessment would allow schools to get help for
troubled children while protecting innocent ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Leone, a University of Maryland professor who is the
director of the National Center for Education, Disabilities and
Juvenile Justice, said, ``I think a thing like this has a great
potential to become part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the behaviors listed are normal developmental stages
for adolescents. To me, this is saying if we can pinpoint the right
kids we can solve the problem, and that is simplistic,'' Leone
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI threat assessment provides guidelines for determining if
troubling statements by a high school student should be taken as a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   A low level threat is one that is vague and indirect. An act
that could be carried out, though it may not appear realistic, is
called a medium level of threat in the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   A high level threat is one that is direct, specific and
plausible. An example cited in the study: ``At 8 am tomorrow
morning I intend to shoot the principal. That's when he is in the
office by himself. I have a 9mm. Believe me, I know what I am
doing. I am sick and tired of the way he runs this school.''
</P>
<P>
   That type of threat must be responded to quickly by school
officials, the FBI warned. It recommended calling local police and
activating an emergency response plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser threats should be dealt with by a team formed of teachers
and mental health workers, the report said. ``A school cannot
ignore any threat of violence. Plausible or not, every threat must
be taken seriously, investigated, responded to,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said Houston schools have a zero tolerance policy for
weapons on school grounds and also for direct threats of violence.
``We can get a child out (of the school) who displays a weapon or
makes terroristic threats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the less direct categories of threat, it becomes tougher,
she said. ``I'd be reluctant to ask our teachers to make those
assessments,'' said Fallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous potential damage to the child. I'd be
upset if you made those allegations about my child.'' Fallon and
others said to designate a child as a ``school shooter'' before he
or she had committed an overt act would invite a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said only one student had been killed at a Houston area
school in her memory, and that killing was gang-related, not the
actions of a disturbed adolescent shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Schiraldi, the children's advocate in Washington, said the
report is an overreaction to a relatively small number of school
violence incidents. ``About one student in two million is involved
with a shooting in school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 80 people killed by lightning last year, and 26 in
school violence related deaths,'' said Schiraldi. ``This is an
effort to protect us from lightning. That can't be done.''

A BOOM MARKET IN TRAVEL SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vacation swindle business is booming, according to law
enforcement agencies, consumer advocates and travel industry
organizations. The bait for unsuspecting victims ranges from
nonexistent trips to identification cards offering anyone the kind
of discounts only travel agents can get legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go out there looking, we find there are people
running travel scams,'' said Mitchell Katz, a spokesman for the
Federal Trade Commission, which last month announced its third
round of enforcement actions against deceptive travel industry
practices since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The commission and 19 state agencies filed 85 actions against
travel promoters, who were accused of actions ranging from falsely
telling people they had won a free trip to concealing costs to
refusing to make refunds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the commission reached an agreement under which
American International Travel Services Inc., of Deerfield Beach,
Fla., paid $1 million to the FTC for refunds to people who say they
were improperly charged for what they thought were free trips to
Florida. The firm did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement, which
was approved by a federal judge in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Travel schemes consistently rank among the top 10 complaints to
the FTC, Katz said. This year, faxed offers of free trips have
prompted a surge of complaints from consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Davis, 28, of Dubuque, Iowa, was one of those who
complained about deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I filled out this card at the Dubuque County Fair in 1999 and
then I was notified that I had won a free trip,'' Davis said. She
paid $598 to ``reserve'' her trip for four to Florida. She said the
vendor, Epic Travel, of King of Prussia, Pa., one of the firms the
commission has filed charges against, never returned her calls
until she wrote that she had retained a lawyer; then, she said, the
firm called only to say that it had no record of her calls and that
it was too late to get a refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I haven't gotten anything back and I never got a trip
anywhere,'' she said. ``But I did learn to never again fill out a
slip for a free trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Semegen, general counsel for Epic Resorts, said Davis'
remarks were ``not anywhere close to factual.'' He said that the
company issues refunds if requested within 30 days, and that it
sells time-share packages and does not promise free trips.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the fraud techniques currently in vogue and
some tips on how to spot them.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has provided a lucrative new venue for a variety of
travel swindles. Travel scams are the ninth most common swindles
reported to Internet Fraud Watch at the Web site www.fraud.org,
said Philip McKee, assistant director of the project, a service of
the National Consumers League, a nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should ignore ads on Internet auction sites from
people who say they have frequent-flier miles expiring or a ticket
in their own name, said Kristina Rundquist, a spokeswoman for the
American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot transfer frequent-flier miles for money and you
cannot use a ticket made out to someone else.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stan Bosco, the society's assistant director for
consumer affairs, one common scheme is to offer a trip that, if
paid for immediately, can be taken any time in the next 18 months.
The extended time period, as well as any efforts to stall the
making of reservations, are signs that the promoters intend to
close the business and flee with the money before any trips are
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents said it has been receiving
a growing number of complaints about phony travel-agent
identification swindles, which it calls ``card mill scams.''
Consumers are told they can buy credentials that make it possible
to pose as a travel agent and obtain the deep discounts on air
fares, hotel rooms and other services that are available to travel
agents on trips that are meant to familiarize them with a
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents do get such discounts. But Bosco said that as this
swindle has spread, at a time when demand has pushed up rates, both
airlines and hotels have begun to tighten up on the availability of
such discounts for legitimate travel agents while training their
employees to weed out fake travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Another dubious deal offers free travel as an inducement to take
out a credit card. William J. McGee, editor of Consumer Reports
Travel Letter, published by the same company that puts out the
magazine, said one such offer it investigated required customers to
join a travel club with a membership fee so high that it offset any
potential travel benefit.
</P>
<P>
   McGee also advises consumers not to deal with any travel company
that will not allow them to pay by credit card or will not conduct
business through the mail. Sales made by credit card can be
contested. Refusal to send through the mail can be a sign of fraud
by people trying to avoid mail-fraud statutes, he said.

   Trips on chartered aircraft are one area that can easily be
checked out. Federal consumer protection rules require charter
companies to specify the airline whose planes are being chartered
in all advertisements and promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
   To check out charter operators, call the Department of
Transportation at (202) 366-1037 and give the name of the tour
operator and travel dates; the department will tell you whether the
company has posted a P.C. number as a public charter operator,
meaning it has met minimum financial-stability requirements. Even
if the operator volunteers its P.C. number, check with the
government, McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators can cancel up to 10 days before a trip if they
refund all money. Customers have the right to cancel if the tour
operator changes the departure or destination, raises prices more
than 10 percent or moves departure and return times by more than 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   When you are already at your destination and ready to return
home, tour operators have the right to delay you by up to two days.
And if you refuse the delayed return, all the charter operator owes
you is the return air fare at the charter rate, which typically is
a fraction of the cost of buying a one-way ticket home or two extra
nights in most resorts, assuming you can even get a room.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has two advisories for travelers on its Web site, at
www.ftc.gov, one about telemarketing fraud and the other about
travel scams in general (click first on ``consumer protection'' and
then on ``telemarketing'').
</P>
<P>
   There is one simple rule that, if followed, pretty much
eliminates the risk of being taken by even the slickest travel con
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that nothing comes free,'' McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   Bosco of the American Society of Travel Agents echoed his
sentiments. ``An offer of a week at a beachfront hotel in Hawaii
for $299 is likely to leave nothing but memories of money spent for
a trip that was never made,'' he said.

BUSH FIELDS $198 BILLION MEDICARE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. _ Unveiling details of a plan that would radically
restructure Medicare, Governor George W. Bush pledged an immediate
end to soaring prescription drug costs for senior citizens, staking
his claim on a highly charged issue that until Tuesday mainly
belonged to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush laid out a $198 billion proposal guaranteeing full
prescription drug coverage for the poorest families, or any senior
earning less than $11,300 a year. For everyone else, the plan would
cover part of the premium for private prescription drug insurance,
relying on a market-oriented reshaping of Medicare to bring down
overall drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the Bush plan _ and there were many _ came amid
accusations the Texas governor has failed to address substantive
issues, and suggested he was trying to project a more serious image
to counter Gore's recent rise in the polls. Rather than his usual
day of outdoor rallies and sweeping rhetoric, Bush held several
intimate meetings, ticking off facts and figures as he read his
policy from a prepared text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is a vital program _ too vital to be neglected,''
Bush told a group of senior citizens in Allentown, Pa., speaking in
the low, serious tone he reserves for formal policy speeches. ``It
needs preventative care now to provide quality health care and
prescription drug coverage for all our seniors. For eight years,
the current administration had this opportunity, and has squandered
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marked the first time in days that Bush
successfully conveyed his chosen message, following a week of
mishaps and an embarrassing incident Monday in which the Texas
governor accidentally broadcast a vulgar insult over the public
address system at a Labor Day rally.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, though completely devoid of surprise, also
confirmed the longstanding conventional wisdom that health care
would become a main theme of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats firmly believe they have taken the more popular stance
on health care in general _ and prescription drugs in particular _
in part because so many of the nation's 39 million Medicare
recipients are desperate for a drug benefit but are wary of
changing the system itself. Under the Gore plan, $253 billion would
be spent over 10 years on adding a prescription drug benefit to the
existing Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attacked the Bush plan as targeting too narrow a group of
seniors, because it would cover drug costs for the poorest but
leave middle-income families with only a minimal subsidy. Under the
Bush plan, a person who has an income of $14,600 or more would get
assistance with 25 percent of the cost of the part of their private
insurance premium that covers prescription drugs _ in other words,
only a fraction of the total cost of the insurance premium, and
nothing for the drugs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly half of all of those who don't have coverage today
wouldn't get coverage under the plan that he's announcing today,''
Gore said. ``The biggest problem is, there's no money to pay for it
if you give away all of the surplus in the form of a giant tax cut
for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has long made a five-year, $483 billion tax cut a
centerpiece of his campaign. In addition, he would spend $2.3
billion of the $4.3 billion federal budget surplus on shoring up
Social Security. The remainder of the surplus would be spent on not
only the prescription drug plan he outlined Tuesday, but also on
improving education and rebuilding the US military, according to
the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking his proposals down even further, Bush said he would
devote $110 billion to modernizing the Medicare program over 10
years, moving seniors into private health care plans of their
choice. The plan would be modeled on the Federal Employees Health
Care system, in which 9 million federal employees are now
essentially given a voucher to pick the health care plan of their
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like a little competition, by the way, to create
excellence in the system,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush would direct $48 billion toward individual
states to create an ``immediate helping hand'' program _ one in
which states would subsidize prescription drugs for the poorest
seniors until the permanent Medicare overhaul was complete.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``helping hand'' would not be mandatory, and some
Democrats questioned whether a state-by-state program could be
implemented as swiftly as Bush suggested. Today, only 23 states
even have mechanisms for providing prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The final portion of Bush's Medicare plan would devote $40.3
billion to restoring Medicare cuts that resulted from the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997, rounding out what Bush described as a plan
based on ``flexibility, options and choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the cruel choices some seniors face: Heat or
medicine. Food or pills. In a wealthy nation, this is a scandal,''
Bush said. ``In a compassionate nation, it is a call to action.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Bush plan closely mirrored an earlier Senate
proposal to overhaul Medicare, a controversial package sponsored by
Senators John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, and Bill Frist, a
Tennessee Republican. The orginal Breaux-Frist plan was eventually
scrapped in favor of a more limited proposal, but Bush returned to
the original blueprint, which deals with revising Medicare instead
of just providing prescription drugs. That Bush would rely on such
a familiar target delighted Democrats, who immediately pounced on
the plan. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts,
even took to the Senate floor to deplore the Bush proposal, saying:
``It is a program only a drug company executive could love.''

 ADVERTISING: A COMPANY TRIES TO CHANGE THE WORLD _ AND SELL SOME
YOGURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Protecting the rain forest. Ending child labor. Preserving a
healthy planet. They all sound like political promises made by
candidates. But they are also subjects touched upon in the first
national campaign for Stonyfield Farm Inc. Yes, that's right, the
company that sells yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   In this print campaign, there will be no beauty shots of
delectable yogurt dripping off a spoon or any boasting about the
brand's tasty flavors. Instead, the campaign takes on a more
serious tone and centers on celebrities who are advocates of
environmental causes or other projects, using them as the link
between commendable causes and Stonyfield's own goal to change the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company was started 17 years ago, its dual mission has
been to sell organic yogurt, while at the same time promoting
social and environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become confident that we're able to communicate our
dual message,'' said Gary Hirshberg, the president and chief
executive of Stonyfield Farm, based in Londonderry, N.H. ``When you
put your personality out there through the medium of advertising,
it can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Stonyfield Farm and other companies like Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade
Inc. and Body Shop International PLC have been embracing
environmental themes or offering to help organizations in a tactic
known as cause-related marketing, which allows them to sell their
products while enhancing their appeal to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for the new campaign came from a concept created
by Hirshberg that he calls ad-tivism, which combines advertising
and activism. An ad formula was born and was then developed by
eFlicksMedia in Boston into a campaign known as ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What excited me was this possibility of being activists, but
using advertising media and also taking advantage of the power of
celebrity, which as we know, is sort of a dominant force in our
culture,'' Hirshberg said.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, the use of celebrities could ``stop people from
turning the page,'' Hirshberg said. But it could ``potentially do a
lot more than that,'' demonstrating, for example, ``that the folks
whom we admire and revere in fact have other sides and in fact use
their power and their fame to do good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five print advertisements features Trudie Styler, an
actress who is the wife of the musician Sting. A head shot of
Styler is the main display set against a background of a rain
forest. The ``I do'' headline is prominent, accompanied by
descriptions of what she is ``committed to'' like: ``Protecting the
rain forest and the people who live there. A sustainable
environment. Healthy living through mind, body and soul. Organic
gardening. Organic Luscious Lemon Yogurt. My family. Businesses run
by people who care.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad features Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, who is described as an
author and activist. Her commitments are listed as: ``Human rights
defenders. Stopping child labor. People who speak truth to power. A
healthy planet for all children. YoSqueeze yogurts for kids.
Companies that take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The three other ads in the campaign feature Ken Burns, the
filmmaker and historian; Rick Bayless, a restaurateur; and
Hirshberg himself. In each of the ads, the product is placed
strategically at the bottom of the ad accompanied by the tagline,
``Stonyfield Farm. Yogurt on a mission.'' The small print on the
bottom states that no fee was paid to the subjects and that a
contribution was made to their nonprofit environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that immediately caused these activists to
jump on board is that Stonyfield Farm was not paying them,''
Hirshberg said. ``Our proposition to the talent has been, `How
would you like to use your name, your activism and your positions
to help put some money into causes you and we believe in?' So,
frankly a number of nonprofits have already seen this as an
opportunity to solicit their folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, with billings estimated at $2 million, began
running in the September issues of magazines including Cooking
Light, Gourmet, House &AMP; Garden, Parenting, Martha Stewart Living
and Utne Reader. The ads will run until the holidays and resume
later with another batch of celebrities. As the campaign grows, the
target audience will also broaden. Hirshberg said that the company
was also thinking about radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Selling yogurt with a cause has proved to be profitable. Over
the last two and a half years, Stonyfield Farm has grown from being
a regional brand to a national player, ranking No. 5, with 3.1
percent of the $1.95 billion national yogurt market. Stonyfield,
with sales at $60.7 million, competes with major brands like
Yoplait, the leader, which has 31.5 percent of the market, with
sales of $614.2 million; Dannon, with 27.7 percent of the market
and sales at $540 million; Breyers, with 8.2 percent and $159
million; and Colombo, with 4.1 percent and $80.4 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Just to get to that point, the company has relied greatly on
word-of-mouth guerrilla marketing tactics that include passing out
yogurt to consumers and asking pediatricians to spread the word on
the product's nutritional benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made inroads in luring both new customers and
those of its rivals through efforts like its yogurt lid campaign,
which carries ``call to action'' messages for everything from
organic farming to gun control. Its charitable donations, which are
10 percent of its profits, go to groups like Share Our Strength,
the anti-poverty and -hunger organization, and the Jane Goodall
Institute, which promotes wildlife research and preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel good about choosing a product that is actually
advancing the environment, then you develop a stronger loyalty than
you'd ever develop from a company that's just saying, `Hey, we just
got a new flavor,''' said Martha Shaw, the president and creative
director at eFlicks.
</P>
<P>
   The national campaign is not the first advertising effort for
the company. A year ago, it started a conventional product and
brand-building effort in some regions created by Lynch Jarvis Jones
in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say the results were mixed at best,''
Hirshberg said. ``We did not see that spike that one likes to see,
and so as an advertising skeptic, I just felt that added more fuel
to my fire that your message has to be perfect and your medium has
to be perfect, and I don't think we got either right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't come up the ad-tivism idea, I doubt we would be
doing a national campaign,'' Hirshberg added. ``My hope is that the
ad-tivism campaign will have legs. I feel it absolutely represents
us, whether it sells more yogurt is the question.''

A SMALL TOWN DEBATES WHETHER TO GIVE UP A CHERISHED ECCENTRICITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA, Calif. _ This is a town that cultivates
eccentricity like a rare organic tomato. Ever since it was
discovered by artists, writers and assorted free spirits nearly a
hundred years ago, people have been drawn to this
precious-as-a-poodle community beside the Pacific Ocean for the
touches of modernity it does not have: street lights, illuminated
signs, parking meters, neighborhood sidewalks, street addresses and
door-to-door mail delivery.
</P>
<P>
   As long as there has been a Carmel-by-the-Sea (not to be
confused with Carmel, the broader area surrounding this
1-square-mile ``urban forest'' that tourists flock to see),
residents have, by choice, picked up their mail at the post office,
opting for the routine of bumping into one another among the oaken
post boxes and avoiding the confusion of carriers delivering mail
to houses without addresses. Houses here, many of them elfin
cottages with thatchlike roofs in the Late Troll style, have always
been identified either by name _ like Tide Pool or Tinkerbell _ or
by folksy descriptions of their location (``second house southwest
of 7th on Camino Real'').
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a significant tempest in a Teapot (the name of another
house here) ensued when, after months of aggressive lobbying by a
determined citizen, the U.S. Postal Service announced at a packed
city hall last month that free home delivery, pending the assigning
of street numbers, would finally be offered in Carmel-by-the-Sea.
</P>
<P>
   To Joe Steinfeld, 71, the choice is clear. Steinfeld has led the
campaign for mail delivery since he moved here last year from
nearby Big Sur, using tactics like visiting Postal Service
headquarters in Washington twice, telephoning members of the
service's board of governors at home and picketing the post office
here with a sign that said ``Choice Not Boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get pizza delivered to my house, but not the mail,''
Steinfeld said. ``They call it a quaint tradition. It's not quaint.
We're paying for something we're not getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinfeld, a retired antiques dealer who ran unsuccessfully for
the City Council on the mail issue, became frustrated about lack of
home delivery after an illness left him bedridden and unable to
pick up his mail.
</P>
<P>
   Among his supporters is Tom Conmy, 66, a packaging broker, who
does not see the charm in threading his car through about 25,000
summertime tourists a week strolling to the 111 art galleries and
eyeballing 15-carat Cartier diamond rings _ all to get to the post
office.
</P>
<P>
   But many in town see Steinfeld's quest as an assault on a
cherished community tradition that has larger reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another step towards the homogenization of Carmel,''
said Alice Englander, 54, a computer programmer, who has taken to
calling her town ``Stepford-by-the-Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between McDonald's and a roadside cafe,''
she said. ``Next, the mailmen will need street lights to see the
boxes, then sidewalks for safety, and soon we'll be one of those
places that used to be wonderful but aren't anymore, like La Jolla
or Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one square mile that's different,'' she added. ``The
people who don't want that can live in the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The post office here looms large. It is ``like the old cracker
barrel of a general store or neighbors talking over a backyard
fence,'' said Steve Bardin, 56, who has occasionally found a
lipstick pucker mark on the window of his box after a spat with a
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here, Carmelites encounter Dan Tarallo, 64, ``the whistler,''
who improvises tunes from his ``inner radio'' twice a day on the
post office bench, and neighbors like Kathleen and Isabel Blythe,
75-year-old twins who use the excursion as an excuse to ``get out
of the house every day, have lunch and throw out the dumb catalogs
before we go home,'' in Kathleen Blythe's words.
</P>
<P>
   The post office is a public spot in a famously private town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates connections between people,'' said Barbara Bolgard,
66.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, `I had a dream about you last night _ are you all
right?' Well, the mailman is not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carmel-by-the-Sea is one of about 4,400 independent post offices
that do not have carrier delivery, said Mark Saunders, a spokesman
for the Postal Service in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Steinfeld has threatened to file a class-action suit on behalf
of Carmel-by-the-Sea's box renters, who he said were entitled to a
97-year refund, which he has calculated as $30 million, for having
paid rental fees for post office boxes throughout the town's
history when mail delivery, he said, is ``supposed to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, box holders in Carmel-by-the-Sea, who pay about $14 a
year, are entitled to a fee refund dating from June 1997, when free
post office box service became available to qualifying
municipalities, Saunders said. (Steinfeld collects his mail at
nearby Pebble Beach because there is a long waiting list for Carmel
boxes.)
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said the postal service was not legally obligated to
provide home delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strongest supporters of street numbering here, which
would be required to deliver the mail, is the city's fire chief,
Bill Hill, a third-generation Carmelite who estimates the price of
idiosyncrasy as ``about a minute longer'' in emergency response
time. The 911 dispatchers are based in Salinas, about 30 miles
away. ``Put yourself in their hands,'' Hill said, when a caller
explains where the emergency is by saying, ``Well, there's a blue
Volvo parked in front.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   David Louie, a veteran United Parcel Service driver, noted that
rookie drivers avoid Carmel-by-the-Sea. ``Sometimes a customer
gives out an address and even they don't know where they live,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of mail is not new in this formerly bohemian
community, once home to Upton Sinclair and Robinson Jeffers and
today better known as the woodsy hideaway of Doris Day, Kim Novak
and the football announcer John Madden. (Former Mayor Clint
Eastwood, whose rugged profile adorns tote bags and mugs here, now
lives up the coast in Pebble Beach.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its history, the town has, in effect, legislated
uniqueness, a boon to tourism. Currently on the books, for
instance, is a ``high heels'' ordinance, inspired by the city's
crooked, uneven streets, requiring a permit to wear shoes with
heels more than 2 inches high and with less than ``1 square inch of
bearing surface.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Now Carmelites will have a choice of mail delivery. But the
debate is far from over: This week the City Council will decide
whether to ban street numbers or mailboxes on streets, potentially
challenging the postal service.
</P>
<P>
   The postal service says it will deliver regardless.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation, Steinfeld has put a mailbox up in front of his
house. But others in town, like J.B. Williams, who describes
herself as ``ancient'' and walks slowly to the post office each
weekday with her cane, say they will continue to pick up mail, by
hook or crook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give up Box 12,'' she said resolutely as if
it were a precious heirloom. ``It belonged to the family.''

COMPETING PLANS OFFER PRIVATE, PUBLIC SOLUTIONS TO MEDICARE WOES

<P>
   Every day, Jere Hoffman sits in his kitchen to count out 34
pills. Ten years ago the Korean War veteran got a heart transplant,
and without these pills he would die.
</P>
<P>
   The prescriptions cost about $15,000 annually, of which Hoffman,
until recently, paid a third.
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant chunk of the 70-year-old's income, and the
frail senior was always cutting corners, doing without a trip to
visit family here, some clothing there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to really cut costs,'' said the Longmeadow, Mass.
retiree.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and people like him are at the center of one of the top
political issues this presidential year and one that has the
Democratic and Republican candidates scrambling to draw up
distinctively competing plans.
</P>
<P>
   To Hoffman, Vice President Al Gore's prescription drug plan
essentially says: We will expand government to help you.
</P>
<P>
   Taking an opposite tack, Texas Governor George W. Bush's plan,
unveiled Tuesday, says: We will invite the private market to
assist.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's plan now in the open, it has become clear that the
two candidates have significant philosophical differences on how
this politically potent issue should be handled. And the
differences go to respective parties' ideological cores.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats' have revered the Medicare program since it was
created in 1965, and Gore's plan would spend about $100 billion
more than Bush's to expand the program to include a prescription
drug subsidy. It is similar to a program offered by President
Clinton earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush believes the entire Medicare program needs a more
fundamental overhaul. He would replace its single, government-set
health plan with a market-based approach, in which private insurers
could compete for seniors by offering a variety of plans.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would help cut costs and keep Medicare fiscally
stable for decades to come. Bush's prescription drug plan,
patterning itself after a recent proposal by congressional
Republicans, is an extension of this approach. It would offer a
smaller subsidy than Gore's but would allow seniors to seek drug
coverage from private plans.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans do have one aspect in common: they offer total
coverage of prescription drugs for impoverished seniors.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they would offer varying degrees of help with drug
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan covers half the drug cost to seniors. Seniors would
pay the government $25-a-month for its help, a premium that would
rise to $44 by 2008. In the Gore plan, the government would control
exactly which drugs were covered but the coverage would be mostly
uniform throughout the country. The Bush campaign criticized this
as a rigid, ``one-size fits all'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   But this uniformity could offer a benefit: the government could
negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies by using
the massive population of Medicare seniors as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan carries a $253 billion price tag over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan would reimburse most seniors 25 percent of their
prescription insurance premiums. But the rest is up to the market.
The plan depends on private health insurance companies offering
seniors prescription drug coverage. Insurers could offer a range of
coverage plans, with a range of monthly premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the more extensive the coverage, the higher the
premium. This, Bush campaign officials said, would give seniors
flexibility to pick plans that best fit them: Healthy seniors could
pick cheaper plans with more limited coverage and sickly ones could
opt for more extensive coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan would cost an estimated $158 billion over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this approach said the private market is too
tumultuous to trust, and could result in unpredictably high
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable that elderly seniors would pay a huge portion
of their income on drugs,'' said Stephen Soumerai, a professor of
ambulatory care and prevention at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the private market for seniors has been
unstable in recent months. In January Harvard Pilgrim Health Care
stopped insuring Medicare recipients in Barnstable, Bristol,
Plymouth, and Worcester counties. More recently, Fallon Community
Health Plan and United Health Plans also pulled out of several
counties, and 10,000 seniors were left to look for new coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesperson for the Bush campaign said the Texas governor
was confident that the market would meet seniors' needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, that there is a market for this, and
there will be,'' said Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government, said the current seniors he has
polled generally favor only limited changes to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``For seniors who have modest incomes, they feel more secure
with Medicare. For upper incomes, (the Bush plan) might be more
appealing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he's not exactly sure how the plans will work but
will be ardently watching as the issue unfolds over the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critically important to us,'' he said.

A RESTAURANT BOOM INSPIRES LONDON'S LUNCHEON LOUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Behaving badly while eating well is more than a
literary tradition in England, where dining clubs like Oxford's
rich and arrogant Assassins still play at being lordly decadents by
getting expensively sick over shattered crockery.
</P>
<P>
   It would be just another obscure pastime like train spotting or
cricket if London's restaurant boom hadn't provided an arena for a
new generation of oafs. Forget Paris, and forget New York: this
city's culinary big hitters agree that London is the home of the
hooligourmet and the Visagoth.
</P>
<P>
   It's become so bad that the president of Britain's Restaurant
Association recently declared London diners the worst behaved in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've simply never seen boorish behavior in restaurants on such
a scale anywhere else _ people trying to make the staff cry,
shouting and swearing, even throwing food,'' Michael Gottlieb, an
expatriate American who presides over the 3,000-member group, said.
``It's ironic, considering how much less real crime there is in
London than back in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the worst behaved, he and other restaurateurs agree, are
well-educated men in their 20s and 30s who earn their living in the
City, London's financial district. (I recently watched a financial
alpha male, a ringer for Henry VIII with a shave and Savile Row
tailoring, savagely rattling the closed grille of an expensive City
bar and roaring for service. At Rules, which is both the oldest
restaurant in London and the most strenuously English, I've cringed
as a youngish, patrician-looking man bellowed profanity at a waiter
who refused him more refreshment.)
</P>
<P>
   London's well-heeled bohemians can mix it up, too. Ask the
long-suffering Adam Tudor: in his capacity as doorman for the
private Chelsea Arts Club, he has been hair-pulled, shin-kicked and
stuck with a brooch. The last of these attacks was launched by one
of the club's artistic ladies.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon dismays Gordon Ramsay, whose two Michelin stars
for his restaurant are expected to become three before very long.
Ramsay, 33, who was once a professional soccer player, is vehement
on the subject of luncheon louts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently commissioned these lovely glass panels in the
restaurant, optic-fibered, showing these dancers pirouetting _
beautiful things,'' he said. ``Almost immediately, I had to get
them steam-cleaned by a specialist after someone eating here threw
up all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   No apologies were offered. Instead, in a spirit the declining
Romans would have recognized, the sick man proposed going in search
of a clean shirt in which to start the process afresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's soul-destroying at times,'' Ramsay said. ``I trained for
years in France, and these days I spend a fortune in New York
restaurants, without ever encountering the kind of boorishness you
can see here. I just don't think people in London are as
impregnated with the culture and etiquette of eating good food as
people are in other great cities.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gordon Ramsay the final sanction is to strip the miscreants'
table, layer by layer. ``Once you get down to the wood, they
realize it's time to leave,'' Ramsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Worrall-Thompson, a television personality and the
proprietor of Woz in Notting Hill, goes one better: ``I take away
the table. I've done it on several occasions when people have
become objectionable and refused to leave _ it's particularly
effective with a round table, because they're left sitting there
like a drunken game of musical chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The behavior that necessitates such warfare ``is definitely a
London thing,'' Worrall-Thompson said. ``It's partly down to the
huge bonuses going to young City guys, who don't know how to handle
it. But I think it's also that Londoners are still getting used to
using restaurants, not just as places for special occasions, but as
a natural meeting place, like the pub.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the pub. Soren Jessen, the Danish proprietor of two of
London's smart restaurants, One Lombard Street and Noble Rot,
believes that London's eaterati are ``unquestionably worse behaved
than the New Yorkers or Parisians _ and I can add Copenhageners to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically points to London's new bar-restaurant chains,
which he says pander to a dark British longing for the primeval pub
and its forgiving gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those places try to be restaurants and pubs at the same
time,'' he said, naming groups like All Bar One, the Slug and
Lettuce. ``It's all dimly lit, it's thumping, people are encouraged
to drink too much, to shout, to flick ash on the floor. And people
are carrying that whole attitude into serious restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessen doesn't resort to furniture removal, preferring to take
the preventive course at One Lombard Street. ``We discourage them
by trying to soften the environment, to civilize it, to feminize it
even. So if you flick ash on the floor here you should feel
horribly out of place. And I'm sure it helps that our beers, unlike
our Champagne, are very, very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is too grand, it seems, to be touched by the scourge, not
even Nico Ladenis, the chef and owner of Chez Nico, still one of
the titans of London's haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Gottlieb is quite right,'' he said, ``but I think it's
just an extension of the whole national attitude _ the way
authority and privilege are like red rags to a bull. It's about
excessive freedom _ the freedom to be a yob, the freedom to be rude
and boorish. Maybe it also comes from frustration over the loss of
Empire, loss of the Raj. How far back do you want go? You could
write a whole book about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ladenis has written at least part of a book about it;
Chapter 8 of ``My Gastronomy'' (Macmillan; 1997) entitled, ``The
Customer Is Not Always Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's certain,'' Ladenis concluded, ``is that the English
have always taken democracy to extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   If this criticism is all a bit hurtful to Londoners' pride,
there is some comfort on offer, and it comes, improbably, from an
Irishman. Oliver Peyton, the owner of Mash and the
Michelin-approved Isola, does not deny the complaints against his
adopted city. How could he? His own delinquent diners specialize,
he says, in having sex in the lavatories; his minions at Isola have
instructions to intercept would-be members of this Meal-High Club
before they make it into the trysting place.
</P>
<P>
   But Peyton says he likes what he calls London's ``wildness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into this business precisely because I wanted to
challenge and change the stuffy, reverential character of haute
cuisine,'' he said. ``I never liked cathedrals to food. London's
the best place, the natural place, to do that, because it is much
freer and much more rock 'n' roll than other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's a question of balance,'' he added, ``and I can
put up with the bad behavior that does go on, if that's the price
of life in London being such fun, and of restaurants being fun.''

SURFING THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)  
 By BOB TEDESCHI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adventure travelers represent the fastest growing segment of the
$447 billion leisure travel market, according to the nonprofit
Travel Industry Association. It is no surprise, then, that Internet
entrepreneurs have flocked to this category with all the reckless
abandon of the travelers they hope to serve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On paper at least, the notion of an adventure travel Web site
for information and bookings is a perfect Internet idea. Relatively
few conventional travel agencies specialize in this type of
business, in part because the trips are very labor intensive to
plan, and therefore offer meager financial returns. But Internet
travel agents can operate much more efficiently than their offline
counterparts, since, in theory, travelers assume most of the burden
of researching and selecting trips and itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the Web contains a multitude of sites that offer
more information on adventure travel destinations than one could
find in an entire bookstore _ where someone might spend $70 on five
books about hiking treks in Montana _ and, often, a way to reserve
a trip.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, information on these sites is typically better, or
at least more extensive, than the offerings of the adventure-travel
publishing world. That's because sites like GORP.com, away.com,
REIadventures.com, Adventureseek.com, iExplore.com and Altrec.com,
frequently establish agreements with travel publishers to use their
information, then bolster that with an abundance of other tips and
features.
</P>
<P>
   Away.com is one example. The site operators say users can find
over 100,000 pages of information about trips, from African safaris
to spelunking in Arizona. But those who want even more information
have several other options. First, they can type in questions for
one of eight experts who specialize in a region, like Latin
America, or a theme, like ecotourism.
</P>
<P>
   The questions and answers are displayed in a forumlike format,
and the postings are archived, just in case you have a question
like one asked before. If you're considering a trip to Madagascar
to see rare lemurs in the Ankarafantsika Reserve, for instance, the
ecotourism section of the site has some suggestions already
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   If you've forgotten how to spell Ankarafantsika and want to lean
on a human being to find more information about the trip, Away also
provides phone support, e-mail support, and online chats with other
travelers or an Away travel consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The last option can be as much fun as building a campfire in the
rain. I recently asked a question on Away.com about hiking in
Kauai, since my wife and I were headed there with our year-old
daughter, and we figured that if this child was to fit in with her
peers, she really needed to toughen up and get with the whole
adventure travel idea.
</P>
<P>
   During the online chat, a service representative ``pushed'' onto
my screen a page about horseback riding in Molokai _ the connection
between that and hiking in Kauai was unclear _ and another page
with general information about traveling to Kauai.
</P>
<P>
   Within two minutes, there were so many pages opened on my screen
that I had to bushwhack my way through the browser to find the
pop-up window where I'd been chatting with the service
representative. Before I found it, I suspended the search to catch
my breath and check e-mail, which was a bad idea, because my
computer flashed a message about a ``connection failure'' and cut
off the chat.
</P>
<P>
   The phone was much better. A friendly Hawaii specialist on
Away.com told me that the company doesn't take reservations for
day-tour companies in Hawaii, because it wouldn't be financially
feasible, but she told me about the Web site of a tour operator who
might help me. The call took three minutes, and I was able to check
my e-mail at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The top-tier adventure sites include many of the same features,
like online chats and phone support, as well as tips from regional
experts and lists of the most popular tours. But they are also
prone to using unedited versions of sales literature sent by their
tour providers _ which sell their products on multiple sites, so
it's not unusual to feel like you're retracing your tracks while
comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best differentiator for these sites is their search
functions, which let you narrow the universe of available options
quickly. Of those I visited, adventureseek.com had the most nimble
and useful search feature. It let me set my price range, the number
of days I wished to travel, and even the tour company. And when I
chose a particular trip, it gave far more online information about
the tour company than other sites, which leave such issues to their
phone representatives.
</P>
<P>
   IExplore.com _ now partly owned by National Geographic _ also
had a decent search engine, and some nice features, including one
that allowed users to e-mail a page to a friend _ a particularly
useful feature for people traveling in groups.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you found the perfect trip on these sites, however, you
would not be able to book it online. Adventure sites typically ask
their prospective customers to call an 800 number to reserve a
trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this are both pragmatic and technological. Most
of the companies in the market are small businesses run by people
who are much more in tune with nature than e-commerce. They lack
both the budget and the inclination to spend thousands of dollars
on Internet booking systems.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The adventure travel Web sites that depend on those tour
operators for inventory have, in some cases, begun the long process
of helping build reservation tracking systems for the operators, so
everyone knows when a booking has been made, and how many available
spots there are on a given trip.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, tour operators and their Internet partners prefer
to have some interaction with the customer _ other than a mouse
click that delivers a credit card number. By discussing the
itinerary with a customer, travel agents can steer less-qualified
adventurers toward less-strenuous trips, and make sure that those
who are fit enough to climb a mountain have the right equipment and
expectations for the vacation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carla Kinney, 31, an acquisitions editor in Sugar Hill, N.H.,
recently tested the waters of online adventure travel planning
while researching a backpacking trip to Montana. Her husband,
Luther, 29, is a whitewater and backpacking enthusiast, and
although Kinney says she is fit, she has not gone on overnight
backpacking trips with him because she is not sure how she'd hold
up with a heavy pack for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan was to try a guided backpacking trip on her own first,
to ease into the experience, so she checked a number of online
search engines to find such a tour. Eventually, Kinney said she
landed on the GORP.com site, where she had a 90-minute online chat
with a travel consultant named Melissa. The chat ended abruptly
when Kinney's computer dropped her Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   But because she had typed in her phone number at the beginning
of the chat session, Melissa called immediately, and they resumed
their conversation. Twenty minutes later, they settled on a
weeklong backpacking and horseback riding trip with nine other
participants and five guides in the Bob Marshall Wilderness in
Montana, for roughly $1,600, not including air fare or gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy,'' Kinney said. ``And it could've been very
difficult because I was so vague about what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trip, Kinney was impressed. ``The outfitters met me at
the airport, even though I'd never spoken to them,'' she said.
``GORP handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the trip gave her confidence enough to go solo
the next time, Kinney said: ``Absolutely. Most nights I didn't even
sleep in the tent. It was awesome.''

STRIPPED OF PR, FALL FOLIAGE STRICTLY NATURE'S WHIM

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaves go insane. At least that's what new research suggests
about how and why leaves turn those riotous shades of red, yellow
and orange each fall. Facing certain death, leaves appear to
undergo a last crazed metamorphosis to better absorb ultraviolet
rays or protect themselves before becoming mulch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the first wave of foliage forecasters predict that this
could be a big year for fall color, tree experts warn that &UR;  &LR; the
predictions have more to do with bolstering tourism than reality.
Weather during the last two weeks before Columbus Day _ when the
leaves go insane _ will play a big role in determining whether we
get a bumper crop of color, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get to the middle of September, everything that
happens before then really doesn't affect fall color,'' said Peter
Del Tredici, director of living collections with the Arnold
Arboretum in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to come up with a prediction of how bright it's going
to be is pretty iffy,'' added John O'Keefe, curator of the Fisher
Museum at Harvard Forest in Petersham, Mass. ``I'll wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at this time of year, the science of foliage tends to take
a backseat to commerce as various state tourism offices begin
issuing early predictions to lure peepers and their pocketbooks.
And the tree experts feel pressured to make predictions, too.
</P>
<P>
   This week, out of Connecticut, came New England's first guess,
with that state's director of forestry saying the soggy summer
could be a boon to this fall's foliage season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees have larger leaves and more of them, and I think
everyone will find the colors this year will be pretty
impressive,'' said Don H. Smith Jr., director of Connecticut's
forestry division.
</P>
<P>
   However, Warren Archey, chief forester for Massachusetts, was
less certain about both the brilliance and arrival of the foliage
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go out and book a hotel on the basis of a certain
weekend expecting necessarily to see the peak, but I'll go with the
second week of October,'' he said, falling back on the traditional
peak foliage week for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's O'Keefe wouldn't even make a prediction even though he
is one of the state's leading foliage experts. Tuesday he walked
more than 1 1/2 miles and surveyed about 100 species of trees and
shrubs for their leafy changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched it for 10 years and . . . my sense is that the
foliage is impressive every year,'' he said. ``In many cases, the
predictions may be relatively true, but I think that we don't have
a consistent scale to measure this against.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any indication, O'Keefe is right to be reluctant.
Forecasters predicted a dire year during the 1995 drought as leaf
peepers mourned. But according to O'Keefe, it didn't dramatically
reduce the perceived color. Even last year's predictions of a dull
fall fell flat when the colors turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some horrendous weather in the last five to six
years in which trees lost 20 percent of their foliage, and yet
we've had some spectacular fall color,'' said Del Tredici.
</P>
<P>
   Although summer rainfall is one indicator of the intensity of
fall foliage (healthier trees equals bigger leaves equal more
intense colors), experts agree that it's only one variable. But
they are often pressed by the media and the public to make bold
predictions because of all the interest in fall tourism.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that the proliferation of
bed-and-breakfasts has made leaf-peeping an $8 billion annual
business in New England, ahead of skiing in several of the states.
In Maine alone, nearly 400,000 people arrive to view the fall
colors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you knew my grades in plant physiology, the last person you
would call would be me,'' said Massachusetts' Archey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that the fall foliage season ahead could
be a good one. In June and July alone this year, the region had a
rain surplus of almost six inches above normal, a good indication
of healthy trees, according to the Weather Services Corp. of
Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   To really predict what's going to happen, O'Keefe and Del
Tredici say that one must combine rainfall with cooling
temperatures, a day-length component, and a bunch of other factors
and, maybe, you'll be able to make a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the confusion, biologists are continuing to learn more
about these simple fall pleasures, including new insights into why
leaves turn red.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary school textbooks teach that the change is a simple
dying off that unmasks reds and yellows as trees slowly go dormant.
But David Lee and Missy Holbrook of Florida International
University, believe trees may purposefully produce the colors when
they sense the end of the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Under their theory, the colors may protect the leaves, allowing
them to remain on the tree a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really uncharted territory,'' he said. ``It's amazing
there's been so little research on this, especially given the
American academic establishment's headquarters is in the Eastern
US.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe plans to continue his weekly trips into the forest and
plotting the progress of the foliage. And, as for these early
predictions, he sees some positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it gets people looking,'' he said. ``And maybe
they'll do a little bit more thinking than they normally would when
they get up one morning and notice that the trees are red and
yellow.''

BUSH PLAN REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDING MEDICARE TO
INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG OPTION 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. _ Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush tried to take the offensive on the prescription drug issue
Tuesday by detailing a $158 billion plan to help pay Medicare
insurance premiums on plans that provide drug benefit options to
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the cruel choices some seniors face: Heat or
medicine. Food or pills. In a wealthy nation, this is a scandal. In
a compassionate nation, it is a call to action,'' Bush said at the
Gross Towers senior citizen home.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 10-year proposal would shift Medicare away from being a
government-run program to one that involves more competition among
private insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require all insurance companies providing
Medicare coverage to include a prescription drug option. Medicare
would pay the premiums for the poorest Americans, subsidize the
cost for others and cover catastrophic Medicare costs exceeding
$6,000 a year for all seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is proposing to spend an additional $40 billion to
restore payments to Medicare providers that were reduced under the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That would bring the total value of
Bush's package to $198 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore immediately attacked Bush's proposal, claiming
it would force the elderly poor unwillingly into health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign appearance in Columbus, Ohio, the vice president
also contended that Bush's plan ``would leave millions of seniors
without prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the plan, Gore said, is that Bush
cannot pay for it and still go ahead with his proposed $1.3
trillion tax cut, which Gore has said will eat up most of the
federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a $150 billion prescription drug benefit that
would have the Medicare program directly subsidize senior citizens'
drug purchases. Under the Gore plan Medicare would subsidize half
the costs of prescription drugs up to a $5,000 annual limit. Poor
seniors would get larger subsidies depending on their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan also provides catastrophic coverage for expensive
drug purchases. Once a beneficiary paid $4,000 a year in
prescription drugs Medicare would pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore put Bush on the defensive two weeks ago by outlining a $253
billion plan to directly subsidize prescription drug costs for
senior citizens. Gore's plan helped pull the vice president into a
dead heat with Bush in national polls and has been credited with
Gore's new lead in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would pay for all the prescription drugs of the
poorest elderly, individuals earning up to $11,200 a year. More
affluent Americans would have half their drug costs paid for by the
federal government if they took a one-time opportunity to sign up
for a drug plan when they became eligible for Medicare. The
eligibility age is now 65.
</P>
<P>
   In detailing his own plan, Bush sharply criticized Gore as part
of an administration that has failed to reform Medicare. Bush
claimed Gore was more interested in using Medicare for partisan
political advantage than in fixing the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore talks about the `people' vs. the
`powerful.' For eight years he has been the powerful and on health
care he has little to show for it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On health care, my opponent offers the same tired, partisan
ideas that have led our country nowhere,'' Bush said. ``His is the
path of politics, the path of posturing, the path of least
resistance. But it is not the path of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush throughout this year has said he supported the framework of
a plan developed by the National Bipartisan Commission on the
Future of Medicare to have private insurance companies rather than
the government provide prescription drug benefits to seniors, with
a premium subsidy for the poor. But Bush had not previously said
what details he would back.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan proposes spending $110 billion over 10 years to
modernize Medicare by guaranteeing every senior current Medicare
benefits and expanding coverage to include plans with prescription
drug benefits:
</P>
<P>
   Total catastrophic coverage would begin for all seniors when
their medical charges exceeded $6,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As an emergency measure, Bush also proposed giving $48 billion
directly to states to subsidize prescription drug payments for
seniors locally while the new federal program gets up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is no prescription drug benefit in Medicare, 23
states have now established state drug assistance programs,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas under Bush's tenure as governor is not one of those
states. Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said such a program
has never been proposed in Texas by either the Legislature or the
governor's office. But she said interim legislative committees are
looking at the issue for the legislative session that begins in
January.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Gore's plan will keep prescription drug benefits as
part of a government-run program, but seniors who sign up will know
that half their prescription costs are paid. Gore's plan also
includes premiums of about $25 a month that will rise to $40 a
month in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would most benefit poor people who now have no
prescription drug benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has
estimated that in 1996 the average Medicare beneficiary paid $673
for drugs. Gore's plan would pay about $337 of that while requiring
about $300 in new premiums, leaving the average beneficiary $37
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan, by relying on private insurers, leaves open
questions about how much the premiums would cost or how much
prescription drug benefit the elderly actually would receive.
However, it has the advantage that the elderly could switch plans
every year and pay additional premiums to get extra coverage for
prescription drugs and other health care.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered a point-by-point critique of Gore's plan, attacking
first the fact the elderly would only have one chance to sign up
for a prescription program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like the plan the Washington bureaucracy puts you
into, it's too bad. You have no other options,'' Bush said. ``If
you want coverage at age 67 or you change your mind, you're again
out of luck. It's the Gore plan for life or nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also noted that Gore's plan does not become fully effective
for eight years, while his own plan has provisions to quickly help
pay for prescriptions for the poor through his state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Gore's plan also would lead to price controls by
putting the federal government in the position of negotiating major
discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Bush said such price
controls would end drug research.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hostile government takeover of the drug industry would
actually dry up the supply of new miracle drugs,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Gore's plan does nothing to bring about a
fundamental reform of how the Medicare system is run and still
risks the system going bankrupt by 2025 because of a growing
elderly population.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Medicare was created in 1965, Bush compared the system to
an old car that Gore and President Clinton promised to fix in the
1992 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have changed the odometer, but it's still not
running. Medicare needs an overhaul,'' Bush said.

GATES PUTS $28.5M INTO `SMALLER IS BETTER' EDUCATION THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a major investment in the increasingly hot ``smaller
is better'' educational movement, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates
will donate $28.5 million to Massachusetts and Rhode Island groups
working on small schools and other educational innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Citing research that touts the effectiveness of small schools,
the Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation is granting $8.5 million to two
Massachusetts organizations and showering $20 million on Rhode
Island schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Collaborative Education, which works with the 11
pilot schools in the Boston Public Schools, will use $4.9 million
to create 20 small public schools with fewer than 400 students in
New England and upstate New York. Some will be entirely new; others
will be carved out of larger existing schools.
</P>
<P>
   With its $3.6 million share, the Harvard Graduate School of
Education will develop a ``Change Leadership Group'' to offer
training and support services to schools around the country that
are pursuing innovation and change.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million earmarked for Rhode Island goes to the
Providence and Coventry school districts and the Big Picture
Company, a nonprofit that created two public schools in Providence.
The money is for opening small schools and ``smaller learning
communities'' within schools.
</P>
<P>
   The donations, to be announced Wednesday, are the first outside
of Washington state in the Gates Foundation's $350 million campaign
to improve primary and secondary schools. The foundation is also
pouring $1 billion during the next 20 years into college
scholarships for minority students.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates is putting his wealth behind an educational
philosophy very popular today _ the idea that smaller schools can
do wonders for students in urban and rural settings.
</P>
<P>
   The first step to a good education, said Dan French, executive
director of the Center for Collaborative Education, is providing an
environment where ``each student is known well by at least one
adult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mounting evidence and research, particularly with
low-income students and students of color, that small schools are
more successful at providing them a quality education,'' French
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates Foundation and French both point to a recent study in
Chicago, which found that in schools with populations of 350 or
fewer, students were less likely to drop out and more likely to get
better grades. The study, by the Bank Street College of Education
in New York, was published in June.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 report by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory
in Oregon also found that small schools have fewer problems with
discipline, violence, theft, substance abuse, and gang
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small schools have higher retention, college acceptance, and
motivation,'' said Carol Rava, a spokeswoman for the Gates
Foundation. ``We need to step back from the thinking most of us
know from our high school experiences, oriented toward traditional,
large, comprehensive American schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Collaborative Education currently supports the
network of 11 pilot schools in Boston. These schools are part of
the public school system but free from most union and school
committee rules. They include the Boston Arts Academy, Boston
Evening Academy, Young Achievers Math and Science School, and
Fenway High School, which emphasizes critical thinking.
</P>
<P>
   With its grant money, the group hopes to open four small public
schools _ most of them in urban school districts _ each year for
the next five years. The organization will provide them with
professional development and curriculum guidance and will pair each
one with a ``mentor'' school, a preexisting small school, French
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Graduate School of Education has three goals for its
share, said Tony Wagner, an educational consultant who will be
codirector of the Change Leadership Group. First, they plan to
research the best practices available in educational coaching.
Second, they intend to develop a certification program for school
leaders interested in smaller schools and other reform. Third, they
intend to create a nonprofit consulting business for schools and
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more clear that schools need help
(implementing change) and that help simply isn't available,''
Wagner said. ``Educational leaders know how to manage the status
quo, but they don't know how to do change.''

BRAZIL'S OIL COMPANY, IN QUEST OF WORLD STATUS, HIRES PELE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ When Edson Arantes do Nascimento was 18, he
used to run onto the soccer field with a 130-pound sack of coffee
beans on his back. Even then, in the days before Colombia's Juan
Valdez stole the limelight from Brazilian coffee, the young man
known as Pele was already using his fame to promote his country's
products abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never change. In a new role as goodwill ambassador
for the Brazilian oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras,
Pele, who turns 60 next month, is lending the considerable weight
of his name to another company with international aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petrobras is a Brazilian company that made good, just like
Pele is a Brazilian who made good,'' Pele said in an interview
here. ``I can help Petrobras project that image abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras is one of a growing number of Brazilian companies that
have become competitive enough in recent years to turn their sights
toward the international market. Like most of the others, though,
the oil company is hard pressed to come up with the investment
capital in Brazil needed to finance its efforts. So Petrobras has
sought international investors.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, is that Petrobras, the world's
seventh-largest publicly traded oil company, is not well known
outside Brazil. The fact that most of the company's oil is used by
Brazilians has not helped. Nor did the company's 45-year reign as a
state-owned monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras formally lost its monopoly five years ago, and Brazil
is now in the process of opening the energy market to full
competition. To compete against the likes of Royal Dutch/Shell and
Exxon Mobil, the company is increasingly feeling the pressure to go
global. Indeed, Petrobras has plans to spend $33 billion over the
next five years to double its current production and buy up oil
exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to expand abroad,'' said Henri Philippe Reichstul, the
president of Petrobras, when the advertising contract was
announced. ``Pele, his legend, will be our ambassador.''
</P>
<P>
   But the job will not be easy. In years past, Brazil has gotten
more headlines abroad from its political antics, violence and
environmental damage than its business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Pele said that in his many years of travel, the most frequent
question he has been asked is how Brazil is going to overcome its
chronic corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sad about the negative propaganda that our politicians
create for Brazil abroad,'' he remarked. ``Unfortunately, the
administration of Brazil has been terrible, and it is just starting
to get better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras also has its own baggage. The company was responsible
for two extensive oil spills this year that have tainted its
reputation in and outside Brazil. The first spill, in January,
flooded Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro with 325,000 gallons of
oil, blackening some famed beaches and endangering a fragile nature
preserve. After a thorough mea culpa by Reichstul, Petrobras
thought it had put the troubles behind, when another spill, this
time on the Iguacu River in July, sent a million more gallons of
oil into Brazilian waterways.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Pele comes in, with 43 years as an international
icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pele is without a doubt the most well-known Brazilian in the
world,'' said Washington Olivetto, president and creative director
of W/Brasil, a leading advertising agency in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prominent in his resume are Pele's efforts to help put
Pepsi-Cola behind both the Iron Curtain and the Great Wall of
China. He turned MasterCard International, with which he has a
continuing relationship as spokesman, into something approaching a
household name. And perhaps most challenging, for a short time in
the late 1970s, his efforts on behalf of the North American Soccer
League brought early attention to professional soccer in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as Brazil's minister of sports from 1995 to 1998,
during which he tried to remake the legislation that governed the
country's soccer teams, Pele has settled into roles as goodwill
ambassador for several U.N. agencies and spokesman in Brazil for
the Finnish cellular phone giant Nokia, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   He is already hard at work for Petrobras. Last month, in his
first ambassadorial mission, he made a personal appearance at the
New York Stock Exchange for the company's newest stock offering.
The government sold about $4.4 billion in shares, or 17 percent of
the company, to domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a Brazilian company to be understood as being Brazilian,
Pele is an extremely efficient spokesman,'' Olivetto said. ``It is
much easier to explain what Petrobras is to foreigners by using
Pele.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the two years of his contract, he will take part in
commercials, publicity campaigns, speeches and personal appearances
for Petrobras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although, running with a barrel of oil on my back,'' Pele
remarked with a grin, ``now that could get a little complicated.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS OUTLINE CONGRESSIONAL WISH LIST
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Democratic congressional
leaders Tuesday outlined a set of election-year legislative
priorities that overlapped only slightly with a similar wish list
unveiled by Senate Republican leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   In separate appearances as the Senate returned from its August
break, Clinton and Lott agreed that their troops should cooperate
to pass a China trade law, the remaining 11 appropriation bills,
some tax cuts, a minimum wage increase, conservation legislation
and a reduction in the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   But each firmly rejected several of the other's specific
proposals, and emphasized their deep differences over how to
provide prescription drug benefits to seniors and protect the
rights of patients served by health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another list of priorities is to be unveiled Wednesday by
House Republicans, who will be the third participant in
negotiations that will determine how much work the 106th Congress
can complete before it disbands in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri outlined Democratic
priorities in the Rose Garden of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to say is that we are committed to breaking
the legislative logjam, but we have to move forward with fiscal
responsibility, with responsible tax cuts and with public
investments that give all our people a chance and fuel our
prosperity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first priorities of the Democrats are to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Block ``massive and reckless tax cuts'' passed by the
Republican-controlled Congress
</P>
<P>
   _ Reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pass a modest package of ``sensible tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise the $5.15 minimum wage by a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approve a ``strong'' patients' bill of rights and ``an
affordable, voluntary, Medicare prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress should also pass gun-safety and hate crimes
bills, fund the hiring of more local police, strip
``anti-environmental riders'' from appropriation bills, combat
global warming and earmark education funds for more teachers and
for modern classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Lott outlined Senate GOP priorities after a private luncheon
with the other Republican senators in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that the White House wants to create a mess at
the end of the session for pure political reasons,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   If the House somehow achieves the two-thirds majority needed to
override Clinton's veto of tax-cut bills that would have eliminated
estate taxes and reduced the marriage penalty, the Senate will then
try to do the same, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll focus the greatest time commitment'' on four other
priorities, Lott said. The four were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Approval of permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Completion of the 11 remaining appropriation bills for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising the annual limits for tax-protected savings in 401-K
and IRA retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elimination of ``some unfair taxes, like the telephone tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, he would like to reach agreements on
bankruptcy reforms, better military benefits, a water resources
bill, a conservation bill, minimum wage increases tied to tax
relief for small businesses, and education bills with fewer
earmarks. He said prescription drug benefits should be only for
``the needy seniors _ not just a massive entitlement program for
everybody, even those that can afford to pay for their own.''
</P>
<P>
   He said tentative agreements have already been reached on bills
to fund schools and roadwork in national forests and to make it
easier for the victims of state-sponsored terrorism to recover
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the efforts of House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
to reach a compromise with Clinton on a patients' bill of rights,
Lott seemed skeptical. ``So far it hasn't been possible'' for
Senate and House Republicans to agree with each other, much less
the Democrats, about the details of such a bill, Lott said.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Some political scientists are
predicting Al Gore will win the presidential race on the basis of
mathematical formulas alone. What a hoot. Politics is not a
science, but if it were, it would be an inexact one determined not
by numbers-crunching but by the vagaries of human nature. Who could
predict, for instance, that George W. Bush would be caught making a
crude remark, and who knows how the public will react to that? By

   HINES-COLUMN (Washington) _ As the race for the Republican
presidential nomination quickened last fall, George W. Bush said:
``I still have time to screw this up.'' Perhaps over the last three
weeks, as Bush's lead in polls vanished and Vice President Al Gore
gained an upper hand in the national race, the Texas governor
recalled that observation. There is almost always some ebb and flow
in a presidential race without an incumbent, but Bush's recent fade
has been startling. By CRAGG HINES. (Already filed.)

`TURN IT UP': RAPSTERS' ATTITUDE CAN'T SAVE `TURN IT UP'  
 BY STEPHEN HOLDEN  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been called screen presence, star quality and charisma. But
a more apt word for the buzz exuded by the stars of the rickety rap
melodrama ``Turn It Up'' might be attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The projection of attitude _ that's with a capital A _ is a
basic ingredient of hip-hop performance, and it's one reason
rappers seem able to make the transition from music to movies far
more easily than their rock-and-roll forerunners. Long before
appearing in the films, they were already rehearsing their roles.
</P>
<P>
   The typical rap record, after all, is an action-adventure film
(minus the visuals) in which the performer struts a personal
fantasy of urban life. And in ``Turn It Up,'' which has been touted
in advance as the hip-hop answer to ``Purple Rain,'' the rappers
Prakazriel Michel (better known as Pras) and Ja Rule (making his
movie debut) hold the screen with a brash, swaggering arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Pras, a founding member of the Fugees, plays Diamond, an
up-and-coming rapper from Brooklyn, and Ja Rule is Gage, his
thuggish manager and best friend since childhood. As the movie
opens, Diamond has already acquired an underground reputation for
his rap performances in after-hours clubs. He and Gage are
recording a demo with funds made from low-level drug deals arranged
by Mr. B (Jason Staham), a sinister and vicious British drug czar
with ties to the record business. One of Mr. B's closest pals is a
record president known only (and symbolically) as Mr. White (John
Ralston).
</P>
<P>
   Diamond is also trying to hold together a volatile relationship
with his girlfriend, Kia (Tamala Jones), who announces that she's
pregnant and pressures him into making a commitment. One sure sign
of Diamond's ambivalence about the relationship is his refusal to
give her his cell phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Everything explodes at once. Diamond's mother suddenly dies, and
his father, Cliff (Vondie Curtis-Hall), who had vanished years
earlier, appears out of the blue and invites himself to stay with
his still-resentful son. And without consulting Diamond, Gage goes
on the criminal rampage to acquire the big bucks to pay for an
independently produced record.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adetuyi, who wrote and directed ``Turn It Up,'' has a
sharp ear for streetwise dialogue and an eye for seedy urban
ambience. His screenplay captures the urgency, impatience and
frustrations of impoverished musicians just one recording away from
becoming millionaires. The story takes for granted Diamond's and
Gage's illicit interim self-support system, implying without
judgment that this is the way it's often done in the rap world.
</P>
<P>
   But in the film's more intimate scenes, the dialogue turns
wooden and self-conscious. And as the movie goes along, it loses
track of its subplots. Its minor characters, especially the robotic
Mr. White, who talks like an Eddie Murphy imitation of Richard
Nixon, are implausible. And what are we to make of the prodigal
father, who abandoned his wife and young son to pursue a career as
a jazz pianist, then sank into alcoholism and now exudes a sagelike
authority and wisdom? The complicated father-son relationship,
which could have been a movie in itself, is left unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually ``Turn It Up'' deteriorates into a gory shoot-'em-up
gangster movie with a quick-fix ending that leaves many threads
dangling. It could have been something more. The movie is rated R
(Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

GORE TO OFFER DETAILS ON ECONOMIC GOALS: PAYING DOWN NATIONAL
BUDGET, USE OF SURPLUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Hoping to prove he is more fiscally prudent than his
opponent, Al Gore Wednesday will lay out a detailed budget plan
spelling out how he intends to pay down the national debt and use
the projected federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to be delivered at Cleveland State University, aides
said, Gore will list 10 economic goals that include eliminating the
national debt by 2012, doubling the number of families with savings
in excess of $50,000, and ensuring that Medicare and Social
Security payroll taxes are not used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to be giving an economic policy speech that is
comprehensive and detailed and chock-full of details,'' Gore said
on Tuesday. ``It will set some clear goals. It will describe how we
can have a balanced budget every year and still set aside enough
money to pay down the debt and completely eliminate the debt by
year 2012.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech will be accompanied by the release of a several
hundred page budget document providing a year-by-year accounting of
how the surplus will be spent and how the debt will be whittled
down.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details, however, are not new. Gore has spent much
of the campaign season trotting out a series of spending programs
and a $500 billion tax cut, to be funded largely from the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is the packaging of the proposals. For example, he
had previously announced a tax program to allow people to set up
401(k)-style retirement savings programs. But the budget plan will
use those tax deductions and credits as the means to achieve his
goal to double the number of families with savings in excess of
$50,000. About a third of all families have reached such savings
now, according to Gore aides.
</P>
<P>
   Aides also hope the presentation will put Gore's Republican
opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, on the defensive by contending
that the governor's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut and spending
proposals will leave the country saddled with a $2.8 trillion debt
in 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials have defended his economic program as
sound. They argue there will be ample money to pay for their tax
cut and spending initiatives. On Tuesday, Bush enriched that
spending package with a $150 billion health care plan for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said that under the governor's
plans, the debt would be eliminated by 2016. He dismissed the four
additional years of debt as insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of our economy that is minuscule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said the timing of the debt reduction was partially
dependent on how Bush's plan to let some people invest part of
their Social Security taxes in private retirement accounts shapes
up. The transition costs for the retirement plan are estimated to
be as high as a $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett also dismissed the notion that Gore was being more
fiscally conservative, arguing that according to an analysis by the
Bush campaign, Gore's spending program would eat up the surplus
plus another $396 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In another move pounced on by the Bush campaign, Gore aides said
that their budget plan will include the more generous estimates
from the Congressional Budget Office which has pegged the surplus
at $4.5 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Up until recently Gore has stuck to the more conservative
estimate of $4.1 billion surplus estimate by the federal Office of
Management and Budget. And his campaign has criticized Bush for
relying on the larger CBO numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said it was ``hypocritical'' of Gore to criticize Bush
for relying on the larger estimates when he was now willing to use
them to create extra revenue for his budget plan.

THE PUBLICITY ON `JAZZ';   `BIG BROTHER' CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE PUBLICITY ON `JAZZ'
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker, sat down
with his public relations advisers as well as executives from
General Motors, his corporate sponsor, and PBS to figure out how
best to promote his forthcoming documentary, ``Jazz,'' which is to
begin running on PBS in January.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-part series tracks the history of jazz from its inception
_ during the days of the slave trade _ through current times.
</P>
<P>
   Burn's first two major documentaries, ``The Civil War'' and
``Baseball,'' which ran several hours over several nights, had been
shown before the Internet was a part of everyday life for so many
and before cable was so aggressively programming against the
broadcast networks and PBS.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Civil War'' made its debut in 1990, and even in 1994
with the debut of ``Baseball,'' it did not take so much promotional
work to convince people to watch a lengthy documentary on public
television, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   For those films, Burns said, ``you could probably put ads in the
paper, get a couple of feature stories and you had a huge
percentage of the audience primed and geared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have to yell a little bit louder,'' he said. ``Just
to get, maybe, even less.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Burns and his associates came up with what
they are calling an unusually intensive corporate promotional and
marketing campaign for a PBS series, one that is akin to those
undertaken by corporate behemoths like the Walt Disney Co. It was
put together by reaching out to various industries for which the
documentary could be of interest.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after being approached by General Motors
representatives, Sony Music and Verve Music Group, the major
competing distributors of jazz in the United States, have agreed to
jointly produce 24 separate jazz compilations based on the
documentary. Those compilation CD's will be offered for sale in
record stores starting in November.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks coffee shops, where the documentary will be
advertised, will offer a ``Jazz'' CD for sale in January. Some of
the proceeds from those sales are to go to the United Negro College
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Klores, General Motors' public relations and marketing
specialist, enlisted another one of his clients, the National
Basketball Association, to promote the film with half-time jazz
performances at the nation's basketball arenas throughout the fall.
The NBA will also produce television spots promoting the
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   GM will sponsor jazz concerts and screenings of the documentary
around the country and has signed on as a sponsor of the 2000/2001
season of Jazz at Lincoln Center. It also plans to underwrite a
jazz education program for middle-school pupils around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Knopf is publishing a ``Jazz'' book by Burns and
Geoffrey C. Ward, based on the documentary. It is to go on sale in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Burns and PBS executives said they hoped that all the promotion
would help the documentary reach wide swaths of the television
audience that PBS does not normally draw.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt PBS has much riding on its success.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' documentaries typically double, or even triple, PBS's
average ratings. That kind of draw is more meaningful than ever to
PBS' executives, considering that it now faces new competitors on
cable, like A&AMP;E and the History Channel, which show programs
similar to those that were once the sole purview of PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the importance of ``Jazz'' to PBS, the network was
originally planning to show the documentary in the fall. But it
instead decided to show it in January to move it out from under the
shadows of the Olympics and coverage of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the promotional campaign goes far, Burns said, it does
have limits. ``We're holding off on the cups and the lunchboxes,''
he said. ``I don't think there's a Happy Meal in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   `BIG BROTHER' CASH
</P>
<P>
   Now, the producers of the CBS reality series ``Big Brother'' are
getting really serious.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to get someone now in the ``Big Brother'' house to
quit the show, the producers intend to increase a cash offer to
contestants to more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go tonight to the first one who is willing to
quit the camera-filled house in which he or she has been locked for
the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create an opening so a new contestant, a
22-year-old woman named Beth, can be inserted in the house _ and,
the producers fervently hope _stir things up. But after word that
$10,000 would be offered was reported on Monday, several fans of
the current cast took to displaying signs around the house to tell
the participants the offer was coming and urging them to reject it.
</P>
<P>
   That is the last thing the Big Brother producers want to see
happen. So they plan to up the ante further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are going to be higher than anyone expects,'' said
Eddie Michaels, a spokesman. Indeed, the number will ``certainly go
higher than $20,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is intended to light some kind of fire under what is
considered an increasingly sparkless show. At a time when the
show's popularity had been expected to improve because the number
of possible winners was down to six, the ratings are slipping.
</P>
<P>
   How far will the producers go to squeeze someone out of the
house? Michaels would not say. But the show's winner is to get
$500,000, with $100,000 going to the second-place finisher and
$50,000 to the third.

FIRM SAYS IT RESTORED USE OF LIMBS IN PARALYZED RATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston Life Sciences Inc. says it has produced a near
total recovery of limb function in an experimental rat model of
stroke, advancing hopes for a treatment that could reverse nerve
damage and paralysis in stroke victims.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 days of treatment with the company's nerve growth
factor Inosine, rats that had been paralyzed recovered more than 90
percent of the muscle function in their limbs. The treatment began
two days after the rats had suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Although Inosine still must pass years of rigorous testing in
human clinical trials before being made commercially available, the
company said the drug has the potential to be the first
regenerative therapy for stroke victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``All current stroke therapies, which must be given almost
immediately after stroke to take effect, are based on preventing or
minimizing the original damage,'' said Dr. Marc Lanser, founder and
chief scientific officer. ``Inosine appears to be effective even
when given after the damage has been done and the stroke is
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Life Sciences contracted Cerebrotec, a neuroscience
research laboratory, to perform the actual experiment. The rats'
limb function was assessed over the 20-day treatment through a
variety of measures, including paw reaching and twisting tests.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Opel, a health-care technology analyst with Boston-based
investment bank H.C. Wainwright &AMP; Co., said that even if all goes
well, it would be another three to five years before Inosine could
reach the market. The company must get approval from the US Food
and Drug Administration before beginning human clinical trials to
test the product's safety and effectiveness. Then, it must get
clearance from the FDA to market the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I would say that from nothing at all to success in an
animal model is a bigger advance than going from an animal model to
a human model,'' Opel said.

SKI RESORTS PLEDGE TO PROTECT NATURAL AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the nation's biggest ski resorts, trail maps this season will
be emblazoned with a proclamation of environmental good will.
``Sustainable Slopes,'' the new program, is the product of a ski
industry association campaign to quiet critics and to reassure
visitors that its members are committed to protecting natural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   At least 165 ski resorts around the country, including the 20
largest, will be entitled to display the logo, having signed off in
June on a set of standards drafted by the association with help
from government agencies and some environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the standards are often vague, leading many critics to
complain that they do not go far enough to shield forests, rivers
and other wild areas from the damage that ski areas can cause.
</P>
<P>
   The charter calls for voluntary commitment to follow ``best
practices'' in several areas, including ``to use the natural
surroundings as a means to increase environmental awareness'' and
``to conserve natural resources'' in dealing with water, energy,
waste management, fish and wildlife, forests and wetlands. It also
calls on signatories ``to engage surrounding communities and
interest groups in a dialogue on development plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort has already kindled debate between an industry trying
to show itself as ecologically sensitive and skeptical activists
who have now vowed to develop a rating system of their own in order
to grade ski areas on their environmental conduct. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we feel that this so-called charter is being
used as a public relations ploy rather than a genuine attempt to
improve their environmental performance,'' said Jeff Berman,
executive director of Colorado Wild of Durango, Colo., one of the
organizations trying to develop the report card by the time the ski
season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and the ski industry have long been at
odds, wrangling in the courts and other arenas over issues like the
development of ski areas in the national forests and the tapping of
mountain streams for snowmaking.
</P>
<P>
   One of the angriest battles, over the proposed expansion at Vail
Mountain in Colorado, was fought through the mid 1990s. After a
federal court upheld the development plan, arsonists destroyed a
mountaintop restaurant and four ski lifts at Vail in October 1998,
causing $12 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was condemned by mainstream environmental groups, but
an organization calling itself the Earth Liberation Front took
responsibility, saying it was protesting destruction of habitat for
the lynx.
</P>
<P>
   In drafting the new charter, the industry group, the National
Ski Areas Association, has not tried to hide its determination to
put forth a greener image.
</P>
<P>
   The resorts that make up the ski industry ``are operated or
owned by individuals who have a strong environmental ethic,''
Geraldine Hughes, the group's director of public policy, said in a
telephone interview from Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the document, issued as a 22-page book on
recycled paper, calls for voluntary commitment to protecting nature
through more efficient use of energy, safer waste disposal and
water conservation. Hughes said the association would issue a
report next spring assessing progress toward meeting those goals.
</P>
<P>
   The signatories include virtually every major ski resort,
including Vail, Aspen, Park City, Jackson Hole and Sugarloaf, with
the total number accounting for about 70 percent of skier visits.
Half the group's 330 members have not yet agreed to the plan, but
Hughes said most of these were small operators with limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Among 12 outside organizations that have endorsed the plan as
partners (including the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Forest Service), two were environmental groups: Leave No Trace, of
Boulder, and the Conservation Law Foundation of New England, which
has filed numerous lawsuits against ski resorts in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In a June announcement, Mark Sinclair, vice president of the
Conservation Law Foundation, said he believed that the charter
would ``allow resort owners and environmental groups to work more
closely together to improve the sustainability of the ski
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But many other environmental groups chose not to endorse the
plan, including Trout Unlimited, which objected to the absence of a
clear commitment to protect fish habitats from increasingly
extensive snowmaking operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up, skiing started at Christmas or, if you were
lucky, at Thanksgiving,'' said Melinda Kassen, a Colorado-based
expert for the organization. ``With snowmaking, ski areas open in
mid- to late October, the low-flow season for the streams and
creeks, and so that means they're sucking water when the fish are
most vulnerable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the ski industry official, said the resort operators had
been careful not to promise too much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We do create great recreation opportunities,'' Hughes said.
``But with those opportunities come impacts, and we're not going to
agree to something we cannot do.''
</P>

`BACKSTAGE': FILM PRESENTS RAPPER'S-EYE VIEW OF CONCERT TOURING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I came to blow it down, and I'm gonna blow it down,'' DMX says
of his turn onstage in the concert documentary ``Backstage,'' which
follows the 1999 ``Hard Knock Life'' tour headed by Jay-Z and
several other rappers, including the likable and funny Beanie
Sigel, Redman, Memphis Bleek and others, along with a cameo by an
effusive Busta Rhymes, who has the cheerfulness of new money.
</P>
<P>
   DMX, who's so prolific _ and sometimes repetitive _ he may get
his own wing at Tower Records, has a remarkable and combative stage
presence. Bombastic and hot-blooded, he holds court in a singular
fashion, exercising sheer force of will to pull the spotlight down
on himself and demanding the crowd's attention: ``That's the need
to be heard,'' he states, offering his view. (``He epitomizes the
have-nots,'' the Def Jam Music producer Irv Gotti says of the lean,
prowling star.)
</P>
<P>
   DMX's portion of the performance is unlike the family vibe that
permeates the shows of the other rappers on the tour. They include
Jay-Z, who rescued his hit ``Hard Knock Life'' from the inanity of
the movie version of ``Annie'' and built a generation's anthem
around the original song's tossed-off chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Jay-Z used his stature to create the tour he wanted. Instead of
being coerced to go out with an rhythm and blues act to make him
more accessible (as is mentioned in the movie), Jay-Z flexed his
3-million-record sales muscle to surround himself with the rappers
he likes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Spike Lee's ``Original Kings of Comedy,'' which shows the
unanimity of purpose among four professional but extremely
competitive comedians, ``Backstage'' provides a glimpse into the
lives of tough and cooperative black entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of DMX, who seems to seal himself off from
his fellow performers _ ``The only part of the tour I like is the
one hour I'm onstage,'' he says, and a handwritten sign warns that
only his beloved pit bull is allowed to visit him before his show _
the rappers spend copious hang time eluding and flirting with
groupies. (Their faces are obscured by dots of various colors and
sizes and with messages, including ``Your Ad Here.'') It's the
standard life of revelry and exhaustion, something that has been a
staple of concert music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage'' deals with that as well as the performers'
awareness of the way rappers are perceived. The tour was in Denver
when the Columbine High School shootings occurred, and Jay-Z makes
a point of contributing the profits from the Denver show to the
school. At another point Redman notes that he had seen a mosh pit
while touring with Everclear: ``If that ever happened at a hip-hop
show, they'd shut it down,'' he muses.
</P>
<P>
   Where things get really tense and interesting is in the stances
of the management companies. Damon Dash, head of Roc-A-Fella
Records, is furious because Def Jam upstages Roc-A-Fella's artists
by usurping props like jackets; the Def Jam jackets, by the way, do
the job because they're quite fly. Since Jay-Z is a Roc-A-Fella
artist, and the focal point of the show _ ``I came all the way from
Montana to see Jay-Z,'' a young white fan enthuses _ Dash's anger
seems justified.
</P>
<P>
   The film would have been better served had it given a more
complete picture of the shrewdness that has made Def Jam such a
player, although hard-core fans (and ``Hard Knock'' fans) know of
the rivalries in the rap world. As Ja Rule says, ``As long as
you're black, it's gonna be a hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage'' isn't as good as the rap documentaries ``Rhyme and
Reason'' and ``The Show,'' but it still casts a keen, observant eye
(even though video fatigue sets in) on this world.

   Aging Cowboys headed nowhere but down
</P>
<P>
   By Rick Cantu If you believe in omens, the season for the Dallas
Cowboys turned to ashes about the time Philadelphia recovered the
game's opening kickoff Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The season was four seconds old when the red-faced Cowboys
became victims of a sneak attack, a successful onside kick by the
hated Eagles. One play symbolized what has happened lately to the
Cowboys, and where they are headed in 2001, 2002, 2003. ...
</P>
<P>
   The NFL basement is a cold and lonely place.
</P>
<P>
   Why such gloom and doom over the 41-14 loss? There are 15 games
left, for Dave Campo's sake. A marathon season is never over after
the first mile. Isn't 10-6 still possible? What about 9-7?
</P>
<P>
   The prophets have already written on the subway walls. The
script for the next few seasons has already been written. The chief
playmakers in Dallas are old, and the new blood does not consist of
blue-chip material. When Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith play their
final games, there might be nothing left at Texas Stadium but some
old jockstraps and film of glory days gone by.
</P>
<P>
   There comes a time when pessimism and realism become the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 24-25 since 1997, and Aikman and Smith are
almost as old as Mick Jagger. Joining them in the over-30 club are
Leon Lett, Chad Hennings, Mark Stepnoski, Jackie Harris, Darren
Woodson, Erik Williams, Randall Cunningham, Rocket Ismail, Barron
Wortham and Chris Warren. ``The Golden Girls'' showed more spunk
than these Cowboys did Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clues about this dismal start started this summer in oven-hot
Wichita Falls, where devils go to get a tan.
</P>
<P>
   Players were hurt. Williams skipped four weeks. The first-team
offense rarely played together. Smith never carried the football in
a game. And in the course of an 0-5 preseason, players and coaches
had the same battle cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preseason games mean nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, they do.
</P>
<P>
   Forget 0-5. The first-team offense never clicked in preseason
games. The Aikman-to-Joey Galloway connection never connected. And
now Galloway is gone for the season, victimized by a torn knee
ligament. The team has speed but no cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
   There was no good news Sunday, and Smith, the wise old man of
the offense, summed up the mood perfectly: ``As individuals and as
a team, we have to look in the mirror and ask ourselves what we can
do to become better players.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame the players cannot get any younger.
</P>
<P>
   Blame most of this on Jerry Jones. The team owner has gambled
with amazing luck during his 12 years in Texas, and his fortune is
bigger than Deion Sanders' ego. He has been a brilliant
businessman, a steely-eyed poker player.
</P>
<P>
   The dice no longer are kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have become victims of the NFL's salary cap, which
is $62 million this year. Jones was the driving force who made the
Cowboys the NFL's team of the 1990s. His philosophy of giving huge
contracts to players who could win Super Bowls _ Aikman, Smith,
Sanders, Hennings, Lett, Ismail, Galloway _ faces a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's ninth concussion reminds the Cowboys they don't have a
franchise quarterback if his career is close to ending. Smith's
legs will carry him to the Hall of Fame, but it is unrealistic to
believe he can carry the offense by himself. The offensive line is
supposed to be a strength, but the Eagles were hardly impressed.
The defense yielded 201 yards rushing to Duce Staley, not exactly
the reincarnation of Jim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the scary part: The Cowboys will spend about $10
million in 2001 on players who no longer are on the team. The
signing bonuses Jones gave his top players will still count against
the salary cap. He mortgaged the future by giving bonuses to
players such as Sanders and retired Cowboys Michael Irvin and Daryl
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Cowboys traded their 2000 and 2001
first-round draft picks to Seattle in exchange for Galloway. While
the Redskins draft players such as All-Amercans LaVar Arrington and
Chris Samuels, the Cowboys add no one with impressive football
pedigrees.
</P>
<P>
   Before long the Cowboys of the '90s will not be much better than
the New Orleans Saints of any decade.
</P>
<P>
   Who will lead the Cowboys when the well of talent runs dry?
Rookie cornerbacks Dwayne Goodrich and Mario Edwards have shown no
glimpses of greatness. There are no running backs to replace Smith,
no quarterbacks to replace Aikman, no offensive linemen to replace
Williams and Stepnoski.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Jones absorbed the heat Sunday, answering
questions for nearly 30 minutes after the game. ``I don't put this
one on Dave Campo's shoulders,'' he said. ``This one goes on my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones deserves credit for creating an empire. If he reaches the
playoffs with this group, it will be his biggest accomplishment
yet.

 &HT;    Unwelcome mat is out at Ole Miss
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Playing on the road in the SEC is tough enough.
It's pretty much impossible when the opposing town has had two
years to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville faces Saturday night
when he takes the Tigers to Mississippi for a key showdown in the
SEC West.
</P>
<P>
   On the Saturday after Thanksgiving 1998, Tuberville left his job
as Mississippi's coach, which paid about $450,000 a year, for one
at Auburn, which would pay $900,000. Tuberville kept his intentions
quiet until he was introduced at Auburn. Mississippi players, fans,
and administrators felt that he had misled them. Others just said
he lied. Tuberville contended it was the nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult situation for everybody involved,''
Tuberville said. ``There is no good way to leave. No matter what
you do, people are going to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi fans didn't buy that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they appreciated that Tuberville rebuilt a program that had
been wracked by NCAA probation, losing 26 scholarships. They
appreciated that he led the effort to expand and improve
Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, and that he produced 25 wins and three
bowl teams in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who love Ole Miss put a lot of stock in loyalty,
and Saturday night in Oxford they will express _ loudly _ their
displeasure with Tuberville's perceived lack of it. For Saturday's
opener with Tulane, a sign on a store in the Oxford town square
read: ``Sept. 9 _Tommy Tuberville Appreciation Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Tuberville said. ``I've been called a lot of bad
things in a lot of stadiums before. No matter what happens, we have
to get ready to play again next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mississippi fans bought every ticket they could for
the game at Auburn. The Rebel fans were so worked up they were
doing the ``Hotty Toddy'' cheer during the Auburn alma mater. The
Rebels beat Auburn 24-17 in overtime to spark a wild celebration at
Jordan-Hare Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tuberville returns to the place that gave him his first
chance to be a head coach, to a place where 45,000-plus will wish
him ill, to a place where 19 of the 22 starters on the opposing
team were recruited by him and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed with the way coach Tuberville left,'' said
running back Deuce McAllister, a candidate for the Heisman Trophy.
``But I understand. It's business. We just like to remind him what
he left behind.''

MANGLED PIT BULL MAY HAVE SETTLED GANGS' SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Animal control officials were horrified last year when
they discovered the story behind the naked carcass of a young dog.
</P>
<P>
   Rival gangs, embroiled in a turf war, had settled the dispute by
putting their prized mascot pit bulls in a ring to fight, officials
discovered after interviewing gang members. The losing dog was
skinned and its pelt kept as a trophy by the victorious gang.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbing incident illuminated the growing popularity of
organized dog fighting _ particularly among urban gangs _ that has
spawned a a demand for pit bulls trained to attack, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities have seized some 450 dogs in the last four
years _ most of them pit bulls that were considered so dangerous
they had to be put down. At least 20 were seized just last month.
</P>
<P>
   A recent string of pit bull attacks has focused attention on a
breed with an entrenched _ and some say undeserved _ reputation for
viciousness. As a result, the City Council Wednesday will consider
a tough law that could include anything from mandatory insurance
for pit bull owners to an outright ban on the breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to hold owners of these dogs responsible for vicious
behavior,'' said councilor-at-large Stephen J. Murphy who sponsored
the bill. ``This is a problem that needs to be addressed, one way
or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Gang members, city officials say, are deliberately mistreating
pit bulls to turn dogs that are not innately menacing into violent
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These gangs are settling differences with a dog fight, and
dogs that are trained to do that _ there's not much chance for
them,'' said Stephen Crosby, Boston's director of animal control.
``There are a whole lot of pit bulls in this city that are great
dogs. But those that are trained to fight are starved and abused
and trained to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Pit Bulls _ formally called Staffordshire terriers _ have been a
favorite of gang members since the early 1990s as a symbol of fear
and virility. Their stout stances, boxy heads and massive jaw
muscles _ traits supposedly bred into the dogs specifically for
ring fighting _ make them potentially among the most dangerous
breeds when trained to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Outbreaks of pit bull attacks have been widely publicized, and
cities around the country have considered banning or imposing
strict regulations on pit bulls. Public fear has even spread to
France, where recent attacks in a Paris suburb sparked an angry
uprising from people who denounced the breed as not only dangerous
but an American fad.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston last month an attack by two pit bulls sent three
sisters to the hospital, including a pregnant woman who gave birth
prematurely after the attack. Then, a man stabbed a pit bull to
death as he was being attacked, and a Boston police officer shot
and killed a pit bull near a park after the dog attacked a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Police and animal control officials are investigating whether
the dogs in the first incident may have had links to gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists who work with pit bulls say that despite their
reputation, the dogs are no more likely to attack than other
breeds, unless they are abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're raised normally, they're very sweet,'' said Karyn
Prestier, an animal caregiver at the MSPCA in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The animal shelter has seen increasing evidence of dogs trained
for fighting, however. ``It's there,'' she said. ``It's
underground, but we know it's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston already has an ordinace requiring dogs with violent
histories to be kept indoor or in pens. But the council's proposed
ordinance would specifically target pit bulls. At the very least,
councilors say fines for owners who don't control their dogs should
be raised from $50 for a first offense to $250.

CONCERNS OVER INTEL'S GROWTH HELP SEND NASDAQ LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks fell broadly Tuesday, sending the
Nasdaq composite index lower. Intel led the decline after an
analyst said that its sales growth would be slower than forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in drug stocks, meanwhile, coupled with the slide in
technology shares, dragged down the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index. But the Dow Jones industrial average posted a gain, despite
the weakness in Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The first day after Labor Day is often seen as a time when
America gets back to business. But traders and analysts were
reluctant to attribute much significance to Tuesday's price action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the strong gains Nasdaq recorded in August, when it was
up 11 percent, the index was clearly vulnerable to profit taking,''
said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 91.15 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,143.18.
Declines in Intel, Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase accounted for
more than one-third of the Nasdaq price drop.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 index slumped 13.69 points, or 0.9 percent, to
1,507.08.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow industrials rose 21.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to
11,260.61, helped by a bullish forecast from Coca-Cola and gains in
stocks like Home Depot and Proctor &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Intel was the most active stock. The shares fell $4.69, to
$69.25, after Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, cut his ratings on the stock to ``buy'' from ``strong
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for sluggish Intel sales brought down shares of
other semiconductor manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Xilinx fell $2.81, to $89.06. And Applied Materials fell 38
cents, to $84.44.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were reluctant to write off Intel, despite the
downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolute fortunes have been lost trying to market-time
Intel,'' said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research
at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. ``This is a buy-and-hold
stock until you know the world is coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom fell $3.19, to $33.75. The company, a long-distance
phone service provider, agreed to buy Intermedia Communications for
about $3 billion in stock and will assume $3 billion in debt to
gain a controlling stake in Digex Inc., which helps to operate Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks fell after an analyst at Banc of America Securities
recommended that investors pare holdings in pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Merck slipped $1.13, to $68.06; Pfizer fell $2.16, to $41; Eli
Lilly declined $2.94, to $69.75; and Pharmacia closed at $56.44,
down $1.94.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola had its biggest one-day gain since June 22, rising
$1.75, to $56. The company said sales should rise 5 percent to 6
percent this year and as much as 7 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena was another drag on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. The company, a
maker of telephone equipment, said it would take a charge against
fourth-quarter earnings because a British customer, Iaxis Ltd.,
probably would not be able to pay its bills. Ciena closed at
$216.33, down $13.80 on the day.
</P>
<P>
   But Niagara Mohawk Holdings rose $1.88, to $15.75, after the
National Grid Group, which owns a power transmission network in
England and Wales, agreed to buy the utility owner for $8.9
billion, or about $19 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utility stocks traded well,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of
block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``There is evidence
the economy might be weaker than we thought it was, so people are
looking for a defensive tilt to their portfolios.''

A CORNER OF NEW FRANCE, ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI

  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The French roots of St. Louis slip into focus at unexpected
moments. On a hot afternoon in May, as a radio announcer was
warning rush-hour commuters that traffic was snarled on Interstate
270 going through Chouteau Island in the Mississippi River, I was
reminded of a time 200 years ago when the river was filled with
flat-bottomed boats laden with furs and skins to be exchanged at
trading posts operated by the Chouteau family.
</P>
<P>
   An evening visit to gracious Demun Avenue also carried me back
to that era. Jules Demun and A.P. Chouteau, cousins by marriage,
set St. Louis abuzz in 1817 when they returned from a trade mission
to Santa Fe to tell of being held in chains by the Spanish
authorities. It took an act of Congress and a treaty with Mexico to
gain compensation for their merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these reminders of the past, only one structure has
survived from the era of the vibrant society created by the French
families who began building St. Louis in 1764: The elegantly
restored Basilica of Saint Louis, King, known as the Old Cathedral,
near the Gateway Arch. Still used for worship, the church, with its
clean lines, subdued tones and scattered touches of the ornate, is
a worthy example of early 19th-century French taste.
</P>
<P>
   In an alcove on the right just inside the main doors hangs an
oil painting of St. Louis praying on the eve of his coronation as
King Louis IX. It was a gift from Louis XVIII in 1818. The
fleur-de-lis decorates the altar cloths, and the altar is flanked
by statues of Joan of Arc and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cathedral was not consecrated until 1834 _ there
were three earlier churches on the site _ just 60 miles south of
St. Louis, along both sides of the Mississippi, a truly remarkable
collection of earlier French buildings has survived. The
centerpiece is Ste. Genevieve, Mo., founded about 1735 as a river
depot for lead and salt.
</P>
<P>
   A thriving community of more than 4,000, Ste. Genevieve today is
a vast museum of French Colonial structures, with some worthy later
examples of German and early American styles as well. Many are open
as historic sites, with others still being restored by preservation
groups. Private citizens are also restoring _ and living in _ some
of the sturdy remains of these houses built by the French pioneers.
All of them are a pleasant walk from the Inn St. Gemme Beauvais,
where I stayed on a visit in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolduc House, an authentically restored French Creole house,
is a gem. Built in 1785 for Louis Bolduc, a Canadian-born fur
trader and lead-mine owner, it includes only a few pieces of Bolduc
family furniture, including an walnut armoire. But the other
furnishings are authentic French Canadian pieces of the era, based
on an inventory left by Louis Bolduc.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolduc House illustrates the construction basics used by the
early French in the area. It's a large, one-story rectangular
building with two rooms separated by a central hall, surrounded on
four sides by covered galleries or verandas _ a practice the French
adopted from the West Indies. The entire house and outbuildings
were surrounded by a stockade of cedar logs. Although Missouri and
Illinois were less dependent on slave labor than Southern states,
the outbuildings on these properties usually included slave
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The post-on-sill construction used for the Bolduc House involved
sinking tree trunks down to a layer of rock and squaring them off
above ground. For some other structures of the time, hard clay soil
provided a firm base. Walls of vertical oak timbers were set six
inches apart and insulated with some combination of horsehair,
manure, clay and straw. The high-peaked, hip-style roof is
supported by heavy oak trusses in a style reminiscent of medieval
France.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to stand on almost any corner in the 20-some
square blocks that make up historic Ste. Genevieve and feel
yourself at the center of life two centuries ago. Emerging from a
house operated as a historic site, on the other three corners of
the intersection one can see houses of the same era, which are
still private homes or businesses. At one such intersection, Second
and Merchant Streets, private historic homes sit flush to the
sidewalk on three corners; on the fourth is what was once the store
and residence of Felix Valle, now operated as a state historic
site.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1818 _ 33 years later than the Bolduc House and 14
years after Missouri became a United States territory _ the Felix
Valle House (French accents have been lost over the years)
represents a significant shift from the vertical-log construction
methods. Crafted of local stone instead of timbers, the handsome
pale structure also has a second floor, which was unusual in
earlier houses.
</P>
<P>
   What impressed me about the Valle house _ when the guide opened
the door to its commercial side _ was seeing the counters and
shelves where Valle and his father before him had received furs,
skins and lead in exchange for goods from Europe and the East.
Having just researched the Chouteau trading company at St. Louis,
including correspondence between the Chouteaus and the Valles, I
could easily envision Felix Valle and his clients talking about the
price of beaver skins in London, the cholera epidemics that so
often swept through these settlements, or the difficulties of
traders wintering among Indian tribes along the river.
</P>
<P>
   The first Valle in Ste. Genevieve _ Francois _ arrived in the
1740s from French Canada, and many of his descendants became
successful, so it was no surprise to find the family's name
attached to another historic house. The Maison Guibourd-Valle, a
two-story Norman truss house with a wide veranda, was built about
1806 for the Jacques Guibourd family, whose fortunes ran low after
three generations. In 1931, the house was sold to Jules Felix
Valle, one of the many descendants of Francois. Jules Felix had
become wealthy as a stockbroker in St. Louis and married a
beautiful showgirl, Anna Marie.

 &HT;    GAO DOUBTS NEED FOR HIGHER FEES FOR NURSING HOMES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's ailing nursing home industry pressed
for a booster shot of Medicare funds Tuesday, even as federal
overseers told the Senate Special Committee on Aging that the
remedy is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Current rates are ``likely to provide sufficient and in some
cases even generous compensation'' by Medicare to nursing homes,
said Laura A. Dummit, a health care cost expert with the U.S.
General Accounting Office (GAO) told the Senate Special Committee
on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, returning for year-end budget work, is considering
adding as much as $2 billion for Medicare services in nursing homes
to respond to a crisis that has sent 10 percent of facilities,
chiefly large chains, into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Industry defenders told the hearing that federal cutbacks in
Medicare two years ago set up the collapse. Charles H. Roadman II,
president of the American Health Care Association, which represents
the chains, said the reductions were $15.8 billion more over seven
years than Congress had intended.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a map showing the bankrupt facilities as red dots
across the country and said that nursing homes were caught in a
``squeeze'' by federal budget cuts, inconsistent state regulators
and private lawsuits alleging abuse and mistreatment of residents.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement submitted to the Senate committee,
Roadman was even more pointed, warning of ``the real potential for
absolute collapse that will put at risk care for all (skilled
nursing home) patients.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1.5 million Americans are served by nursing homes. About
half the costs are paid by Medicaid, about 17 percent is paid by
Medicare, and the rest is paid by private insurance or individuals.
</P>
<P>
   During the high-flying years of the mid 1990s, many of the
for-profit nursing homes aggressively expanded their services and
sought more patients under Medicare, whose loose rules provided
almost unlimited payments for therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare costs soared by 25 percent a year from 1990 to 1998,
and investigations uncovered massive waste, including unneeded
services, and fraud before the payment system was overhauled. With
the end of the prospects for huge profits and heavily in debt from
acquisitions, five of the 10 biggest nursing homes filed for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, offered
little sympathy to the failed companies. ``Most nursing homes
appear to be able to operate under the new system,'' he told the
hearing, which was called to discuss the causes for the
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, R-La., laid the problem at the failed efforts
by the government to ``micro manage'' the health industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this drives me crazy,'' Breaux said. He then asked
Roadman: ``How could an industry not make it with a 25 percent
(Medicare) increase every year?''
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home trade group president, speechless for several
moments, responded that Medicare comprised only ``9 percent of the
partient days and 17 percent of the revenue'' for the facilities
and urged the senator to look at the other problems, such as
underfunding for Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial problems, a Clinton administration
official offered assurance that bankrupt nursing homes are not
falling down in their care.
</P>
<P>
   States have been required to inspect those in bankruptcy, said
Steve Pelovitz, who is overseeing the failing businesses for the
Health Care Financing Administration. He said they have found ``no
systemic problems with those actually operating in bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, who has set a hearing for later this month on problems
in the nationwide inspection system, said after the hearing that
he, nonetheless, was satisfied that HCFA is watching the bankrupt
homes. ``Their heart is in the right place,'' Grassley said of the
federal overseers.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that although the nursing home chains ``gambled''
on getting ever higher government fees and lost, he would back an
increase for Medicare later this month ``to protect the residents''
of nursing homes.

DNC UNVEILS ADS CRITICAL OF BUSH, TEXAS HEALTH CARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic National Committee pounced on a
federal judge's ruling critical of Texas' health care efforts for
poor children in a new television ad attacking Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was unveiled Tuesday as Bush presented his plan for
prescription drug coverage for seniors. It marks one of the
clearest articulations yet of the Gore strategy to force Bush to
run on his Texas record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush record is certainly becoming an issue in this
campaign,'' said DNC National Chairman Joe Andrew, as he introduced
the ad, which the DNC will spend $3 million to $5 million to air.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign called the ad part of a ``$30 million
distortion'' of Bush's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vice President Gore wants to complain about health care in
Texas, then he ought to be complaining about the situation in
America under his watch, because it's worse,'' said Bush spokesman
Dan Bartlett. ``Texas is doing a better job than the nation as a
whole does when it comes to providing health and dental care to
children enrolled in Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is to begin running Thursday in nine states that are
considered up for grabs in November _ including Louisiana and
Arkansas, but not Texas. It also will run in critical Midwestern
states like Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as
Missouri, Washington and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush says he has a plan for children's health care, but
why hasn't he done it in Texas?'' is the opening salvo in the
30-second ad.
</P>
<P>
   From there the spot recites the state's ranking as 49th out of
50 in one study of health care insurance coverage for children.
</P>
<P>
   The ad then alludes to a finding last month by U.S. District
Judge William Wayne Justice. He held that state Medicaid officials
had failed to implement a 1996 agreement to improve health care
services to children such as medical and dental checkups and
transportation to medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so bad a federal judge just ruled Texas must take
immediate corrective action,'' says the narrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush record: It is becoming an issue,'' says the ad's
parting shot.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was timed to begin on the day Bush unveiled his plan to
provide a prescription drug benefit for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC had prepared the ad to run as early as last week, but a
Democratic source said it was held while media reported on
Justice's ruling, which the DNC viewed as a free assault on Bush's
Texas health care record.
</P>
<P>
   One DNC official said a decision was made to wait until news
coverage of the Justice ruling waned before running the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 14 ruling was the latest development in a class action
lawsuit dating to 1993, and filed initially against the
administration of Democratic Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said about 1 million Medicaid children did not get
medical or dental treatment last year, and noted that many Medicaid
families do not know they are eligible for services like dental
checkups.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign has said the judge, appointed in 1968 by
President Johnson, is well-known as a liberal activist. A Bush
spokesman said the ruling focused on ``hyper-technical reporting
and methodology disputes'' in an effort to embarrass Bush.

 UNDATED: Anna Marie.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They moved to Ste. Genevieve and devoted their time and money to
restoring and furnishing the old house. They installed heat,
running water and electricity. After Jules Felix died in 1949, Anna
Marie _ something of an outcast in the genteel town _ traveled and
shopped the world until her own death in 1971. She filled the
house, just a good-size cottage by today's suburban standards, with
museum quality Louis XV, Louis XVI and French Empire pieces, as
well as Venetian mirrors, Queen Anne chests, a 1790 crystal
chandelier and screens from China. She put jade plates around the
light switches and hung portraits of her husband's ancestors on the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   It's all there today, a stunning surprise on a quiet corner of a
quiet river town.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, it was a return to a more austere setting when
I followed the signs through Ste. Genevieve to the ferry and
crossed the Mississippi to Illinois, continued to Bluff Road and
drove south to the Fort Kaskaskia Historic Site. The town of
Kaskaskia (pronounced kass-KASS-kee-ah) was the first capital of
Illinois after statehood in 1818. It was a trading partner of St.
Louis and Ste. Genevieve until it was wiped out by a series of
floods in the late 1800s, and the town and fort are remembered with
the historic site, including a park and relocated cemetery, on
rolling hills overlooking the Mississippi and Kaskaskia Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the handsomely restored home of Pierre Menard,
surrounded by rolling green lawns, gardens and fields. Finished in
1802, it survived the floods because it was on higher ground just
outside Kaskaskia.
</P>
<P>
   Menard, a trader and farmer, was one of the richest and most
appreciated men in French Illinois. A museum on the lower level,
below the floor with the family portraits and period furniture,
displays some remnants of his comfortable life _ like his pocket
watch and a white satin dancing slipper that belonged to one of his
daughters. A woolen carpet on display was woven for the 1825 visit
of the Marquis de Lafayette, when Pierre Menard was seated next to
him at a banquet at Sweet's Hotel in Kaskaskia.
</P>
<P>
   Menard's large family left many footprints. Not the least of
them belonged to a daughter, Therese Berenice, who went out from
Kaskaskia to marry a Chouteau and, with him, found the trading post
that eventually became Kansas City, Mo. Living to nearly 90, she
created her own legends of style and substance _ dragging
loose-living trappers and hunters into the church she built and
using her Paris gowns as shrouds to bury cholera victims.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Menard home, I drove north about 15 miles to Fort de
Chartres, which rises out of farm fields like an ancient mirage
near Prairie du Rocher. This town's name brought to mind that the
French gave us the name we apply to the vast lands stretching from
Ohio to the Rockies _ the prairies.
</P>
<P>
   The fort was the center of French authority, both civilian and
military, in the mid-Mississippi Valley before the Illinois side of
the river passed first to England and later to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today's massive limestone fort is mostly a reconstruction _
having been rebuilt from the 1920s on _ of a fort put up by the
French in the 1750s to replace a wooden stockade. The only original
building is the powder magazine _ there are also a few original
foundations _ but the stone walls and parapets seem authentic.
</P>
<P>
   While Civil War re-enactments are the rage in many parts of the
country, I discovered that the French and Indian War (1754-63) also
draws huge crowds of re-enactors to Fort de Chartres. On the day I
visited, a group of schoolchildren was acting out a battle for
teachers and parents manning video cameras. A teacher told her
charges that the English had proved their general ignorance of
frontier life by wearing red, a color that she said was
particularly distasteful to the Indians, thereby strengthening
their inclinations to sympathize with the blue-coated French.
</P>
<P>
   From her spin on the conflict, you would never know who lost.
</P>

the Cafe de France, 410 Olive St., (314) 231-2204, just five blocks
from the Old Cathedral. The menu features traditional French dishes
_ chateaubriand, pates, escargot. Dinner for four with wine came to
about $200.

U.S. HALTS ELECTION AID   TO HAITI OVER DISPUTED VOTE TALLY 
</HEADLINE>
 . S . -NYT  By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The United States will not send observers or financial
aid to Haiti for that country's presidential elections in November,
a senior American diplomat said on Tuesday, citing the Haitian
government's unwillingness to recalculate the results of recent
legislative elections that gave an overwhelming and disputed
majority to the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Washington will also scrutinize all other development aid to
Haiti to ensure that it does not go directly to the Haitian
government, but through private nongovernmental organizations, said
Luis Lauredo, the American ambassador to the Organization of
American States. And it will review hundreds of millions of dollars
in loans pending before international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The measures were announced during a meeting in Washington of
the OAS, which issued its own critical report of a recent mission
to Haiti that failed to nudge the Haitian government towards
resolving the political crisis. Other countries have repeatedly
criticized the Haitian government for installing a Parliament
chosen in May using a controversial methodology that gave
Aristide's Lavalas Family party 18 of 19 Senate seats. Electoral
observers said that 10 of those seats should have gone to a runoff,
but Haitian electoral officials have rejected their demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent new concrete steps to end the impasse, the United
States will not be able to conduct `business as usual' with
Haiti,'' Lauredo said at Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said that American diplomats
visited Haiti last week to warn Haitian officials _ including
Aristide and his protege, President Rene Preval _ of the impending
measures. Among the points they pressed were the need to reconsider
the contested election results and to name an electoral council
that would have the confidence of the Haitian people.
</P>
<P>
   The last president of the provisional electoral council resigned
and went into exile soon after the May elections, saying he had
been pressured to ratify questionable results.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Haitian government's decision to proceed with the
new Parliament, the first since January 1999, left the United
States with few other options.
</P>
<P>
   While the official could not specify how much money would be
withheld, the United States provided about $25 million for the last
elections. The American refusal to provide financial assistance for
the presidential elections could further hamper the image of
Aristide, who is presumed to be seeking reelection to the office.
``Without aid it is going to cast further doubts on the credibility
of the process,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It would also present logistical problems, because
poverty-stricken Haiti needs to register voters and candidates, set
up polling places and hire poll workers. Many poll workers have yet
to be paid for their work in the May elections, American officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the OAS, said that while
the international community was willing to help foster a dialogue,
the Haitian government needs to show its willingness to
participate.

   HOT HOLIDAY$: Online holiday sales should reach $19.5 billion
this year, technology research firm Gartner Group said Tuesday.
That's an 85 percent increase over last year, when holiday Internet
sales reached $10.5 billion and nearly undid many online retailers
overwhelmed by the crush of first-time buyers. Undaunted, many of
those e-tailers have learned from their mistakes, spending much of
the year improving what happens after the customer clicks the
``buy'' button. Smart move: By the end of this year, e-business
research firm Forrester Research predicts the number of new online
shoppers should hit 11 million.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SEARCHING ON AOL: GoTo.com Inc., a Web search engine that
charges for placement in its listings, said Tuesday it will pay
America Online Inc. $50 million to be featured on the Internet
service provider's Web sites. Searches on AOL.com, Netscape
Netcenter and AOL proprietary sites will return two or three links
from GoTo.com alongside results from AOL's own search engine. Links
supplied by GoTo.com's will be marked as ``sponsored links.''
Companies wishing to be listed on GoTo.com's search engine can
place bids on how much they want to pay for each visitor. The
company with the highest bid is listed first in the search results,
and pays GoTo.com for each click on the link. This is the latest of
several deals AOL has made with Internet companies who want to
drive traffic to their sites.

DESIGN THAT COAXES BUILDINGS OUT OF THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 $ ADV10-NYT  (Attn: Calif., Md.) 
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The term ``contextual'' having become debased by those who
fundamentally despise the whole idea of architecture, the time has
come to speak of ``relational'' design _ buildings that interact
with their surroundings in full dimension instead of dumbly
mimicking the scale and form of their next-door neighbors. We
should think of architecture as a supremely interactive art _ a
participatory medium that transforms configurations of scale,
dimension, shape, proximity, space, time, energy, cultural meaning,
economic value and land use.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, there will be many opportunities to enrich
the vocabulary for talking about architecture in relational terms.
Perhaps the most spirited of these projects is the continuing
development of SPARCity _ Eric Owen Moss' name for the
discontinuous loop of urban development he has been designing for
Culver City, Calif.. (The project is named for the air rights over
the former tracks of a Southern Pacific freight line).
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, Moss, supported by two enlightened clients,
Frederick and Laurie Smith, has been converting abandoned factory
buildings for use by firms specializing in graphic design,
advertising, film production and other post-industrial businesses.
This month, SPARCity reaches critical mass with the completion of
the Stealth Building, as it has become known, the ground-hugging
centerpiece of a newly redeveloped Culver City block. The building
vaguely recalls the bomber's tapered horizontal profile.This is the
authentic New Urbanism _ the productive future of the tattered
industrial center.
</P>
<P>
   The Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., is the first project in the Northeast by
Antoine Predock, the architectural shaman of the American
Southwest. Designed to foster crossdisciplinary experiments in the
arts, the Tang is finished in stone, metal and concrete, and is
surrounded by a circle of white pines. Two giant staircases
converge to form a symbolic crossroads of culture and nature. Not
since the glory days of the Beaux-Arts have we seen such an
extravagant representation of the ascent to Parnassus.
</P>
<P>
   Since no relationship matters more than the unstable links
between older urban centers and the suburbs encircling them, the
most important event this season will be the presidential campaign.
Between now and November, we will find out whether either candidate
has anything substantial to say on urban policy. The past eight
years have seen declining crime rates and increased participation
from the private sector in urban life. But the Clinton
administration wasted the opportunity to invest in housing,
transportation and public space, or to revitalize the urban core as
an economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere have the shortcomings of urban policy been clearer than
in Baltimore, a city that has been at the forefront of innovation
for three decades. Despite urban homesteading, the Harborside
festival marketplace, the Camden Yards ball park and other
initiatives undertaken by the public and private spheres, Baltimore
continues to epitomize the city as a permanent invalid of modern
life. The Student Arts Center, designed by Tod Williams and Billie
Tsien for Johns Hopkins University, adds a new layer to the city's
cultural mix. Intended to bring art into an environment dedicated
to science, the three-winged building creates a new campus
landscape with courtyards, paths and views.
</P>
<P>
   Things are really cooking this year for Zaha Hadid. Her most
ambitious built work to date will open in December. A tramway
station and car park in the French city of Strasbourg, the project
is an infrastructural intervention designed to reduce car traffic
in the central district. Like Peter Eisenman's design for the
Staten Island ferry terminal, Hadid's forms are derived from the
motion patterns of different transportation modes. And what, by the
way, is the status of Eisenman's fine plan?
</P>
<P>
   Not one of these forthcoming projects is ``appropriate.'' Isn't
that great? Like ``contextual,'' the word ``appropriate'' has
ceased to be constructive. Buildings can be good, bad, mediocre or
pointless. But ``appropriateness'' is a useless gauge of
architectural value. Rather, it has become equivalent to the notion
of progress in the postwar decades. It represents the evasion of
responsibility for personal preference. ``Don't hold me
accountable. History made me do it. Peer pressure made me do it.''
Mediocrity loves company.

COMMENTARY: THERE HE GOES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commentariat seems shocked by Gov. George W. Bush's
brazenness in the debate debate. Not only has he casually tossed
aside the longstanding principle that the question of when and how
the candidates will debate should not be a political issue; not
only is he shamelessly insisting that 60 minutes of shmoozing with
Larry King is the moral equivalent of 90 minutes of serious debate
carried on all major networks; but then he turns around and accuses
Al Gore of refusing to debate. What, ask my colleagues, makes him
think he can get away with this? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to anyone who has followed Bush's pronouncements on economic
policy issues _ that is, really looked at what he says, not at how
what he says plays in the polls _ his attempt to pull a fast one on
the debates comes as no surprise. Throughout the campaign Bush has
counted on his personal charm to protect him from awkward questions
about his economic proposals. Why shouldn't he imagine that he can
do the same on this issue?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After all, most reporting accepts Bush's numbers on his tax cut,
which his campaign likes to describe as costing the Treasury $1.3
trillion over the next decade, compared with a projected $2.2
trillion surplus. Few reporters have noticed that that comparison
turns out to be full of sly tricks designed to make the tax cut
look less irresponsible than it is.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trick involves counting $400 billion of Medicare
funds in the budget surplus number, even though the Republican
Congress insists that these funds are in a ``lock-box.'' Another
big trick involves not mentioning that the tax cut will reduce the
rate at which the federal debt is paid down, indirectly costing an
extra $300 billion or so in interest payments. Then there are a
series of little accounting tricks _ a hundred billion here,
another hundred billion there, eventually adding up to real money.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and almost nobody has noticed that Bush's headline number is
also held down by a feature of his plan that will come as a rude
shock if the plan ever becomes law: Millions of taxpayers won't
actually get the tax cuts they think they have been promised,
because they will end up paying the alternative minimum tax
instead.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's number games on taxes pale in comparison with his
breathtaking audacity on Social Security. In case you have been in
hibernation these last six months: Bush has proposed with great
fanfare a partial privatization of Social Security, an idea that
has its virtues (and its vices, but never mind that right now). But
what is his plan? All we know is that he proposes to allow
individuals to invest part of the money they currently contribute
to Social Security, which will reduce the inflow of money into the
Social Security system by $1.3 trillion over the next decade _ and
that he insists he will not cut benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But if contributions are down, and benefits are not, where does
the money come from? Bush hasn't said _ and he insists that he has
nothing more to say. ``My position on Social Security is where it
is,'' he declared a few days ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes, in other words, that he can cover up the absence of
any actual plan to pay for his proposals with sheer bravado. And by
and large he has been getting away with it. How many news reports
have you seen explaining that Bush intends to bolster the Social
Security system with stock market returns? Bush said he had a plan,
and reporters assumed that he meant it _ missing the simple fact
that he has never said a word about bolstering, that the only
specifics we have heard from him will weaken, not strengthen,
Social Security finances. And the public probably still believes
his claim that he has a ``plan to save Social Security.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why, having gotten away with so much already, shouldn't Bush
imagine that he can get away with snubbing the debate commission,
and going on Larry King instead?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A report in The New York Times quoted an unnamed Bush adviser as
declaring: ``We're not stupid. We've been looking at this. Nobody
knows who the commission is.'' In other words, we're not stupid,
but the public is. And Bush's advisers apparently believe _ with
history on their side _ that he can get away with just about
anything if he does it with a twinkle in his eye and a grin on his
face. Or maybe a smirk.

TORY LEADER VOWS TO FIGHT ENCROACHMENT OF EU ON BRITISH
SOVEREIGNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Conservative Party leader, William Hague, set out
100 policy proposals on Tuesday that his party hopes will help it
defeat Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labor Party in the coming
national election.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Believing in Britain,'' the 32-page document stressed
the party's determination to hold off any consideration that
Britain adopt the euro as its currency in common with continental
nations, and it pledged legislation to halt what it said was the
relinquishing of British sovereignty to a ``European superstate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Extraordinarily, the Conservatives will be the only major
party fighting the next election determined to stop the surrender
of our most precious right as a country _ the right to govern
ourselves,'' Hague said.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Labor government of squandering ``the rights and
independence that so many of our countrymen lived for and sweated
for and died for'' and concluded, ``Say whatever else you like
about a Conservative Britain, but at least a Conservative Britain
will still be Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that Blair will call the next election for May, a
date that will mark four years since Labor took power with a huge
majority of 179 seats in Parliament. For three years, Labor has
held onto a lead of almost 20 percentage points over the
Conservatives in voter polls, making Blair the most enduringly
popular prime minister in British history.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of government internal leaks and policy spats in
May and June, and simultaneous moves by Hague associating himself
with emotive populist causes like law and order and blocking asylum
seekers, had brought him within single digits of Blair.
</P>
<P>
   However, new polls now show Labor with the support of more than
50 percent of voters and the Conservatives with less than 30, a
margin that would produce an even larger Labor majority in
Parliament than its landslide win in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Labor appears to have won back its following with renewed
proposals to overhaul the ailing National Health Service and
increase funding for deteriorating public services.
</P>
<P>
   Hague, meanwhile, was obliged during the summer to abandon an
absolute tax-cut pledge and sacrificed credibility as a future
prime minister by giving an interview in August to a men's magazine
in which he claimed he used to drink 14 pints of beer a day as a
young man working on a truck making deliveries to pubs in
Rotherham, the South Yorkshire town where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining Tory leadership in 1997, Hague, 39, has struggled
to free himself from a young fogey reputation stemming from his
having read parliamentary papers, memorized speeches of Winston
Churchill and learned the names and districts of the Tory members
of Parliament, all when he was just 15. He has trimmed his thinning
hair into a fashionable stubble, donned jeans and baseball caps and
slid down amusement park water sluices in a repeatedly unsuccessful
effort to update his image.
</P>
<P>
   On the contentious issue of Europe, Blair has said he is in
favor of the principle of Britain's joining monetary union but will
not schedule a promised referendum on the matter until he is
convinced that entry would be economically advantageous to Britain.
Hague argues that there should be no thought of proposals to adopt
the common European currency whatever the circumstances until at
least the end of the next Parliament, or 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Hague is focusing on Europe as the key issue in the upcoming
election, aware that it is the area of most distinct contrast with
Labor and that polls show two-thirds of the British public opposed
to abandoning the pound for the euro. But his hard-line position
causes him problems in his own party, some of whose more
traditional members said Tuesday they believed in a less
confrontational stance.
</P>
<P>
   A former Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, said the
party was being destabilized by ``rigid Euroskepticism,'' and the
former Foreign Secretary Lord Howe said he found Hague's proposals
to take back powers from Brussels ``deeply disturbing.'' He said
that the European Union could not function ``if every member state
claimed the right to interpret or limit its EU obligations to suit
its own wishes.''

 &UR; BIRDS THAT FLY WHERE BIRDIES FLY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV broadcasts of golf tournaments have been using tapes of
birdcalls recorded elsewhere to prettify live coverage. According
to a Washington Post story forwarded to Personals by  &UR; Alice &LR; 
 &UR; Barnes &LR; , the sounds of a canyon wren (a bird never seen east of
Texas) were heard on the broadcast of the Buick Open tournament
from Michigan, and a white-throated sparrow, a species not heard
during the summer in the South, was broadcast both at the PGA
Championship in Kentucky and during the NEC Invitational in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Producers like bird sounds so much during golf, said  &UR; Leslie &LR; 
 &UR; Ann Wade &LR;  of CBS Sports, that they put birdseed next to
microphones. When that lure is unsuccessful, ``they have used a
(tape) cartridge at one time or another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and NBC denied that they indulged in the bird &LR; - &LR; call fakery,
but the Post says some viewers heard out-of-place birds during
recent ABC broadcasts. ``It's deceitful and overkill,'' birder
 &UR; John Malcolm &LR;  said. ``Just how perfect do they want us to think it
is out there? Why not dub in harp music and rainbows for certain
crucial holes? Besides, it messes up our harmless little hobby,''

<P>
   Feminist leader  &UR; Gloria Steinem &LR; , 66, got married at sunrise
Sunday, Sept. 2, in Oklahoma to entrepreneur  &UR; David Bale &LR; , 61. The
wedding was in the home of Steinem's friend, former Cherokee Nation
chief  &UR; Wilma Mankiller &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It was the first marriage for Steinem _ who once said a spouse
becomes a ``semi-nonperson'' _ and the third for Bale. He is South
African-born, was an anti-apartheid activist and lived much of his
life in England. He moved to Los Angeles in 1990 and met Steinem at
a Voters for Choice benefit there a year ago. Bale's son,
 &UR; Christian Bale &LR; , is an actor who appeared in ``Shaft'' and
``American Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I've worked many years to make marriage more equal, I
never expected to take advantage of it myself,'' Steinem said in an
official release about the marriage. ``I am happy, surprised and
one day will write about it, but for now, I hope this proves what
feminists have always said _ that feminism is about the ability to
choose what's right at each time of our lives.''

AS VOTE ON CHINA TRADE BILL NEARS, SENATE LOOKS TO SMOOTH ITS
PASSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As senators resumed debate on a major bill
establishing permanent trade relations with China, the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, said on Tuesday that he would try to
schedule a final vote by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has delayed consideration of the bill since the House
approved it in May, drawing criticism from Democrats that Lott was
trying to use one of President Clinton's top remaining legislative
priorities as political leverage in the last days of the
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   But with the pro-Republican business community clamoring for
results on a bill that would give a boon to American farmers and
corporations, the foot-dragging is ending. Senators will debate 7
to 10 amendments this week and next before voting on the measure,
which would end Congress' annual review of China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the House, where supporters eked out a victory,
passage in the Senate is all but assured. About 70 senators are
expected to vote for the measure. But with only about five weeks
left before lawmakers leave for the year, supporters say they need
a clean bill, free from amendments that would force the measure
back to the House for a second vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluntly, a vote to amend is a vote to kill this bill and, with
it, any chance that U.S. workers, farmers and businesses will
benefit,'' said Sen. William V. Roth Jr., (R-Del.) who heads the
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest potential obstacle facing the bill is a measure
sponsored by Sens. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) and Robert Torricelli
(D-N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   Their measure, which Thompson said could be offered as an
amendment next week, would require the administration to monitor
China's record on the spread of nuclear, chemical and missile
proliferation. It would impose sanctions on China if there is
evidence of exports of certain type of prohibited weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has sought to modify the bill in response to
administration criticisms that the measure would hurt American
businesses, infringe on the president's authority and focus too
narrowly on China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough senators who feel very strongly that they do
not want to have to go through the House consideration again,''
Lott said on Tuesday. ``On the other hand, China is still doing
some very unsettling things. He's right on the substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicitly acknowledging he may not have the votes, Thompson
said that if his measure failed, he was considering a second
amendment that would simply condemn countries that traffic in
nuclear, chemical or missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
Foreign Relations Committee, said few senators want to vote on
anything that could doom the trade bill. ``There are an awful lot
of Republicans and some Democrats who would like to vote for
Thompson, but they don't want to be responsible for killing this,''
Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's action will overlap with President Clinton's
scheduled meeting on Friday with President Jiang Zemin of China at
the United Nations summit meeting in New York. The White House will
prepare Clinton to telephone senators on specific amendments this
week and next, if necessary, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to Clinton's fiery rhetoric on campaign issues
like education, health care and taxes, he and his top aides are
deliberately keeping a low profile on the China bill to avoid
inflaming Republican critics.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Tuesay, friends and foes of the trade bill
squared off in the first of several days of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, (R-N.C.) a North Carolina Republican who heads
the Foreign Relations Committee and opposes the trade measure, said
the United States should not reward a Beijing government that
intimidates its neighbors, sells sophisticated weapons to America's
enemies and persecutes its own people for their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters like Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) warned
that the ``potential for estrangement and worse'' with China is
still real.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan for the first time suggested that racism might underlie
some of the bill's opposition: ``There is a long and rueful history
in the United States of our racial antagonism to Chinese emigration
to this country, which now appears as an antagonism to the arrival
of Chinese goods.''

 &UR; BIRDS THAT FLY WHERE BIRDIES FLY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV broadcasts of golf tournaments have been using tapes of
birdcalls recorded elsewhere to prettify live coverage. According
to a Washington Post story forwarded to Personals by  &UR; Alice &LR; 
 &UR; Barnes &LR; , the sounds of a canyon wren (a bird never seen east of
Texas) were heard on the broadcast of the Buick Open tournament
from Michigan, and a white-throated sparrow, a species not heard
during the summer in the South, was broadcast both at the PGA
Championship in Kentucky and during the NEC Invitational in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Producers like bird sounds so much during golf, said  &UR; Leslie &LR; 
 &UR; Ann Wade &LR;  of CBS Sports, that they put birdseed next to
microphones. When that lure is unsuccessful, ``they have used a
(tape) cartridge at one time or another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and NBC denied that they indulged in the bird &LR; - &LR; call fakery,
but the Post says some viewers heard out-of-place birds during
recent ABC broadcasts. ``It's deceitful and overkill,'' birder
 &UR; John Malcolm &LR;  said. ``Just how perfect do they want us to think it
is out there? Why not dub in harp music and rainbows for certain
crucial holes? Besides, it messes up our harmless little hobby,''
which is keeping lists of birds during golf tournaments.

</P>
<P>
   Feminist leader  &UR; Gloria Steinem &LR; , 66, got married at sunrise
Sunday, Sept. 2, in Oklahoma to entrepreneur  &UR; David Bale &LR; , 61. The
wedding was in the home of Steinem's friend, former Cherokee Nation
chief  &UR; Wilma Mankiller &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It was the first marriage for Steinem _ who once said a spouse
becomes a ``semi-nonperson'' _ and the third for Bale. He is South
African-born, was an anti-apartheid activist and lived much of his
life in England. He moved to Los Angeles in 1990 and met Steinem at
a Voters for Choice benefit there a year ago. Bale's son,
 &UR; Christian Bale &LR; , is an actor who appeared in ``Shaft'' and
``American Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I've worked many years to make marriage more equal, I
never expected to take advantage of it myself,'' Steinem said in an
official release about the marriage. ``I am happy, surprised and
one day will write about it, but for now, I hope this proves what
feminists have always said _ that feminism is about the ability to
choose what's right at each time of our lives.''

FOR A PRIZE THAT'S OLYMPIAN, CHINA JUMPS THE GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ It seems recently that all of Beijing is flushed with
Olympic fever, busy making preparations. The posters are up at
Beijing International Airport. Commemorative stamps have been
issued. Taxi drivers are learning English to prepare for the influx
of foreign guests. The logo is cropping up on key chains and bumper
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney? Oh no, not that Olympics. Not the one that begins on
Sept. 15 in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking the Summer Olympiad 2008, the games to which
Beijing desperately, desperately wants to play host _ although the
International Olympic Committee will not chose a site for about
another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding the Olympics in 2008 is the common wish of all
Chinese,'' said Beijing's deputy mayor, Liu Jingmin, who is chief
of the bid committee. ``We are confident and full of hope that they
will be held here.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the space-age command center that has been
constructed to mastermind the bid _ an entire floor of a hotel _
Liu walks crisply and with determination past Olympic statues
decked with Beijing's newly designed Olympic logo and huge pictures
of stadiums, real and yet to be built. Teams of engineers pore over
designs submitted by international architects for a new Olympic
village for north Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand why this teeming city with so many day-to-day
problems is investing so much in pursuit of a distant dream, rewind
history a bit: seven years ago, Beijing lost to Sydney by the
slimmest of margins in an effort to hold this year's Olympics. (In
2004, the site will be Athens.)
</P>
<P>
   To the Chinese it was a huge loss of face, the big fish that got
away. And watching Australia basking in Olympic glory now has no
doubt left them itching with desire, determined that no price is
too high to land the games this time, no flaw too small to expunge
in order to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time we only lost by two votes and there was really no
loser, we were just unlucky,'' said Liu. ``But our wish of holding
an Olympics never faded. And compared to 1993, Beijing is much more
competitive now.''
</P>
<P>
   As Liu points out, Beijing has enjoyed strong economic growth
and vast amounts of public construction since 1993 and China has
become far more engaged internationally, moving from a pariah state
still in the shadow of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, to a growing
economic powerhouse that is about to enter the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   And to get the Olympics, Beijing has already essentially
promised a vast speedup in its remodeling of the city, building
three new subway lines and a new highway to ease the city's
horrible traffic. It will also turn 1,235 acres of bare earth into
green space and shoo factories out of the city to improve its now
mostly gray environment and clean up its foul air.
</P>
<P>
   The Bid Committee's official web site
(www.beijing-olympic.org.cn) lists 10 reasons for choosing Beijing,
among them:
</P>
<P>
   --China, which has one-fifth of the world's population, has
never held the event.
</P>
<P>
   --China ranked fourth in medals at the past two summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   --Stable politics and a low crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   --Independent surveys show that 94.6 percent of Beijing's
residents want the Olympics there.
</P>
<P>
   Most Beijingers do seem to want it with a passion, often in part
because they think it will force the government to bankroll and
complete much-needed projects that would otherwise drag on for
years. Twenty environmental groups, some of which are frequently at
odds with the government, have signed on to a ``Green Olympic
Program,'' to help clean up Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I support the bid,'' said Lin Xuezhu, a 36-year-old
cab driver waiting for a customer outside a luxury hotel here.
``The roads will be improved, it will make Beijing more famous and
for me it means more customers _ there's nothing bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his cab company had already begun to teach its
drivers English for the Olympics and that he was eagerly awaiting
his turn. Last month, the Beijing city government began an
``English-speaking campaign'' whose goal is to teach half of all
Beijingers 100 English phrases to prepare for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   With the city government's Olympic obsession mounting,
everything is now evaluated in terms of how it will affect the bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of the Olympics, the police are stopping
bare-chested cyclists and forcing them to don shirts. Some
academics are balking at interviews with foreign journalists for
fear they might say something that could undercut Beijing's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk shows advise people on what they can do to support
the effort: Drivers must not overcharge, by even a penny. Industry
managers must make sure company vans don't pollute. People
shouldn't spit on the ground, a still widespread habit here.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the bid effort got a big push when the International
Olympic Committee announced that Beijing was among the five
finalists for 2008, along with Paris, Toronto, Istanbul and Osaka,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful young women in traditional dress lined the hallway
into a lavish government news conference at a hotel, held to
announce the news and discuss future plans. Chinese reporters
clapped giddily at every answer and state-run media quickly began
dissecting the pros and cons of the competing cities.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in this city of 15 million could get excited
about an event eight years away that will require billions in
government outlays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's great for the country, but it's bad for me,'' said a
scraggly laid-off worker named Wang who was sitting nearby, hoping
to find a customer for his pedicab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already they're telling us you can't drive on this road and
that road _ you look too bad,'' he said. ``If we get the Olympics,
they'll totally shut us out.''

IF ONLY I COULD BE FOREMAN

<P>
   I think most people believe there is a formula for success, and
it goes something like this: You do well in school, you work hard,
you stay focused, you take risks. A good formula, but not the only
one.
</P>
<P>
   Take me. Some chief executives started businesses while in
college, but not me. I spent the bulk of my time as an
undergraduate at the New York University business school in the
1960s shooting pool at a place on 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   After I got my degree, I enrolled in the graduate program. I
never got my M.B.A. though, because I refused to write a thesis. A
thesis is too narrowly focused, and it has nothing to do with real
life _ with the way things really work. I've spent a lifetime
finding out how things work and how you can make them better. That
has been my real education.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, writing a thesis would have interfered with my
recreational activities. I did not even know companies came to
recruit on campus, because they never came to the pool hall. I did
hear the Peace Corps was coming to school, however, and it was the
only job interview I went on. I joined in 1967 and spent two years
in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   One of my assignments there was working with a rural electrical
cooperative. The U.S. government had run power lines through the
region, but we had to convince the villagers to bring the wires
into their homes so they didn't have to use candles. They had never
even seen wires like those. They didn't understand electricity, so
we would go out at night with a generator and a movie projector and
show them a movie about rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
   When I got back from the Peace Corps, I needed a job, so I went
to an employment agency on Fifth Avenue, and they sent me to Allied
Chemical, which became Allied Signal. Again, it was the only
interview I had. I started at $12,000. I told myself I was going to
stay six months, learn everything I needed to, and then leave. I
stayed 30 years, and I tell people that they can conclude I was a
very, very, very slow learner. I left as president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   When Allied Signal merged with Honeywell, my wife and I talked
about what I was going to do next. I could either be a boss again,
go into business in a less-demanding area or spread my time with
family, hobbies, business, sports and charity. I ended up being a
boss again.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, I say I am a frustrated plant manager. I go into a
plant and I want to improve things. I want to know how machines
work, why they work and how I can make them better. Plants are not
about machines, they are about people, how you motivate them and
raise their expectations. When I grow up, I am going to be a plant
manager.
</P>
<P>
   At a plant meeting recently, I told the staff I found a defect
in a furnace at the end of a production line. One person wanted to
know how I found the problem. I simply said, ``I asked.'' The
employees were afraid I would be mad, but I said no, now we can get
to work and figure out how to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   One of my sons goes to a school in Connecticut for the learning
disabled. I am on the board of this school, as well as my other
son's. I am also on the board for the National Center of Learning
Disabilities. A tremendous number of people have learning
disabilities, and this organization is important to me. Being a
good boss does not end at work.
</P>
<P>
   We are building a house right now, and my 16-year-old wants a
pool table. I told him, no, you will get bad habits. You'll turn
out like your dad.

 &HT;    Hip-hop film mostly fury, little insight
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's truth to the title ``Backstage.'' The new
behind-the-scenes film about the 1999 Hard Knocks Life tour is less
a documentary than a home movie, intercutting stage-show clips with
endless bad-boy behavior. We watch the hip-hop stars playing dice,
smoking endless blunts and getting lap-danced by groupies happy to
take their tops off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're gonna be a star,'' one rapper tells one breast-baring
girl, shortly before coercing her into a bathroom stall for some
quick sex.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``Backstage'' doesn't pull any punches. It never
tries to show its rapping crews as misunderstood artists. As Kevin
Liles, president of Def Jam Records, puts it, ``It's all about
getting the (expletive) money.''
</P>
<P>
   The musicians make no bones about their rough backgrounds,
including DMX, who ``epitomizes the have-nots,'' in the words of
one colleague. Many of the guys came to rap after years of dealing
drugs. Their goal is to get the multimillion-dollar home, a garage
full of Bentleys, security for their families ... and try to not
wind up a statistic, like slain rappers Tupac Shakur and the
Notorious B.I.G.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, first-time feature director Chris Fiore doesn't
try to probe his subjects' backgrounds or put the tour into the
larger context of hip-hop history.
</P>
<P>
   There is a no-rules circus atmosphere to the tour as it winds
across the country, starting with the initial attention from
journalists who wonder how so many rappers packed into three buses
can keep their egos (and anger) in check. In the words of DJ
Scratch, ``Everybody's waiting for something bad to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing really does in ``Backstage,'' except for a tiff between
Damon Dash, co-founder of Roc-a-Fella Records, and Liles. That
happens when Liles hands out Def Jam jackets, and Dash berates him
for making it seem that the tour is solely fronted by his record
company. Dash gets more screen time than some of the stars, who
include Jay-Z, Method Man and Beanie Siegel. The fact that he's the
movie's producer lends it the whiff of a vanity production, and
sometimes ``Backstage'' seems like nothing more than a long
commercial for the musicians it features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   A hip-hop documentary. Rated R for strong language, nudity and
drug content. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A high-energy but incomplete backstage documentary.

 &HT;    `Turn It Up' tunes out possibilities
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on ``Ghetto Supastar,'' both the CD and young-adult novel
by hip-hop star Pras (aka the Fugees' Prakerzel Michel), ``Turn It
Up'' is a flashy, loud urban thriller that wants to critique the
guns-and-bullets world of thug life, while at the same time
reveling in its perks (jewelry, sharp clothes, accommodating
women). It's a cautionary tale that isn't quite sure what it wants
to caution the audience about.
</P>
<P>
   Pras stars as Diamond, an aspiring musician who's struggling
with best pal Gage (fellow rapper Ja Rule) to cut his first CD.
They finance the enterprise as couriers for a drug lord (Jason
Statham of ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''), so when
they're not cutting tracks, they're often dodging bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Like the documentary ``Backstage,'' ``Turn It Up'' takes for
granted that guys like Diamond and Gage have only these two options
to get ahead: moving dope or bustin' rhymes. Diamond's mom and his
girlfriend (Patricia Velasquez) voice some skepticism, but in a
movie that views its female characters as little more than scenery,
their opinion doesn't carry much weight.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling figure is Vondie Curtis-Hall's turn as
Diamond's estranged dad, himself a musician who introduces his son
to the pleasures of music that's not entirely synthesized. The
actor has such charisma, he practially obliterates Pras in their
scenes together.
</P>
<P>
   Pras comes across less an actor than a presence. His character
can seem maddeningly passive, especially as Gage comes up with
bigger (and dumber) risks to finance their time in the recording
studio. In his feature debut, director Robert Adetuyi (who also
scripted) never quite finds a coherent tone, any more than the
script ever gets its moral bearings. He offers flashy shootout
scenes, and a Tarantino-lite interlude of threatened torture with a
deli meat slicer. But a few too many dialogue scenes, often between
Pras and Velasquez, play flat and airless.
</P>
<P>
   The movie occasionally loses its grip on characters and plot.
Curtis-Hall is virtually dropped from the movie's last reel, and
his character never quite achieves the importance it seems to
deserve. It's in keeping with the movie's flip-flop values that
when one of the main characters gets shot, we never see if he
survives or dies. Instead, the final moments are spent glorifying
the very person whose rash actions caused all the problems in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn It Up'' has moments of power and a sense of
off-the-streets urgency, but its strengths are too often squandered
on cheap theatrics. The movie raises interesting issues, such as
empowerment through music, and how hip-hop has become the magic
carpet out of the ghetto (in the way of sports). But as soon as an
idea worth pursuing pops up, the plot shoots it down in a literal
hail of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn It Up''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pras, Ja Rule, Vondie Curtis-Hall. One hour, 23
minutes. Rated R for strong violence and language and for some drug
content.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An urban thriller too busy firing bullets to
examine its own interesting dramatic premise.

BIOPURE COMPLETES FIRST SYNTHETIC-BLOOD TRIAL GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biopure Corp. is expected to announce Wednesday that it is the
first company to complete enrolling patients in a pivotal US
clinical trial that compares the safety and efficacy of a
hemoglobin-based blood substitute to red blood cell transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company enrolled 680 patients undergoing
orthopedic surgery at 50 hospitals and medical centers in the
United States, Europe, Canada, and South Africa. Half received a
transfusion of red blood cells; half received Hemopure, the
company's blood substitute.
</P>
<P>
   An independent panel, appointed to review the patients' medical
data during the enrollment and ensure the safety of patients in the
study, found no reason to stop or change the design of the clinical
trial, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The study will be completed in mid-October after all of the
patient data has been collected. The results of the study will be
released sometime before mid-2001, when the company expects to
apply for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This development has been a long time coming, and we feel
confident that the results from this pivotal trial are going to be
positive,'' said Carl Rausch, Biopure's chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company began enrolling patients in the pivotal trial in
March 1999. It began testing Hemopure in earlier studies almost
eight years ago. To date, more than 1,300 patients have been
enrolled in a total of 22 trials. In these trials, Hemopure has
been given to more than 750 patients. In addition to studying its
use in orthopedic surgeries, the company is also testing it for use
in stabilized trauma situations and other surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   If Hemopure is approved by the FDA, Rausch said, it could be
used as a safe alternative for donated blood and ease the strain on
the nation's already overtaxed blood banks.
</P>
<P>
   The US blood supply is chronically low. American blood banks are
expected to come up about 250,000 units short this year. Donated
blood is only good for 42 days, and less than 5 percent of eligible
donors give blood.
</P>
<P>
   American Red Cross Blood Services for the New England Region
supplies hospitals in Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, and New
Hampshire with more than 350,000 units of blood each year. The
organization has found it increasingly difficult to meet demand,
said its medical director, Dr. Mary O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been searching for a good alternative for years,''
O'Neill said. ``It would be wonderful in emergency situations or
when you can't get compatible blood for a patient. But it wouldn't
eliminate the need for blood donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Red blood cells carry the body's oxygen. When people lose large
amounts of blood, their oxygen supply is threatened. Although
Hemopure and other blood substitutes do not replace red blood
cells, they do carry oxygen when those cells are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its ability to deliver oxygen, Rausch said, Hemopure
potentially could be used in combination with red blood cell
transfusions as well as in situations for which red blood cells are
not well-suited. Hemopure can be stored for up to 36 months and is
compatible with all blood types.

THE EXTRAORDINARY ADOLESCENCE OF CAMERON CROWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 By BILL DESOWITZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ For Cameron Crowe, it has always been
about rock 'n' roll. That has been the story of his life and work,
starting with his precocious stint as a teen-age journalist with
Rolling Stone magazine in the '70s, right on through his current
filmmaking career as a writer and director. In all his films _ from
``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' (his impressive 1982 screenwriting
debut), which details the normal adolescence he never had, to
``Almost Famous'' (his newest and most autobiographical film),
which describes the extraordinary adolescence he truly had _ rock
helps people come of age.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fast Times,'' it's about making out to the second side of
Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album; in ``Say Anything'' (1989),
his directorial debut, it's about losing your virginity while
listening to Peter Gabriel's ``In Your Eyes'' and losing your adult
inhibitions while listening to Steely Dan's ``Rikki Don't Lose That
Number''; in ``Singles'' (1992), it's about falling in love while
listening to your entire record collection; and in ``Jerry
Maguire''(1996), it's about releasing your fears while listening to
Tom Petty's ``Free Fallin.''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Almost Famous,'' which opens Wednesday, rock is a
religion. For the winsome William Miller (Patrick Fugit in a
poignant debut), Crowe's 15-year-old protagonist and alter ego, it
begins with glimpsing his entire future while listening to the
Who's rock opera ``Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock,'' Crowe says, quoting a line from the film, ``is your
other friend in the room.'' Crowe even thinks and speaks in terms
of rock: ``This movie is like my greatest hits,'' he says recently
while eating a hamburger in his memorabilia-filled Santa Monica
office. ``But the execution is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Almost Famous'' becomes deeply personal, as Crowe, 43,
recounts his first writing assignment for Rolling Stone in 1973:
going on the road with an American band (in this case the fictional
Stillwater) and as a result missing most of his senior year of high
school in San Diego. Through it all, he explores his youthful
impressions of the rock 'n' roll circus; his tender friendship with
the acid-tongued (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman); his first
infatuation, with a mesmerizing groupie called Penny Lane (Kate
Hudson); and his difficult but loving relationship with his overly
protective mother (Frances McDormand). Although the script had been
kicking around since the late '80s in one form or another, Crowe
kept it under wraps. It wasn't time, he wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   What he was really waiting for, he says, was ``a body of work''
to give him confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Jerry Maguire,'' his breakthrough hit, and the rare
opportunity to conduct a series of lengthy interviews with the
legendary director Billy Wilder (published late last year as
``Conversations With Wilder'').
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the Q &AMP; A with Wilder (whom Crowe worships as the
master of bittersweet truth) helped him to finally tell his
personal story about the liberating impact of rock. He wooed the
cagey and elusive Wilder, and got him to open up, by befriending
him _ which was his way as a rock journalist. Now it was time to
bare his soul on film.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's more Francois Truffaut in ``Almost Famous'' than
Billy Wilder. Not surprising, considering that the French director
is a more appropriate model for a filmmaker dealing with the pain
and exuberance of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to recognize this, either. In the very
first scene, in which Crowe stages his mother's attempt to persuade
him to grow up and be like Atticus Finch in ``To Kill a
Mockingbird,'' there's a theater in the background showing ``Stolen
Kisses'' _ Truffaut's 1968 masterpiece about the coming of age of
Antoine Doinel, his alter ego. From the outset, Crowe not only
wants us to know that his aspirations went beyond his mother's
(though he too cherishes ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and pays homage
to it with a nostalgic tableau in the opening titles, but that
William is his Antoine Doinel.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, the very title, ``Almost Famous'' _ which
Crowe resisted until after the film was completed and DreamWorks
made him come up with something better than ``Untitled'' _ evokes
Truffaut as well. It sums up the state of grace one finds in early
Truffaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the theme of my movies: the victory of the battered
idealist in a cynical world,'' Crowe says.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no mere homage; it's a genuine and euphoric
coming-of-age story that captures the early-'70s rock scene through
the eyes of a buoyant insider: the music, the touring, the
groupies, the glamour, the camaraderie. And the loneliness. Rock
can be a circus of disappointments as well as dreams _ which is why
William suffers the pangs of unrequited love and hero worship when
he gets too close to the people he's writing about.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Crowe defends his cozy interview style despite the
journalistic compromises it entails. He says he has gained valuable
trust and deeper insight as a result of having befriended the
people he has covered. He comes off as sweet, sincere and
unassuming. He's still the enthusiastic fan, whether the subject is
music or movies. Though his personality comes through in all of his
films, in ``Almost Famous'' we get the complete persona, through
William.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crowe's biggest fear was that his alter ego would come
off as too much of an observer. ``I always found that the people
who come in like gangbusters or with their big theories _ `I'm
going to play the role of your interrogator and I'm damn good at
it!' _ make the situation more about themselves than the subject,''
he explains. ``So I always wanted to blend into the woodwork. Why
not be the one guy the band trusts to write about what's really
going on? Which I did. For me it was always about writing about
people I wanted to spend time around.''
</P>
<P>
   But William is much more than an observer; he is the heart of
the film, and it is through his eyes that the audience learns how
he and Stillwater overcome their growing pains. Unlike the Allman
Brothers Band, the real, hugely popular group Crowe first covered
in 1973, Stillwater is an average band on the rise with lots of
promise. Billy Crudup, in his most endearing role plays the band's
guitarist, while Jason Lee plays the likable lead singer. Their Led
Zeppelin-like clash of egos and flirtation with stardom threaten to
destroy the band, but William, playing guardian angel, reminds them
of the joy that drew them to rock in the first place. In return,
Stillwater becomes his wings over America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie's about how society changes around '73, when
everything else is changing too, in music and movies,'' Crowe says.
``It was becoming that much less personal. Corporate takeover,
marketing. Less and less for one person and more for global
audiences. Stadium concerts, everything becomes huge.''
</P>
<P>
   To provide material for the band, Crowe collaborated on a
half-dozen songs with his wife, Nancy Wilson, of Heart. The result
is a cross between the Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd. ``These are guys
who came from somewhere else to L.A., who have built a following by
playing a lot. I took Billy aside and played him a rare Bruce
Springsteen track called `The Promise' about a garage band. I told
him, `That's Stillwater.' Almost famous, almost there, bubbling
below the radar.''

SANTA MONICA, Calif.: below the radar.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Almost Famous,'' Crowe defines the music of this era as a
means of escape as well as a way of connecting with people. Most of
the behemoths of the period are present on the soundtrack (the Who,
Yes, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Rod Stewart, Black Sabbath), but
the spirit of the film resonates more closely with the melancholy
music of Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Todd Rundgren and Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   John's ``Tiny Dancer,'' an early ballad about falling in love
with the ``seamstress for the band,'' holds the most personal
appeal. It occurs on the film's soundtrack at a pivotal moment,
when Stillwater seems on the verge of breaking up. The mood on the
tour bus is somber. Then the song fortuitously comes on the radio
and everyone slowly joins in, smiling and surrendering to the
plaintive melody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on my first date in '71, and we went to see Elton in San
Diego,'' Crowe remembers. ``A date that did not go well. He was so
connected to those songs. He became the sound of doomed romance and
love, because I knew I wasn't going to get this girl, and there was
Elton singing and playing the piano. `Tiny Dancer' came out and
that piano intro reminded me of that concert and that girl. And it
was always a part of this story that I wanted to write. We could've
lost every other song in this movie but `Tiny Dancer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The adolescent Crowe ultimately did lose his heart to the
groupie depicted in ``Almost Famous'' (though her real name isn't
Penny Lane). She ran her own charm school for groupies (called
``band aids'' by Crowe), emphasizing the love of music even more
than the glamour. In the film, the impish Lane conveys elegance,
street smarts, sexuality and vulnerability. Crowe says Hudson
eerily captures the cool facade of the era, calling her a cross
between her mother, Goldie Hawn, and Claudette Colbert. In the
film, William is drawn to Lane's seductive flamboyance and she to
his refreshing honesty and capacity for intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like an autobiographical film to shed
significant light on a body of work. ``Little bits of this story
get told through every one of my movies, except the events
involving my personal family,'' Crowe says. ``They're all
coming-of-age movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jerry Maguire,'' the sports agent played by Tom Cruise
tries to carry on the idealism of his wise old mentor while
battling his obsession with success (``Show me the love'' versus
``Show me the money'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Singles,'' two couples (Kyra Sedgwick and Campbell Scott,
Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon) rediscover the joy of their
relationships after a series of disillusioning distractions.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Say Anything,'' Crowe's favorite of his films, John Cusack
and Ione Skye find refuge together in their own secret world, while
John Mahoney, who plays her amiable but secretive father, learns
about openness from the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really caught something with Cusack,'' Crowe says. ``He saw
the anger in his character, and I tried to temper it, making him
more lovable. The collaboration brought out the best in both of us.
We were both so stubborn. I try to play the Cusack role myself
sometimes, to air out the sweetness. I guess the goal is to bring
the ghost of John into the room when I'm writing and directing as
much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe achieves a different sort of truth in depicting his mother
and Lester Bangs, who died in 1982. They are really the soul of
``Almost Famous,'' because they nurture William's sense of purpose
and keep him anchored in reality. McDormand plays Elaine as caring,
concerned and cool. In fact, in this celebration of uncool, she is
the only cool character, as a result of her self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   She may be clueless about rock, but she can quote Goethe and
spout lines like ``Adolescence is a marketing tool.'' She can also
go to pieces on the phone when she's lonely, yet admit to her son
how much she loves him.
</P>
<P>
   Bangs is a whole other story. He curses the death of rock with
his rueful ruminations and warns William not to become friends with
the band, but as the film wears on he's reduced to a lonely man
living with his records. ``The only true currency in this bankrupt
world is what we share with someone else when we're uncool,'' Bangs
confides to William.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so remarkable about Cameron is that he gets to the
truth about so many people in this picture through a knowledge of
cynicism and a way of working through it,'' says the filmmaker
James Brooks, who has mentored him as a director. ``This is the
gold ring _ to make something this personal and yet so
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crowe has also cut a version that runs 45 minutes longer
than the one that will show in theaters _ and that captures a
completely different mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot about letting the music play, and you feel the
length of the tour,'' he says. ``But at two hours, you're left
wanting more in a good way with the release version. It's actually
more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry; Crowe promises that the longer version, called
``Untitled,'' will find its way onto the DVD next year, alongside
``Almost Famous.'' ``It's like the bootlegs I buy at the swap meets
with the longer tracks on it. If you like it, bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   And bring on his next film, ``Vanilla Sky,'' a love story
reuniting him with Cruise. Crowe describes ``Vanilla Sky'' (which
will also star Penelope Cruz and will begin filming in November) as
a complete departure from his coming-of-age stories. He bristles at
the notion that it has taken him too long to confront more adult
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come of age,'' he says. ``It's time to sort of move on. I
have kids now, and there's something challenging, as a writer, to
tell yourself, `Even if you love those kinds of stories, you've got
to push yourself and build other muscles.' I still want to make
movies about adults and adult problems. I want to try other stuff
out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to redesign Medicare
and offer drug benefits to the elderly puts him squarely in line
with his party's drive to reshape the program by reducing the role
of government, increasing the role of insurance companies and
giving elderly people more choices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is also meant to serve an important political
purpose: to fend off attacks by Democrats who contend that Bush has
no true commitment to elderly people squeezed by rising drug costs.
Elderly Americans, long a key part of the Democratic coalition, are
considered a critical swing vote this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Democrats, Vice President Al Gore sees Medicare as one
of the greatest achievements of American social policy, and
basically approves of the course it has followed since its creation
35 years ago. Bush, by contrast, sees Medicare as a prime example
of government regulation run wild.
</P>
<P>
   With his proposal, which he outlined in a speech Tuesday in
Pennsylvania, Bush has set the stage for a reprise of the health
care battles of the last decade, revolving around a fundamental
question: Do voters fear the government or the insurance industry
more?
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore proposals would both offer some assistance
with drug costs to all beneficiaries, but by no means would they
relieve the elderly of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says that under his plan, the government will pay all
pharmaceutical costs after a beneficiary spends $4,000
out-of-pocket on drugs in a year. Bush says that under his
proposal, the government will pick up all costs after a beneficiary
spends $6,000 on health care of all types.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would pump much more money into Medicare and drug benefits
for the elderly in the coming decade. But Bush's proposal would
cost far more than a bill passed by the House in June to offer drug
coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says his plan would offer assistance more quickly because
he would offer money to the states _ $12 billion a year for four
years _ to provide immediate assistance to people with low incomes.
Twenty-three states, including New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, have programs to provide such assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, described the
difference this way: ``Governor Bush would provide seniors with
options and choices. Vice President Gore focuses on a
one-size-fits-all solution to the need for drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services,
insisted that the uniformity of premiums and benefits under the
Gore plan was a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Bush plan, there would be wide variations across the
country,'' said Shalala, serving as spokeswoman for the Gore
campaign. ``It simply is not a Medicare benefit. It's not available
to everyone in every part of country at the same price.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Shalala argued, ``George Bush suggests seniors have a
big problem with the bureaucracy of the Health Care Financing
Administration,'' the agency that runs Medicare. ``What they really
have a problem with is the bureaucracy of HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   A summary of Bush's plan, issued by his campaign headquarters,
indicates that drug benefits would be offered to Medicare
recipients in the original fee-for-service program, as well as to
those in HMOs. All health insurers in Medicare, including
government-sponsored plans, ``will have to offer an expanded
benefit package, including outpatient prescription drug coverage,''
the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer, the spokesman for Bush, said: ``Under Governor Bush's
proposal, the existing standard Medicare benefit package would be
expanded for the first time to provide prescription drugs for those
who remain in the fee-for-service program. You would not have to
leave Medicare to get prescription drug benefits. But you would be
free to shop around, choose and compare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan was praised by insurance industry executives.
Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association
of America, said, ``I think it's a serious proposal that will help
make prescription drugs more affordable for those most in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, which represents health maintenance organizations,
said her industry could ``play a role, definitely, in delivering
this benefit,'' though it needed to be paid more by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and Democrats were just as quick to
criticize. Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
consumer advocacy group, said the record of HMOs and other private
insurers in delivering drug coverage to the elderly was ``at best
spotty.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the broader market-oriented changes contemplated by Bush,
Pollack said, ``We fear that this would wither away the
fee-for-service system that five out of six seniors depend on
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush's plan achieves its political purpose may depend
less on its specific details than on how skillfully he marshals
facts, figures and arguments in support of it _ both in televised
debates and his campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In drafting his proposal, Bush drew heavily on ideas developed
by a federal advisory commission headed by Sen. John B. Breaux,
D-La., and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to use private industry, including insurance
companies and HMOs, to deliver drug benefits and other medical
services to the elderly. But the government would still pay most of
the costs, and it would supervise insurers, approving or
disapproving all plans. In essence, it envisions a vast expansion
of the role of HMOs, which now provide coverage to 6.2 million of
the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's approach relies more on the traditional Medicare program
to deliver drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates agree that drug benefits should be voluntary
_ an option available for an extra charge. Under Bush's proposal,
the government would pay at least 25 percent of the cost of
premiums for drug coverage, even for the most affluent
beneficiaries. Under Gore's proposal, the government would pay at
least 50 percent of the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription drug issue looms large politically because it
is a top concern of a critical constituency _ the elderly, and the
generation aging just behind them. Republican strategists said
Tuesday that Bush's proposal had fundamentally changed the debate,
which had taken its toll in recent weeks on his support among older
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female seniors will be critical to this election,'' said Linda
DiVall, a Republican pollster. ``Bush has been performing well with
them, but he's fallen off in the last couple of weeks. I think this
plan will allow him to be competitive with them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who also works for the
pharmaceutical industry, said: ``Now, there's a legitimate debate
about which plan is better. That's a very different debate, with
significant merits on the side of what Governor Bush has
introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats argued that Bush's plan had huge vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors are looking for the reassurance of guaranteed coverage
under a Medicare system they fundamentally trust,'' said Geoff
Garin, a Democratic pollster. The private sector marketplace that
Bush envisions is ``an abstraction and an unknown quantity that
provides no comfort or reassurance to seniors,'' he said.

 &HT;    Parents to ask school board to ban Scout activities
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Years ago Carole Benowitz thought she
had a real Scouting family _ she was a Cub Scout troop leader, her
father had a coveted Silver Beaver Scouting award, and her son was
a Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Her gay son.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Benowitz and others will ask the Palm Beach County
School Board to prohibit Boy Scouts from using schools for
recruitment and meetings because the Scouts exclude gays from their
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using public property to discriminate, and this should
not be allowed,'' said Benowitz, Gulf Coast coordinator for PFLAG,
an organization of parents of gay and lesbian children. ``Gay kids
should have the same rights as other children.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely school board members will take any action at this
time, but principals should be told they can't ``endorse'' the Boy
Scouts, said Cynthia Prettyman, general counsel for the school
district. This year's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the Boy
Scouts to exclude gays basically permits them to discriminate
against gay students and teachers _ and that violates the
district's own nondiscrimination policies, Prettyman said.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean the Boy Scouts can't use the schools, but the
troops should be charged the regular $10-an-hour rental fee, she
said. ``We can't appear to be supporting them,'' she said. ``If we
do, we're violating a policy that the school board adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Many principals waive rental fees for the Scouts because they
provide after-school activities for their students, said interim
schools Superintendent Ben Marlin. Just last week, the Boy Scouts
signed up 2,562 new Scouts during an annual ``School Night for
Scouting'' at more than 80 elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a group of people who do a lot of good stuff,'' said
Marlin of the Scouts. ``The question is: Should they be charged?''
</P>
<P>
   School board member Paulette Burdick said Tuesday she wants the
district to stop training teachers in the use of a character
education curriculum that she believes was written with the help of
Boy Scouts. But Burdick said she wouldn't kick Scouts out entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are aspects that I don't philosophically agree with, but
they are providing programs for our children,'' she noted. ``I
would hope Boy Scouts of America would work with communities and
school districts to change. I think there's enough community
pressure right now to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Directors of the United Way of Palm Beach County also are
considering how they will deal with the agency's $118,000
contribution to the Boy Scouts, as is the Palm Beach Community
Chest/United Way for its $62,000 allocation.

 &HT;    Gore previews wide-ranging economic plan
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio - Democrat Al Gore previewed a wide-ranging
economic plan Tuesday aimed at keeping America's good times rolling
and making sure the prosperity touches those who have been left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's plan, which he said he would implement if
elected president, calls for:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Retiring the $5.6 trillion national debt by 2012 by balancing
the federal budget each year and using the annual surplus to reduce
debt accumulated over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Putting annual Social Security and Medicare budget surpluses
in ``lock boxes,'' assuring that there would be enough money to
keep Social Security solvent for 50 years and Medicare afloat for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Doubling the number of American families with savings of
$50,000 or more by offering them ``retirement plus'' savings
accounts, in addition to Social Security, in which the federal
government would match personal savings with tax credits. The tax
incentives would be greatest for families with annual incomes below
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gore even unveiled his plan, U.S. Rep. John Kasich,
R-Westerville, House Budget Committee chairman, was tearing it
apart on behalf of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling presentations, held at nearby locations in downtown
Columbus, highlighted a frantic week of Ohio presidential
campaigning that emphasize the importance both sides place on the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will be at Cleveland State University today to lay out his
economic plan in detail. Tuesday night, after arriving in
Cleveland, he campaigned briefly with fans on their way to Jacobs
Field for the Indians game. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., Gore's
vice presidential running mate, was in Toledo on Monday. Bush is
expected in the Dayton area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No state is more important than Ohio,'' Gore said in his
meeting with reporters from Ohio newspapers with whom he previewed
his economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting followed Gore's appearance at a downtown Columbus
technology marketing company housed in a former plow factory that
was aimed at emphasizing his commitment to technology as an
economic development tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement I've felt in this room is what we need to make
our economy what it needs to be,'' Gore, accompanied by former U.S.
Sen. John Glenn, told several hundred employees and guests gathered
in the fourth floor of the brick building.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that retiring the national debt will mean ``lower
interest rates'' and ``stronger economic growth.'' He faulted Bush
for not setting a timetable for retiring the debt.
</P>
<P>
   He also contrasted his ``lock box'' plans for the Social
Security and Medicare surpluses with what he said was Bush's plan.
The Texas governor's proposed across-the-board tax cuts would take
``billions'' of dollars from Medicare, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has projected a $2.2 trillion
budget surplus over the next 10 years, including $360 billion in
Medicare surpluses and a separate, additional $2.3 trillion Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that his ``retirement plus'' savings plans are in
addition to Social Security, in contrast to Bush's plan, which
calls for allowing younger workers to invest part of their Social
Security savings in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that for families with incomes below $30,000, the
federal government would match savings of $500 with a tax credit of
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's an offer you can't refuse,'' said Gore, dressed for
the high-tech crowd in a black and white checked coat, knit shirt
opened at the collar and khaki pants.
</P>
<P>
   Families earning between $30,000 and $60,000 would get a $1 tax
credit for each dollar saved, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put $1,000 in a savings account, the federal government
will match it one for one with another $1,000 (tax credit),'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, coming off his Labor Day weekend campaign marathon,
misspoke during the meeting about the incentives the federal
government would provide to families with incomes above $60,000. He
said families in that wage bracket who put $500 in a savings
account would get a $1,500 tax credit _ the same as the low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore aides corrected the information and said families
earning more than $60,000 would get only a $500 tax credit to match
savings of $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   In amounted to what was a GOP response, Kasich, considered a
leading force in balancing the federal budget, blasted Gore for
``employing an amazing tactic by buying people's votes with their
own money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with the surplus? Gore wants to spend it. We
want to use it for a broad-based tax cut and give some back to the
people,'' Kasich said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gore's plan would only empower Washington lobbyists
and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, however, that he really wants to empower Americans
who have been left out of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied. We need to do much better. How do we do
better? ... The big limiting factor today is job training and
education. I think we need to do a much better job of getting
skills made available to people who need them,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Ned Hill of Cleveland State University said Gore's
economic plan could work but cautioned that it is based on
optimistic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It essentially assumes there will be no real increase in
government spending which, of course, Congress is paying no
attention to lately,'' said Hill, senior research fellow at the
university's Urban Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan also ``assumes there is going to be no recession. It
assumes welfare reform continues on its path,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hill said, Gore has come up with a proposal that ``brings
the numbers together in a coherent whole. Bush hasn't done that
yet.''

CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS GO ON THE OFFENSIVE IN PUSHING THEIR
AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats took the offensive Tuesday and said they
would remain on Capitol Hill as long as necessary this year to push
their agenda, from overhauling managed care to bumping up the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we going to hold the bar high enough, we're also
going to ensure that we have the time it takes to address these
issues,'' Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, warned shortly
after a meeting with President Clinton at the White House. ``And
we're in no hurry to go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senate Republican leaders were drawing their
own line in the sand, saying they would not approve a rise in the
minimum wage without accompanying tax cuts for small businesses and
assuring that a Democratic bill to overhaul managed health care
would go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   And in a turnaround, Senate Republican leaders also pushed a
revised bill on prescription drugs, written by Sen. William V. Roth
Jr. of Delaware, that had gained little traction in July, a sign
both of the issue's potency among voters and of perceptions that
Roth is vulnerable in his campaign for re-election. The legislation
would immediately make drugs more affordable for the low-income
elderly, independently of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats propose a measure to help all of the elderly pay some
of the costs of prescription drug coverage. House Republicans have
already passed their own separate bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do it in such a way that it doesn't cause major
problems for Medicare,'' said Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader.
``The president wants to subsidize it for everybody. And he wants
to do it, and Al Gore wants to do it, without any Medicare changes.
That is a major problem. That's like putting more passengers on the
Titanic as it's headed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Daschle, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and other
Democrats met Tuesday at the White House to discuss strategy for
closing out the congressional session before the November election.
Congress is officially scheduled to break on Oct. 5, a target date
that is likely to come and go.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the strategy appears simple: Push the Democratic
agenda, criticize Republican tax cuts as too expensive and hold the
Republicans' feet to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democrats were unlikely to embrace Roth's
prescription drug bill. ``We are unwilling to accept a bill that
does not meet at least the minimum criteria,'' he said. ``We've
said it had to be universal.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would push for another vote on a bill to overhaul
managed care that Democrats favor and that has already passed the
House. The bill could pass the Senate this time around, with the
arrival of Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., who replaced the late Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   As for minimum wage, Daschle expressed reservations Tuesday
about a Republican proposal to include tax breaks for small
businesses, which he said totaled $76 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the Senate said they were ready to do battle, if
necessary, and shot back at Democrats Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time an appropriations bill comes up, just about, we
have 100 amendments,'' Lott said. ``You know it's a magic number _
100.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned, he added, ``that the White House wants to
create a mess at the end of the session for pure political
reasons.''

A CHARACTER ACTRESS TRAPPED IN AN INGENUE'S BODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 (Dana Kennedy is an entertainment reporter for MSNBC.)  
 By DANA KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Renee Zellweger, from a distance, has all the
trappings of a rising Hollywood starlet: the blond hair, the thin
frame, the bee-stung lips, the colorful but homespun childhood in
Texas, no formal acting training and a boyfriend who gets $20
million per picture.
</P>
<P>
   So when she arrives in a big black SUV with her dog at her
favorite coffee shop on Sunset Boulevard and suggests a
late-morning hike, it might seem as if this outdoorsy scene has
been as strategically scripted as a movie montage.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes only a two-hour trek through Runyon Park to
discover that Zellweger, though best known for playing Tom Cruise's
girlfriend in her breakthrough role in ``Jerry Maguire'' in 1996
and, more recently, Jim Carrey's girlfriend in this summer's ``Me,
Myself and Irene,'' is not simply another actress who has succeeded
by perfecting the art of playing herself.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Zellweger, who is leaving the girlfriend parts
behind with starring roles in two new movies, Neil LaBute's black
comedy ``Nurse Betty'' and an adaptation of Helen Fielding's
best-selling novel ``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' is actually a
character actress trapped in the body of an ingenue.
</P>
<P>
   This revelation has nothing to do with the fact that Zellweger
has shown up in sweats, running shoes, no makeup; talks to anyone
she meets; and blithely hikes straight up the steep hills in the
searing late-August sun without so much as a sip of water or a drop
of sunscreen on her lily-white skin.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't come just from anything she says, either, though she
is warm and chatty, especially when talking about something other
than herself.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it comes from what Zellweger does not say, which is
considerable, and how strikingly different she is from the
characters she plays in ``Nurse Betty,'' which opened Friday, or
``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' arriving in spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them seemed a little scary to do,'' Zellweger says.
``And that was the appeal. They were both a really complicated
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Nurse Betty,'' Zellweger plays a naive small-town wife who
is traumatized after witnessing her husband's murder and becomes
fixated on traveling to Los Angeles to find the handsome doctor she
watches on her favorite soap opera. As Bridget Jones, she is the
neurotic 30-something ``singleton'' who drinks and smokes too much
while obsessing about how to land a man.
</P>
<P>
   It is not inconceivable that Zellweger, 31, could have drawn on
her own life to play both roles. Her character in ``Nurse Betty''
develops a real-life psychological disorder called a disassociative
fugue, which usually surfaces after a trauma or life-changing event
and causes a person to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger researched the condition and consulted a psychologist
who specializes in treating the disorder before she tackled the
role. ``It's mystical almost,'' she says of the illness. ``It's
unbelievably bizarre, but learning about it was half the fun of the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger experienced a different kind of shock in 1995 when,
after a few minor roles in small, Texas-based independent films, in
B-movies like ``The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' and in
the critically acclaimed but little-seen love story ``The Whole
Wide World,'' she was chosen to play opposite Tom Cruise in ``Jerry
Maguire.'' The film went on to make $240 million and made Zellweger
a star.
</P>
<P>
   Up until then, her life had been remarkably parochial. She grew
up in Katy, Texas (pop. 12,500), just outside Houston, with a Swiss
father and Norwegian mother who immigrated to Texas after their
marriage. Zellweger graduated from the University of Texas and
began her acting career in the Austin area with a beef commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by all accounts, far from going into any fugue state,
Zellweger remained exactly the same after ``Jerry Maguire.'' She
has just moved into a new $1.5 million home in Nichols Canyon in
the trendy Hollywood Hills and has been involved with Carrey since
they made ``Irene'' last summer, but her most constant companion is
still her 12-year-old collie-retriever mix, Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little that's worth everything to me,'' she says
calmly. ``I love my job, I love what I do. I couldn't ask for a
better life. But I'd be OK if this all went away and I had to do
something else, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have read ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' know that such
sanguine, Zen-like sentiments are hardly what the nakedly ambitious
and chronically dissatisfied Bridget, a publicist turned wacky
television feature correspondent, would be likely to utter.
</P>
<P>
   There was controversy, mostly stirred up by the British
tabloids, over the selection of Zellweger for the part, since she
is American. ``Don't think I didn't have a lot of nightmares and
sleepless nights,'' says Sharon Maguire, the director, of her
decision to hire Zellweger after a lengthy search (which included
British actresses). ``After she came in, I thought, `She's perfect
but she's a Texan. What do we do?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Maguire was won over by Zellweger's promise that she
would nail the accent. ``Her attitude was, `If I don't get this
accent right, we are both so busted,''' Maguire says. ``She worked
really hard and I think she got it.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that she got it, Zellweger was asked by the filmmakers
to come to London three months early to study with a dialect coach
and immerse herself in the culture. She even went undercover, using
the name Bridget Cavendish, at the Picador publishing company in
London for two weeks, calling editors to ask them to review books,
skimming the newspapers for pertinent articles and getting coffee
for the executives.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her seven-month stay in London, she spoke with a
British accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very technical,'' says Zellweger. ``They wanted a very
specific accent from a particular social class in a particular area
outside London. We started by over-enunciating and speaking the
Queen's English, then taking it back a notch. It got to be a
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger even used her newly acquired accent when she met her
co-stars Hugh Grant, who plays the caddish Daniel Cleaver, and
Colin Firth, who plays Mark Darcy, on the set. ``They were really
kind about it. They knew I wasn't some geek trying to sound
English. They knew it was part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey, who visited Zellweger but mostly spoke to her by
telephone from the United States, was less understanding. ``I'd
call my boyfriend and he couldn't take it,'' she says. ``He'd ask
me to please speak normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger also had to gain about 17 pounds for the part. Usually
she is a size 2 and loves to run or hike every day, but in London
she went on a nutritionist-guided diet to pack on pounds and was
forbidden to exercise. ``I'd have an omelet with cheese and sauce
for breakfast with a fatty yogurt and then a fruit salad with a
topping and juice and coffee and cream and a bagel with butter and
a few hours later a chocolate shake with weight-gain powder in
it,'' she says. ``It was like, do the research, learn your lines,
eat the shake. It was all part of the job.''

LOS ANGELES: of the job.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Learning to talk and eat like Bridget Jones may have been the
easy part for Zellweger. Truly becoming Bridget, which means being
blunt, impolitic, gossipy, envious, needy and a little too obvious
about everything, must have been like acquiring the traits of an
alien.
</P>
<P>
   In person, she is relentlessly positive, eager to see, as she
puts it, ``the good in everybody,'' and will not utter a negative
word about anyone or anything. She says she has not had one really
bad experience in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Often, she firmly but politely says ``I don't know'' to even the
most softball questions.
</P>
<P>
   In a move too cool for the perpetually desperate Bridget,
Zellweger became legendary for what she said to Cameron Crowe, the
director of ``Jerry Maguire,'' when he called to tell her she had
the part of Dorothy Boyd. ``What makes you think I want it?'' she
replied. Zellweger, who is normally unfailingly pleasant, says she
acted flippant because she thought Crowe was joking.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything _ her role in ``The Return of the Texas
Chainsaw Massacre,'' her pre-``Jerry Maguire'' job bussing tables
at the Three Clubs in Hollywood, even having to gain weight in
London _ was a ``gift'' or a ``learning experience.'' She is
enthusiastic about her co-stars, like Cruise or Meryl Streep, whom
she reveres and with whom she starred in ``One True Thing'' (1998).
She frequently labels both her colleagues and all her adventures
``fantastic!'' and ``amazing!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been showered with good fortune,'' she says, in most
un-Bridget fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while that may sound annoying, the net effect is that you
admire Zellweger for refusing to disclose her own personal
struggles and pain. In fact, she comes across as if straight from
the pages of another best seller, the often-scorned 1995 book ``The
Rules,'' which advocates setting strong boundaries and saying no
whenever possible in order to get a man and get ahead. ``I know how
people can get hurt by what you say, so I don't feel a need to
share everything about myself,'' she says. ``Just because I'm an
actress shouldn't mean that I can just talk about difficult things
that involve other people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find anyone who will do anything except gush about
Zellweger; but some of her directors, while fans, hint that there
is some steel under the sugar. ``I think she's very savvy
underneath about a lot of things,'' LaBute says. ``But I don't
think it's anything dark. I think Renee just braced herself to deal
with an industry that can be crushing and made the decision to be
buoyant as a way to rise above it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Farrelly, who directed Zellweger and Carrey in ``Me,
Myself and Irene,'' has said Carrey fell in love with Zellweger
during filming but she was unresponsive. Farrelly said Carrey was a
``whipped puppy'' and that she ``played him like a violin.'' The
two did not get together romantically until after the movie
wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not played like a violin,'' says Carrey stiffly, if a
little unconvincingly, when asked. ``Neither of us were playing or
were played.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked what makes Zellweger different from other
actresses he has worked with, Carrey could have been describing her
on or off screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's her ability to withhold her emotions,'' he says. ``She
has it all working inside, but she doesn't prostitute her feelings.
A lot of actresses can't wait to show their feelings all over the
place. As a result, when you finally see a glimpse of Renee's
feelings _ it's something much more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to glimpse those feelings from Zellweger is to
knock off the formal interview and talk hiking or some other
outdoor activity. At the moment she's excited about her upcoming
trip to the Palm Springs area. True to form, she won't be kicking
back and pounding down the margaritas either. ``My friends think
I'm crazy,'' she says. ``But I love it when it's like 120 degrees
and I go running. It feels great. Fantastic!''

AMID THE QUICK HITS, A DOSE OF EARNESTNESS
</HEADLINE>
 $ ADV10-NYT (for release Sunday, Sept. 10)  
 By JON PARELES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is music a momentary thrill or is it a long-term companion?
Popular music has always answered yes to both options.
</P>
<P>
   Hits are disposable by definition, since nothing is permanent on
the pop charts. And the recording business isn't at all unhappy to
face the pop equivalent of attention deficit disorder, on the
theory that obsolescence means more opportunities to sell new
tunes. The proliferating sources for music and other entertainment,
from satellite television to the Internet, encourage potential
listeners to surf for the next bit of stimulation, not to give a
song a second chance. Napster, Scour and other free music-sharing
programs on the Internet also take the commitment, in money and
time, out of acquiring a piece of music; it's easy to download,
play and delete a song without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many musicians hope their work will stay with listeners. To
spend long days and nights in studios, poring over every sonic
nuance, they have to believe that at least some of their listeners
will give the music enough consideration to let it sink in. They
still expect that a certain core of fans will spend enough time
with an album to hear all the details, to memorize songs, to take
the music and the performers to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, those two kinds of ambition have been increasingly
polarized. Some musicians, contemplating youth demographics, are
reaching for quick hit singles, proffering smiley teenypop tunes to
the youngest fans and rude hip-hop and rap-metal to their older
siblings, hoping to cash in before they outgrow current styles. The
next season's platinum contenders include new albums by Limp Bizkit
and Ricky Martin in October. Other musicians, however, cling to the
idea that someone will still want to replay their albums in the
distant future _ say, six months or a year after they're released.
</P>
<P>
   Outkast, a hip-hop duo from Atlanta, has designed itself with an
ingenious balance between immediate gratification and lasting
messages. One of its two rappers, Big Boi, is a light-hearted
gangsta type, out for sex and excitement like many of the other
street characters who zoomed up and down the pop charts in the
1990s. But Outkast's other rapper, Dre, thinks about issues like
crime, drugs and illegitimacy. On its fourth album, ``Stankonia,''
which is due in October, Outkast embraces hip-hop as both a raunchy
boast and a community alert, refusing to split mind from body. Yet
their music makes it all sound like a party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Outkast's duality is only a fraction of the
multifariousness of the Wu-Tang Clan, whose many members make it
more like a hip-hop coalition meeting than a standard group. With
its members reconvened after many solo albums, the Wu-Tang Clan is
slated to release its third album later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's long career has refuted all attempts to dismiss her as
a short-lived pop infatuation, even as she used all the marketing
machinery that makes pop hits explode. For nearly two decades she
has caught musical styles on the upswing, even as she latched on to
fashions that made her worth watching. But she and her
collaborators also came up with songs that have outlasted the
trends they exploited. ``Music'' is Madonna's second album in
collaboration with the producer William Orbit, who merged
dance-floor propulsion with sensuous electronic dreamscapes for
``Ray of Light,'' as she continues her transit from earthly desires
to spiritual hopes and yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   Radiohead's 1997 album, ``OK Computer,'' deliberately defied
superficial listening. It was an album-length contemplation, and a
bitter critique, of how mass media and technology shape docile,
depersonalized consumers, and it took pains over every note as it
pondered why alienation festers behind comfort. Radiohead's next
album, ``Kid A,'' is due in October, and while it's not billed as a
concept album, it's even more introspective, almost begging for
headphones and undivided attention. Songs and instrumental passages
drift and hover, as if floating within some lonely, abstracted
intelligence. ``Kid A'' is half of a two-album set, to be completed
next year by a second album of material from the same recording
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Radiohead isn't the only band that's not afraid to appear
serious; U2, whose previous album confused potential fans by
putting a light-hearted title, ``Pop,'' on a set of brooding songs,
is to release a new studio album in October.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, whose next album is due in November, can count on
longtime loyalty because his albums have a secure place on the
bedroom stereo. He has defined himself as something his fans long
for: a romantic, thoughtful, sensual and utterly monogamous lover,
completely devoted to his partner's happiness. Taking the Marvin
Gaye of ``Sexual Healing'' as his model, and merging Gaye's
undulating grooves with a touch of Sade, Maxwell comes across as
sweet but virile, with touches of mysticism and eccentricity giving
depth to his come-ons. D'Angelo's brilliant 1999 album, ``Voodoo,''
gave Maxwell serious competition in both music and
persona-building; with any luck, Maxwell will raise the stakes
again.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of pop is that intentions rarely correspond to
results. The most carefully thought out, elaborately realized
musical opus may well be ignored or repudiated, while a casually
tossed off ditty can turn out to be timeless. Listeners, not
musicians, will make the final decisions about what's worth saving.
And in the meantime, fleeting pleasures will do just fine. &QL;

ORGANIZERS OF ANTI-GLOBALIZATION CONFERENCE HOPE U.N. HEARS THEIR
MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)  (sidebar with U.N.-MILLENNIUM-SUMMIT) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the 150 or so world leaders meeting this week at
the United Nations wanted answers to the question of globalization,
they had to do nothing more than walk a few blocks Tuesday to the
Town Hall, a concert auditorium in midtown Manhattan. There, plenty
of words of wisdom awaited them:
</P>
<P>
   ``The current stage of the world economy is the cancer stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should continue in cutting back the powers of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the global economy doing to the earth? It's killing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of remarks came during a daylong teach-in organized
by the International Forum on Globalization, a group based in
northern California that opposes the spread of an unregulated free
market economy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 900 people came to hear about the evils of U.S.- and
European-dominated financial institutions like the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.
Issues mentioned in the forum, which was called ``Globalization and
the Role of the United Nations,'' ranged from dam-building in the
Philippines to the 1944 Bretton Woods monetary system agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the speakers and groups involved in the teach-in
participated in the mass protests last November that tied up a
meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle. In April, the
same people, who represent causes ranging from environmental
protection to the needs of indigenous cultures, took to the streets
of Washington during a meeting of international finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no black masks or tear gas in evidence Tuesday,
and the attendees appeared as well-mannered as their counterparts
in the U.N. complex overlooking the East River. An usher took
tickets ($20 for general admission), a will-call line snaked out
the doors and organizers even handed out sheets the audience could
use to rate the panels (poor to excellent in various categories.)
Relative calm prevailed partly because the teach-in was intended to
be a discussion and not a demonstration, and partly because many of
the participants were not ready to write off the United Nations as
an unwitting tool of U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations has traditionally had a mandate of social
justice and peace and human rights,'' said Jerry Mander, founder of
the International Forum on Globalization. ``But we've lately begun
to worry that that mandate was weakening, and that the same
ideologies that drive the WTO will appear in the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   For the anti-globalization movement, the teach-in was not only a
venue to assess the role of the United Nations in the world
economy, but also allowed participants to reflect on how far the
movement had come since Seattle, and how much further it had to go.
Many speakers said that they did not oppose globalization per se,
since the era of nation-states was coming to an inevitable end, but
that they opposed an emerging world economy where global policies
are made by large corporations. Those policies, the speakers said,
are paving the way for big business to exploit developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have entered the era of corporate rule,'' Mander said to
the audience, which was made up in almost equal parts of young
people and their elders. ``The familiar homily is this: the rising
tide will lift all boats. Actually, it lifts yachts.''
</P>
<P>
   The four speakers on a panel introduced by Mander congratulated
the movement for making its roar heard during the Seattle protests,
but also rattled off a list of goals and strategies. Several
panelists said that economic boycotts would be the most effective
way to get their message across to business executives. Victoria
Tauli-Corpuz, an advocate for indigenous people in the Philippines,
implored listeners to urge the United Nations to adhere to its
original goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, we are seeing that the United Nations is
abdicating its role in terms of social improvement, in terms of
poverty alleviation,'' Tauli-Corpuz said. ``It is our role to still
insist and assert that the United Nations is not a body that should
be siding with the interests of capitalists or the interests of
powerful corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the speeches made at the forum echoed the goals of
this week's Millennium Summit at the United Nations. The summit
meeting is intended as a forum where the voices of the smallest
countries can be heard alongside those of most powerful nations.
Hours before the Town Hall teach-in began Wednesday, President
Mohammed Khatami of Iran said in a speech at the United Nations:
``Global culture cannot and should not overlook the characteristics
and requirements of local cultures with the aim of imposing itself
on them.''

REGULATORS FINALIZING CONDITIONS THEY WANT IN AOL-TIME WARNER
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Government regulators are finishing work on a list of conditions
they would like to impose on America Online and Time Warner for the
$165 billion merger of those companies to be approved, people
involved in the talks between the government and the companies say.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, they say, the government wants to force the
combined company, to be known as AOL Time Warner, to open its cable
television systems to other companies that want to offer high-speed
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The government, AOL's competitors and some consumer groups have
worried that without such restrictions, the combination of the
America Online service, with 24 million members, and Time Warner's
cable systems, available in 20 percent of the country's homes,
could dominate the evolution of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue apparently of concern to the government is the
cross holdings between the combined company and AT&AMP;T, the No. 1
cable operator. AT&AMP;T owns 25 percent of Time Warner Entertainment,
a holding company for some of Time Warner's cable and production
assets.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Time Warner jointly own the Road Runner high-speed
Internet service, and there are other joint ventures. The
government is considering pressing the companies to undo at least
some of these arrangements or otherwise to make sure that the two
companies do not deal with each other on more favorable terms than
with other companies, people involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   While some of these proposed restrictions may be objectionable
to America Online, none of them is likely to be so severe as to
block the completion of the deal, industry executives and consumer
advocates agreed. ``There was never any question the deal would go
through,'' said Jeff Chester, executive director for the Center for
Media Education, one of four groups that filed objections to the
merger. ``The only question is what safeguards will be in place.''
</P>
<P>
   After reports about the potential regulatory hurdles appeared in
The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, America Online's
stock fell Tuesday by 38 cents, to $57.38. Time Warner fell $2.59,
to $81.78.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, the safeguards being proposed are formal
versions of policies that America Online has already proposed. AOL
has said it will open its cable systems to competing Internet
providers, although it does not want government restrictions as to
the terms of such deals.
</P>
<P>
   And AOL and Time Warner have been looking at a number of ways of
approaching their dealings with AT&AMP;T _ not only their current
ventures, but also prospects like offering AT&AMP;T telephone service
to Time Warner Cable subscribers and America Online members, and
making AT&AMP;T's high-speed Internet service, Excite(at)home,
available on Time Warner's cable systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are convinced we will successfully address the issues
raised in our review,'' said Kathy McKiernan, a spokeswoman for
AOL. ``And we are on track to close the deal in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also played down the potential restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still possible that the regulators will impose some
conditions, but we do not expect such conditions, if any, to impact
the financial performance or strategy of the company,'' Henry
Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Chester said, however, that were AOL to agree to these
conditions, it would represent a significant victory for the
consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will this prevent AOL Time Warner from becoming the most
powerful company in digital media? No,'' he said. ``And are they
opposed to allowing other voices to be heard? No. But we would
create a policy that will give other voices the right to be
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger is being reviewed by two federal agencies, the
Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.
People involved in the merger review say that the FTC is taking the
lead in shaping the government's response so far. Staff attorneys
in the FTC Bureau of Competition are shaping their recommendations
for conditions on the merger, but they have not yet submitted those
to Richard G. Parker, the director of the Bureau, who in turn must
submit his recommendations to the full commission and its chairman,
Robert Pitofsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, negotiations between the commission staff and
the two companies are accelerating, people involved in the talks
say. And there could be an agreement rather than a more
confrontational government action.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is also receiving a close review by the European
Commission, which is considering it alongside Time Warner's
agreement to buy the EMI Group, a rival record company. The
commission, in fact, is especially concerned with the resulting
company's control over music in a digital age. Executives involved
in negotiations with the European officials say that AOL and Time
Warner may have to make potentially significant changes to the
structure of the deal to buy EMI.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors and consumer groups have asked regulators to impose
additional restrictions on AOL and Time Warner, although none of
these issues have been discussed at length in the discussions
between the companies and the government, people involved in the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Some want it to sell its 5 percent stake in Hughes Electronics,
which runs the DirecTV satellite service, a potent competitor to
cable. Some are concerned over AOL's instant-messaging system,
which does not allow access by many rival messaging systems. And
others want to make sure that the open access rules apply not only
to Internet services but also to interactive television services
that may be offered through the company's cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If open access applies to a web site, it should also apply to
a cable channel,'' said Preston Padden, a lobbyist for Walt Disney,
which has been vocal in its opposition to the AOL Time Warner deal.
He said the company is concerned that Disney's properties, such as
the ESPN cable sports networks, might be at a disadvantage in
offering interactive services to AOL Time Warners' brands, like the
CNNSI sports network.
</P>
<P>
   McKiernan said the company was committed to equal access for
interactive programming services as well. But Padden said such
commitments were not as good as government mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference between an honest,
nondiscriminatory, government-mandated open access on the one hand
and a private deal you've negotiated when you have all the
leverage,'' he said. &QL;

STUDENTS SHOW FEW GAINS IN READING SKILLS, REPORT FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite years of efforts to improve education, American students
today read no better than their predecessors a generation ago, and
their basic math skills have only advanced slightly, according to a
new analysis of standardized tests given since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   While students have shown steady and significant improvement in
the 1990s on a new math test designed to measure problem-solving
techniques and geometry, the study shows, they have posted smaller
gains on a more traditional examination that emphasizes arithmetic,
fractions, decimals and percentages. Looking at those basic skills,
today's 9- and 13-year-olds probably know as much mathematics as
10- and 14-year-olds in 1973, the study finds; but even if those
gains continued, American students would still take 125 years to
catch up with their counterparts in Singapore and 83 years to reach
their peers in Japan (assuming scores in those countries did not
improve).
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the story is not one of disastrous decline,'' the
study, conducted by Tom Loveless, director of the Brown Center on
American Education at the Brookings Institution, said. ``Nor is it
cause for national celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   The flat trends in reading _ Loveless called it ``treading
water'' _ do not take into account the influx of
non-English-speaking immigrants into the nation's schools. And
while a promise to teach every third grader to read has been a
centerpiece of the Clinton administration's education agenda, many
states have emphasized math and science over literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culturally, literacy isn't as important as it once was,''
Loveless said. ``The role of literacy in American society has
declined over the last three decades, not just among children but
among adults as well. I mean, newspaper readership is down.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of five annual reports planned on the National
Assessment of Educational Progress _ a set of tests known as the
nation's report card _ the study did not present new data, but
offered fresh analysis. In addition to providing a sobering look at
long-term test trends, the report on the study raised questions
about the criteria used for the federal government's Blue Ribbon
Schools program, noting that about a quarter of the award-winning
schools have below-average test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that fourth graders who said they used a
calculator every day had the lowest math test scores, and that
black and Hispanic children were far more likely to rely on
calculators than white and Asian students. Generally, math gains
were highest among fourth graders, and dropped off for middle- and
high-school students.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the report focuses on the two math tests and
raises questions about why scores on one are rising far more
quickly than on the other. The newer examination, known as the
``main'' test, reflects curriculums that have flourished during the
decade, and allows students to use calculators on some problems and
receive partial credit for work done on wrong answers. The older,
``trend'' test is a multiple-choice examination of basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at specific sections of the older test, Loveless found
that students have improved their performance in geometry,
problem-solving, data analysis and algebra, but lost ground on
fractions, decimals, and multiplication and subtraction of whole
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Loveless said having two math tests, with different results,
confuses the public _ and researchers. He questioned whether the
gains on the main test reflected real progress in math or simply an
alignment between the test material and curriculums, and he
expressed concern that there had not been a parallel uptick in the
trend test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hannaway, director of the Education Policy Center at the
Urban Institution in Washington, interpreted some of the math
results as good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows we really can influence what kids are learning with
curriculum policies,'' Hannaway said. ``We've been doing more of
that new math and kids are learning it. We know how to teach basic
skills. That's a very easy area to remedy. But we didn't know we
knew how to teach problem solving.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif Shakrani, deputy executive director of the National
Assessment Governing Board _ which administers the NAEP tests _
said the newer test ``tells us more about the relevant
mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to find out whether our students are competitive
and whether they are learning the math they would need to enter the
world of science and technology and information, then we need to
look at the main math'' test, Shakrani said.

AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, CAN CHARLIE'S ANGELS STILL FLY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By MOLLY HASKELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1977. One of the talking points of the women's movement,
then in voluble high gear, was the treatment of women in films and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Every new picture was subjected to heated dissections of its
overt or covert offenses against women _ if the female sex was
represented at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this fairly dismal decade appeared ``Charlie's
Angels,'' with its spectacularly coiffed, pistol-packing cupcakes,
and we who were doing the agitating and analyzing didn't know
whether to laugh or cry. Or simply surrender to the show's dippy
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Having fallen, I'm ashamed to confess, into the latter category
_ I'm a sucker for mysteries and it was part of my professional
research (am I protesting too much?) _ I nevertheless can't warm to
the prospect of a 21st-century film spinoff (opening Nov. 3) with
three of Hollywood's hottest babes. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore
(one of the movie's producers) and Lucy Liu, the smoldering Asian
femme fatale on ``Ally McBeal,'' are stars in their own right,
hence far more independently powerful than the members of the
original trio, then virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But that sense of discovery was just one of the modest
enticements of the television show that can't be reproduced. Who
knew Farrah Fawcett-Majors, she of the three-toned tresses and
two-hand backhand; or Jaclyn Smith of the porcelain complexion and
honey voice; or Kate Jackson, who became known as ``the smart one''
because she had straight hair, more tailored clothes and could
actually act a little? (At least she could cock a pistol and say
``Freeze!'' without having us collapse in giggles.) They were, if
not revelations, at least brand-new, hence without baggage, and
could create a sort of girls'-night-out camaraderie as they went
along, and a very sweet if ephemeral tune it was.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which ran five seasons, wasn't one for the ages, and
its relatively poor showing in syndication, as compared with male
buddy crime solvers like ``Starsky and Hutch'' and ``Magnum P.I.,''
may or may not confirm the axiom that the female action picture is
a tough sell with general audiences. But then again, do Charlie's
pulchritudinous hirelings belong in the same category with
no-frills action heroines like Thelma and Louise, G.I. Jane, the
``Bad Girls'' western foursome, Warrant Officer Lt. Ellen Ripley
(``Alien'') and the various Femmes Nikita?
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie's Angels'' was very much an artifact of its time,
perched precariously on the borderline between snickering sexism
and feminism-lite, as dated now as the posters (and name) of Farrah
Fawcett-Majors. That it worked at all was one of those peculiar and
unpredictable phenomena of show business, an amalgam of high
concept and low chuckles, an alchemy of mythology, formula,
self-parody and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the upgraded firepower we may expect from
``Charlie's Angels'' the movie, theirs was a low-tech enterprise,
operating in a world before cell phones, gyms and Attitude. The
sweet sensuality of the small-screen angels was a matter of halter
tops and slender brown arms; lithe, boyish figures and dazzling
white smiles; and a ready if not always Marivaux-level repartee. In
other words, the three Nancy Drews with the fabulous hair, who set
out each week to solve a crime and nab the perpetrators, were a
cunning blend of rear-guard cute and jockess competent, ``Beach
Blanket Bingo'' meets Title IX, a not inapt metaphor for the twin
modes, victim and aggressor, between which women were oscillating
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The show, offering three ``types'' of babe to choose from,
managed to strike sparks in crossover markets, from pubescent male
fantasies to Girl Guide role models, with a nod to us ``humorless''
feminists along the way.
</P>
<P>
   These ``girls,'' as they were called in tweaking defiance of the
taboo, were liberated women, but liberated from what? And by whom?
``Three little girls went to the police academy,'' announces
Charlie, the unseen pasha, at the beginning of each show. (The
orotund voice of John Forsythe will also be heard in the movie.) We
see the recruits going through their paces at the firing range,
jumping, wrestling, though, unlike Demi Moore's Marine Corps grunt,
never strenuously or for long enough to work up a sweat or build a
muscle. When they are immobilized (by the glass ceiling?) in
``hazardous'' jobs like typist, meter maid and crossing guard,
Charlie comes to the rescue, placing the damsels in real (and
titillating) distress in the path of blackmailers, murderers, con
artists and pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   The girls brush shoulders with the sleaze and decadence of a
modern L.A. without a speck of mud ever sticking to their
peachy-keen personalities or their off-the-rack jump suits, tank
tops and jeans. In one episode, a devoted son supports his aging
mother's orchid habit (shades of ``The Big Sleep's'' General
Sternwood) by churning out porn movies in his film lab. When the
girls are obliged to watch these movies or, in another episode, go
``undercover'' as prostitutes (Jackson as Sabrina) and masseuses
(Fawcett-Majors as Jill) or, in still another, sleepwalk around
town in a lacy negligee (Smith as Kelly), they are as unbesmirched
by sophistication as little girls dressed in Mommy's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Mediating between the angels and Charlie is his avuncular
factotum Bosley, played by David Doyle. Jaded critics, untouched by
the angels, saw these two gentlemen more as procurers than
protectors, noting that they and the girls fell into
pimp-prostitute roles along traditional gender lines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;  But fairy tale analogies might be even more
to the point: ``Three Little Pigs'' and ``Goldilocks and the Three
Bears'' echo through the proceedings, the latter reversing neatly
into Three Gorgeous-Locks and a Bear. Or we might see in the
rivalry set up by their iconographic contrasts and implied
differences a replay of the judgment of Paris, wherein he opted for
Venus (Beauty, the fairest woman for a wife) over Minerva (Wisdom
and Renown) or Juno (Riches and Power). Dispensing with the
also-rans, Minerva and Juno, and getting right to the bottom line,
the show offers only the choice between Beautiful and Strong
(Smith), Beautiful and Smart (Jackson) and Just Beautiful
(Fawcett).
 &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In one of the wittiest commentaries at the time, Lois Gould
wrote a column in The New York Times in which she polled little
girls of 8, 10 and 12 on the impact of the angels and what she saw
as a sudden ``confusion about the difference _ if any _ between a
role model and a hair model.'' The message that little girls were
taking to their pillows at night was that one could be a president
or a detective or Amelia Earhart, a weight lifter or a nuclear
physicist, and still be ravishing. But if a choice had to be made,
it was beauty (i.e., highlights and sexy clothes) before business
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Now, presumably, with the blurring of once-rigid boundaries
between male and female roles, and the prevalence of women, often
attractive women, in sports, politics and business, the action
heroine is no longer the anomaly who has to be softened, made
acceptable, by precisely those ``feminizing'' qualities that
undermine her plausibility, threaten to turn her into a harmless
joke.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie will no doubt give us the real thing: Powerful,
enterprising women who haven't got time to look perfect, whose
fingernails crack and whose roots grow out, who give their Bosley
(Bill Murray) not girlish giggles but power-grrrl guff.
</P>
<P>
   And if you believe that, you'll believe that there's a vast new
commercial frontier for women as heroines who play tough, crack
wise and shoot straight, who make no concessions to glamour and are
strangers to the hairdresser's art.

INCREASING GUERRILLA ATTACKS RAISE CONCERN IN CENTRAL ASIAN

<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Deadly clashes between guerrillas and the
armies of two former Soviet republics in Central Asia last month
are deepening concerns that an effort is under way to destabilize
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas operating from bases in Tajikistan have staged
several incursions into a remote mountainous region bordering
Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Unconfirmed government reports said
dozens of rebels and at least 30 soldiers from the two countries
had been killed in the battles.
</P>
<P>
   The Uzbek government says the attacks are organized by the
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which it says infiltrated the
Fergana Valley from Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials in Kyrgyzstan said on Tuesday that the armed
forces had bombed suspected rebel hideouts after hundreds of
insurgents had crossed into that country from Tajikistan, according
to news agencies. Officials said more than 7,000 government troops
had been mobilized to counter a force of about 700 rebels in the
mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll remains low, and fighting has been sporadic. But
the attacks have been more frequent than in the past, and
government officials and Western diplomats said the rebels were
better trained and equipped, with antiaircraft weapons,
night-vision equipment and sniper rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan met on Aug. 20 and issued a statement vowing that
``terrorist actions will be crushed using the most decisive
measures.'' President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has
asked for broad new powers to curb religious extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The Uzbek government said that the guerrillas included fighters
from other countries in addition to Tajikistan and Afghanistan and
that they had modern arms and communication equipment as well as
good financing.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is strong that the insurgents are Islamic militants
trained and armed in Afghanistan, say Kazakh officials and Western
diplomats. Some officials said the rebels wanted to create havoc to
keep borders open for the heroin flow, which the authorities said
was increasing sharply. Other officials speculated that the intent
was to spread Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the goals, the violence has clearly reached a new
stage. Fighting this summer rose significantly beyond the bombings
in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, in February 1999 and the single
incident last summer in which Islamic rebels held several hostages
in Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   Jerzy Wieclaw, head of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's office in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, said rebels
had used antiaircraft guns and possibly helicopters. He also said
they were demonstrating new strength to an impoverished population
potentially ripe for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries can cope with the threat now, but it seems to
be a long-term strategy to find military and political weak
points,'' Wieclaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The first substantial battle this year was reported in early
August. Government officials in Uzbekistan said guerrillas from
Tajikistan had clashed with troops, leaving 20 rebels and 12
soldiers dead. On Aug. 11 officials in Kyrgyzstan said 100
militants had entered the country and engaged in a pitched battle
with government troops. Unconfirmed reports said 20 soldiers and 50
rebels had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there have been sporadic clashes, including
intelligence reports that rebel snipers have used advanced rifles
and night-vision equipment for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan joined its neighbors in sending military
reinforcements to the borders in the region, and Uzbekistan
threatened to chase the rebels wherever they went, an action that
could create a new set of tensions if Uzbek troops cross into
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats worry that the threat will be used by the
governments as a cover for getting tougher on internal dissent in
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, where human rights groups
already complain that political freedom is suppressed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even before the latest attacks, the presidents of all three
countries centralized authority and limited political expression in
the name of fighting terrorism and drug trafficking, though the
degrees vary from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks have caused geopolitical complications outside the
region. The head of Russia's security council attended the meeting
of the region's presidents in August and offered Russian troops,
who are already battling rebels in Chechnya, as reinforcements. The
Chinese, concerned about separatists in Muslim-inhabited areas of
western China, have also pledged cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Central Asian leaders, struggling to establish
independent identities after decades of Soviet domination, seemed
in no hurry to duck under a Russian military umbrella or embrace
Chinese security assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Wieclaw and other diplomats predicted, the
outcome of the war may be decided not by military power, but by how
much backing the insurgents find in the countryside, where
unemployment and disenchantment with government are running high.

   Health costs are ``out of control,'' said Elyse Hanan, executive
producer of Zap Edit, a film editing company with eight employees
in Manhattan that absorbed double-digit premium increases in 1999
and this year. ``I like the plan that I have but it's a ridiculous

January, she added, ``the only doctor I'm going to be able to

   Alltel Corp., a wireless phone company with 26,000 employees, is
absorbing most, but not all, of its premium increases. It is
raising the employee payment for a visit to a doctor's office to a
$20 maximum from $15, and adding a partial payment each time an
employee checks into a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Meyer, manager of corporate benefits planning at Alltel,
said he had persuaded its HMOs to shave a few percentage points
from the proposed increases, cutting the average increases to 15
percent from 17 percent. But he said many HMOs were reluctant to
bargain. ``They have a `take it or leave it' attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The premium increases are not limited to a particular region.
The nation's second largest employee benefits provider, the
California Public Employees Retirement System, said the rates its 1
million members and their families would pay for basic HMOs with
limited service options were rising 9.2 percent, while rates for
preferred provider groups were increasing 18.8 percent, and for
Medicare HMOs, 31.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Small and mid-size employers face even steeper increases. In the
Northwest, for example, their premiums will rise 15 percent to 30
percent next year, said Richard Woolworth, chief executive of the
Regence Blue Cross and Blue Shield group in Oregon, Washington
state, Idaho and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums will rise 18 percent to 20 percent in Texas, 10 percent
to 15 percent in St. Louis and close to 10 percent in New York for
most large employers, and 14.5 percent for state employees in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Boress, executive director of the Chicago Business Group
on Health, an employer group, said many employees had singled out
point-of-service plans as a problem. One in six insured employees
were in these plans last year, according to a survey by the William
M. Mercer consulting firm. And employers called the plans ``very
expensive,'' Boress said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently advised employees that it would no
longer provide extra subsidies for point-of-service health plans,
including one operated by Cigna Corp., because costs were
practically identical to the company's basic PPO plan. Without the
subsidies, the Times said that monthly contributions by employees
in the Cigna plan would increase by roughly 80 percent. The Times
suggested that employees might consider other company health plans
in which employee contributions would rise less sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Marcus, a senior vice president of Cigna HealthCare, said
that its 4.8 million-member PPO was growing twice as fast as its
HMOs and its point-of-service plans. But she said Cigna had not
seen customers switching to PPOs from other types of plans.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans still has 77 percent of its 1.45 million
members in point of service hybrids, said Maria Shydlo, a
spokeswoman for Oxford. Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna
U.S. Healthcare, said the company was adding flexible options to
give members more choices. She said Aetna would be raising premium
rates by 13 percent next January.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As a battle between supporters and opponents of
democratic reform rages at home, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran
came to the United Nations Tuesday to promote his campaign for a
global ``dialogue among civilizations'' and to praise his country
as one of the world's oldest.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a midranking cleric who was swept to victory in a
popular election three years ago on a platform promoting the rule
of law, delivered a highly theoretical speech that offered no
concrete proposal on how to promote global dialogue, no talk of his
promises to promote reform at home and no mention of any country
except his own.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a clerical robe and cloak and the black turban
signifying that he is a descendant of the prophet Muhammad, Khatami
instead quoted from the Koran and the 14th-century poet Hafiz and
spoke of the importance of artists and poets, mystical thought and
Islamic civilization and of the lack of empathy and compassion in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us hope that enmity and oppression should end, and that
the clamor of love for truth, justice and human dignity should
prevail,'' Khatami told an audience of several hundred, including a
number of heads of state and invited Iranian expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned about the dangers of unlimited globalization,
saying, ``Global culture cannot and should not overlook the
characteristics and requirements of local cultures with the aim of
imposing itself on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the front row of the audience a few yards away from
Khatami was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who came to New
York early Tuesday to hear his 30-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   She applauded him twice _ when he was introduced and again at
the end of his speech _ and left the conference room before any of
the other speakers took the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vagueness of much of the speech by Khatami, who was
trained in philosophy at the University of Isfahan, Albright later
called it thought-provoking and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official explained that Albright had
attended because ``there is no official dialogue with Iran at this
point and we wanted t send a signal to the Iranians that we're
willing to listen to what they have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also wanted to be present after she learned that
Khatami would be seated in the General Assembly hall on Wednesday
when President Clinton addresses the assembly's 55th session, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and Khatami steered clear of each other at a
reception just before the conference Tuesday, and Clinton will not
try to meet his Iranian counterpart on Wednesday, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pressed Iran to open an official
dialogue as a first step toward drawing a ``road map'' for the
eventual normalization of relations, but Iran has repeatedly
refused.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami became president in 1997, one of his main themes
has been the need for a ``dialogue among civilizations,'' code
words for bridging the gap between an Islamic government like
Iran's, which is still subject to U.S. economic sanctions, and
secular nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed making 2001 the year of such dialogue in his maiden
speech before the General Assembly two years ago. Tuesday's event
was the kickoff of that endeavor as well as the prelude to the
opening of the annual Assembly session and the three-day summit
meeting that will bring together more than 150 world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's appearance Tuesday was dramatically different from his
U.N. debut two years ago. Back then he had been president for a
little more than a year, and he wooed a receptive global audience
with talk of how freedom-loving and law-abiding Iran was becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Iran's reformist press is shut down, many of its reformist
journalists and clerics have been imprisoned and its judiciary,
dominated by ultraconservative clerics, is determined to punish any
behavior it considers un-Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, who
under the country's constitution wields much more power than
Khatami, stunned the nation when he directly intervened in the
affairs of the newly elected Parliament, ordering it not to
consider amending a restrictive press law.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, vigilantes forcibly prevented two reformist
leaders from speaking in the western industrial city of
Khurramabad, touching off days of rioting in which a policeman was
killed and more than 100 people were injured.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Near the Iranian mission to the United Nations Tuesday, about
the same time that Khatami was speaking, the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations sponsored a rally
demanding the release of 10 Iranian Jews convicted of espionage in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers were Gov. George Pataki of New York, Rep.
Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is running for the Senate in New York, and
a number of Democrats including Rep. Nita Lowey, also of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to send a message to the president of Iran and the
people of Iran, Pataki said. ``The ten do not stand alone. We are
in solidarity with them.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City public advocate Mark Green said, ``No more caviar
and Iranian rugs while our brothers are kept in jail.'' He was
referring to the recent easing of the economic embargo against Iran
to allow the United States to import Iranian caviar, carpets and
pistachios.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away across the street from the United Nations,
more than 1,000 Iranian protesters representing the U.S.-based
National Council of Resistance of Iran stood under a cloud of red,
white and green balloons and protested Khatami's visit and demanded
the overthrow of the Teheran government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to Khatami!'' the protesters chanted, as they waved the
flags of the Mujaheddin-e Khalq, Iran's main armed resistance
organization which the State Department defines as a terrorist
group. One of their signs read, ``Murder, torture and execution
continues in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Khatami met with a hand-picked group of 500 Iranian
businessmen, academics, students and artists, stoking their Persian
pride and exhorting them to invest in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are beating for the love of one place, and this
place is Iran,'' Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Khatami spoke, five expatriates delivered their own
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultural freedom is not relative,'' said R.K. Ramazani,
professor of government at the University of Virginia. He warned of
``national suicide'' if the Iranian people's demands for freedom
are overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Jahangir Ghaznavi, who heads a Pittsburgh investment company,
drew loud applause when he suggested ways to attract Iranian
expatriates back home.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Khatami, open the economic doors,'' he said. ``Make
coming and going in and out of the country easier. Try to guarantee
investments as is done in other countries. Remove political
obstacles for investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Khatami held a similar meeting with hundreds of
Iranian expatriates. But that time, he allowed the audience to ask
questions in what turned out to be an extraordinarily free-wheeling
exchange. This time, in a sign of the times in Iran perhaps, no
questions were allowed. There was only a box into which guests
could deposit their questions and comments.

<P>
   Kartchner Caverns is a twisted maze of passageways that open
into two main galleries with 100-foot-high ceilings and 26 smaller
rooms. Apart from spectacular stalactites, stalagmites and columns,
many of the formations sound good enough to eat or put in a living
room at home: fried eggs, bacon, popcorn, turnip shields, soda
straws, draperies, cave cotton, coral pipes, birdnests and miles of
moonmilk, a soft, white claylike substance on cave walls. Some of
the formations are blood red. A viscous mud of unknown depth lies
in many passages, holding water from past floods.
</P>
<P>
   From April to September each year, 1,000 to 2,000 myotis bats
turn one corner of the cave into a bat maternity ward. That corner
will be off limits to visitors then, Travous said. A variety of
microbial life plus 38 invertebrate species munch on bat guano or
each other year round.
</P>
<P>
   Like most limestone caves in the world, Kartchner was formed
when rain water combined with carbon dioxide in the air and carbon
in the soil to form a weak acid solution similar to soda pop. As
this acidic water trickled through limestone, it picked up calcium
in the rock. When it reached air in underground passages carved by
water running underground, each droplet gave up carbon dixode gas
and left calcium carbonate in tiny rings that grew into the yummy
sounding cave formations.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge at Kartchner is that this wet underworld lies in a
desert where the surface evaporation rate is 800 times greater than
inside the cave. If completely opened to surface air, the cave
would dry out in a week, Travous said.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening it to the public, scientists spent two years
taking baseline measurements of air and soil temperatures, relative
humidity, evaporation rates, gases and airflow patterns within the
cave.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extremely fragile environment, said Robert Buecher, a
civil engineer who led the monitoring study and is a leading
authority on cave climates. The original entrance allowed very
little air exchange with the surface, he said. If the humidity were
to drop just 0.7 percent from its average before development, to
98.7 percent, he said, the evaporation rate would double and start
to dry out the cave.
</P>
<P>
   Cave climates are tricky and often counterintuitive, Buecher
said. For example, one winter the cave flooded and the relative
humidity went down instead of up. This was because the flood water
was slightly colder than the cave air and, just as a glass of iced
tea in summer collects moisture, the cold water condensed moisture
out of the cave air.
</P>
<P>
   But people are the biggest threat to cave health, Kerbo said. At
Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, people snap off and carry away
2,000 to 3,000 pieces of cave formation each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who goes into a cave leaves behind a belly button
full of lint, skin cells and dust,'' said Tom Aley, owner and
director of the Ozark Underground Laboratory, a cavern dedicated to
teaching and research in Protem, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   People carry enough dust on the surface of their clothing fibers
to cover the area of two tennis courts, said Neville Michie, a cave
climate expert at Macquarie University in Marsfield, Australia.
Walking through a cave, each person drops one microgram of dust per
second, Michie said. The dust travels to the corners of a cavern
and dulls the formations. Skin cells and lint, which are heavier
than dust, accumulate near trails in nasty-looking grayish black
mats or can even hang from the ceiling in ``lintcicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Flakes of skin are little life rafts for bacteria that float
into the cave and compete with native bacteria, often taking over.
Moreover, most lint contains phosphates from detergents, and
phosphates are essentially fertilizers for algae, which can take
root in the cave formations and cause them to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which can change the
deposition rate of calcium carbonate, slowing the growth of
formations. And, of course, people add heat.
</P>
<P>
   All of these problems were anticipated at Kartchner, Travous
said. The entrances and tunnels were dug at the same level of the
natural opening, which prevents air from leaving the cave in a
chimney effect. The visitor center, parking lot and other
structures were built downhill within a different drainage system.
Two huge walk-in freezer doors at each entrance serve as airlocks
to the entrance tunnel and prevent surface air from coming into the
cave.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the tunnel, visitors pass through a smaller third
door that leads to trails for viewing cave formations. Misters,
like those used on vegetables in a supermarket, are on round the
clock, adding two to three gallons of water per hour to the cave.
</P>
<P>
   The trails have 18-inch-high curbs for catching lint and skin
cells, which tend to fall straight to the ground. Trails are hosed
down every night. Lights are turned on only when tours pass through
an area.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Travous said, only 20 people at a time
are allowed on a tour and are watched by two guides.
</P>
<P>
   As for keeping an eye on the cave's climate, 13 monitoring
stations for temperature, humidity and evaporation rate are located
along the tour route and in deeper recesses of the cave. The ``cave
sucker'' system of tubing is being installed in hope of automating
data collection.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if all these measures were working to protect the cave,
Travous said, ``We sure hope so,'' but added, ``We still don't know
what is acceptable change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cave is one degree warmer and the humidity is lower in
some places,'' Travous said. ``But if we go back and look at
monitoring data from the past, we've seen these higher temperatures
before. Plus the cave will flood again.''
</P>
<P>
   But many scientists familiar with Kartchner Caverns are worried
that some of the steps taken to protect the cave may ultimately
contribute to its drying out. While the freezer doors keep hot air
out of the cave entrance, the tunnels contain so much air that they
may significantly alter air flow inside the cave, Kerbo said.
</P>
<P>
   The misters might change air flow patterns and temperatures,
Kerbo said. Introduced water could concentrate on mudflats and
other surfaces in a way that interferes with natural processes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Buecher said he was worried that data now being collected by
hand were not being compared to baseline. ``If they were, someone
would have sounded the alarm,'' he said. ``The cave is definitely
drying out.''
</P>
<P>
   Travous said that he planned to hire a cave specialist and a
cave scientist to improve monitoring. Scientific advisers will be
invited back at some point, and the idea for cave suckers is being
re-assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under pressure from the Legislature to finish
construction and be fully open to the public,'' he said. ``But we
won't neglect good science in the process.''

U.S. RIGHTS REPORT SAYS CHINA RESTRICTS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
</HEADLINE>
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more and more Chinese seek to practice faiths
including Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, government
officials there have increasingly responded with harassment,
extortion, detention and even torture, the State Department said on
Tuesday in its second annual report on religious freedom around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a ``marked deterioration'' in religious freedom has
occurred in China during the last year, enabled by a new law
granting state and local officials broad authority to suppress 14
minority religions, including the Falun Gong movement, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The China government is concerned about things they don't
understand, things they can't control and things that have an
external influence,'' said Robert Seiple, the department's
ambassador at large for religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressionally mandated report's blunt assessment of
conditions in China could add to tensions with Beijing as President
Clinton prepares to meet with President Jiang Zemin on Friday in
New York during a summit meeting of world leaders at the United
Nations. Clinton hopes to persuade China to halt the export of
missile technology to Pakistan, even as he seeks to place relations
on a friendlier footing based on Senate approval of normal trade
relations, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Seiple said the president would raise concerns about religious
persecution with Jiang. The ambassador highlighted the ``brutal
treatment'' of members of Falun Gong, a growing spiritual movement
that is widely perceived as benign in the West but has prompted
mass arrests and lengthy sentences in China.
</P>
<P>
   In its analysis of religious freedom elsewhere, the report
faulted Taliban authorities in Afghanistan for continuing to
persecute religious minorities by enforcing a strict interpretation
of Islamic law that has resulted in public executions, floggings
and amputations, and has systematically stigmatized non-Muslim
Afghans.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that Iraq, under President Saddam Hussein, has
continued to ply a ``brutal campaign'' of murder and arbitrary
arrests against followers of the majority Shiite Muslim population,
the report said. Meanwhile, in Serbia, President Slobodan Milosevic
has marginalized other faiths by favoring the Serbian Orthodox
Church, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's move to replace a landmark 1990 law protecting
religious freedom with ``ambiguous, unpredictable'' legislation in
1997, constituted ``a giant step backward,'' Seiple said.
</P>
<P>
   Some close American allies were also singled out for criticism.
The report faulted Israel for subjecting Arab Muslims to ``various
forms of discrimination,'' and for depriving them of the same
quality of education, job opportunities and social services as
Jews.

HMO COSTS SPUR EMPLOYERS TO SHIFT PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Health insurance premiums are increasing from 10
percent to 30 percent across the country, according to employers,
insurers and regional business groups familiar with rates being
paid by dozens of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Driven largely by escalating drug costs, the double-digit
increase in annual premiums is the third in a row for many
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The rising premiums suggest that apart from the most
restrictive, bare-bones health maintenance organizations, managed
care is no longer keeping medical costs down. Indeed, many of the
companies facing steep premium increases actively encouraged their
employees to join managed care plans in the past, even though some
health care experts warned that managed care plans would not
control costs in the long run. Now those companies are starting to
turn away from HMOs toward insurance that does not entail the high
administrative costs of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The double-digit increases come at a time of rising concern in
Washington and in the presidential campaign about health care
costs, particularly for drugs, in the Medicare program. Both Gov.
George W. Bush, and Vice President Al Gore have proposed ways to
add drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, managed care company profits are on the rise and the
industry is consolidating, weakening the ability of employers to
bargain on rates.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the increasing premiums is likely to ripple
through the economy. In contrast to the 1970s, when companies were
able to pass along higher health care costs in the form of higher
prices their customers, today's rising premiums will cut into many
companies' profits by adding to their operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology companies, facing particularly fierce
competition for workers, are among those absorbing the higher
premiums. Higher rates would be ``as unaffordable for employees as
they are for the company,'' said Kathy Reinhardt, benefits director
of Analog Devices, a chip manufacturer based in Norwood, Mass.
``Fortunately, we can do it this year. It is real important that we
continue to be able to attract and retain key employees.''
</P>
<P>
   But other employers, particularly smaller companies in
low-margin businesses, may force their employees to pay the
increasing costs, or even stop offering health insurance
altogether. In a survey of 506 businesses released Tuesday by the
National Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and the Employee
Benefits Research Institute, one in seven businesses with fewer
than 100 employees said they would drop health insurance if their
premiums increased by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even when companies continue to offer health insurance, some
workers facing higher premiums may decide to drop their coverage
and join the 45 million Americans without insurance. Individuals
who buy their own insurance are likely to be hit hard as well.
</P>
<P>
   Many large employers are frustrated by the costs of the
elaborate central administrative systems of many HMO's, and by the
need to pay in advance for all their employees to be covered. Big
companies are also de-emphasizing more flexible managed care plans,
known as point-of-service plans, that let employees visit doctors
outside their HMO network if they are willing to shoulder more
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, companies are stepping up efforts to shift employees
into preferred provider organizations, plans that are much closer
to old-fashioned fee-for-service insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, are based on networks
of doctors and hospitals that agree to reduced rates for their
services. Employees can go to any doctor in the network without
obtaining permission beforehand, and employers pay only when their
workers use medical services. There were 89 million people in PPOs
and 81.3 million in HMOs in July 1999, the latest count, according
to the American Association of Health Plans, a managed care
industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck is one company making PPOs more appealing. It is
cutting PPO deductibles by half to attract employees away from
HMOs, said Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits at Sears. The
company is also dropping about 30 of the 180 HMOs that it offered
employees this year. About 87 percent of Sears employees subscribed
to HMOs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting said it was substituting a national PPO from
United Healthcare and a Blue Cross and Blue Shield network to
replace 125 HMOs and a point-of-service plan. Geoff Kantor, head of
benefits at Andersen, said the company expected ``to use our money
more effectively'' in the PPO. He said the PPO would also be more
convenient for Andersen's 30,000 employees, who frequently travel
far from their hometown HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Costly new drugs and rising prescription volumes account for
much of the premium increases. At General Motors, for example,
spending on drugs increased 20 percent last year to $762 million in
its self-insured plans, and the company expects its pharmacy costs
to continue rising at that rate, said Bruce Bradley, director of
managed care plans at GM.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say that in addition to rising drug costs, greater
demand for other medical services, increasing hospital and
physician fees, and uncertainty about new laws regulating health
care are all forcing them to raise rates, and making it impossible
for them to commit to premium rates for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   David Snow, executive vice president of Empire Blue Cross and
Blue Shield, said heavy investments in new technology and higher
salaries to retain skilled employees were also adding to costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, profits of managed care companies are
rising slightly after losses in the mid-1990s, and a wave of
insurance company mergers has reduced competition in many markets.
</P>
<P>
   Several large employers said that 2001 would be the second
consecutive year of double-digit health care premium increases. For
many smaller companies, which generally face steeper rate
increases, 2001 will bring their third annual increase of more than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the employer's share of health benefits averages
$4,911 for each employee with a family, according to John Cookson,
a principal at Milliman &AMP; Robertson, an actuarial firm.

RAMS SHOW SYSTEM WORKS, IF PEOPLE DO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It is never about the system. It is always about the people in
the system. If the system doesn't fit the people, it is the wrong
system. If the people fail, the system is doomed. And, of course,
the better the skill level of the people, the better the system.
</P>
<P>
   Football works that way. Everything works that way. Not that any
of us philosophers and deep thinkers needed additional proof, but,
if necessary, proof has been provided again this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some 24 hours after the massive destruction of both people and
system, as witnessed by horrified bystanders at Texas Stadium, that
same system was on national TV display. Except, of course, it was
in the hands of different people.
</P>
<P>
   See if this sounds familiar:
</P>
<P>
   An offensive outfit considered very high octane, wheels out a
nonmobile quarterback, going totally against that silly, yet
ever-so-trendy notion that the NFL game of today demands a Movin'
Jessie be playing the position.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons for this particular human tree stump of a
quarterback are very speedy wideouts, a big-time running back, and
a veteran offensive line. Hmmmm. A comparison pattern seems to be
developing.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Providing the opposition for our
offensive friends on this particular Monday evening was a kamikaze
defensive unit that depends on the blitz to create both confusion
and concussions for nonmobile QBs, who, of course, have no business
playing the game anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened?
</P>
<P>
   This dinosaur of a quarterback, who answers to both MVP and Kurt
Warner, threw three awful interceptions and appeared to have cost
his team this particular game. Yes, the pressure shook Mr. Concrete
Shoes so much, he only managed to throw for 441 yards and three
TDs, and atoned for his own mistakes by leading the game-winning
touchdown drive. It was beautiful, it was entertaining. Even Dennis
Miller had a good night.
</P>
<P>
   So, why did this story have this particular ending, as opposed
to Texas Stadium on Sunday? For starters, this QB's offensive line
responded well to the blitz, and everything else the defense showed
it. There were no gutless pigs playing up front who went into
hiding when the blitz heat got heavy. And then this QB, with the
quickness of a fire plug, took his normal ``hot route'' three]-step
and five]step drops, dumped the ball off on the wings to receivers
and his running back, who 50, 60 and 70 yards later, had those
blitzers feeling like fools.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, the system works. And it's the same system in St. Louis as
at Valley Ranch. But you get the point; the difference came in the
people, despite the physical parts on offense being very similar.
With the right people, the system wins Super Bowls. In the wrong
hands, however ...
</P>
<P>
   The season is already over with a mere 15 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman is lucky to have gotten out alive. On the street, a
concussion would have been considered a minor injury, based on the
possible alternative his offensive line almost caused. For personal
health purposes, of course, Aikman's having his brain rattled again
is yet another warning sign that the point of no-football-return is
near.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he won't retire. There's too much personal
stubbornness for that, and too much loyalty to Jerry Jones, and the
salary cap situation that has developed over the past five years.
The day Aikman retires is the day the Cowboys join the 49ers on the
list of salary-cap-dead teams. Jones had cap-soaked his club's
contractual structure around Aikman, who has constantly agreed to a
contractual redo to free money in order to sign other players.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this: Aikman is on the Cowboys' financial ledger until
the year 2007. He might not last past next week. And don't be
surprised at all if he's playing Sunday night, as dumb as that may
seem after three concussions in his past 10 games. To start the
season with another brain bruise means the second one could end his
year, if not his career, if not his motor skills, at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   I have no advice for Aikman on what to do with himself; he's not
listening, anyway. But on Ring of Honor and Hall of Fame induction
days, hopefully, the ceremonies won't be delayed until someone can
empty a drool cup.
</P>
<P>
   While Aikman's departure is pending, Joey Galloway already knows
about his immediate future. There is no future, at least not this
season. What was supposed to be the high-priced offensive piece
that put the ``new/old'' system into gear, is facing knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Should Galloway have been on the field at that particular
fourth-quarter point? The easy second guess nails Dave Campo.
</P>
<P>
   But because this was strictly an artificial turf-type injury,
with no contact involved, Jones also pays the price for keeping
that stupid plastic grass in place all these years.
</P>
<P>
   One game _ one very lousy game _ and the 2000 season suddenly
vanishes. Elsewhere, the system keeps working. But here, the people
failed, and the consequences will stretch far into the future.

 NEW YORK: Boress said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health costs are ``out of control,'' said Elyse Hanan, executive
producer of Zap Edit, a film editing company with eight employees
in Manhattan that absorbed double-digit premium increases in 1999
and this year. ``I like the plan that I have but it's a ridiculous
amount of money,'' she said. If there is a third big increase next
January, she added, ``the only doctor I'm going to be able to
afford is my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Alltel Corp., a wireless phone company with 26,000 employees, is
absorbing most, but not all, of its premium increases. It is
raising the employee payment for a visit to a doctor's office to a
$20 maximum from $15, and adding a partial payment each time an
employee checks into a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Meyer, manager of corporate benefits planning at Alltel,
said he had persuaded its HMOs to shave a few percentage points
from the proposed increases, cutting the average increases to 15
percent from 17 percent. But he said many HMOs were reluctant to
bargain. ``They have a `take it or leave it' attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The premium increases are not limited to a particular region.
The nation's second largest employee benefits provider, the
California Public Employees Retirement System, said the rates its 1
million members and their families would pay for basic HMOs with
limited service options were rising 9.2 percent, while rates for
preferred provider groups were increasing 18.8 percent, and for
Medicare HMOs, 31.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Small and mid-size employers face even steeper increases. In the
Northwest, for example, their premiums will rise 15 percent to 30
percent next year, said Richard Woolworth, chief executive of the
Regence Blue Cross and Blue Shield group in Oregon, Washington
state, Idaho and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums will rise 18 percent to 20 percent in Texas, 10 percent
to 15 percent in St. Louis and close to 10 percent in New York for
most large employers, and 14.5 percent for state employees in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Boress, executive director of the Chicago Business Group
on Health, an employer group, said many employees had singled out
point-of-service plans as a problem. One in six insured employees
were in these plans last year, according to a survey by the William
M. Mercer consulting firm. And employers called the plans ``very
expensive,'' Boress said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently advised employees that it would no
longer provide extra subsidies for point-of-service health plans,
including one operated by Cigna Corp., because costs were
practically identical to the company's basic PPO plan. Without the
subsidies, the Times said that monthly contributions by employees
in the Cigna plan would increase by roughly 80 percent. The Times
suggested that employees might consider other company health plans
in which employee contributions would rise less sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Marcus, a senior vice president of Cigna HealthCare, said
that its 4.8 million-member PPO was growing twice as fast as its
HMOs and its point-of-service plans. But she said Cigna had not
seen customers switching to PPOs from other types of plans.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans still has 77 percent of its 1.45 million
members in point of service hybrids, said Maria Shydlo, a
spokeswoman for Oxford. Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna
U.S. Healthcare, said the company was adding flexible options to
give members more choices. She said Aetna would be raising premium
rates by 13 percent next January.

`NOSFERATU' SET THE VAMPIRE STANDARD THAT'S STILL BEING IMITATED 
</HEADLINE>
 - (TRIMS)-NYT  (for release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
(Jim Shepard teaches literature and film at Williams College. His
most recent book is ``Nosferatu,'' a fictional biography of F.W.
Murnau.) 
 
 By JIM SHEPARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When E. Elias Merhige's ``Shadow of the Vampire,'' with its
attention-snagging stars John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe, opens
Dec. 29, it will be at least the fourth time that filmmakers have
resuscitated this particular version of the vampire: Nosferatu,
that disturbingly peculiar and apparently iconic figure created by
an odd little group of Germans 79 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of Merhige's film is that in making ``Nosferatu,''
the first vampire movie and one of the silent cinema's
masterpieces, the legendary director F.W. Murnau employed a real
vampire in the title role. The conceit is understandable to anyone
who's seen the original film: Murnau, his art director Albin Grau,
and his screenwriter Henrik Galeen all must have rummaged around in
their psychic basements in order to help Max Schreck (whose last
name, conveniently, means terror or horror in German) generate a
performance that's conversation-stopping in its sinister
strangeness and dignified repulsiveness. If there's anyone in film
history who seems to have wandered in from another world, it's
Schreck's Nosferatu, evoking at once, through his makeup and
manner, rat, spider and skull. He's the unsettling center of a film
that moved figures as diverse as Andre Breton and Jack Kerouac to
rhapsodies and that continues to influence filmmakers to this day.
</P>
<P>
   The most flat-footed evidence of influence, of course, involves
the direct re-creations. First Werner Herzog paid homage to the
film in 1979 by remaking it, at times nearly shot for shot, with
Klaus Kinski _ who himself might have been the '70s graven image of
sinister strangeness and dignified repulsiveness. Then Tobe Hooper
decided that the vampire in his 1979 television film ``Salem's
Lot,'' based on the Stephen King novel, would have Schreck's look:
cadaverously egg-headed, with fanged front teeth like small ice
picks, ears that suggest some crossbreeding with bats, and
outlandishly long claws. And Nicolas Cage _ one of the producers of
``Shadow of the Vampire'' _ took a turn with the Schreck look
himself, with frequently hilarious results, in Robert Bierman's
1989 horror comedy ``Vampire's Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shadow of the Vampire,'' Willem Dafoe, as Schreck, also
intermittently plays his overall grotesquerie for laughs. His
performance is congruent with John Malkovich's, whose Herr Director
Murnau flamboyantly loses his Teutonic reserve every five minutes.
Even so, as the film progresses, the horsing around gives way to
the resiliently predatory frightfulness of Nosferatu's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror'' _ its full title _ is
one of the most celebrated films of the silent period not just
because it featured a scary vampire.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Murnau's first nine films were lost; he owes his status among
cineastes to ``Nosferatu'' and the movies that followed it _
especially ``Der Letzte Mann,'' ``Faust,'' ``Sunrise'' and
``Tabu.'' (He was killed in 1931, when his Packard overturned
outside Santa Barbara, Calif., just before the premiere of
``Tabu.'') He's generally credited with having been the first to
understand the expressive potential of the moving camera, in ``Der
Letzte Mann'' (released in the United States as ``The Last
Laugh'').
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But four years earlier, with ``Nosferatu,'' he was already one
of the first to consistently design individual shots _ referred to
as tableaus by early filmmakers _ as not simply static
compositions, but as negotiable spaces open to every sort of
intrusion and transformation. He turned ``Nosferatu'' into an
inventory of entries and exits, of trajectories in which the frame
was explored in unexpectedly eloquent ways; and in doing so, he
further liberated movies from their theatrical mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   For their plot, Murnau and Galeen pillaged Bram Stoker's
``Dracula'' (without troubling themselves about permissions), and
the vampire's liminal status (dead or alive? part of our world or
wholly Other?) was beautifully suited to Murnau's larger cinematic
project. Each character in the film has his or her own way of
moving, of making visually tangible what each represents. Hutter,
the Jonathan Harker figure, is all doltish energy and precipitous
rushing about, always active and never effective; his wife, Ellen,
responds with a resigned and somnambulant grace.
</P>
<P>
   Nosferatu, meanwhile, maintains the stillness of a figure in a
bad dream or a spider on its web. He rises from his coffin like a
plank. He ascends stairs with an awful, quick-footed walk. His
shadow spreads across walls or bedclothes like an ink stain. He
appropriates and contaminates whatever space he's in. His initial
stalking of Hutter is rendered from Hutter's point of view in a
series of dissolves that mimic the mechanism of nightmare, the
vampire's frozen figure nonetheless becoming progressively larger:
he isn't moving, but he keeps getting closer. And in one of the
most disturbingly beautiful shots in film history, his quietly
insidious arrival in Bremen is heralded by his ship's smoothly
innocuous glide into a static and placid long shot of the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Nosferatu,'' Murnau is hybridizing two approaches that
seemed opposed in the early '20s: the expressionism of German films
like ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' and the depiction of the sweep
and luminosity of nature displayed in the films of Scandinavians
like Carl Theodor Dreyer and Victor Sjostrom. For Murnau, the real
world contained all that was necessary to obtain whatever emotional
or atmospheric effect was required, and how something was
photographed made all the difference. Much of the power of
``Nosferatu'' comes from its efficacy at rendering the permeability
of the border between the familiar and the uncanny, and presenting
us with a nature that seems to operate, as one critic put it,
``under the shadow of the supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   The oblique neutrality of waves in the moonlight, the balky
jumpiness of horses in a field, wind-swept dunes spotted with
listing and canted crosses: Murnau's genius at infusing apparent
tranquillity with an underlying unease and dread has inspired
countless films as diverse as Peter Weir's ``Picnic at Hanging
Rock'' and Jacques Tournier's ``Cat People.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   None of that, though, gets at how truly weird ``Nosferatu'' is.
The scenes between Hutter and Ellen feel bizarrely charged even
before he leaves for the castle; Knock, the house agent who is
Hutter's boss, seems to be practicing a kind of homespun diabolism
before the vampire even arrives to take possession of his new home;
and Hutter, after his escape from the castle, noticeably dawdles in
his race with the vampire to his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The film's structure seems to insist that we not single out the
vampire as its only source of anxiety: once he arrives in Bremen we
spend eight minutes on the plague that's accompanied him, and then
yet more time with Knock, who's institutionalized like Stoker's
Renfield and then escapes and is pursued around Bremen, looking
like Mr. Pickwick on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer begins to realize that various juxtaposed elements
are intended to have more of a metaphoric than strictly narrative
relationship, as we're repeatedly presented with visual
juxtapositions that seem to assert that the polarities we expect
will be maintained _ like purity and corruption, innocence and
knowledge, or desire and repulsion _ are breaking down. The morning
after Hutter's first night in the castle, he notices marks on his
throat in the mirror, and smiles. At the moment of his greatest
danger the next night, with him in a swoon and his baleful,
implacable host looming over his bed, we cut suddenly to Ellen,
back in Bremen, sitting bolt upright in her bed, stretching out her
arms and calling to him. But it's Nosferatu who responds, turning
from his prey and gazing offscreen in a perfect eyeline match,
confirming the film's insistent subversive implication that the
pure at heart are as much on the monster's wavelength as those
already given over to perdition. (The diabolic Knock and Ellen are
from the very beginning sensitized to the vampire's approach.)
</P>
<P>
   Our unease is then masterfully underlined by our sense that the
explanatory intertitles at times misrepresent the images: ``Hutter,
far away, had heard her cry of warning,'' we're told immediately
after Ellen's call has apparently lured Nosferatu away from her
husband. But her husband was clearly visible, and out like a light;
he hadn't heard anything.
</P>
<P>
   As successfully as any film ever has, then, ``Nosferatu'' poses
the question at the heart of expressionism: Where does the infected
soul stop and the world begin? Hutter and Ellen, reunited in
Bremen, kiss, and we cut to a close-up of Nosferatu, who smiles.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All of this becomes somewhat more resonant when we remember that
Murnau, born Friedrich Plumpe, was semivoluntarily exiled from his
family because of his sexual orientation; the exile left him
feeling both a part of the world around him and something else
altogether. He would have been aware of a Slovakian belief that
vampires came from the ranks of those excommunicated from the
church, or their lives: suicides, heretics, apostates and those
cursed by their parents. He certainly must have registered at least
what Stoker did: the usefulness of vampirism as a way of animating
the unspeakable.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most noticeable differences in Murnau's version of
the Dracula legend is the way he dumped Stoker's Christian
metaphysic entirely. None of the sacred ammunition that Stoker
provides _ communion wafers, holy water, crucifixes _ have any
role; instead, Galeen and Murnau's contribution to the genre is the
destructive power of daylight: nature itself takes care of a
problem that seems to be a dark parody of its own fertility.
(``From the seed of Belial,'' we're told, the vampire has sprung,
and he sails to Bremen on a ship called the Demeter.)
</P>
<P>
   The figure of Nosferatu in that light becomes readable as a
grotesque and frightening form of desire, a version of the awakened
or indulged wish that's both irresistibly powerful and
pestilentially dangerous. The figure of Van Helsing, representing
rational science and hardy, masculine, can-do industry, is
completely ineffectual in Murnau's version, dozing through the
crisis and arriving too late to help; instead, Ellen faces the
threat alone.
</P>
<P>
   We make the shocking transition from the irritating and frenetic
digression of Knock's pursuit to the utter stillness of Nosferatu,
gazing out from the window of a creepily dilapidated house that
sits directly opposite Ellen's, like a real estate version of the
unconscious. Ellen bolts awake. Hutter, naturally, does not. She
wakes him and sends him for help. Then, after some agonizing, she
throws open the gateway of her window _ in a film filled with
gateways and portals _ inviting Nosferatu in.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is rightly famous. He leaves the window. She
staggers drunkenly, her head in her hands. His shadow mounts a
staircase. His shadow pauses outside her door, its fingers
extending elastically across the wall to the knob in an
unforgettable visualization of the vampire's defiling reach. In
bed, with him offscreen, she jerks her head down in anticipation of
his touch, and the shadow of his hand and arm spread upward across
her white dressing gown. The shadow-fist seizes her heart, leaving
her in something between rapture and agony. We crosscut between the
disturbingly intimate and understated image of him feeding at her
neck in a long shot of the room and Hutter not hurrying back(!)
with the groggy Van Helsing figure in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Her sacrifice succeeds: Nosferatu is caught by the cock's crow,
loses his malevolent power and staggers around in the sunlight like
someone having a coronary. He dissolves, the same cinematic
technology used to create him erasing him. And then the most
disturbing _ and often unremarked-upon _ turn occurs. Knock,
apparently returned to his cell, pronounces his master's death.
</P>
<P>
   Hutter continues to stroll home. Ellen lasts long enough to fall
into Hutter's embrace upon his return, and she dies in his arms,
her sacrifice complete. Hutter grieves on her bed while keeping one
foot still primly on the floor. The intertitle announces, ``At that
very hour the Great Death ceased and the shadow of the vampire
vanished as if overcome by the victorious rays of the living sun'':
the good news everyone's been waiting for. Except Murnau was
careful to have it follow not the monster's death, which had taken
place four scenes earlier, but Ellen's death. It's her death that's
required, and her death that abolishes the taint. And the film's
insistence on the necessity of destroying what it claims it most
values may be its only real perverseness

SOME LAWYERS FIND PART-TIME PRACTICE BETTER SUITED TO PURSUIT OF
HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF BERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perry Nagle, 35, a lawyer specializing in corporate
finance, is taking the rest of the year off. Having already earned
more than enough money to tide him over until next year, he has
packed his bags and is heading for the beaches of Indonesia where,
he said, the ocean is ``bath-water warm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals for the year is to get in two good months of
surfing on the south coast of Java,'' Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle practices law in Manhattan just a few months each year and
spends the rest of his time writing, performing stand-up comedy and
traveling. He makes $75 to $125 an hour doing free-lance legal
assignments for major firms. At that rate, 20 weeks of full-time
work can bring in up to $100,000, leaving the rest of the year open
for the pursuit of pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, the prospect of working just a few months each
year, or a few days each week, is nothing but an idle fantasy. For
a growing number of lawyers, though, it is an everyday reality. The
demand for their expertise and the high rates they can command make
it possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are talented lawyers out there who prefer not be on the
full-time track,'' said James Quinn, who is head of litigation at
Weil, Gotshal &AMP; Manges, one of New York's largest and most
prestigious firms. ``We've kept these types of people on board here
by developing a range of flexible arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, Nagle put in the long hours at Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley &AMP; McCloy, a prominent Wall Street firm. There, he
specialized in international finance and worked with clients like
the New York Stock Exchange and Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, I've simplified my life tremendously,'' he said,
speaking recently from a summer home on Plum Lake, Wis., where he
was preparing for his trip to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Milbank Tweed sent him to Jakarta, Indonesia's
capital, as liaison to an affiliated firm there. On the day he
arrived, the head of that firm died of a rare heart virus and the
firm dissolved, leaving Nagle in temporary limbo while his New York
bosses searched for another Indonesian partner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he was making a Wall Street salary in a Third World
economy, and had plenty of free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived like a colonialist, with servants and drivers,'' he
said. ``I also had some space to explore different ways of life. I
eventually found out that full-time law just wasn't the thing for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States in late 1996, Nagle used
the money he had saved overseas to buy a Manhattan loft, which he
now rents out during his travels. Soon afterward, he quit his
full-time job and began to take advantage of New York's growing
market for alternative-work arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that he dislikes the practice of law, he says. He has
his own legal Web site, alleylaw.com, and says he enjoys helping
new-media companies secure corporate financing. But, he says, his
outside interests are incompatible with 80-hour work weeks that
full-time practice often demands.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Nagle is working on a book, provisionally titled,
``State of Nature,'' about his experiences in Indonesia, which he
hopes to finish during his four-month stay there this year. He says
it will chronicle ``the effect of a chaotic Indonesia on the
orderly, over-civilized life of a typical young Wall Street
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stand-up comedy gives Nagle another outlet. He says he has
developed a small following doing an act that friends describe as
``early Andy Kaufman,'' in which, for example, he imitates a piece
of toast by ``remaining stiff, jumping straight up and down, and
fanning my face as if I'm hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schlanger, president of Peak Counsel Inc., Manhattan's
largest privately held legal staffing agency, said it was not
unusual for lawyers to have such outside interests. ``Some people
are actors, some people are free-lance writers, others have young
kids they want to spend time with.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, said Lori Phelps, regional vice president of
Special Counsel, a legal staffing agency in New York, such people
can ``find work at major firms without committing to the classic
work-until-you-drop life style.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Fratianni and Lisa Jacobs, both of whom make six-figure
salaries as partners at Sherman &AMP; Sterling, work reduced hours to
spend more time with their families. ``I guess what flex time means
in practice for me is that when my daughter has a 4 o'clock Girl
Scout meeting, I go,'' said Fratianni, whose Midtown Manhattan
office is adorned with poster-sized photos of her two boys and two
girls, ages 8, 6, 4 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Jacobs works a four-day week and takes extra time off
during school vacations. Catching up on errands during the week,
she said, ``gives me an opportunity to be a fun mommy on the
weekends.'' On Fridays, she stays home to prepare a traditional
Sabbath dinner for her family, although, she said, ``I may have to
partake in a conference call sometimes while I chop the
vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Talbert, a real-estate lawyer in Manhattan, gave up
full-time practice to pursue an acting career. Since completing
acting school seven years ago, he has supported himself by taking
temporary legal assignments at several big New York firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting is what I love, and acting is what excites me,'' he
said. ``It's what I'd do full-time if I could.'' But, he said, ``a
big part of being an actor in New York City is being able to
survive economically. Legal temp work has helped me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative-work arrangements are not without their drawbacks.
Many part-time lawyers _ especially those working through agencies
or at junior levels _ forgo fringe benefits like health insurance,
401(k) plans and paid vacations. But the sacrifice, they say, is
worth the free time it buys. And, of course, earning $100,000 or
more for a half year's work is not exactly a life of hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of a sea change,'' Jacobs said.
``The legal community and Wall Street were loath to recognize that
people could have a family, a personal life, and a professional
life with none of them suffering. For the first time, the light
bulb is going off.''

HOSPITAL CHIEF TO LEAD AETNA MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John W. Rowe, who oversaw one of the largest hospital
mergers in New York City and in the process became one of the
industry's most prominent executives, was named president and chief
executive of Aetna U.S. Healthcare late on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Rowe, the chief executive of the Mount Sinai-New York
University Medical Center and Health System, Aetna is hiring a
well-known geriatrics specialist who has helped his hospital, a
combined unit of the two prominent medical centers, stay afloat in
extremely troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   In Aetna, the country's largest health insurer, Rowe takes over
a company faced with the difficult task of improving customer
relations while raising prices for managed-care coverage. Last
month, the company reported a 17 percent drop in second-quarter
profits; in a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Friday, the company reported profit
margins of less than 2 percent. Rowe will begin Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Through mergers, Aetna acquired U.S. Healthcare, the NYLcare
unit of New York Life Insurance Co. and Prudential Health Care,
which had lost money for Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America.
</P>
<P>
   Under its former chief executive, Richard Huber, Aetna became a
favorite target for angry doctors and other critics of managed
care. William H. Donaldson, Huber's successor, has tried to calm
the waters by relaxing controls on patient care, thereby risking
higher internal costs and reduced profits or losses.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have urged Donaldson to find an experienced
chief for the health care business, no easy task when most HMO
companies had troubles of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Once Aetna completes the planned spinoff of its health care
unit, Rowe will become chief executive of the single company and
Donaldson will remain chairman, a spokeswoman for Aetna said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and Rowe come together after what was ostensibly a fairly
hostile relationship; Rowe, like all of his counterparts in New
York, have complained of financial stress in recent years, brought
on in part by what they have said was increased pressures from
managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of dissatisfaction with health insurance
processes,'' Rowe said, ``and I think that Aetna, because of its
strength as the largest health insurance company in the nation has
an opportunity to play a very significant role to change this. I am
very excited about this new platform.''

<P>
   The Mount Sinai-NYU Center is in better shape than many other
medical centers in New York, though that is somewhat analogous to
being the healthiest patient in the intensive care ward. The center
earned only about $20 million on $1.7 billion in revenue last year
and expects to earn roughly the same on $1.8 billion in revenue
this year, partly through budget cuts like the elimination of
consultants and some management positions. The NYU hospitals ran a
deficit, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   While the merged entities have increased their market share
while others around them have lost patients over the last few
years, cash flow is still tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would characterize Mount Sinai-NYU Health as stronger than
most in the New York marketplace,'' said Liz Sweeney, a director in
health care ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's, which rates the
hospital's bonds BBB-plus, or investment grade, with a stable
outlook. ``But from a national perspective, it is weaker than what
we see at other organizations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York trails its national counterparts in several key ways.
Managed care came late to the region. More important, the state had
a regulated pricing policy for hospitals until 1997, and when
deregulation was introduced in 1997, competition suddenly became
part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the Balanced Budget Act of the same year, which reduced
some payments to hospitals under Medicare, and the full
infiltration of managed care into the marketplace, and hospitals
were suddenly like retailers, battling for customers and increasing
their marketing budgets to sell things like pretty maternity wards
and high-profile doctors. Some centers have since filed for
bankruptcy. ``New York hospitals tend to be highly leveraged,''
Sweeney said. ``Their balance sheets tend to be thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, 56, has made many moves to help his merged center gain
strides. He came to Mount Sinai in 1988 as president of the
hospital and medical school and set his sights on a modernization
of the entire campus. A 1-million-square-foot inpatient center
designed by I.M. Pei was added in 1993, and two other buildings
went up later while others were overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   He also built up the center's home health agency, where revenue
increased to $59 million last year from $3 million in 1998. On
Rowe's watch, Mount Sinai's medical school gained stature with the
National Institutes of Health; in 1997, the school received $97.7
million in support from the federal agency. While New York
University and Mount Sinai did not meld their medical schools or
clinical departments, the merged unit has saved about $24 million
in administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe is among New York's more accessible hospital executives and
enjoys giving interviews on topics ranging from health care
economics to gerontology.
</P>
<P>
   A professor of medicine at Mount Sinai's School of Medicine, he
still often goes on rounds with residents, during which he has been
known to chat about acute renal failure, brag about the hospital's
savings on its meal program and recall banter once exchanged with
Pei.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Mount Sinai, he was the founding director of the
Division of Aging at Harvard Medical School and chief of
gerontology at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He has written
extensively on geriatric medicine and aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big win for Aetna,'' said James R. Tallon, the
president of the United Hospital Fund, a philanthropy group. ``The
issues facing the insurance industry and health care industry are
complicated long-term issues, and someone of Jack's stature can
only be positive for Aetna.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some could argue that Rowe is joining forces with a
semi-adversary of sorts, Sweeney said that could also work in
Aetna's favor. ``Health plans and hospitals sit across from each
other in negotiations,'' she said. ``So from that perspective I am
sure he is valuable to them. But it could seem like now he is part
of the problem.''

KRAJICEK SHOULD BREAK THE PATTERN AND TEST SAMPRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's Pete and the pretenders now.
</P>
<P>
   This is Pete Sampras's US Open to lose, a tournament from which
notables have been purged like bold ideas from the Presidential
campaign, and he is left with seven other guys in the room who'd
better wear name tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Pete, I'm Tom Johansson . . . uh, you know . . . of the
Linkoping, Sweden, Johanssons?'' one of them might introduce
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, no extrovert, and not much interested in anybody's game
but his diamond-encrusted own, would probably recognize Andre
Agassi, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Thomas Enqvist, Mark Philippoussis,
Guga Kuerten, Alex Corretja, Tim Henman, and Cedric Pioline _ guys
who've beaten him, or given him a rough time. But they're gone,
without making any more impression at Flushing Meadows than a milk
commercial in a saloon.
</P>
<P>
   They've left Sampras lonely and unmussed in the quarterfinals,
three wins away from a fifth Open title, and a 14th major, almost
wondering whether he'll bump into a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   Almost _ because the face in the floodlights tonight is, for
Sampras, right out of a horror movie called ``The Frying
Dutchman.'' It belongs to 6-foot-5-inch Richard Krajicek, a citizen
of the Netherlands who often makes Sampras feel as though he's
wearing wooden shoes. Krajicek has sauteed Sampras six of nine,
grilling him like Edam cheese on important occasions: Davis Cup,
1994; Wimbledon quarters, 1996; the Lipton, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A Sampras-Krajicek collision means that the title could be
decided Wednesday night. Suddenly, Sampras will have to lift
something heavier than his racket or a glass of the milk that he
hustles. He must raise his glorious game to hunt big game after
four rounds of dealing with mice.
</P>
<P>
   This has been take-a-stranger-to-lunch stuff as Sampras rolled
up Nos. 69-88-72-182 (Martin Damm, Justin Gimelstob, Augustin
Calleri, Hyung-Taik Lee) like rugs in the minimum 12 sets. During
his four previous championship journeys to the last eight (1990,
1993, 1995, 1996), Sampras had to take care of tougher prelims,
guys named Thomas Muster, Todd Martin, Aleksandr Volkov, Enqvist,
and (twice) Philippoussis. He lost sets along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But greats or grunts, it's Sampras's habit to bust them all.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sampras should be well-rested, if not tested,
considering his dream draw, the nightmare element is Krajicek. The
Dutchman appears fitter than usual and fully recovered from knee
surgery early in the year, ranked a deceptive No. 23. He gives
Silky Sampras a chance to glitter as no one else, the kind of
challenge that this Californian vacuumer of titles relishes.
</P>
<P>
   In their duel of heavy artillery at 25 paces, I wouldn't want to
be one of the three line judges at either end of the court. Suits
of armor would be the most appropriate attire for those poor souls
making the calls with these two serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Returning serve will decide it,'' says Sampras. ``We both
serve huge, but the guy who gets them back low on the big points
wins. Richard's done that pretty well against me, but we haven't
played since Cincinnati last year where I beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, holder of the Open's ace record (49 in a losing
bombardmnent of Kafelnikov last year), says, ``Pete serves bigger
than me, but I'm happy with my serve-and-volley game. We'll see if
I can return. I think it's better to catch him early _ now _ than
after he's had tough matches and is grooved.'' Krajicek is
averaging 19 aces per gig, Sampras 15.
</P>
<P>
   There's more than heat to both of them. A couple of
smart-bombers, they move balls all over the service box, hook and
kick wide. Sampras's malevolent second serve sets him apart from
all others.
</P>
<P>
   If Sampras, the 19-year-old champ of 1990, can cruise to the
championship he last won over Michael Chang four years ago, he will
take on more historical luster, catching up with an ancient
Cornellian named Bill Larned, winner of titles a decade apart, 1901
and 1911. Nine-year spans belong to Big Bill Tilden, 1920 and 1929,
and Jimmy Connors, 1974 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras's counterpart in golf, a game he loves, Tiger Woods,
obviously gets much more ink and screen time. Comparisons are
silly. After all, tennis is a running game of infinite length and
exertion, golf a walking game of 18 holes, limited shots. Unlike
golf balls, tennis balls don't lie there crying ``Hit me! Hit me!''
in the manner of blackjack players. It takes two weeks to win a
major, and Sampras faces guys like Krajicek trying to take him
apart, not stationary foes: sand, water, vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   They're different disciplines. But, despite his renown, Woods
hasn't come close to 29-year-old Sampras's accomplishments over 11
years: 13 majors and 50 other titles across the world. Still,
curiously, Sampras has trouble getting his name into the paper,
except at the majors.
</P>
<P>
   But this is one of those majors, and the Sampras greatness for
the ages is on view. Take a look. Otherwise you're missing a unique
sporting treat.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. _ Gov. George W. Bush proposed a fundamental
overhaul of the 35-year-old Medicare program Tuesday that would
encourage recipients to choose subsidized private health insurance
plans that include prescription drug coverage and would also pay
the full cost of drug coverage for the low income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush unveiled his Medicare plan at a senior citizens center in
Allentown after weeks of pressure from Vice President Al Gore, who
considers health care one of his strongest issues and who has
relentlessly accused his rival of avoiding specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan takes a sharply different approach from Gore's
proposal. The vice president would dedicate more money to shore up
the current Medicare system and then add a new government
prescription drug benefit to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is an enduring commitment of our country,'' the Texas
governor said. ``It must be modernized for our times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's $198 billion plan, modeled after bipartisan legislation
on Capitol Hill, would be the most sweeping overhaul of the federal
health insurance program for the elderly since its inception 35
years ago. He would create a system where private insurers compete
with the federal government to provide coverage for the nation's 39
million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of providing people with certain defined health benefits
as it does now under Medicare, the government would in essence
provide subsidies that elderly people could then use to buy
government-approved private insurance plans, including prescription
drug coverage. Or they could choose to remain in the current
Medicare system and still have the option of buying a subsidized
prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the lowest income elderly, those earning $11,300
annually or less, the government, under Bush's plan, would pay the
entire cost of a plan that includes prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor praised the Great Society health program for
the elderly, which was signed into law by President Johnson and
which Democrats consider one of their greatest achievements. ``My
party has often pointed out the limit and flaws of the Great
Society,'' he said. ``But there were successes as well. Medicare is
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went on to offer a withering attack on government
bureaucracy and on the federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare. ``When you need a drivers
license, bureaucracy can be frustrating,'' he said. ``When you need
medical care, bureaucracy can be a hazard to your health.''
</P>
<P>
   And he quoted a Democrat, Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, who has
compared Medicare to a `65 Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused President Clinton and Gore of failing to seize the
opportunity to reshape the system. ``On health care, my opponent
offers the same tired, partisan ideas that have led our country
nowhere,'' Bush said. ``His is the path of politics, the path of
posturing, the path of least resistance. But it is not the path of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan essentially builds on the expansion of managed care
in Medicare that was required by the balanced budget act of 1997.
In a system modeled after the health plan now offered to federal
workers, the government would solicit various health insurance
plans including prescription drug benefits from private companies
and then allow people to select from an array of plans it approved
or else remain in the current Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   People would be free to buy additional coverage at a higher cost
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some new benefits packages will be traditional fee for
service, `' Bush said. ``Others may be networks run by doctors. All
must offer the minimum Medicare benefits and can add additional
services to compete for customers. You can choose to keep your
current Medicare benefit, exactly the way it is, or, if you decide
to, you can add to it and improve it. It's your choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other Democrats immediately criticized the plan as one
that did not provide meaningful enough subsidies to help many of
the elderly purchase drug coverage, arguing that it would leave
half those who need it without drug coverage. And they said the
plan would force more people into health maintenance organizations
at a time when many HMO's have been pulling out of the Medicare
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves millions of seniors without any prescription drug
coverage,'' Gore said. ``Middle-class seniors, nearly half of those
who don't have coverage today, would not get coverage.'' He also
charged that Bush had now proposed such a large tax cut and so many
programs that he could not pay for the plan without causing a
deficit _ a charge the Bush campaign denied.
</P>
<P>
   To help people with drug costs, Bush would provide a sliding
scale of subsidies, beginning with the full premium coverage for
the low income elderly to get a standard benefit package including
drug coverage. A second group of elderly, with incomes between
$11,300 and $14,600 would get an unspecified partial subsidy for
the cost of their coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And for all other elderly, the government would pay 25 percent
of the premium costs for prescription drug coverage. In addition,
the government would pay for all catastrophic medical expenses over
$6,000 a year. According to the campaign, these subsidies would
cost in all about $110 billion across a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Because such an overhaul of the Medicare system could take years
to set into law, Bush also offered a temporary, four-year $48
billion plan to give grants to states to subsidize prescription
drug coverage for the low income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said 23 states _ Texas not among them _ already offer
versions of such plans. But critics said such state plans currently
help only an estimated 1 million people. ``Past experience has
shown the states have only been able to cover small portions of
those who need prescription drug coverage,'' said Ron Pollack, the
executive director of Families USA, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group
for health care consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush also called for $40 billion to be restored to Medicare
for payments to doctors, hospitals and health care providers that
were reduced under the balanced budget act of 1997.

BEN AFFLECK SHOCKER: `I BARGAINED WITH DEVIL FOR FAME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
(Franz Lidz, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, is the author
of ``Unstrung Heroes'' and writes frequently about film.)  
 By FRANZ LIDZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ The door of the Hollywood Hills Cafe opens
and Ben Affleck appears like an usher remembered from a 3 a.m.
awakening in some all-night moviehouse. You sort of expect him to
have a flashlight in his hand as he points you toward the back
room, a dim alcove with the faintly menacing air of a Capone-era
speakeasy. ``If you say the code word,'' he jokes, ``you can go in
and they'll serve you gin.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck fires up a Camel Light with an elbow-cocked rakishness
that William Powell might envy. ``There are very Draconian smoking
laws in Los Angeles,'' he says, sheepishly. ``I hate smoking. It's
a terrible thing.'' Dressed in dharma-bum blue denim, eyes daring
and mischievous, the 28-year-old actor puffs and puffs and ponders
his place in the tabloid pantheon. Since wafting into the public
consciousness three years ago in ``Good Will Hunting'' _ a film for
which he shared a screenwriting Oscar with his co-star and Little
League teammate, Matt Damon _ Affleck has emerged as one of
Hollywood's major heart flutters. When his new romantic drama,
``Bounce,'' is released on Oct. 13, cardiologists across the
country will be on call.
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket press has spied Affleck buying out the condoms
in a 7-Eleven in Wisconsin, and affianced him to innumerable
actresses, some of whom he has even met. His on-again, off-again
entanglement with his ``Bounce'' co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow _ this
week off _ was the subject of more speculation than the last
Mideast peace summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tabloid stories are what I imagine patients' diaries are like
in lunatic asylums,'' says Affleck. ``They're always about storming
out of rooms and falling in love with 17 different people.'' He
inhales deeply, crushes out his cigarette, shreds a paper napkin.
Well aware that being too famous is not the sort of personal
problem that elicits much sympathy, Affleck shrugs: ``Those of us
who have agreed to this Faustian bargain deserve our drubbings at
the hands of the Fourth Estate. We entered into the agreement
willingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck gets drubbed all the time _ most recently for cracking
that Paltrow is ``actually the funny, down-to-earth fat girl in the
beautiful girl's body.''
</P>
<P>
   He sweeps the napkin bits into a pile, lights another Camel,
exhales deeply: ``I hesitate to elaborate for fear of another
pounding at the hands of fat girls offended by the assumption that
they are either funny or down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing gleefully, he rends another napkin. ``I apologize. Fat
people can be just as aloof and dull as
center-of-the-bell-curve-shaped people.''
</P>

that leaves his arms hanging wide, Affleck is hardly aloof and
anything but dull. Though he seems like the smart-aleck
towel-snapper you avoided in gym class, he is, by Damon's account,
``charismatic, loyal, a fantastic storyteller and a great friend
who can laugh even when things go terribly, terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck, he says, shares those endearing attributes with Dickie
Greenleaf, the doomed playboy in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
``Unlike Dickie, Ben has survived,'' says Damon, who played that
film's murderous Ripley.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow demurs. ``I know what Matt means,'' she says. ``Ben is
affable and charming and people are sort of drawn to him. But to
me, the movie character he's closer to is Will Hunting: they're
both disarmingly quick, fiercely intelligent and, in some ways,
underachievers. Though Ben had almost perfect SAT scores in high
school, his grades varied wildly depending on his attendance and
level of interest.'' By his own account, Affleck was often absent
and mostly uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge chasm between the public and the private
Bens,'' Paltrow says. ``In quiet moments, Jocular Ben transforms
into Contemplative Ben. He's not vulnerable right away; it takes
ages to get to that part of him. I like him in all his
incarnations.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Berkeley, Calif., Affleck grew up a block-and-a-half
from Damon in Cambridge, Mass. Perhaps inspired by a television
doctor-drama, Chris and Tim Affleck named their sons Ben and Casey.
(Casey, also an actor, can be forever grateful his parents weren't
Marcus Welby fans.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris taught school, and Tim performed in the Theater Company of
Boston with Dustin Hoffman, Robert Duvall and Blythe Danner,
Paltrow's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Woods told me that my father got him into acting,'' Ben
says. ``He said, `I was at M.I.T. and your dad advised me to go for
it.' I called Dad, who said, `The way I remember it, I told him he
should finish college.'''
</P>
<P>
   An aspiring playwright, Tim had briefly dropped out of his Rhode
Island high school to make a pilgrimage to Rowan Oak, the home of
William Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a famous family story,'' Ben says. ``My dad drove down to
Oxford, Miss., got directions at a general store, and knocked on
Faulkner's door. When a guy appeared, my dad said, `Hey, are you
William Faulkner?' The guy, badly hung over, asked, `Are you a
writer?' Dad shook his head no, and Faulkner said, `All right then,
come on in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Affleck's life has also been clouded by alcoholism. He
bounced from job to odd job _ working construction, mopping floors
at Harvard _ the same career moves Will Hunting later made. Ben's
parents divorced when he was 11, and his mother raised the boys on
her own. ``Ben had a difficult childhood, but not a nightmarish
one,'' Paltrow says. ``He loves both his parents dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben's father stopped drinking in 1990, and he now works as a
counselor at an alcohol-rehabilitation center in California. ``The
most enduring lesson my father taught me is the degree to which
it's possible to change your life and patterns,'' he says with a
humility befitting a lifelong Red Sox fan. ``It gives me hope that
with the right amount of work and discipline, I can address and
remedy some of the things I don't like very much about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Biz, as his friends called him, sprang half-formed into acting.
By 14, he had landed roles in everything from a PBS science series
to Burger King commercials. ``I pushed to do as much as my mother
would let me,'' he says. ``She was worried that I wouldn't become a
normal person. She wanted me to be a history teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck stashed her son's earnings in a college trust fund. Ben
had other ideas for the swag, and, at 15, conned bank tellers into
allowing him to sign withdrawal chits. ``I spent $200 a week on
pizza, beer and video games,'' he recalls. ``I'd intercept the
monthly bank statements and hide them under my mattress.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme unraveled one day when Affleck changed her son's
sheets. ``I don't know which was more embarrassing,'' Affleck says.
``Was it the fact that Mom had discovered the bank statements, or
that she had changed my sheets?''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced Ben was a crack addict, she demanded he enter a
recovery center. He bargained her down to three weeks in Outward
Bound. Affleck remembers floating down the Colorado River as a raft
full of troubled teen-agers recited their transgressions. ``One
said, `I assaulted a cop,''' he says. ``Another said, `I dealt
weed.' Then it was my turn. I said, `I stole money from myself.'''

HOLLYWOOD, Calif.: from myself.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To appease his mother, Affleck enrolled at the University of
Vermont. He quit after one semester and headed west to become an
actor. His ascent was not unfettered. Typecast as a lamebrained
lummox, he couldn't seem to catch a break. He had lots of small
parts in lots of small films, including ``School Ties'' (Affleck as
a bullying preppy), ``Dazed and Confused'' (Affleck as a bullying
druggie) and ``Mallrats'' (Affleck as a bullying bully).
</P>
<P>
   He made a modest dash to daylight as the sweet-natured,
lesbian-loving cartoonist in the 1997 indie hit ``Chasing Amy.''
``I had to find a way to make people think I could be a leading
man,'' he says. ``Otherwise, I'd never get the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he never got Amy, he did get an Academy Award for ``Good
Will Hunting.'' The backstory has become as much a part of
Hollywood lore as Lana Turner and the drugstore: in 1992, Damon
wrote a short story for a class at Harvard, abandoned his studies
and moved to a two-bedroom house in Los Angeles. One night Affleck,
having been dumped by his girlfriend, showed up with all his
belongings and became part of the couch. Together, they turned the
short story into a screenplay, then jeopardized the sale by
insisting that only they could play the leads. Castle Rock bought
the script and dumped it; Miramax swooped in and made it.
</P>
<P>
   Damon played Will Hunting, a mathematics prodigy; Affleck, his
wisecracking sidekick, Chuckie. ``We always thought of Chuckie as
kind of the Mercutio character,'' Affleck says. ``He got to do all
the fun stuff.'' The actors' friendship infused the film: their
best scenes are boyish badinage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the film changed the way Hollywood looked at
Ben,'' Damon says. ``Suddenly, he was the bronzed god in
`Armageddon' who flew into outer space to blow up an asteroid. It
was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke wasn't lost on Affleck. ``I've made mistakes because I
was trying to do something different and interesting,'' he says.
``I don't suffer so much from lazy choices as probably
overthinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow, who first worked with Affleck in ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' suggests he may not be overthinking as much as
underestimating. ``Ben doesn't take the roles that would challenge
him most,'' she laments, ``nor does he appear in the films that
would take him closest to his emotional fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   She isn't afraid to name names. Besides ``Armageddon,'' she
fingers ``Forces of Nature'' and Disney's ``Pearl Harbor,'' a $135
million machine-gun wedding of ``From Here to Eternity'' and
``Saving Private Ryan'' that will open in May. ``Those films don't
push Ben, make him expand as an actor,'' Paltrow says. ``He's
capable of so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Paltrow who persuaded Affleck to do ``Bounce,'' a film
about a swinging ad executive who gives a man his seat on a flight
that later crashes, and then falls in love with the victim's widow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gwyneth wrassled him into it,'' says the director, Don Roos.
``She brought Ben the script and read it through with him. I think
he only signed on because she wanted him to.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roos may be onto something. ``At first, I thought my character
was too old for me,'' Affleck says. ``But Gwyneth made a convincing
pitch. She said, `I know you can do this, and I want other people
to know you can do this.'''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Affleck brings more than a melting smile to the adman, Buddy
Amaral. He achieves a close give-and-take with Paltrow; he actually
listens to his co-star, and he listens with the whole tilt of his
body. ``In their scenes together, Ben really looks like he's in
love with Gwyneth,'' Roos coos. ``I don't know, maybe it's not
love. It's definitely not the way he looks at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Damon, for that matter. ``We're just friends,'' Affleck says,
deadpan. ``We root for each other and enjoy each other's successes.
It's what makes us great business partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Among their many joint projects are an Internet screenplay
contest and an HBO adaptation of Howard Zinn's contrarian book, ``A
People's History of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan to act in it,'' Affleck says. ``Our role is
producorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Producorial?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like professorial except it requires no accreditation, no
intelligence and no actual expertise, which is why we qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Arching his back and waving languidly toward a waitress, Affleck
exposes a smeary splotch on his right shoulder. ``I was 16,'' he
says, blushing. ``I got a fake ID, went out and got a tattoo of
barbed wire. Then I decided I didn't like the tattoo.'' He had
roses etched over the barbed wire. ``I decided I didn't like the
roses, either.'' Hence, the splotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to be my age, there's real pressure _ family pressure,
peer pressure _ to start thinking about marriage, kids and all that
stuff,'' he says. ``I want to make sure I take that decision very
seriously, and not before I'm ready. Whenever I think something's
not to be taken lightly, I just look down at my arm and remember
how different my frame of mind was when I got the tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighs and uncorks a self-deprecating laugh. ``I'm truly
pleased,'' he says. ``At least I didn't go the Charles Manson
tattoo-the-forehead route.''

BOULEZ AND THE VIENNA: OPPOSITES UNOPPOSED
</HEADLINE>
 $ ADV10-NYT (for release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  The cleft dividing the composers of the 19th century from those of
the 20th is arguably the most prominent geographical feature of our
musical landscape. Two attitudes _ on how music should sound, how
it should feel and what its purpose should be _ have split
audiences, musicians and commentators so decisively that in still a
third century, the 21st, the gap is only marginally narrower than
it was 100 years ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On consecutive days, March 2, 3 and 4, 2001, at Carnegie Hall,
the sides face each other in a format of rare concentration and
potency. The Vienna Philharmonic plays; Pierre Boulez conducts. The
orchestra is our guardian of Romantic self-absorption; the
conductor, a musician whose sense of beauty lies outside the
immediate self.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna is famous for its stubborn identity: some of the
world's best conductors have tried to change its sound and
inflection, and have ended (wisely) by letting this orchestra do
what it does. Not even a Herbert von Karajan could persuade the
Vienna to make Stravinsky and Webern sound like Stravinsky and
Webern, and I heard him try. Central Europe has come a long way
since a frustrated Stravinsky complained of the difficulty of
making its orchestras accent off the beat. But the symphony
orchestra, at least in the Vienna's traditional configuration of
dense strings and warm woodwinds and brasses, is a distance from
the brilliant, hard surfaces favored by Boulez, his like-minded
contemporaries and his immediate predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez, who in his 70s has become one of our most persuasive
conductors as well as one of our most interesting composers, brings
Bartok, Webern, Debussy and Stravinsky to the Vienna Philharmonic
on the first Friday in March. Afterward, the orchestra will be
operating on its own territory with Wagner and Bruckner on the
Saturday and the Mahler Third Symphony on the Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Will this be a contest? The effusive gesture against the
tight-lipped symmetry? The relaxed versus the tightly strung? The
id versus the superego? Will the Vienna players overcome Boulez's
cooler tendencies, or will he subtly channel them into an
unfamiliar world of sound? Given the strong personalities of both
parties, listeners should expect a certain movement at either end
and a meeting somewhere near the middle, as in past meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruckner Ninth Symphony is monumental, slow-footed and
patient in a way Boulez's ``Repons'' is not. The Mahler Third
Symphony, by one of music's most extraordinary imaginations, is
confessional, uncomfortably so at times. The score, as they say,
will spill its guts, but will its conductor be listening? To a mind
as fastidious as Boulez's, Mahler intrigues with its invention and
yet seems somehow vulgar for its self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez, at any rate, is not the conductor he was 30 years ago.
The defiant puritanism and the love of manifestoes have gone away.
He is by any measure one of the most accomplished conductors alive.
Players are awed by his command of any score, and they have learned
to trust his gestures in difficult situations. The Vienna
Philharmonic has no boss and no overriding administration. It hires
the conductors its players ask for, and one expects they have
responded to the qualities of a great man (for Boulez is one)
regardless of stylistic differences.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings of these two minds in March will not represent any
particular surprise for either. The Vienna knows precisely who
Boulez is and what he does. Boulez has a long history with the
Romantic repertory and has committed a lot of it to recordings. The
Prelude and ``Liebestod'' from ``Tristan und Isolde'' will remind
listeners that the conductor led the famously controversial
production of ``Der Ring des Nibelungen'' at the Bayreuth Festival
in 1976. Just as Patrice Chereau's starkly updated staging both
thrilled and rankled, Boulez's idea of Wagner troubled or pleased
just as many for its perceived objectivity and coolness. Bayreuth's
orchestra, indeed, was so disturbed at Boulez's suppression of the
operas' themes and leitmotifs that the conductor at one point in
the proceedings offered to resign. At the curtain calls of
``Gotterdammerung,'' the musicians traditionally take the stage,
but they refused to appear with this conductor.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was a long time ago. Boulez has changed, and
music has changed. So, too, have we listeners, and that may be the
most important shift of all. So powerful has been the appeal of
Romantic and post-Romantic music that the 20th century as a whole
is seen by some as a defense against it, a recoiling from a
threatening force rather than a thing in itself. The defense has
not held. We still like Brahms and Tchaikovsky as much as we ever
did, though perhaps the musical aesthetic of a Pierre Boulez
inhabits our ears more than we know and subtly changes our
experience.

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AMONG MOST MOM-FRIENDLY EMPLOYERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Universal Studios Inc. earned a spot among Working
Woman's 100 best companies for working mothers by accommodating
flexible schedules, the magazine reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Universal was the only Southern California company to make the
magazine's 15th annual list, although firms with a strong presence
in the region, including Aetna Inc., Bank of America, Prudential
and Target Corp., were also recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Each year hundreds of companies apply for the coveted
distinction, which gauges a firm's commitment to child care, leave
for new parents, advancement for woman and benefits, said
editor-in-chief Lisa Benenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are all moving the bar up every year,''
Benenson said, adding that competition was particularly intense
this year, with 21 new companies making the list, about double that
seen in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a sign that more and more companies are finding it
necessary to have these programs in place,'' she said. ``The
economy is so hot now that if you don't have family-friendly
programs, your employees are going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal was singled out for its efforts to make flex time more
widely available and easier to arrange for its 14,940 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Universal officials said they had no one available to comment,
and the person most familiar with these programs went out on
maternity leave last week.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is being bought by French water utility
Vivendi, expanded its long-standing flex time plan by adding a
``tool kit'' to help employees and their managers more easily draw
up the agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Also, women made up 35 percent of the company's top earners in
1999, up from 28 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top 10 companies on the list are ranked numerically.
The complete list is posted online at www.workingwoman.com.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list was Allstate Insurance Co., followed in order
by Bank of America, Eli Lilly and Co., Fannie Mae and IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has been on the list for the past 13 years. This year it
pledged to spread its family-friendly benefits to its employees who
work outside the United States, Benenson said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the strides made by these and other companies, more
needs to be done to help the nation's 26 million working mothers,
she said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The summit meeting of world leaders gets under way
Wednesday at the United Nations, but most of New York and its
thousands of visitors could not wait to open the curtain on what
promises to be a world-class sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was backed up across the East Side Tuesday because of a
crush of limousines carrying VIPs everywhere from the U.N.P Plaza
Hotel to the Bronx Zoo. (Denis Sessou-Nguesso, president of the
Republic of Congo, skipped some pre-conference hobnobbing to tour
the ``Congo Gorilla Forest'' exhibit).
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, some beating drums, some shouting with bullhorns
and some practicing silent meditation, squeezed into Dag
Hammarskjolkd Plaza at the United Nations, the global soapbox for
the week. Whether anyone was listening did not seem important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no peace without Yahweh's 613 laws of peace,'' a
religious group from Texas chanted. The reply from a pro-Taiwan
group: ``Say no to China.'' And members of the Chinese spiritual
movement Falung Gong, kept the yelling to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just focus inside,'' one of the meditators said.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary general, has called the three-day
conference a ``defining moment for the world's leaders and for the
United Nations.'' To be sure, some of the world's most vexing
problems, from poverty to disease, will be debated by presidents,
prime ministers, kings and crown princes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, President Mohammed Khatami of Iran delivered a speech
at a one-day conference ahead of the summit, in which he praised
Iran as one of the world's oldest civilizations and promoted his
campaign for a global ``dialogue among civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions also began among four African presidents on
Zimbabwe's troubled land-reform program. More than 700 other
meetings, dealing with local issues around the world, are expected
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, it was mostly hard to see the diplomacy past the
pre-summit spectacle, which spilled into every nook and cranny of
New York and promised to continue throughout the week. Even as
Khatami spoke, hundreds of demonstrators marched down 47th Street
in opposition to his government, their protests filling one slot in
a day of events and counter-events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this in bits and pieces before, but never like
this all together,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, who joined the
ranks of attention-seekers by releasing a letter to Madeleine
Albright, the secretary of state, requesting that the city be
reimbursed for the $10 million it is spending on the summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, home for the week to
about 30 heads of state, including President Clinton, finished
installing an elaborate telephone network that includes 4 miles of
additional cable, untold pieces of high-tech gadgetry and several
rooftop satellite links. Maintenance workers at the United Nations,
meanwhile, rushed to shore up a rain-soaked ceiling in a meeting
room where breakfast is to be served Wednesday to more than 150
invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed every New Yorker, permanent or just passing through,
also had a gripe about the once-a-millennium inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   A German tennis player, Nicolas Kiefer, advanced to the
quarterfinals at the U.S. Open in Queens, but only after surviving
a sleepless weekend at his hotel, the U.N. Plaza. Kiefer said he
had ``a very bad night'' on Sunday because there were no fewer than
four security alerts during the night. The Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, one of 18 dignitaries considered high security risks
by police, is among the hotel's guests.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer said he moved to the Waldorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow is the same thing again when Mr. Clinton is
going'' there, he said shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudoph Giuliani, who has a history of using U.N.
gatherings to dress down his least favorite world leaders, did not
go uncounted by attacking Fidel Castro of Cuba, who is making his
first visit to New York in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and sympathize with the sense of injustice that
much of the Cuban community feels with regard to Fidel Castro,''
Giuliani told a Midtown news conference. ``He's taken the land of
many people, displaced families, killed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro will get his chance to turn some heads Wednesday when he
addresses the summit meeting's opening session.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean leaders did not even make it to New York before
they started complaining. They abruptly returned home after being
subjected to security checks at the airport in Frankfurt, Germany.
Choe Su Hon, the North Korean vice minister for foreign affairs,
blamed the United States for the security measures, carried out by
American Airlines, which apparently caused the delegation to miss
its flight.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will shed tears about the absence of the North
Koreans: All the more attention for the rest of us out there.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, the main speaker was a no-show and the crowd outside
a funeral home across the street was bigger than the media
contingent on hand. But the Friends of Zimbabwe pressed ahead with
its publicity campaign, one of a gazillion organizations and people
across the city screaming, ``Hey, look at me!''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wareham, a Brooklyn lawyer, unveiled a poster of Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe at the Mt. Olivet Baptist Church on Malcolm
X Boulevard. The Rev. Charles Curtis, pastor at the church, spoke
of an international political and media campaign to discredit
Mugabe. And Amadi Ajamu, the group's publicity chief, handed out a
press release announcing the Zimbabwean president's appearance
Thursday night at the church, a sort of coming out party for the
African leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that he is not really well known in the black
community,'' Wareham said. ``People know Fidel,'' he said referring
to Castro, ``but if they've heard of Mugabe in the mainstream
media, they think he is some kind of maniac.''

   Friends of Mugabe were not alone in their frustration, as
evidenced by the flurry of press releases, some written by hand,
sent to media organizations around the city.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady of South Korea would like it known that she will
help raise money for HIV-infected children at the YMCA in Flushing.
Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, the Indian representative to the United

   Ruby Anderson did not write a press release, but she is starving
for some attention as well. She runs Al's Delicatessen at what has
become ground zero during Millennium Summit week, 44th Street
between First and Second avenues. Al's lies behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who requested Al's by name were allowed Tuesday to
slip past the police line, but none seemed to know this, and so
what would have been the 1 p.m. sandwich rush became a thin trickle
of secret service agents, police officers and the occasional
regular from the nearby Nigerian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in the area, Anderson can tell the difference.
``I can see if they're secret service or state department or with
the detectives or with the policemen,'' she said. ``They all behave
different.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, three men whisked in, placed orders for sandwiches and
headed for a table in the back corner of the room. The one who
seemed to be in charge was clearly a figure of note, Anderson
determined, someone `` very down to business.''
</P>
<P>
   The customer was Leon Fuerth, Vice President Al Gore's national
security adviser, and he polished off a turkey sandwich and a side
of cole slaw over a confab with two staffers that one of them
described only as ``important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't care for his bagel from the Delta Shuttle,''
confided the staff member, who asked that his name not be used.
With its paucity of customers, Al's was the perfect place to talk
foreign policy on the down-low. ``It gave us an opportunity to
engage in our discussion in a typical New York environment,'' the
staffer said.

HIGH-TECH FIRMS HELP SPONSOR ACADEMIC PROGRAM

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A hybrid between computer science and electrical
engineering courses at California State University, Northridge, is
teaching students about the software and hardware sides of
computers, a combo-talent sought along the Ventura Freeway
technology corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great demand from the industry for students that
have the mix of hardware and software education,'' said Sharlene
Katz, who led the faculty committee that created the curriculum.
``We're really giving them the full picture of computer systems so
it makes them useful to local companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The need, however, isn't limited to the corridor, which extends
from Burbank through L.A.'s San Fernando Valley to the Ventura
County communities of Thousand Oaks and Camarillo. The creators of
the major were driven by the federal rating of computer engineering
as the No. &UR;  &LR; 1 growth field nationally over the next 10 years. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the number of computer
engineering positions will double between 1998 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hwang, chief operating officer of the Los Angeles
Regional Technology Alliance, said the hybrid is a natural
progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have a category that is growing larger and larger,
it's prone to more niches like that,'' said Hwang. ``What
programmer hasn't opened up their PC and installed components? The
lines were always sort of blurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Interrante, an applications engineering manager at
Vitesse Semiconductor in Camarillo, said even experienced job
candidates have trouble grasping the new technologies in
development there. A member of the major's advisory board, he said
its curriculum would most come into play at Vitesse when it comes
to directing the operation of circuit boards, a task for engineers
requiring software knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to end up programming programmable logic devices,''
said Interrante. ``That's really where I see it coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to know how many students will be attracted to
the new major, which makes CSUN the ninth out of 23 California
State University campuses to offer it. The first declarations won't
be made until spring. Last year, CSUN issued a total of 363 degrees
to computer science and electrical engineering students.
</P>
<P>
   Some in those programs are expected to modify their course
selections and join the new major, which takes away the mechanical
and civil engineering classes that electrical engineering students
must take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited about the program,'' said Nagwa Bekir, chair of
the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. ``We believe
we'll have a high turnout and at the same time make all the
companies around us happy.''

BRITAIN'S NATIONAL GRID ACQUIRES NIAGARA MOHAWK FOR $3 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So far, the names have stayed the same among the small utilities
that serve communities from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, and
from Maine to Florida. But that masks the efforts of the large,
ambitious electricity concerns that are rapidly swallowing local
companies to fashion regional giants. Tuesday's acquisition of
Niagara Mohawk, in upstate New York, by the National Grid Group, of
Britain, highlights that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion National Grid purchase, confirmed Tuesday, comes
on the heels of two other mergers. A month ago, FPL Group, of
Florida, merged with Entergy to create a Gulf Coast company with
more than 6 million customers, making it the nation's largest
utility. Weeks later, FirstEnergy acquired GPU, of New Jersey, for
$4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every utility in the country is willing to sit down
and talk with anyone who presents a serious proposal,'' said Tia
Barancik, a lawyer with LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &AMP; MacRae who
specializes in utilities .
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast, perhaps more than any other region, has become a
key staging ground for consolidation because it was among the first
places in the country where states deregulated the power industry.
That, in turn, created opportunities for utilities to streamline
their businesses, add new ones and generally make more money than
they had in the past. As a result, local utilities have been
hooking up, as Consolidated Edison is in the process of doing with
Northeast Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, deregulation has drawn the interest of outsiders like
National Grid. Within the last year, the company acquired two other
Northeast utilities, New England Electric Systems and Eastern
Utilities Association. Its purchase of Niagara Mohawk would give
National Grid about 3.3 million electricity customers, making it
the ninth largest electric utility in the country, and 540,000
natural gas customers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Grid acquisitions, analysts say, mark a shift in
the kind of mergers that will unfurl within the industry over the
next few years. Until recently, companies of similar size often
made deals, normally with little reason except to get bigger and
keep competitors at bay. As a result, their shares often took a
drubbing. Now larger companies are pursuing smaller companies to
build a position in a particular market and to fill certain niches.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, National Grid seems to be moving to create an entity
that will distribute power across one of most densely populated
parts of the country. None of National Grid's holdings, including
Niagara Mohawk, actually generate power. Under deregulation, they
sold their power plants and now buy electricity from various
plants, apparently with an eye to getting the lowest price for
themselves and the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the addition of Niagara Mohawk to National Grid's
earlier acquisitions will give the combined company more power to
bargain for cheaper rates when it buys electricity. National Grid
also stated that by streamlining staff and instituting more
efficient business practices, the expanded company would save about
$90 million in the first four years after the merger becomes
official.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk's customers could probably ``receive a healthier
company,'' said Barry Abrahamson, senior electric utility analyst
with PaineWebber. The company neared bankruptcy a few years ago
under the burden of about $3.5 billion in long-term contracts for
highly expensive electricity it had bought a decade earlier, as
part of a state and federal initiative. Niagara Mohawk has paid
about $900 million of that debt and National Grid will assume the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk's shares rose $1.88 Tuesday, to $15.75. That is
well short of the $19 a share the deal works out to, no doubt
reflecting that with all the regulatory hurdles, it could well take
a year before the acquisition is complete. In addition, it must
sell its Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in upstate New York before
the merger goes through.
</P>
<P>
   Despite National Grid's incursions into the Northeast, ratepayer
advocates remain somewhat wary of the deal, since they know little
about the British company. They point out, for example, that the
industry attrition rate is lower than what is expected in the
merger, and therefore the savings from the deal may be less than
predicted. Under an agreement with the state, Niagara Mohawk is
also allowed to keep most of the savings from a merger for five
years, rather than pass them along to customers.

NEW YORK THEATER SEASON OFFERS FEW BIG TREATS, BUT MANY SMALL
PLEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
 1 0-NYT (for release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Holding your breath in anticipation is rarely
healthy, and in the theater it is usually suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   A mere few months ago, an improbably rosy horizon seemed to glow
before those rich or fanatical enough to attend Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   That splendid London-born revival of ``Oklahoma!,'' directed by
Trevor Nunn; Donna Murphy recreating her peerless comic performance
in the rarely revived ``Wonderful Town,'' first seen last spring in
an Encores! concert production; and, most tantalizing of all,
Angela Lansbury back onstage, and in a Kander-Ebb musical (``The
Visit'') to boot: all of these mouth-watering prospects were to
materialize in the near future, making the 2000-1 Broadway season
look like a gloriously overstuffed Christmas stocking.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus, of course, is known to disappoint. So theater fans
shouldn't be terribly surprised to learn that none of the above is
now expected to reach a Broadway theater anytime soon, with the
possible exception of ``The Visit,'' which in any case will be
without Lansbury.
</P>
<P>
   But if the schedule of big musical treats suddenly looks
skeletal, there are more intimate and eccentric pleasures to be
found elsewhere, smaller productions that nonetheless merit great
expectations. One hesitates to mention them, for fear they might
evaporate before this list reaches print. Kindly remember that
nothing in theater is guaranteed to arrive, either dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's the return of Edward Albee, one of the
handful of working American playwrights to whom the word ``great''
adheres easily: a dramatist who rarely fails to exasperate and
never fails to intrigue. Albee, whose last new production in New
York was the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Three Tall Women'' (1993),
will be represented this fall or winter by ``The Play About the
Baby.'' If you think this sounds like a rejected title for Albee's
most famous work, ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' you're not
on the wrong track.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Woolf,'' this dark cosmic comedy, which I saw in an
earlier version in London two years ago, features an older couple
and a younger couple, and a child who may or may not exist. If you
go with an open mind and limited hopes for things like a
straightforward plot, you're likely to have a good time. This
version stars Marian Seldes and Brian Murray, outsized theatrical
presences who, if they rein in their penchants for excess, could be
fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider another theatrical pair, one whose arrival from
England demands attention and arguably even fireworks. That's Alan
Bates and Eileen Atkins, who will be the entire cast of ``The
Unexpected Man,'' the latest offering from Yasmina Reza, who won
over Broadway audiences with her pithy and intermissionless
``Art.'' Atkins, whose natural incisiveness gives elegance to
anything in which she appears, has been seen to fine advantage on
these shores in the last decade in ``Vita and Virginia'' and
``Indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bates, the most soulful of the angry young
actors who dominated British film in the 1960s, hasn't been in a
major New York production in 27 years. That was when he appeared in
the surly title role of Simon Gray's ``Butley,'' and anyone who
remembers that performance will most likely already be ordering
tickets for ``The Unexpected Man.''
</P>
<P>
   You would also be well advised to sign up for the entire season
of the Drama Dept., the most ambitious and eclectic of the city's
young theater troupes and the creators of everything from a
flamboyant deconstruction of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' to the
commercial hit ``As Bees in Honey Drown.''
</P>
<P>
   Its latest schedule tentatively and temptingly includes new
works from Douglas Carter Beane, the author of ``Bees,'' and from
David and Amy Sedaris, the iconoclastic brother-sister team who
bill themselves, not without reason, as the Talent Family. (
Sedaris is the author of the current collection of essays ``Me Talk
Pretty One Day,'' while Amy Sedaris stars in ``Strangers With
Candy'' on Comedy Central.)
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, what sounded most promising of all from the
Drama Dept. was a new play by Richard Greenberg. This eloquent
chronicler of urban neuroses, as in ``Eastern Standard'' and
``Three Days of Rain,'' had taken on a subject he seemed born to
tackle: those ultimate urban neurotics and glamorously bad
housekeepers, the Collyer Brothers, in ``The Dazzle.'' The latest
word, however, has it that Greenberg and the Collyers have fallen
off the schedule. Which at least puts them in illustrious company.

NATIONAL DEBT LOSES ITS STATUS AS ECONOMIC BOGEYMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York developer Seymour Durst sent every member of Congress a
holiday card in 1981. ``Happy New Year,'' it said, ``your share of
the national debt is $20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Durst took his battle against government
borrowing a step further, attracting headlines nationwide by
hauling a 12-by-20-foot clock up the side of his company's building
in Times Square. The National Debt Clock, he swore, would keep
passersby up to date on Uncle Sam's IOUs _ which were rising
$10,000 a second at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought our cultural and political systems were creating
problems for the future,'' Douglas Durst said of his father, who
died in 1995. ``I'm proud that he did something about it, that he
focused attention on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst will retire his father's creation Thursday. Call it a sign
of the times.
</P>
<P>
   With the government running at a surplus for the first time in
three decades, the national debt just isn't a big deal anymore. And
New Yorkers strolling through Times Square aren't going to be the
only ones who notice.
</P>
<P>
   At its current pace, the government could pay off its debts and
stop borrowing within the decade. If that happens, every American
who owns a retirement account, buys a house, finances a car, or
runs up a credit-card tab will feel the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming the current trend persists, you could see the
Treasury Department stop issuing new debt within five years,'' said
Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates in
New York. ``That's a big deal for just about everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   How big of a deal?
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the ``full faith and credit of the US government,''
Treasuries are a safe haven for investors ranging from pensioners
to pension-fund managers to overseas central bankers. They're also
a key component of money-market accounts, where investors park cash
they don't want to _ or can't afford to _ put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional bank savings account, backed by a guarantee from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., will still be there for people
willing to accept interest rates as low as 2 to 3 percent. But
investors who have gotten used to earning twice as much on
Treasuries will be forced to choose between the government's safety
net and higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lose the Treasuries and all of the financial markets become a
riskier place to do business,'' said F. Ward McCarthy, managing
director at Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
``The one place that doesn't suffer from potential default risk
will have been removed from the equation, and there is no perfect
substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   The quasigovernmental Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac)
have increased their own bond offerings to attract nervous
investors wondering where to stash their cash safely. Corporations
with the highest credit ratings _ such as General Electric _ may
also fill the demand for conservative investments by offering more
bonds to the public.
</P>
<P>
   CDs, or certificates of deposit, are also likely to change, as
banks try to make them more ``bondlike'' _ allowing investors to
cash out early without paying penalties, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to FDIC insurance, CDs offer the government's `full
faith and credit' guarantee in a different guise,'' said Crandall,
of Wrightson Associates. ``Individual investors will almost
certainly see an explosion of FDIC-insured products as Treasuries
are removed from the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Some borrowers, meanwhile, have begun to benefit from the
government's attempt to rein in debt. Mortgage rates and other
consumer loans are lower than they otherwise would be today, though
by how much it's difficult to say.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have risen over the past year as the Federal
Reserve has attempted to slow the economy's growth. But with excess
money in the credit markets _ at least until safe substitutes are
widely accepted _ rates have risen only gradually, and home sales
have remained high.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the no-government-debt scenario is hardly a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office says the Treasury Department
could retire virtually all of its $3.3 trillion in public borrowing
by 2011 if tax revenues and government spending continue at the
current pace. The department could stop issuing new debt years
before that, maybe as soon as 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole thing rests on a big ``if.'' For the numbers to
work, the economy has to stay strong and politicians have to ward
off the temptation to divert more money for tax cuts or additional
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economies cycle, so the trends (behind the debt reduction) are
unlikely to continue forever,'' said Sanjiv Ranjan Das, a finance
professor and bond-market researcher at California's Santa Clara
University. ``I don't think we're in danger of wiping out the
public debt anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, argue that government borrowing will be all but
eliminated within a decade even if politicians can't keep their
hands out of the cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers chief economist Stephen Slifer, for example,
said the CBO numbers assume economic growth of 3 percent per year,
which he called ``a lowball forecast.'' Faster growth would allow
the Treasury to pay its debts before 2011, even if politicians help
themselves to some of the bounty.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the Treasury has already initiated a round of
cutbacks likely to continue for at least a couple more years.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the department started buying back 30-year bonds
with remaining maturities of 15 to 25 years. It has taken bonds
worth $19.75 billion off the market in the months since, and hopes
to reach $30 billion by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Treasury said it was actively considering whether to
stop issuing one-year bills altogether, and it has reduced the
frequency and size of the auctions in which it makes various types
of debt available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep whittling away,'' said Jack Kallis, manager of the
State Street Research Government Income mutual fund. ``I'm not yet
convinced that I'll be out of a job (in 2011), but the current
trend is going to continue for another year or two, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, oblivious to what's happening in Times Square
or on Wall Street, another debt clock continues to track the
government's red-tape tally. The Bureau of the Public Debt, at
www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpdodt.htm, updates the Web world
daily on how much debt the public holds and how much is owed the
Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   And Durst, despite the Manhattan ceremony planned for Thursday,
isn't actually taking his dad's famous chronometer down. He's just
hanging a red, white, and blue curtain in front of it for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has served its function,'' he said, ``but it will still be
there in case things go awry and the debt soars.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As a battle between supporters and opponents of
democratic reform rages at home, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran
came to the United Nations Tuesday to promote his campaign for a
global ``dialogue among civilizations'' and to praise his country
as one of the world's oldest.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a midranking cleric who was swept to victory in a
popular election three years ago on a platform promoting the rule
of law, delivered a highly theoretical speech that offered no
concrete proposal on how to promote global dialogue, no talk of his
promises to promote reform at home and no mention of any country
except his own.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a clerical robe and cloak and the black turban
signifying that he is a descendant of the prophet Muhammad, Khatami
instead quoted from the Koran and the 14th-century poet Hafiz and
spoke of the importance of artists and poets, mystical thought and
Islamic civilization and of the lack of empathy and compassion in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us hope that enmity and oppression should end, and that
the clamor of love for truth, justice and human dignity should
prevail,'' Khatami told an audience of several hundred, including a
number of heads of state and invited Iranian expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned about the dangers of unlimited globalization,
saying, ``Global culture cannot and should not overlook the
characteristics and requirements of local cultures with the aim of
imposing itself on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the front row of the audience a few yards away from
Khatami was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who came to New
York early Tuesday to hear his 30-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   She applauded him twice _ when he was introduced and again at
the end of his speech _ and left the conference room before any of
the other speakers took the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vagueness of much of the speech by Khatami, who was
trained in philosophy at the University of Isfahan, Albright later
called it thought-provoking and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official explained that Albright had
attended because ``there is no official dialogue with Iran at this
point and we wanted to send a signal to the Iranians that we're
willing to listen to what they have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also wanted to be present after she learned that
Khatami would be seated in the General Assembly hall on Wednesday
when President Clinton addresses the assembly's 55th session, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and Khatami steered clear of each other at a
reception just before the conference Tuesday, and Clinton will not
try to meet his Iranian counterpart on Wednesday, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pressed Iran to open an official
dialogue as a first step toward drawing a ``road map'' for the
eventual normalization of relations, but Iran has repeatedly
refused.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami became president in 1997, one of his main themes
has been the need for a ``dialogue among civilizations,'' code
words for bridging the gap between an Islamic government like
Iran's, which is still subject to U.S. economic sanctions, and
secular nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed making 2001 the year of such dialogue in his maiden
speech before the General Assembly two years ago. Tuesday's event
was the kickoff of that endeavor as well as the prelude to the
opening of the annual Assembly session and the three-day summit
meeting that will bring together more than 150 world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's appearance Tuesday was dramatically different from his
U.N. debut two years ago. Back then he had been president for a
little more than a year, and he wooed a receptive global audience
with talk of how freedom-loving and law-abiding Iran was becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Iran's reformist press is shut down, many of its reformist
journalists and clerics have been imprisoned and its judiciary,
dominated by ultraconservative clerics, is determined to punish any
behavior it considers un-Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, who
under the country's constitution wields much more power than
Khatami, stunned the nation when he directly intervened in the
affairs of the newly elected Parliament, ordering it not to
consider amending a restrictive press law.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, vigilantes forcibly prevented two reformist
leaders from speaking in the western industrial city of
Khurramabad, touching off days of rioting in which a policeman was
killed and more than 100 people were injured.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Near the Iranian mission to the United Nations Tuesday, about
the same time that Khatami was speaking, the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations sponsored a rally
demanding the release of 10 Iranian Jews convicted of espionage in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers were Gov. George Pataki of New York, Rep.
Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is running for the Senate in New York, and
a number of Democrats including Rep. Nita Lowey, also of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to send a message to the president of Iran and the
people of Iran, Pataki said. ``The ten do not stand alone. We are
in solidarity with them.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City public advocate Mark Green said, ``No more caviar
and Iranian rugs while our brothers are kept in jail.'' He was
referring to the recent easing of the economic embargo against Iran
to allow the United States to import Iranian caviar, carpets and
pistachios.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away across the street from the United Nations,
more than 1,000 Iranian protesters representing the U.S.-based
National Council of Resistance of Iran stood under a cloud of red,
white and green balloons and protested Khatami's visit and demanded
the overthrow of the Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to Khatami!'' the protesters chanted, as they waved the
flags of the Mujaheddin-e Khalq, Iran's main armed resistance
organization which the State Department defines as a terrorist
group. One of their signs read, ``Murder, torture and execution
continues in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Khatami met with a hand-picked group of 500 Iranian
businessmen, academics, students and artists, stoking their Persian
pride and exhorting them to invest in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are beating for the love of one place, and this
place is Iran,'' Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Khatami spoke, five expatriates delivered their own
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultural freedom is not relative,'' said R.K. Ramazani,
professor of government at the University of Virginia. He warned of
``national suicide'' if the Iranian people's demands for freedom
are overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Jahangir Ghaznavi, who heads a Pittsburgh investment company,
drew loud applause when he suggested ways to attract Iranian
expatriates back home.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Khatami, open the economic doors,'' he said. ``Make
coming and going in and out of the country easier. Try to guarantee
investments as is done in other countries. Remove political
obstacles for investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Khatami held a similar meeting with hundreds of
Iranian expatriates. But that time, he allowed the audience to ask
questions in what turned out to be an extraordinarily free-wheeling
exchange. This time, in a sign of the times in Iran perhaps, no
questions were allowed. There was only a box into which guests
could deposit their questions and comments.

PHYSICISTS IN GENEVA FACE DILEMMA OVER UPGRADING PARTICLE
ACCELERATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suspicions that they are seeing sketchy evidence for a
long-sought particle has put physicists in Geneva in a quandary
over whether to delay building a $4 billion particle accelerator or
to continue experiments with the current equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Like their rivals at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
outside Chicago, the Geneva physicists, at the laboratory known as
CERN, for its French acronym, have been searching for a particle
called the Higgs boson, which theoretical physicists believe may be
the source of all mass in the universe _ in effect, the reason
matter has weight.
</P>
<P>
   But the accelerator in Geneva that is producing the data is
scheduled to be shut on Oct. 1, so that the new machine can be
constructed in the same underground tunnel. The new machine, which
is to have a $500,000 contribution from the United States, would
almost certainly be powerful enough to see the Higgs, assuming that
it exists, by 2005 or 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for the Geneva scientists is that a freshly upgraded
machine at the Fermi lab may be powerful enough to make the
discovery first, after beginning operation next spring. CERN
physicists, who generally favor an extension for their existing
equipment, met Tuesday to present data from their particle
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are all thrilled,'' said Dr. Tiziano Camporesi,
spokesman for the group that is working on one of the four large
particle detectors at the accelerator. ``We have been on this
machine for more than 10 years now, and clearly this is the first
time we have seen something which might give a hint of a
discovery'' of the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, an advisory panel at CERN will make a recommendation
to the director general of the lab, Luciano Maiani, on continuing
the experiments for up to several months longer. Roger Cashmore,
the research director of the accelerator and a member of the panel,
said that despite the physicists' enthusiasm it was still not clear
what the recommendation would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to balance whether we can turn an excitement into a
bona fide reliable physics signal against big delays to the next
big project inside CERN,'' Cashmore said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, particle physicists have worked out a complex
theory, the Standard Model, which accounts for the masses of all
the known particles. It also seems to explain three of the four
known forces by which particles in the universe interact, or exert
forces, on one another.
</P>
<P>
   Those three are: the strong nuclear force, which holds together
atomic nuclei; the weak nuclear force, which causes radioactive
decay; and the electromagnetic force, whose effects are familiar
from magnets and electrically charged rods, but which also operates
at the subatomic level.
</P>
<P>
   The force of gravity, described by Einstein's theory of
relativity, has not been successfully incorporated into the
Standard Model.
</P>
<P>
   For the model to predict the particle masses, it requires the
existence of one particle unlike any other _ the Higgs boson. By
filling space with a molasseslike field of energy, the Higgs serves
as a sort of wellspring of mass for other particles. But when those
particles are smashed together violently enough in particle
accelerators, the Higgs should appear as a particle itself.
</P>
<P>
   The precise mass of the Higgs is uncertain. The heavier it is
the more powerful the accelerator that will be required to create
it in those collisions. Most of the excitement at CERN has flowed
from signals indicating that three Higgs bosons may have been
captured in one of the big particle detectors at an energy of 115
billion electron volts. The mass of a hydrogen atom, expressed in
those units, is 1 billion electron volts. But the signals could
simply be statistical flukes, and more data could confirm the
signal or wipe it out.
</P>
<P>
   If the Higgs is too heavy to be seen by the existing
accelerator, called LEP, the Fermi lab's upgraded machine will have
a shot at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globally, everybody would like the Higgs boson to be found
tomorrow,'' Chris Quigg, a Fermilab theorist, said. ``On the other
hand, some of my colleagues can't quite keep themselves from hoping
that it's really there, but LEP can't quite confirm it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Higgs does not turn up at the Fermi lab, the $4 billion
CERN machine may be able to find it starting in 2005. But that date
seems a long way off for CERN physicists who see a possible
discovery at hand.

A WITNESS TO THE FINAL JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
Sherwin B. Nuland is clinical professor of surgery at the Yale
School of Medicine and the author of ``How We Die'' (Alfred A.
Knopf). His most recent book is ``The Mysteries Within'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 2000). 
 
 By SHERWIN B. NULAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two gentle, unobtrusive voices unite the many seemingly
disparate threads that are woven into Bill Moyers' magisterial
documentary on death, ``On Our Own Terms,'' which begins Sunday
night on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the voice of Moyers himself, the temperate sound of
a compassionate understanding that never treads roughshod on the
boundaries of another's sorrow. It does not probe so much as it
simply asks and wonders. Though it is the voice of a stranger, it
speaks in the tones of a fellow seeker, which are tones not only of
one who yearns to know but also of one who yearns to ease the
burden of an inescapable passage, and an inescapable loss. It is in
the unaffected honesty of his questions and his spoken thoughts,
whether uttered to those who are to die or to those who are to lose
them, that Moyers brings to the harsh medium of television a level
of humanity and truth that will leave few viewers unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The other voice is one unheard and yet heard constantly, the
more powerful for being soundless, the more insistent for not
needing words. It is the background against which every sentence in
the entire six hours of the four-night series is spoken, and the
context in which everything must be understood. Were it possible to
set its truth to music, the tune would be played softly _ though
here and there in crescendo _ throughout each scene. By this I mean
the voice formed by the experience of witnessing the death of those
we love, or even of those whose lives have merely crossed our own.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, one or another poet or sage has tried to
express it in language, but its reality beggars the syllables. One
of those sages was the 17th-century physician Thomas Browne, and
this is the way he put it in his ``Religio Medici,'' a journal of
contemplations on the nature of man: ``With what strife and pains
we come into the world, we know not, but 'tis commonly no easy
matter to get out of it.'' For the mortally ill and those who love
them, Browne's aphorism gives voice to a sound that will ever
persist. Almost always, dying is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In this one thing, Moyers falters. He has chosen a misleading
title. Not one of the courageous men and women whom we are
privileged to meet in this documentary dies on his or her own
terms. For each of them, the terms change in the face of what is
permitted by the circumstances of disease, the setting in which it
takes place and the pragmatic necessity to modify expectations.
Compromise inevitably wins out over brave intentions. But this is
the way life is lived, and the way its final chapter is played out.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We do as well as we can, and those to whom we are introduced
here do far better than most.  &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The participants in this documentary represent a broad range of
Americans, and we meet them in a variety of settings, from
university teaching hospital to home, and even out on the Kansas
prairie. They are patients, caregivers and family members, all with
a single goal: a death as tranquil as medical science and
compassion can provide. Though the majority of those we see dying
have cancer, some are succumbing to such problems as liver failure,
degenerative neurological diseases and the destructive effects of
time on the aging body. They come to us as distinctive individuals
much like ourselves, all of whose journeys toward death are unique
to their own circumstances. Those who care for them are unique as
well, and it is in their interactions that we learn what it is like
to die in America today, when accompanied by empathetic men and
women, whether they be highly trained professionals or loving
members of one's own family.
</P>
<P>
   The great message of Moyers' work is not that people die on
their own terms, but that settings and circumstances are beginning
to change, and can change a great deal more. His is a call for
hope, and a demonstration that hope is justified, that each of the
dying may be given a level of comfort that far exceeds what has
been available until recently. The comfort to be attained is not
meant to be physical alone, but spiritual, social and even
existential. It extends to those who are left behind, and even to
the physicians, nurses and others who have consecrated their
careers to such work.
 &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Their aim, and the hope of all of us who wait to take our place
among the dying or their caregivers, is that compromises may in
time be ever lessened, and the realities come closer to the ideal
of Moyers' wishful title.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Consecrated'' is precisely the right word, in my view, for the
dedication and skill of the doctors and nurses who work in the area
known as comfort care. By letting us see them absorbed in the
moment-to-moment attentions they pay to those in their care, Moyers
helps us to understand the complexity of the problems they handle
with such sensitivity and technical expertise. It has been
extremely difficult for the vast majority of their colleagues to
reorient their efforts toward the relief of symptoms whose very
existence is a reminder of their failure to cure. The movement for
improved care of the dying has led to the founding of more than
2,300 American hospices and countless palliative care units in
hospitals. What may be most impressive to viewers is the relative
youth of the people involved in this new specialty. All but a very
few in the series appear to be no older than perhaps their early
'40s, an age at which the need to cure and the intense drive to
accomplish it _ going sometimes beyond the bounds of reason _ are
at their highest level.
</P>
<P>
   What is also impressive is the range of challenges with which
these new specialists concern themselves. Everything even remotely
connected with the patient's or family's welfare is fair game.
Complex methodologies of pain relief involving ultrasophisticated
pharmacological expertise are discussed in the same clinical
conference that emphasizes the provision of respite days for family
members, or strategies to help patients obtain financial benefits
from government or community sources. These experts are not only
doers but teachers as well, and one can sense that some of them
have already inspired their students with the importance of what
they do and the enormous emotional rewards of doing it. It is to
the example and energy of these young doers and teachers that we
can look for the vast changes that are needed.
</P>
<P>
   What is the best way for those of us who are not professionals
to take part in the campaign to improve the care of the dying?
Moyers and his medical specialists guide the audience to an answer
that follows directly from the evidence implicit in the entire
documentary. Even the finest efforts of the experts will not
suffice if there is no public structure to integrate their
contributions with those of the community and state. What will be
required is a public policy initiative to coordinate the care given
in hospitals, hospices, nursing facilities and the home, in order
not only to solve the comfort problems of the dying but also to
protect their families from bankrupting themselves. (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Much of the necessary government money is already being
ineffectively spent in a hodgepodge of scattered programs, and the
question is largely one of putting the system together and
providing smooth transitions from one part to the next. From where
will the momentum come? The answer lies in a basic principle hidden
within the sociology of medicine, which far too few people take
note of: great changes in the way health care is delivered never
originate with the profession itself but in the public demand for
betterment. When Moyers asks Dr. Joanne Lynn, the director of the
Center to Improve Care of the Dying and one of the nation's
authorities on such problems, why we don't change the system, she
smiles at her own spontaneous, self-evident answer: ``Let's do!
Let's do change it. We the people own the care system that we're
now unhappy with. So we could fix it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The time for public clamor has come. Were there a great deal
more of it we might move far closer to the ideal of Moyers' title.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such considerations are the main agenda of only the last episode
of ``On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying.'' The ones that precede it
tell the stories of the men and women who allowed Moyers and his
camera crews into their lives, to share their final chapters with
him and with us. Although some of them are reasonably prosperous
and seem to be well educated, others are not. The one
characteristic they have in common is that almost all of them not
only are extremely articulate but also have given great thought to
the nature of their sufferings, as have the remarkably devoted
members of their families.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly needs to be added that these few whom we see are also
the lucky or knowledgeable ones who have found their way into the
system, no matter its many imperfections. We never find out much
about those many others left out by the confusion of partly
adequate resources, the squandered public financing and the
continuing avoidance of their problems by the majority of the
medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   Moyers' technique seems deceptively simple: he just lets the
cameras roll while the life of the family or the care unit is going
on. There are no abrupt transitions or endings _ everything is
allowed to complete itself no matter how long it takes, and no
matter the appearance of trivialities that few directors would
allow. It is in the trivialities _ like a child's gift of flowers
to his dying grandmother, or the taking of a family photograph _
that the real art of this production lies, and the real beauty.
</P>
<P>
   It is also in the seeming trivialities that we learn what it is
like to witness the dying of someone about whom we have come to
care, even through this peculiar medium of television. Not a single
participant in these many dramas seems so much as aware of the
filming. They are saying and doing the kinds of things they must
certainly say and do every day of the lives that they so generously
reveal to us.
</P>
<P>
   To accompany the dying is to find something of the divine within
ourselves. Somehow, by force of exquisite insight and a unique kind
of empathy for his subjects and his audience, Bill Moyers has
enabled us to do it. It is an extraordinary accomplishment. Through
it all moves Moyers himself, never prompting, never intrusive,
never more than the voice of the humanity that is in each of us,
and the witness to a particular form of grace.

 SCRANTON, Pa.: of 1997.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health care issues _ most particularly the spiraling cost of
prescription drugs for the elderly _ are some of the most potent
ones on the campaign trail this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's entry into the debate now sets up a sharp competition for
the votes of the elderly who are concerned about health care. In a
sign of just how intent the Democrats are to hold on to their
traditional advantage on the issue, the Democratic National
Committee announced Tuesday that it would begin running a
commercial that seizes on a ruling by a federal judge that Texas
has violated a 1996 agreement to improve its Medicaid program for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush says he has a plan to improve children's health
care, but why hasn't he done it in Texas?'' the ad asks. Texas is
appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Gore came out with his own prescription drug plan months ago.
Showing the philosophical difference between the two parties, it is
more expensive that Bush's _ costing at least $253 billion over 10
years _ and it creates the prescription drug benefit inside the
traditional Medicare program. His coverage for people with
catastrophic drug costs would kick in after a beneficiary spent
$4,000 on medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would pay all drug costs for the approximately 13
million uncovered Medicare recipients with incomes up to about
$11,300 a year. For those with higher incomes, his plan would pay
half of a Medicare recipient's drug costs up to $5,000 a year. Once
that cap is met beneficiaries would pay out of pocket up to an
additional $1,500. After that catastrophic coverage would kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say the uniform nature of their plan is part of its
appeal _ that it would effectively give Medicare vast purchasing
power and the ability to extract deep discounts from drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, the trade group that represents the major drug companies
in Washington, said that the group's experts were still reviewing
the details of Bush's plan and could not say yet whether they
supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Neil B. Sweig, a drug industry analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co., said
that Bush's plan was clearly more ``favorable'' to the drug
companies and to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, much like the drug industry, criticized Gore's plan
Tuesday as a step toward government price controls. ``By making
government agents the largest purchaser of prescription drugs in
America,'' Bush said, ``by making Washington the nation's
pharmacist, the Gore plan puts us well on the way to price control
for drugs.''

 NEW YORK: Boress said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health costs are ``out of control,'' said Elyse Hanan, executive
producer of Zap Edit, a film editing company with eight employees
in Manhattan that absorbed double-digit premium increases in 1999
and this year. ``I like the plan that I have but it's a ridiculous
amount of money,'' she said. If there is a third big increase next
January, she added, ``the only doctor I'm going to be able to
afford is my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Alltel Corp., a wireless phone company with 26,000 employees, is
absorbing most, but not all, of its premium increases. It is
raising the employee payment for a visit to a doctor's office to a
$20 maximum from $15, and adding a partial payment each time an
employee checks into a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Meyer, manager of corporate benefits planning at Alltel,
said he had persuaded its HMOs to shave a few percentage points
from the proposed increases, cutting the average increases to 15
percent from 17 percent. But he said many HMOs were reluctant to
bargain. ``They have a `take it or leave it' attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The premium increases are not limited to a particular region.
The nation's second largest employee benefits provider, the
California Public Employees Retirement System, said the rates its 1
million members and their families would pay for basic HMOs with
limited service options were rising 9.2 percent, while rates for
preferred provider groups were increasing 18.8 percent, and for
Medicare HMOs, 31.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Small and mid-size employers face even steeper increases. In the
Northwest, for example, their premiums will rise 15 percent to 30
percent next year, said Richard Woolworth, chief executive of the
Regence Blue Cross and Blue Shield group in Oregon, Washington
state, Idaho and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums will rise 18 percent to 20 percent in Texas, 10 percent
to 15 percent in St. Louis and close to 10 percent in New York for
most large employers, and 14.5 percent for state employees in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Boress, executive director of the Chicago Business Group
on Health, an employer group, said many employees had singled out
point-of-service plans as a problem. One in six insured employees
were in these plans last year, according to a survey by the William
M. Mercer consulting firm. And employers called the plans ``very
expensive,'' Boress said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently advised employees that it would no
longer provide extra subsidies for point-of-service health plans,
including one operated by Cigna Corp., because costs were
practically identical to the company's basic PPO plan. Without the
subsidies, the Times said that monthly contributions by employees
in the Cigna plan would increase by roughly 80 percent. The Times
suggested that employees might consider other company health plans
in which employee contributions would rise less sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Marcus, a senior vice president of Cigna HealthCare, said
that its 4.8 million-member PPO was growing twice as fast as its
HMOs and its point-of-service plans. But she said Cigna had not
seen customers switching to PPOs from other types of plans.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans still has 77 percent of its 1.45 million
members in point of service hybrids, said Maria Shydlo, a
spokeswoman for Oxford. Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna
U.S. Healthcare, said the company was adding flexible options to
give members more choices. She said Aetna would be raising premium
rates by 13 percent next January.

FORD SAYS TIRE-DEFECT-RELATED EXPLORER CRASHES TOO INFREQUENT TO
DETECT 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The Bridgestone/Firestone tire defect now blamed
for 88 deaths, mainly from crashes of Ford Explorers, eluded
detection for so long because it occurred infrequently, even though
it proved deadlier than many problems that occur more often in
vehicles, Ford Motor and congressional investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees will conduct hearings on Wednesday
to examine what Firestone, Ford and federal regulators knew about
the tire problems, when they knew it, and how they reacted.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators and Ford disagreed Tuesday about the
significance of the fact that Firestone customers turned in few of
the millions of tires for replacement under warranty, yet Firestone
received a high number of claims of property damage, personal
injury and death.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of
one of the subcommittees holding hearings scheduled on Wednesday,
said that the problem was ``a lethal combination of a somewhat
unstable vehicle'' with tires prone to shed their treads at high
speed. His own Ford Explorer, a green 1992 model, has been sitting
in his garage for a month, he said, because he cannot find
replacement tires for it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ford denied that a low rate of warranty complaints,
coupled with numerous crash claims, implied that anything was wrong
with the Explorer. Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said that many of
the crashes involved tires on which the warranty had expired, so
that warranty data would not have provided a clue about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Explorers equipped with Goodyear tires from
1995 to 1997 have had virtually no problems. Even with the tire
problems, Explorers have a lower death rate in rollovers per
million vehicles on the road than other midsized sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for environment and
safety issues, said that the warranty data was not always
appropriate for spotting safety problems because it included a lot
of ``chaff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will complain, `I don't like the way the white
lettering is,' or `it's noisy,''' Petrauskas said. ``If you have
property and injury claims, chances are you've captured the more
serious thing that has happened with the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin also complained that Ford had replaced tires for
customers in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Malaysia, among other
places, without telling the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   A Firestone document sent to Ford in March 1999 said that the
tire maker did not want to recall tires in Saudi Arabia partly
because it did not want to alert American regulators, Ford
confirmed Tuesday. The automaker said that it then recalled the
vehicles at its own expense to replace the tires and that Firestone
had insisted to Ford that the same tires in the United States had a
tiny rate of warranty claims.
</P>
<P>
   Petrauskas said in a briefing with reporters that Ford
voluntarily informs American regulators of recalls abroad ``if
there's reason to believe that there's a safety defect in the
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company accepted Firestone's assurances that the
problems in those countries were not relevant to conditions in the
United States, after Firestone engineers dissected sample tires
shipped back to Akron, Ohio, Petrauskas said. Citing Firestone
analyses that failures in Saudi Arabia, in particular, were caused
by improper repairs and severe underinflation, she said she was
still not persuaded that tire problems overseas were relevant to
problems in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ford released a documents intended to show that it
carefully examined tires when foreign customers complained about
them, but it failed to spot a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, which is owned by Bridgestone Corp. of Japan,
repeatedly said that the problem was improper repairs or extended
operation at extremely low tire pressures, or both, Petrauskas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that rollovers had occurred in 85 of the 1,424
American tread separation cases involving tires now being recalled,
which are ATX and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size, plus
Wilderness tires of the same size that were made in Decatur, Ill.
Most of the deaths, however, occurred in rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, which will probably face criminal charges in
Venezuela, had no comment before the hearings..
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Bridgestone are both liable for damages resulting from
crashes, Tauzin said Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Bridgestone/Firestone presentation at the International Tire
Exhibition and Conference two years ago in Akron reviewed the tire
maker's experiments with a Ford Explorer equipped with the kind of
tire that was recalled last month. A tire company engineer
concluded that if the tread separated, the result was ``well within
the range of a driver's ability to control a vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford provided a copy of the document, but plaintiffs' lawyers,
and even some Ford officials, say that the bang that accompanies
the tire failure could startle a motorist into swerving or braking
sharply, either one of which could lead to a fatal crash.

IT'S THE `SERIOUS' SEASON, AND OTHER MYTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every culture cherishes the myths and rituals by which it marks
the change of seasons, and associates different times of the year
with appropriate modes of expression. According to the literary
critic Northrop Frye, each of the four seasons of the Northern
Hemisphere has given rise to a correlative genre: satire belongs to
winter, comedy to spring, romance to summer and tragedy to fall.
Our present civilization has little appetite for tragedy, but a
wispy shadow of Frye's theory persists, as the coming of autumn
brings children back to school and putatively serious movies back
into the multiplexes. As the days grow shorter, the running times
grow longer. Special effects give way to feats of costume and set
design. The box office sprints of the Memorial and Independence Day
weekends, and the damaged-goods studio yard sales of late August,
are soon forgotten as the long march toward Christmas _ and the
Oscars _ begins. Hollywood, after a three-month revel in expensive
triviality, knits its brow and dons its glasses to signal a renewed
commitment to expensive importance.
</P>
<P>
   This, at any rate, is the myth, though a recent article in
Variety _ with the enchanting headline ``Fall Films Favor Frothy
Fare'' _ suggests that its power and relevance may be diminishing.
The film industry's autumnal hopes seem to be pinned, for the
moment, on a live-action adaptation, ``Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch
Stole Christmas,'' and an updating of the '70s television show
``Charlie's Angels,'' which not even those of us who decorated our
bedrooms with pictures of its crime-fighting stars ever considered
a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   There are further signs that cinematic seriousness has fallen on
hard times. In another article in the same issue, Variety reported
that ``art films'' _ art in the quantitative sense, meaning movies
shown on 600 or fewer screens nationwide _ had suffered a 14
percent decline in box office revenues so far this year, as
compared with 1999 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among critics, the nervous high spirits of 1999 _ a year that
seemed to herald a revival of risky, innovative American filmmaking
(tribute to which was paid by the Academy's embrace of the tame,
derivative ``American Beauty'') _ have dissipated, leaving an air
of gloom and resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this pessimism reflects a momentary and recurrent mood
swing _ for most of its history, at least since the coming of the
talkies, the cinema has been reported by somebody or other to be in
decline _ or a true intimation of mortality remains to be seen. In
any case, the love of an art form that is the critic's first
obligation often expresses itself as a protective grumpiness about
the art's current prospects. But it does seem worthwhile to ask, in
the spirit of love as well as duty, what we mean by calling some
movies serious, and how we go about taking them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   These questions are more complicated than they sound, and any
attempt to address them risks tripping the buried land mines of
past debates _ between Sarrisites and Kaelites, between humanists
and formalists, between worshipers at the shrine of difficulty and
pagan celebrants in the cult of pop. The past century has witnessed
a series of attempts to draw, to blur and to erase altogether the
boundaries that separate high culture from low. The movies, which
have done more than any other medium to upend such lazy and
invidious distinctions, have nonetheless been irresistible to those
who rely on them. A reflexive snobbery based on uncritical
valuation of the foreign, the arty, the ``independent'' often
confronts an equally automatic sham-populist deference to mass
taste.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth _ a truth every moviegoer and honest critic
instinctively knows _ is that you can't judge experience according
to prefabricated categories. There are plenty of dull, meretricious
films dressed up (or down, given the current art house bias in
favor of the hand-held and the rough-hewn) in the trappings of art,
and just as many gaudy commercial toys that turn out to be vehicles
of aesthetic transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   Another myth that seems especially dear these days to critics of
literature and pop music as well as movies is the myth of the lost
heroic age, in whose shadow the sickly, pale inhabitants of the
present are doomed to labor. The memory of two such ages haunts
critics, audiences and filmmakers alike: the nearer one is the
golden, squandered moment of the New Hollywood, which unfolded in
the decade between ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Star Wars'' _ the era
of ``Nashville'' and the ``Godfather'' movies, of ``Mean Streets''
and ``Chinatown'' and Pauline Kael. This moment, sometimes called
the era of American auteurism, saw the late flowering of seeds
planted in the first golden age, a decade or so earlier, which
witnessed, among other developments, the adaptation of the auteur
theory to an American context, the founding of the New York Film
Festival, the canonization of classic Hollywood, and the cresting
of the French New Wave.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '50s and early '60s, through the efforts of a
dedicated cadre of critics, editors, repertory programmers and
besotted cinephiles (or film buffs, if you prefer), a lively and
serious film culture began to emerge in the larger American cities,
filtering out onto college campuses and suburban film clubs. The
institutional and intellectual achievement of this culture was
substantial: its adherents led the way in efforts to preserve the
movies of the past, recognized the embattled craftsmen of the old
Hollywood as important artists, and made elevated critical
discussion of movies seem both urgent and chic. ``We looked to
filmmakers to be our novelists, our sages,'' Philip Lopate has
written in ``Anticipation of La Notte,'' his wry, clearsighted
essay on his own youthful movie mania. ``Film enjoyed as never
before (or since) the prestige of high culture.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Lopate's reminiscence, happily, is concerned less
with prestige than with pleasure, and the critical essays collected
in his engaging 1998 book ``Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' are,
like any criticism worth reading, evidence that seriousness is an
ennobled form of delight. Is it also an endangered one? Movies are
bigger than ever. Have our ways of talking about them gotten small?
Each year more of them flicker across our screens _ and there is,
suddenly, a glut of screens, with new megaplexes sprouting from
Times Square to Tulsa _ or illuminate our living rooms. But the
film culture whose heroic age Lopate celebrates survives in
fragments. The ``film generation,'' the transformative impact of
whose arrival the critic Stanley Kauffman hailed nearly 40 years
ago, has been succeeded, with breathtaking and brutal speed, by
generations reared on rock 'n' roll, on television and now online.
</P>
<P>
   The relations between these generations _ the tangle of envy,
impatience, admiration and bewilderment that informs their regard
for each other _ is a central and underacknowledged fact of our
culture and our politics. To those filmgoers born too late to see
``L'Avventura'' in its initial run, or who never set foot in the
Thalia or the old second-run theaters of Times Square, who first
saw ``The Godfather'' on video and ``Breathless'' on cable _ to
most of the movie audience, in other words _ the endless hymning of
the glories of the past can seem like a dropped gauntlet we
hesitate to pick up
</P>
<P>
   How can the delights of different ages be compared? Isn't my
formative enchantment with Molly Ringwald the equal of your
undergraduate lust for Julie Christie or Anouk Aimee? Is my ``Dazed
and Confused'' worth less than your ``Dolce Vita''? Isn't it all
just a matter of taste?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, but there's more to taste than knowing what you like,
and if lived experiences are incommensurable with each other, works
of art nonetheless demand to be ranked, judged and argued about _
that's part of the fun. It's also, I'm tempted to say, a fact of
human nature. Arguments about whether the movies are on the verge
of death or the cusp of a new golden age _ thanks to digital video,
computer-generated imagery, the internet, Dogma 95, globalization
or Adam Sandler _ are likely to continue. A new golden age _ the
indie moment, the Chinese new wave, the discovery of Iran _ may be
just behind us, or just ahead. (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL
MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   The more important arguments, the ones that will determine the
future of this protean and impatient (and still young) art form,
will be about particular movies. Here, perhaps, there is cause for
some concern. The rise first of the video store and then of the
Internet has made movies and the discussion of them more accessible
than ever before. These technologies have also contributed to the
fragmentation of audiences, and the triumph of niche marketing and
complacent subjectivism. The film industry, with serious money on
the line, helps to trivialize its product, drowning conversation in
bullying hype. Movies, whose expense demands that they remain a
mass medium, get bigger and smaller at the same time _ either gaudy
baubles or tiny diamonds in the rough. Some you can't see: a trip
to the new 12-screen movie palace ends in the discovery that half
of the screens are devoted to half-hourly showings of the same
blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   In the golden year of 1999, already receding into myth, several
brilliantly unlikely American movies _ ``Being John Malkovich,''
``Boys Don't Cry'' _ broke through to audiences. But a number of
others _ ``Election,'' ``Three Kings'' and ``Go'' _ foundered in
spite of the ardor of critics. Others arrive disfigured by the
sham-democracy of test-marketing and the bureaucratic
authoritarianism of top-down scriptwriting by committee. This year
has so far seen the release of a number of interesting movies _
``Jesus' Son,'' ``Chuck and Buck,'' ``American Psycho'' and at
least a half-dozen more _ that seemed to require, and to languish
in the absence of, the protective embrace and the critical scrutiny
of a devoted audience.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of the three films just mentioned _ Alison Maclean,
Miguel Arteta and Mary Harron _ have each now made two commercial
features that show them to be stylistically daring and
intellectually curious. They and other emerging voices, including
those who have been graced with the success to allow them their
choice of projects, are in need of defenders and debunkers. The
serious movies are out there, in search of a culture. &QL;

 (EDS: SUBS to supply substitutions for numbers that should appear
in scientific notation, in 14th graf and throughout; e.g., `(10 to
the 16th) joules' sted `1016 joules')   By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the corporate enthusiasm over the unveiling of each new
generation of computer chip (last month Intel announced that its
Pentium 4 would be packed with 42 million transistors performing as
many as 8.4 billion operations per second), consumers may be more
apt to feel a sense of dread. Once again the expensive desktop
computers and laptops they were so proud of have become outmoded,
destined to join the scrap piles of unsalable equipment
accumulating in closets everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's law, which holds that computing power doubles
approximately every 18 months, therefore sometimes seems less a
blessing than a curse. But the law cannot hold forever, and Seth
Lloyd, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offers hope that the end is
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper in the current issue of Nature, Lloyd describes the
ultimate laptop _ a computer as powerful as the laws of physics
would allow. So energetic is this imaginary machine that using it
would be like harnessing a thermonuclear reaction. In the most
extreme version of this computer supreme, so much computational
circuitry would be packed into so small a space that the whole
thing would collapse from its own gravity forming a tiny black
hole, an object so dense that not even light can escape its
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a rather dangerous device to hold on one's
lap _ ``Opening the lid,'' Lloyd warns, ``voids the warranty'' _
there is a serious purpose to his theoretical tour de force: to
plumb the absolute limits nature sets on computation.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like Lloyd's Ultimate Laptop is likely to ever roll off
the assembly line at some future Apple or IBM. But his effort, part
of a relatively new discipline called the physics of information,
gives computer engineers an ideal to aim for. More importantly,
this exercise in extreme computer science may help deepen the
understanding of the connections between physics and information,
and explore the notion, popular among many theorists, that the very
processes of nature can be thought of as computations.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law, named for its formulator Gordon Moore, a founder of
Intel, has continued to hold true because of the dexterity with
which engineers have been able to inscribe smaller and smaller
circuitry onto silicon computer chips. As the components of the
circuits are squeezed closer and closer together, they can exchange
information at increasingly faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been predicting the demise of Moore's law pretty
much since it was posited in the early '60s because some
manufacturing technology was about to run out,'' Lloyd said. ``But
Moore's law is a law of human ingenuity rather than of nature.
Predictions of its demise have been wrong because people are
ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, engineers have continued to find ways to make the
circuits smaller and faster.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishingly tiny components on a chip can be thought of as
switches that can be in two positions, either on or off _
representing a bit of information, 1 or 0. Minuscule as they seem,
each of these devices is typically made of about a billion atoms.
But laboratories are already experimenting with computers in which
a bit is stored by a single atom that can spin clockwise or
counterclockwise, indicating a 1 or a 0. And who is to say that the
grain could not someday be even finer with subatomic particles like
quarks or gluons or even the hypothetical superstrings harnessed to
encode and manipulate information?
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the limits of nature must prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believe the laws of physics,'' Lloyd said, ``then the
fundamental constants of nature should tell us where Moore's law
absolutely has to end, where we can't miniaturize any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd approached the problem like a consumer in the market for a
new laptop. ``If you're going out to buy a computer,'' he said,
``you have two basic questions: how fast is it and how much memory
space does it have?'' Those are the ingredients of computing power.
He assumed that his laptop would have about the same dimensions as
a contemporary one, weighing a kilogram, 2.2 pounds, and occupying
1 liter of space.
</P>
<P>
   First he set out to determine how fast his ultimate laptop could
compute. The limiting factor here is energy: the faster a computer
runs, the more voracious its appetite. So what would be the maximum
possible energy available to a portable machine?
</P>
<P>
   One could speculate endlessly on the future of battery
technology. Seeking a more fundamental answer, Lloyd looked to
Einstein's special theory of relativity. If every particle of the
laptop's kilogram of mass is converted into energy according to the
equation E(EQ)mc2 , the answer is 8.9874 x (10 to the 16th) joules
_ or in more familiar terms, 25 million megawatt-hours, the amount
of energy produced by all the world's nuclear power plants in 72
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine would be cannibalizing its own mass to perform its
operations,'' Lloyd mused. No engineer from Eveready or Duracell
could ever squeeze more juice from a chunk of matter.
</P>
<P>
   There would be obvious practical considerations to controlling
(and computing with) what would amount to thermonuclear fusion.
(Lloyd speculated that the computer's ``circuitry'' might consist
of electrons and antimatter positrons, signaling each other with
gamma rays.) But the details are unimportant. Ultimate computer
science is not about what is probable but what is possible. The
rest can be left to the engineers.

   ISRAEL-DEFENSE _ JERUSALEM _ In a country flush with military

behind you.'' In truth, of course, it's the other way around.
American aid makes up about a quarter of Israel's defense budget,
including nearly half its equipment, comes free from America. But,
even as Israeli officials prepare to ask for increases in aid with
President Clinton's encouragement, some say that Israel's defense
dependence on American aid may be doing more harm than good. WAN:

   RAD-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a typical
childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police shootouts.
Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was constantly
shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the neighborhood
ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black Panther Party
leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about growing up in
a communal home and attending a grade school where students read
Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this swashbuckling
idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a child it all
seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about growing up in
the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights movement. The
people at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous,
lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of the movement _
the offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The Children of the
Movement have followed many roads in recent years. Some continue to
carry on their parents' work. Others want only to forget their
childhood. Here are the stories of nine of them. (Blake, Atlanta

   GLOBAL-WARMING _Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in the
last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millenium has given
millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer world
grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions about ways
to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James Hansen, one
of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global warming 20
years ago, suggests that industrialized nations struggling to
implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions called for under
the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing the wrong
villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner, Atlanta

 &HT;    Four are fantastic for women's tour
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The real U.S. Open women's draw begins today.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams plays Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinals,
where one of the Fab Four of the WTA Tour actually could lose.
</P>
<P>
   The other ``Fabs'' _ Martina Hingis and Venus Williams _ are
expected to meet in the semifinals Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The WTA Tour never has had at one time four players so good and
so evenly matched. The four have won 10 of the last 15 Grand Slam
titles. In the U.S. Open, they have won 34 of their 36 sets.
</P>
<P>
   And each one of them believes that she is the best female tennis
player on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I deserve to be No. 1,'' said Venus Williams, who
is No. 3 in the rankings. ``There's no way I'm going to say, `I'm
happy at No. 3; I like it here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won a tour-leading 24 matches in a row. She also
has gone 4-0 against the other three, defeating each at least once.
</P>
<P>
   But her sister, Serena, is the defending champion here. Serena
was the tour's toughest to beat last year, with a leading 41-7
(.854) record. She is 7-2 against the other Fabs over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Serena's development has been impeded by the tendinitis in her
knee that kept her out of the Australian Open, and by the burden of
sibling rivalry; she is 1-4 against Venus.
</P>
<P>
   That record is not from lack of confidence. Serena picks herself
to win here and expects to see Venus in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an opportunity that would just be magnificent,''
she said. ``It's what we've wanted our whole careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters are 42-1 since Wimbledon when not playing
each other, prompting Serena to add, ``Everyone wants to beat a
Williams sister now. It's the person to beat. That's just the way
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelena Dokic, whom Serena beat Monday, agreed. ``They're
probably the two players at the moment that are just _ they're
unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that's what they were saying earlier this year about
Davenport when she won 36 of 37 matches over seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Australian Open, Davenport had won three of the last
six majors. Then, an injury to her left ankle forced her out of two
clay-court tournaments, and a back injury ruined two more, leading
to a first-round loss at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Wimbledon, where Venus beat her 6-3, 7-6 in the final,
Davenport claimed she was just 70 percent. Then, she sprained her
foot three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited (in the U.S. Open) when I realized I was
going to be able to play 100 percent with no pain, being able to
give it all I got,'' Davenport said. ``The last Grand Slams, it
hasn't been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Hingis, merely the No. 1-ranked player. Head to
head against the others, Hingis' case is weak. She is 2-7 over the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hingis has been the most efficient through four rounds here.
She is averaging just eight errors per match. Hingis has no
double-faults; Venus has 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to beat Martina is if you overpower her,'' Monica
Seles said. ``She's the best at her style of game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis also leads the tour in wins (54) and could be No. 1 in
winning percentage by knocking off Venus in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Williamses, I think so far I've been better than them,''
said Hingis, noting that she has five major titles, the same as the
other three combined. ``I haven't been injured as them. It's just
the consistency. That's what counts to be No. 1, not who wins the
most tournaments or hits the ball the fastest.... So we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting tonight.

 UNDATED: the engineers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next step was to determine the maximum speed one can get
from all that energy _ how rapidly the little switches can be
flipped between 1 and 0, carrying out their calculations. Here
Lloyd turned to quantum mechanics, the quirky rules that govern the
behavior of subatomic particles _ specifically, Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle, which shows how time is related to energy.
One multiplies pi by the number called Planck's constant and
divides by twice the available energy. Applied to the ultimate
laptop, the answer is 5.4258 x (10 to the 50th) operations per
second _ about 10,000 trillion trillion trillion times speedier
than the Pentium 4. A computer that fast could never be obsolete _
not in this universe, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   These limits would hold true no matter what kind of
technological breakthroughs lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether you're computing with vacuum tubes
or transistors or using quarks and gluons or something even more
exotic like superstrings,'' Lloyd said. Relativity and quantum
mechanics promise that is as fast as the ultimate laptop can be.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it matter how the computer is designed. The energy can
be used to power one extremely fast processor or many slower ones.
Either way, the maximum possible number of operations per second is
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he had put an upper limit on speed, Lloyd wanted to see
how big he could make the machine's memory _ how many bits of
information could be stored and manipulated at those blazing
speeds. Every atom or even every electron could be used to register
a 1 or a 0, depending on which way it was spinning. But to store
the maximum amount of information, the little processors would have
to be free to assume as many different states as possible. At
intense energies, information might be encoded not just by the spin
of a particle but also by the speed and direction in which it was
moving inside the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to take full advantage of the memory space available,
the ultimate laptop must turn all its matter into energy,'' Lloyd
explained. ``A typical state of the ultimate laptop's memory looks
like a thermonuclear explosion or a little piece of the Big Bang!
Clearly, packaging issues alone make it unlikely that this limit
can be obtained, even setting aside the difficulties of stability
and control.''
</P>
<P>
   An object like this, so packed with energy that its particles
are as free as they can possibly be, is said to be in a state of
maximum entropy. Though more commonly thought of as a measure of
disorder _ a vaporized laptop being less orderly than one at room
temperature _ entropy can also be used to calculate the amount of
information something can hold. (The orderly atoms in a crystal can
occupy fewer possible states and hold less information than the
swarming atoms in a gas.)
</P>
<P>
   For the ultimate laptop, the maximum entropy corresponds to an
information capacity of about 2.13 x (10 to the 31st) bits _ a
billion trillion times more than today's laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving so vast a memory might not be as unrealistic as it
sounds. In a kilogram of matter there are approximately 1,025
atomic nuclei, each of which could store a bit without vaporizing
the entire mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can get quite close to the ultimate physical limit of
memory without having to resort to thermonuclear explosions,''
Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Until this point, Lloyd had been constraining himself to a
laptop with a volume of one liter. By imagining it even smaller, he
knew, he could pack the kilogram of particle-size components even
tighter, speeding up the information flow and shortening the time
it takes to do long, step-by-step calculations. He would be
sacrificing memory (there would be less room to store information)
for speed _ a common tradeoff in designing computers.
</P>
<P>
   So in the final act of his thought experiment, he programmed the
ultimate laptop to solve a formidable problem (cracking a secret
code or something like that) and imagined it shrinking and
shrinking _ to the size of a wallet, then a credit card, then a
postage stamp. Smaller and smaller until its radius is a mere
centimeter (10-2 meters), then a millionth of a meter (10-6 ), then
a billionth (10-9 ).
</P>
<P>
   When the laptop has shrunk to 10-27 meters (a billionth the size
of a proton), it crosses what is called the Schwarzschild radius:
So much mass is packed into so little space that the whole thing
collapses, sucking itself into a tiny black hole.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may be convinced that they already own a black hole
laptop, imploding at the worst possible moments and irretrievably
swallowing data. Owning the real thing would surely be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to some theories, however, information thrown down a
black hole does not disappear, but is displayed on the hole's
surface. Each pixel of this screen would occupy one square Planck
length, 10-35 by 10-35 square meters, the smallest area conceivable
by the laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   Some theorists, in fact, believe that the information about
everything that falls into any black hole is projected in this
manner _ that each one of these sink holes is, in a sense,
processing information. Taking the vision even further, some
imagine all the particles in the universe trading bits of data as
readily as they trade energy _ the universe as a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the long-term consequence of this work is
not building a black hole computer, which would be a dangerous
thing to do,'' Lloyd said, ``but seeing whether we can understand
how nature itself processes information.''

   NEW FUNDS FOR MILLENNIUM DOME

   Threatened once again with bankruptcy, the operators of
Britain's ill-starred Millennium Dome attraction won a fresh
injection of $74 million from National Lottery funds to remain open
until the end of the year. The Dome has so far cost about $957
million in public financing but has failed to attract enough
visitors to cover costs. It was sold in July for $157 million to a
consortium led by of Japan, which takes over at the end of the year
with plans to change the attraction into a theme park. An

Brazilian economy has seen output above 6 percent. Production of
non-durable goods, including food and tobacco, continues to lag
growth elsewhere in the economy as high unemployment and low wages
affect consumer purchasing power. Consumer prices rose 1.55 percent
in Sao Paulo in August, according to the Economic Research

FEW THAT LOOK WORTH THE EXTRA WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 By   CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a television season whose big names include Bette Midler,
Geena Davis and Gabriel Byrne, all starring in sitcoms, the most
promising series belong to Andre Braugher, David E. Kelley and some
guy who looks like David Letterman. Their shows are not entirely
original; let's be realistic, that is not what most television
series do. Yet they accomplish something equally good, breathing
fresh life into traditional genres.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital drama is obviously coming to the end of its cycle,
with ``Chicago Hope'' dead and ``ER'' old enough in television
years (six) to enter the geriatric ward. ``Gideon's Crossing''
(ABC, Wednesdays at 10) gives it a new depth by focusing on one
intense, humane doctor, played by Andre Braugher of ``Homicide.''
His character, Ben Gideon, may be softer than Frank Pembleton, the
uncompromising detective who was the vehicle for some of the best
acting on the air during that show's run.
</P>
<P>
   But Gideon and the new show have some similarities to Pembleton
and ``Homicide'' that are cause for optimism. Gideon, a widower
with two small children, shares Pembleton's soul-searching
tendencies. The show was created by Paul Attanasio, a creator of
``Homicide'' (and the writer of the film ``Quiz Show''). Though the
medical stories are crucial, with Ruben Blades playing Gideon's
friend and hospital colleague, the show promises to replace the
fast-paced, ensemble approach of ``ER'' with a sharper focus on
character and psychology. In most seasons one drama emerges from
the buzz of hype as the most intelligent (not the same as most
likely to succeed). This season that show is undoubtedly ``Gideon's
Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   In general the dramas are more enticing than the comedies this
year, and another exceptionally promising one is created by David
E. Kelley, who may not be a movie star but is the biggest of
television names behind the scenes. He created the comedy-drama of
``Ally McBeal,'' but with ``Boston Public'' (Fox, Mondays at 8) he
tries to do for teachers in a Boston high school what his terrific
dramatic series ``The Practice'' does for lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the characters on ``The Practice,'' the teachers in
``Boston Public'' are imperfect, under stress, facing a range of
up-to-date problems. It has been 20 years since teachers were
television heroes, and then it was in second-rate '70s shows like
``Room 222'' or ``The White Shadow.'' ``Boston Public'' reflects
changing times with plots that include violence and a student Web
site that scatologically lampoons a teacher. Kelley's sensibility
and writing, smartly attuned to the ambiguity of social problems,
should distinguish this as more than a show about teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Among comedies, there is one clear standout: ``Welcome to New
York'' (CBS, Wednesdays at 8:30), set in a television newsroom that
is far away, in miles and in tone, from the Minneapolis station
that sheltered Mary Richards in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Christine Baranski plays the acerbic, jaded executive
producer of a morning news program. She hires a Midwestern
weatherman (a job David Letterman actually used to have), whose
culture shock includes the backbiting and paranoia of his ruthless
colleagues. The weatherman is played by Jim Gaffigan, who looks and
sounds a lot like the early Dave (same sandy hair, same round face)
without the sarcasm. Since Letterman's company, Worldwide Pants, is
one of the show's producers, let's assume this is intentional.
Gaffigan's engaging demeanor, Baranski's better-known comic edge
and the series' sharp writing allow ``Welcome to New York'' to rise
above its unlikely premise.
</P>
<P>
   While the most promising dramas and sitcoms do not come from the
season's most glittery Hollywood names, the most anticipated
miniseries does. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are executive
producers of ``Band of Brothers,'' a 10-part miniseries (HBO,
starting in June) set during World War II. The setting evokes
``Saving Private Ryan,'' and the producers' cachet has made this
among the biggest-budgeted miniseries ever at $130 million. The
series is based on the historian Stephen Ambrose's book about an
Army rifle company that parachuted into France on D-Day. The
soldiers are played by a group of little-known actors, though the
various directors include Hanks and Phil Alden Robinson (``Field of
Dreams''). ``Band of Brothers'' is poised to tap into the
regenerated hero worship of those who took part in World War II,
the spirit that has made the title of Tom Brokaw's best-selling
book ``The Greatest Generation'' enter the language as a common
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Don't anticipate any of this too soon. Because of the Olympics,
not to mention interruptions by the World Series and possibly
presidential debates, the networks have agreed that the new season
will not begin until October this year. Some new series will begin
as late as November. In a perfect world, that would give the less
promising shows time to whip themselves into better shape. Keep
dreaming. Keep in mind that having three new series to anticipate
with real enthusiasm is three more than you can find in some
seasons. &QL;

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Gore campaign released a detailed economic
blueprint for the next decade on Tuesday, including a $300 billion
hedge against overly optimistic budget projections, a commitment to
eliminate the national debt and a broad variety of socioeconomic
goals like increasing family income, reducing poverty and narrowing
the gap in wages between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is to discuss the plan, much of it a synthesis of proposals
he has made over the last several months, in a speech here on
Wednesday. Details are being published in a 200-page book, unique
in modern presidential campaigns in that it is essentially a budget
proposal that will serve as an economic and political manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   The number-heavy and footnoted book, which was made available to
The New York Times, underscores Gore's determination to supply
specifics in his policy proposals and is intended to serve as a
counterweight to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, which the
Gore camp regards as light on policy and based largely on
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book anticipates criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that what we are doing here defies conventional
wisdom, putting out a detailed economic plan, full of specifics for
our opponents to ridicule, attack or belittle,'' Gore and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, wrote in the introduction.
``But we think that the American people are entitled to know what
we would do to grow our prosperity if elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers denied any suggestion that the release of the plan
was timed to offset Bush's issuance of his Medicare overhaul
proposal on Tuesday. The Gore campaign drafted its plan for months
with help from Clinton administration experts like Robert E. Rubin,
former treasury secretary; Laura D. Tyson, former chairwoman of the
Council of Economic Advisers; and Gene Sperling, President
Clinton's top economic adviser. Rubin is to join Gore for the
presentation here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said its blueprint was the road to continued
economic expansion. And Gore's goals, like reducing the poverty
level to below 10 percent for the first time in history, and
increasing the number of college graduates depend on that
continuation.
</P>
<P>
   So does his plan to set aside $300 billion over the decade as a
cushion against shortfalls in projections by the Congressional
Budget Office, which estimates a surplus of $1.8 trillion, the same
estimates used by the Bush campaign. The Clinton administration has
used the more conservative estimates of the Office of Management
and Budget, which amount to $1.4 trillion. Senior Gore advisers
said that if the administration estimates proved correct, no
reserve fund would be set aside.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of the Gore budget prepared by the Senate Budget
Committee, headed by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) says that Gore has
proposed such extensive spending that he would even have to dip
into Social Security to pay for his programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the largest expansion of federal spending
since the days of Lyndon Johnson, and a significant portion will
have to come out of the Social Security surplus,'' said Bob
Stevenson, spokesman for the committee. ``Based on our analysis,
he's already devoured all of the available non-Social Security
surplus, so if his intention is to set up a $300 billion rainy day
fund, he would have to take it out of the Social Security
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign says that its program is sound and would
eliminate the publicly held federal debt by 2012, while Bush's, it
said, would leave the government $2.8 trillion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described his plan as ``comprehensive and detailed and
chock full of specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan says that through increased productivity, a Gore
administration could raise family incomes by one-third over the
next decade. It estimates productivity growth at 2.8 percent
annually, by paying down the debt, investing in biomedical research
and computer technology and opening more markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing all these things, and much more, we can grow incomes
faster than any 10-year period ever recorded,'' the plan says. ``As
a result, after-tax incomes would grow by one-third over the next
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign says that it has proposed targeted tax cuts
amounting to $500 billion over 10 years, but Republicans said these
are illusory and so complicated that no one can be sure how much
anyone will save. The Senate analysis says the proposals amount to
$300 billion.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Pakistan's military ruler said on Tuesday that
he saw no hope of solving the explosive issue of Kashmir through
negotiations with India and that he would appeal to world leaders
on Wednesday for the type of international mediation that ended the
Indonesian occupation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani general, Pervez Musharraf, who took power in a
coup last Oct. 12, said in an interview that India had squandered
several recent opportunities to start serious talks with the
Kashmiris, as well as with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is mediation, strong mediation, justice cannot
come about,'' Musharraf said. ``Mediation is definitely required,
and East Timor provides an excellent example of how the situation
can be solved if the world community shows the will.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, who remains chairman of the Pakistani joint chiefs of
staff and calls himself the country's chief executive, will speak
here on Wednesday, the first day of a three-day summit meeting of
more than 150 world leaders. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of
India, who is scheduled to speak on Friday, cut short his visit
because of health problems and is not expected in New York until
Thursday. Officials of both governments said there had been no
requests from either side for a meeting of the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview in his hotel suite, Musahrraf, 56, also spoke
of the problems that he has encountered in his anticorruption drive
and explained in some detail his plans for restoring democracy
``from the grass roots up'' in Pakistan. The country's Supreme
Court has given him three years to complete the process.
</P>
<P>
   His plan to ``bring to book people who squandered the nation's
wealth'' _ his list includes two former prime ministers, Nawaz
Sharif, now in jail, and Benazir Bhutto, who is in self-imposed
exile _ ``is slow going because of obstacles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, his aides said, is trying to set an example of
austerity in a country where elected leaders have lived in mansions
and traveled with huge entourages, staying in the best hotels. In
New York, he is at the Roosevelt Hotel, owned by Pakistani
International Airlines, and has brought 20 aides and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the targets of his anticorruption drive, which
Pakistanis have greeted enthusiastically, he said, ``These are
white-collar crimes in which these people have been involved, which
are not very easy to investigate and get the facts out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said finding assets abroad was not easy, and bringing the
money home was even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has also met opposition to his plans to make
Pakistanis pay taxes, which only 1 million people in a population
of 140 million do now. A process to assess property values led to a
25-day strike by shopkeepers, ``but they've come around now,'' the
leader said. House and factory assessments are going better, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Musahrraf, who has been accused by India of supporting Islamic
militants in Kashmir denied strongly that the army is in danger of
succumbing to fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total misperception of the military in Pakistan,''
he said. ``The military in Pakistan _ the army in particular _ is
the most disciplined, the most well organized, the most well
administered. There is no question of differences within the
army.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf spoke at the most length about the Kashmir issue, and
other areas in which, he said, India has blamed Pakistan for crises
without any evidence. Indians have accused Pakistan of fomenting
anti-Christian violence and supporting rebels in Punjab and the
remote Indian northeast as well as in Kashmir. He blamed the
international news media for often accepting the charges at face
value.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has long argued for international help in solving the
issue of Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan territory that has been the
scene of several wars between India and Pakistan and is considered
a dangerous flashpoint between two nuclear-armed nations. But
Musharraf was more categorical than his predecessors in dismissing
Indian promises to settle the issue between the two governments.
India has always rejected offers of international help, including
offers from Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations never recognized Kashmir as part of India,
just as East Timor was never recognized as Indonesian, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they talk of bilateralism, actually, that means they
don't want to do anything,'' he said of India. ``So that time is
over.''

TRYING TO BE BRILLIANT, SCARY AND THRIFTY. TWICE. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joe Berlinger, a respected documentary filmmaker
who was itching to make his first fictional feature, was delivering
his pitch to the executives at Artisan Entertainment last
Thanksgiving, thinking everything was going just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seemed to be doing well,'' he said. ``At least I kept
meeting more and more people. Then gradually I realized that it
wasn't the movie I was there pitching that interested them. They
were really looking at me because they wanted me to direct a sequel
to `The Blair Witch Project.' Of course, I was interested.''
</P>
<P>
   It did come as a bit of a shock. ``I thought my first movie
would be a small, independent feature that would maybe play at the
Sundance Film Festival and get some attention,'' Berlinger said.
``Instead, I found myself committed to delivering a sequel to one
of the most successful movies of all time, and I had 10 months to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashback to the summer of 1999: Seemingly out of nowhere, ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' an unheralded horror film shot on a
minuscule budget, opened on a handful of screens and grew into one
of the most bizarre movie sensations of the decade, both a summer
blockbuster and a cultural phenomenon that rewrote the rules on how
to make and market movies for young people in the Internet Age.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan had picked up the film at the Sundance festival the
previous January, after no other independent distribution company
exhibited any interest. The joke at the time was that the only
thing scary about ``The Blair Witch Project'' was that Artisan had
paid $1 million for it.
</P>
<P>
   Few appreciated how cannily the filmmakers, Daniel Myrick and
Eduardo Sanchez (who are producers on the sequel), had used the Web
as a creative and marketing tool to spin a supposedly true story
about the disappearance of three young filmmakers in the Maryland
woods. They blended fact and fiction and successfully convinced
many young people that the story was true. They also came up with a
brilliant way to turn their primary handicap, a budget of next to
nothing, into an advantage _ by claiming their film, with its
nausea-inducing hand-held camera moves and Salvation Army
production values, looked that way because it was the raw video
footage that had been left behind when the filmmakers disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites sprang up with additional ``interview footage'' and
richly imagined back stories about the characters involved in the
film and the legend that supposedly inspired it, all set in and
around the actual town of Burkittsville, Md. The blending of fact
and fiction went so far as to include using the real names of the
actors in the film for their screen characters. The poor town of
Burkittsville suddenly found itself overrun with ``Blair Witch''
groupies, wandering around in the woods, trying to find the
``real'' places where the story had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Since the film made more than $150 million last summer, and was
a subsequent hit on videotape and DVD, a sequel was inevitable.
Myrick and Sanchez were the logical filmmakers to do it, but their
company, Haxan Films, instead signed with Artisan to do ``Heart of
Love,'' a comedy about a love cult (now tentatively scheduled for a
summer 2001 release). The Haxan team does plan to direct the third
``Blair Witch'' movie, most likely a prequel to the original.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who does it, making a sequel to a hit film is one
thing; making a sequel to a phenomenon is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge was in walking a fine line in dealing with the
fact that the first movie did what it did,'' said Amorette Jones,
Artisan's executive vice president for worldwide marketing. ``We
had to tip our hand and acknowledge that the first movie was out
there. The challenge is allowing the second film to be related to
the first, then letting it stand on its own independently. That's
where Joe's skills as a filmmaker and his vision came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlinger, 37, was best known for a trio of truly creepy
documentaries ``Brother's Keeper'' in 1992, ``Paradise Lost: The
Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills'' in 1996 and `Paradise Lost 2:
Revelations'' earlier this year. All three were made with his
partner, Bruce Sinofsky, who is not involved in the ``Blair Witch''
sequel. The two ``Paradise Lost'' films most clearly show why
Berlinger appealed to Artisan. They are about the murders of
several young children in a working-class small town in eastern
Arkansas, and the documentary suggests that three local youths were
convicted of the crimes on flimsy evidence involving their supposed
interest in Satanism and the occult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In choosing Joe, we knew, based on his past credits, that he'd
have the right sensibility to bring to this,'' Jones said.
Berlinger said that he was struck immediately by the three sequel
scripts that had been written before his involvement. ``They were
very fine scripts,'' he said, but he thought they were headed in
the wrong direction. ``All of them picked up at the moment that the
first film ended,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem was that it asked audiences, once again, to
believe that the first film was a documentary and it ignored what,
to him, was the most fascinating aspect of the ``Blair Witch''
phenomenon: the cultural hysteria that the original film produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a major pulling the wool over the eyes of America had
taken place with the first film, and then been revealed,'' he said.
``I thought it was too much to ask the audience to suspend
disbelief again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the original movie fascinated me mostly from the
standpoint that the real little town of Burkittsville had been
overrun to a degree that you can't believe. Thousands of people
were going there every week, people who were convinced that there
was some grain of truth in the Blair Witch legend. The town was
unprepared to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   So his movie (with screenplay credit going to John Bokenkamp and
Neal Stevens) is set in that real town at the time it is first
inundated with ``Blair Witch'' groupies, in the weeks after the
explosive success of the original movie. The original plan, in a
nod to the original, was for the characters in the sequel to bear
the same names as the actors who portray them. But the filmmakers
decided to change the last names just to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Donovan plays Jeff Patterson, a local tour operator who
takes ``Blair Witch'' tourists into the woods where the original
movie was filmed. In the sequel, he takes four young people (a pair
of Boston academics, a nature-worshiping witch and a cynical Goth
enthusiast) on such a tour, and they find themselves in the middle
of the forest in the middle of the night when very odd things begin
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My movie is about five obsessed movie fans who go to the real
town of Burkittsville and sort of make a pilgrimage to the site,''
Berlinger said. ``But I am confident that what people expect to
happen, even after the characters end up in the woods, is not what
is going to happen. I think people will be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, with its $10 million budget, is inexpensive by the
standards of most movies that are released on 3,000 screens, as
``Book of Shadows: Blair Witch Project 2'' will be on Oct. 27. But
it's a fortune compared with the original's budget. Berlinger said
that the reason for the higher budget was that he had decided not
to imitate the hand-held, low-budget look of the first film but to
make a more traditional movie with more mainstream production
values. The first film was also noticeably gore-free, for a horror
film, largely because of budgetary constraints; the sequel will
raise the ante a bit in this category, Berlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said that audiences would have trouble guessing where
the plot of the sequel was headed. ``People expect it to be a romp
in the woods, with some kids going crazy-scared in a tent,'' he
said. ``But it's not going to be anything like the first one or
like people expect. Instead, it's a movie about mass hysteria and
collective delusion.'' (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Erica Leerhsen, who plays Erica Geerson, the young witch in the
film, said that she had resisted going to see the original. ``I
knew it was a big deal,'' she said. ``I'm the kind of person who
doesn't necessarily want to follow hype, if you know what I mean. I
purposely don't go see something for that reason. So I waited until
the hype kind of died down and went to see it, and I was so
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   She went to an audition in New York for the sequel and found
herself surrounded by ``millions of people'' trying out for the key
parts. ``They asked me, what was the scariest thing that had
happened to me, so I came up with spiders and how I thought I was
going to die because I had to be around these spiders one time,''
Leerhsen said. ``Then, they had me back and Joe was there and they
asked me the same question again. So I had to come up with
something new. And they kept having me back and back, with fewer
and fewer people each time, until it was just me.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlinger said that the key trick, for him, was to come up with
something that interested him intellectually and was still
satisfying to the fans of the original film, breaking the mold of
the first film while remaining true to its spirit. So he decided
once again to blend fact and fiction, to have a resolution that is
vague _ at least subject to interpretation _ and to have the idea
of ``found footage'' play a role in the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fascinated by the notion most Americans have, when they
consume media, that shaky camera means reality,'' Berlinger said.
``That's a dangerous thing. It's utterly fascinating to me that to
most people amateur video equals reality. It taps into a larger
issue, a real concern of mine, the blurring in general between
fiction and reality, between news and entertainment. Over the last
decade, they've become so intertwined.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Blair Witch'' fanatics will appreciate the film on
this level, he is not sure, but Berlinger said he was convinced
they wouldn't have to. The movie works as a traditional
horror-mystery, without the intellectual overlay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I just decided early on was that I needed to stick
to my vision,'' he said. ``I hope it plays for America. I think it
will. We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunities come in all shapes and sizes. You can't really
pick and choose your moment of destiny, so I just jumped out the
window and hoped, as I continue to hope, that there's a mattress on
the other side to catch me.''

CHENEY DEFENDS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AS `APPROPRIATE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 9th graf, `Later in ...,' to correct figure for total
charitable contributions to $442,152, sted $442,154.) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. _ Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential
candidate, Tuesday defended his charitable contributions as
``appropriate'' and insisted he should be given credit not only for
direct contributions but also for speaking fees he directed to
charity and for corporate gifts that matched his own donations.
</P>
<P>
   Answering reporters' questions on a campaign flight from
Washington, Cheney challenged the suggestion that his generosity
should be measured by comparing his direct contributions of
$209,832 over the last 10 years to his income of $20,677,742, a
standard by which he gave 1.01 percent of his income.
</P>
<P>
   He also counted $89,500 in speaking fees and $142,820 in
matching grants. Neither is a charitable contribution under the
federal tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 440-some thousand dollars were directed to charity,
either direct contributions or honorariums or matching funds from
the boards that we sat on,'' he said. ``I thought that was
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   By his measure, that would equal 2.14 percent of his income.
Asked if he considered that level ``generous,'' Cheney replied, ``I
answered your question.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter, noting that he is a multi-millionaire, asked
him, ``What do you think is a proper level of giving for someone
who has millions of dollars, in terms of percentage?'' Cheney
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a choice that individuals have to make in terms
of what they want to do with their resources. It's not a policy
question. It's a private matter. It's a matter of private choice.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service, average taxpayers
give about 2 percent of their income to charity. In 1997, the last
year for which figures are available, those with incomes of $1
million or more gave an average of 4.5 percent. The last year that
the income of Cheney and his wife, Lynne, was below $2 million was
in 1992, when he was secretary of defense and they earned $258,394.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, an aide explained that Cheney's first concern
when he started making lots of money in the private sector was
providing for his children and grandchildren, and that the $442,152
represented only the beginning of substantial lifetime
contributions he expected to make to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who last week released the first two pages of his tax
returns for each of the last 10 years, although not the full
returns, said he and his wife had decided not to identify the
charities they had given money to. But he said, ``It was everything
from the United Way to Capital Partners for Education in
Washington, which provides scholarships for inner city kids to go
to parochial school, and a whole range of things in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also said he had rejected an opportunity to have $3.5
million worth of stock options in the Halliburton Co. vest before
he might become vice president because ``that is traditionally not
the way we do business at Halliburton.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while he had received hundreds of thousands of
dollars when he left the board of Electronic Data Systems to run
for vice president, as The New York Times reported last Saturday,
that money was deferred earnings from previous board service.

PRIME TIME   FOR PRIVATE   COLLECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By   RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American collectors in the late 20th century went bonkers over
art. Week after week they chalked up records, buying Rembrandts,
Renoirs and Rauschenbergs and becoming instant celebrities at
black-tie auctions in New York and London. The consumer society had
met the art world head on, and collecting evolved into a sport of
mass buying more reminiscent of the style of William Randolph
Hearst than of Andrew Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   Once awakened, the obsessive appetite for art spawned more grand
acquisitors than the world had ever seen. Armed with the basics
from Art 101 and from visiting museums everywhere, many collectors
_ school teachers, salesmen, rock stars and Wall Street
arbitrageurs _ looked beyond the paintings and sculpture that had
once satisfied most elite art buyers. Instead they looked to
acquire exotic and everyday things. They amassed so much quality
French furniture, Chinese bronzes, Japanese screens, German toy
trains, Venetian glass, African masks and American folk art that
they sometimes surpassed the museums. Since it was no fun to play
alone with their adult toys, they lent, gave or sold their objects
to museums, and occasionally even paid for the galleries and wings
to accommodate the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The collecting phenomenon enriched most everyone _ buyers,
sellers, museums and the public. But there were drawbacks when
collectors gained too much power, lending art of lesser quality,
dictating how their art should be displayed or using an exhibition
as a launching pad for an auction. For the most part, though, such
practices are the exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ahead there will be an amazing variety of private
art collections starring in exhibitions at museums across the
country. Three in New York illustrate why private art collections
are formed, why museums exhibit them _ and in some cases acquire
them _ and why museumgoers find them irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   When word gets around that a quintessential collection, of even
the most esoteric material, is about to go on view, the show
becomes a must see for serious art enthusiasts. One such show,
``The Embodied Image: Chinese Calligraphy From the John B. Elliott
Collection,'' opens next Friday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
``The most important and comprehensive exhibition of its kind ever
assembled in the West,'' the press release announces.
</P>
<P>
   The 55 masterworks from the Elliott collection take center stage
in the show. It also includes works from the museum's own holdings
that were collected by John M. Crawford Jr., heir to an
oil-drilling fortune, and a group of rubbings of early engraved
calligraphies, lent by Robert H. Ellsworth, a New York dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Before he bought calligraphy, Elliott, a Wall Street financier,
dabbled in Japanese folk art. In 1967, he started at the top,
buying a dynamic work of bold, diagonal strokes by the 11th-century
poet Huang Tingjian, a work that remains the most important in the
collection. With the help of Wen C. Fong, a professor of art
history at Princeton University (later a consultant to the
Metropolitan Museum), Elliott had acquired the bulk of his
calligraphies by 1970, but added rarities as he found them until
his death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott always collected ``with an institutional perspective,''
as Maxwell K. Hearn, curator of Asian art at the Metropolitan
Museum, put it. Elliott's interest in Asian art began while he was
a student at Princeton University in the 1950s. He had wanted to
build a pre-eminent collection and leave it to the museum at
Princeton (which he ultimately did). But his dream, which he shared
with Crawford, a bibliophile and arts patron who died in 1988, was
to have their collections exhibited together at the Metropolitan
Museum. Now their dream will be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Other collectors become involved with a museum at the start of
their collecting, consciously making selections with the needs of
the museum in mind. This approach is apparent in ``An Engagement
with Folk Art: Cyril I. Nelson's Gifts to the Museum of American
Folk Art,'' which will be on view through Jan.7.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson began collecting American folk art in 1972 while editing
a book on painted furniture. Soon he was buying works of great
virtuosity _ quilts, coverlets, stencilled watercolors, portraits,
landscapes, painted furniture and sculpture, produced from 1800 to
1940. In 1974, he joined the museum board, always looking for ways
to strengthen its collection. ``The quilts he favored are unlike
any we owned,'' said Gerard C. Wertkin, the museum director. ``And
we were very weak on Maine forms in furniture until Cy found an
elaborately painted 1830s blanket chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 113 objects that Nelson gave to the museum, 50 are in the
exhibition. The quirkiest, a late 19th-century wood sculpture.
``Dove,'' once sat atop a pole in a Kansas grainery.
</P>
<P>
   Museums today are quick to seize on objects they think will
attract new audiences. Collectibles, like baseball cards and
vintage eyeglasses, do just that. This season's ultimate pop
culture extravaganza, ``Robots, Astronauts and Space Toys: The
Robert Lesser Collection,'' will be an exhibition of 250 examples
at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, from Nov. 10 to Feb. 1. Lesser, a
retired electric-sign salesman, amassed one of the most extensive
collections of toy robots from the 1930s to the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Lehman, the museum director, came upon the robots while
visiting Lesser to see his collection of pulp art of the '30s and
'40s. The robots were chockablock in the apartment, and Lehman was
dazzled. He immediately persuaded Lesser to lend the collection to
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, everyone is able to collect something,'' Lehman said.
``For me the kind of mentality represented in this collection is
totally fascinating. We talk about 19th-century American paintings
as the romance of the wilderness. Well, robots are about romance,
too _ the romance of outer space.'' &QR;

A PAIR OF POP GUERRILLAS FLAUNTING BAD TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 
(Amy Serafin is the editor of Where magazine in Paris.) By AMY
SERAFIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When Claudia Schiffer posed for them, she became
``Venus,'' framed by sparkling plastic flowers, two lovely tears
running down her porcelain cheeks. The pop singer Nina Hagen
metamorphosed, improbably, into a beatific Virgin Mary and, in
another image, into a bondage victim, dressed in latex and roped to
a kitchen chair. Catherine Deneuve turned into the ``White Queen,''
floating among clouds in a gown and tiara.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pop-culture paradise of the French artists Pierre
and Gilles, who use fashion, religion and the star system to create
an idealized universe of their own. Over the next year, that
universe is coming to the United States, starting with a
retrospective in Manhattan at the New Museum of Contemporary Art,
Friday through Jan. 21, and then traveling to the Yerba Buena
Center of the Arts in San Francisco in February.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre and Gilles believe that beauty can be found everywhere,
if one is a willing beholder. Refusing to admit the existence of
bad taste, they happily embrace mass, even ``lowbrow'' culture:
variety shows, glitzy religious iconography, Indian B movies. At
home, they leave their television on 24 hours a day. In their work,
they manipulate reality using the saccharine artifice of
Technicolor blue skies, haloes of light and models as perfect as
deities, with airbrush-smooth skin and strangely peaceful
expressions. ``It's a cruel world,'' says Gilles, ``so we like to
show things that are gentle and pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, it seems, the artists themselves; in their early 40s,
they are both delicately good looking and endearingly shy. Pierre
is small, dark and angular; Gilles slightly taller, blond and
baby-faced. Tattoos peek out from under their T-shirts, and Pierre
wears the tattoo of a tear under his left eye. For 25 years they
have been known by their first names.
</P>
<P>
   When the two met at a party in Paris in 1976, Pierre was a
photographer of glamour portraits for magazines and Gilles was
teaching art. They fell in love, then started working together
almost by chance. Pierre had shot a portrait of a punk singer
friend but found it lacked intensity. Gilles took his paintbrush
and filled in the missing color.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic technique remains the same. First they decide on a
concept and a model, and then they build elaborate sets using
common objects as props: a shredded Christmas garland, transparent
starfish, plastic flowers, hair gel for tears (a recurring theme).
When the set is finished and the model in place, Pierre takes the
photo and Gilles meticulously paints in depth and luminosity.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite subjects include the sea (they both grew up on the
Atlantic coast _ Gilles in Normandy, Pierre in the Vendee),
adolescent boys and a typically ambiguous series of Catholic saints
and Hindu gods, where angelic purity meets naive eroticism.
</P>
<P>
   They also appear to inhabit the world they have created.
Entering their apartment in the Pre Saint Gervais, a suburb east of
Paris, is like climbing inside one of their frames. Every inch is
decorated with treasures one might find in a garage sale or the
trinket shops of Chinatown: a guitar sporting Elvis' face, colored
Christmas balls hanging from a glitter-covered ceiling, a Bruce Lee
poster, a red inflatable bunny. A row of plastic gods from Thailand
sits underneath a waterfall of shimmering lights that flows when
Gilles flicks a switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel at ease the moment you walk into their home,'' said
the French supermodel Laetitia Casta, who recently posed for them.
``Suddenly, you are less distracted by what you have to do than by
what is on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre and Gilles photograph only the people who inspire them,
and they produce a mere 12 to 15 works a year. Believing their
portraits were computer-generated, Michael Jackson once asked them
to do 70 of him and was turned down. ``They have refused an
incredible number of commands from very famous people,'' said
Jerome de Noirmont, whose gallery in Paris represents them. In any
case, the model is secondary to the concept. ``Sometimes we have a
model we adore, but it takes a long time before we take the photo,
because we have to find the best way to express the person,'' says
Pierre. ``Or else we have an idea, and it takes us years to find
the right model.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally the subject discovers the set-up only at the time of
the shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I would have expected,'' says Paloma Picasso,
who was buried to her waist in sand and surrounded by red plastic
crabs, ``but I thought that's what was interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists took two portraits of Casta, one as Botticelli's
Venus and another in which she is hand-washing laundry. Casta was
struck by the latter image: ``This is the simple side that
corresponds to me quite well, and that few people see. It made me
laugh that they guessed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the artists' subjects are not famous. Many are their
friends, especially the gorgeous young men _ Stephane, Roy, Enzo,
Karim _ naked or nearly so, striking gently erotic poses. Pierre
and Gilles' gay work has become more daring with time, a fact they
attribute to society's growing acceptance of homosexuality, and
also to their models, who are increasingly willing to go further.
</P>
<P>
   A series from the mid-1990s called ``Les Plaisirs de la Foret''
(``Pleasures of the Forest'') takes the enchantment of a fairy-tale
setting a leap beyond Little Red Riding Hood. Pierre and Gilles'
forest is a place of fantasy, where human figures, mainly lone men,
emerge from the foliage like otherworldly beasts. Some are bloodied
or tied to trees, waiting helplessly for who knows what to come
along.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a melancholy side to their work _
teary-eyed women, martyred saints _ but in some of their later
portraits they have revealed a darker vision. ``Le Garcon des
Neons'' (``The Boy in the Neon Lights''), taken in 1998, shows a
young man in shadow, standing in front of a broken window, blood
streaming from his wrists. ``In the beginning we touched less upon
that kind of thing,'' Gilles says. ``We have been marked by
difficult events, and you no longer see life like when you're 20.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, art critics and curators were dismissive of the
pair, and they themselves originally considered their niche more
advertisements and album covers than museums. Their style is often
labeled kitsch, a term they feel belittles their work. In the last
few years, the art world has come around. Their market value has
soared, and museums from Japan to Finland have lined up to exhibit
their work. Pierre and Gilles are not surprised by the attention.
What they have long understood is that popular culture is, well,
popular.

ANNAN SAYS NATIONS MUST COOPERATE TO END WAR, POVERTY AND OTHER
WOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This is a writethru of the early version of
U.N.-MILLENNIUM-SUMMIT, written by Christopher Wren; see also
U.N.-MILLENNIUM-SUMMIT-1STLD-WRITETHRU for the day story, written
by Dean E. Murphy.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Tuesday
that the perennial problems of war, disease, poverty and pollution
will never be resolved unless all countries cooperate, and he
stressed that neither they nor the United Nations can accomplish
the tasks unaided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the United Nations should be seen as
doing everything, or that it should attempt to do everything by
itself,'' Annan said. ``The issues we are dealing with _ from the
elimination of poverty to the fight against AIDS and the protection
of the environment _ are issues that require all hands on deck.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general spoke at a news conference before a
three-day meeting of about 150 heads of state and other leaders
here, which its U.N. organizers are calling the largest gathering
of political leaders in history.
</P>
<P>
   Annan first suggested the gathering three years ago, he said,
``to harness the symbolic power of the millennium to the real and
urgent needs of people everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had tried to encourage a partnership of governments,
international organizations, private businesses and foundations to
bring their ``collective impact'' the bear on the world's ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is everyone's responsibility,'' Annan said. ``We will play
our catalytic role. We will press. We will advocate the issues. We
will use the little money we have to help. But everyone has to do
their bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of world leaders here will open on Wednesday and
conclude on Friday with a joint declaration, a draft of which began
circulating here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The draft commits nations that sign it to ``spare no effort to
free our peoples from the scourge of war,'' and to promote
democracy, expand respect for human rights and ensure access to
economic development to every country.
</P>
<P>
   Other resolutions call for ridding the world of poverty,
promoting education and reversing the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these are big issues,'' Annan said. ``This is also why
I am challenging everyone to make a contribution. This is why I am
telling the world leaders not only to come here and approve a plan
of action, but that I would expect each and every one of them to go
back home and begin to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter pointed out that talk of ringing in peace and
ending cruelty dated back to biblical times, Annan said: ``The fact
that the poor have always been with us does not mean we should not
try to improve their lot and their conditions. Yes, you may think I
am a dreamer, as some have called me, but without the dream you do
not get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   On a matter closer to home, Annan was asked about prospects for
expanding the 15-member Security Council, which many nations are
seeking. He said he believed that an expansion was possible, though
he doubted that it could be achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Britain proposed increasing the overall size of the
council and the number of permanent members. The U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, also spoke last spring of
expanding its membership even beyond 20 or 21 nations, which the
United States had previously considered a maximum. Britain and the
United States are now permanent members, with veto power, as are
China, France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western critics of expansion have argued that too many
members would weaken the council and make decisions harder. But
Annan said it ought to be possible to expand the council and make
it more democratic and representative of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the idea that the expansion will necessarily lead to
a confused, ineffective Security Council, which fudges all
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also welcomed an offer by Britain to establish a military
staff college to train peacekeepers from around the world to serve
with U.N. missions, calling the idea ``something that I endorse
wholeheartedly.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he supported a new report recommending an overhaul
of United Nations peacekeeping operations, which have stumbled in
Sierra Leone and Congo, among other troubled countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to conduct peacekeeping operations, we must do
so effectively,'' he said. ``But we cannot continue to work as we
are doing now.''

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Major League Soccer's marathon season is now
a sprint to the finish with five teams capable in the final week of
earning the best record.
</P>
<P>
   With two victories, the Los Angeles Galaxy (14-8-8, 50 points)
could do no worse than the fourth seed, which would earn Los
Angeles home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   However, a loss against either Dallas tonight at the Rose Bowl
or Friday at Colorado would end any realistic hopes the Galaxy has
of catching Western Division-leading Kansas City (15-7-8, 53
points).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many possibilities, but we can't worry how the
other games unfold,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``We have to
take care of our business, win our last two games, then find out
how the chips fell.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the five teams at the top, New York/New Jersey (16-11-3, 51
points) can do no worse than a third seed after wrapping up the
Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (16-12-3, 51 points) and Chicago (15-9-6, 51 points)
are tied for the Central Division lead, but the Fire has the edge
with two games left while the Mutiny has one.
</P>
<P>
   If the Galaxy finishes second to Kansas City, it will play the
Central Division runner up in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But no use figuring this out now. The Galaxy will have a better
idea of what's in store after tonight. K.C. is at New England, then
finishes at Tampa Bay on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league did a good job with parity,'' said Galaxy
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. ``This is how it should be, competitive
all the way to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were too many meaningless games last season because some
teams clinched early. This way, everyone is sharp heading into the
playoffs because every game counts until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   This week is also a chance for Schmid to test his group without
Olympians Danny Califf, Sasha Victorine and Peter Vagenas, who will
miss the first round of the playoffs and possibly the second.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Caligiuri will step in for Califf while midfielders Brian
Kelly and Ivan Polic audition for Vagenas' spot. Up front, former
UCLA striker Seth George will share time with Sebastian Vorbe
replacing Victorine. Both George and Vorbe scored during the
Galaxy's 2-1 victory over San Jose last week. George will start
tonight, as he did against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both played well last week, so I thought I would not
change anything,'' said Schmid. ``As far as the playoffs go, I'll
have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (12-14-4, 40 points), led by Galaxy killer Ariel
Graziani, is fighting for the eighth playoff seed along with
Colorado (12-15-4, 40 points).
</P>
<P>
   If either the Burn or Rapids stumble, Columbus and Miami, both
at 38 points, could sneak into the playoff picture with a pair of
wins.

AUTUMN IS MELLOW DEEP IN NORMANDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By FREDERICK TURNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A journey to inland Normandy began in a promise I made myself
some years ago. My brother and I were tearing through the Norman
countryside in a rental car, bound for the coast: for
Mont-Saint-Michel, for Bayeux and the tapestry, for the tragic
beaches and Rommel's still, grim emplacements above them, for the
stately strand at Deauville, for the picturesque harbor at
Honfleur, for Etretat.
</P>
<P>
   It was spring. The countryside was decked in its best, the apple
orchards a snowy blaze of blossoms, the new grasses fiercely green,
wildflowers waving in a briny breeze that had scoured away winter's
blackness, leaving everything washed and sharp-edged. As we drove
on toward Bayeux, I caught glimpses of half-timbered buildings of
such age that not one line looked plumb; window boxes bursting with
flowers; farm lanes so bowered by hedgerows and trees that they
wore the portent of dusk at midday; weathered, slate-steepled
churches. ``OK,'' I said to myself, ``you've got to come back here
someday. All this is too marvelous simply to zip through.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the coast is to be disdained. It's too striking, as at
Etretat; too historic, as at Omaha and Sword Beaches. And a Sunday
spent at Trouville-sur-Mer's lively market, followed by lunch at
Les Vapeurs on the waterfront and a post-prandial stroll along
Deauville's boardwalk, is an experience catering to most of the
important senses. Yet sampling these seaside pleasures late in the
19th century, Henry James remarked that they were of relatively
recent vintage compared with the antiquity of the country inland,
which had been settled by the Norsemen and where some roads are
Roman.
</P>
<P>
   When I came back to the interior last year it was autumn, and
the apple trees were yielding their bounty in red-gold piles.
Spring's briny wind had died and a mellow haze hung over the
landscape. Scarves of wood smoke stood above houses shielded by
groves, and this time, instead of making for the coast, I marked
out for a leisurely investigation a part of the country bounded by
the Risle River on the east, the Dives on the west, and the town of
Gace on the south. The distances involved here are not great, and
so for six days, I crisscrossed what is essentially the Calvados
region.
</P>
<P>
   One evening in Pont-Audemer at the Auberge du Vieux Puits, I
told the host and chef, Jacques Foltz, that I'd spent most of the
day in the little town of Orbec. ``Ah!'' he exclaimed, ``there you
have penetrated la Normandie profonde. So often we are mad to get
to Honfleur, Trouville. But Orbec, that I regard as the true
Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked what I'd done in Orbec, and I said not much of
anything, and that it had been wonderful. Instead of racing through
like an invading army, I'd wandered its little, sloping streets,
strolled the beautiful park with the Orbiquet River flowing
through, listened to the tinny sound of the church clock hitting
the quarter hours. Down at the town square, I watched a petanque
match _ about as leisurely as sport can get.
</P>
<P>
   After a fine lunch of oysters and veal kidneys at Au Caneton, I
stepped out onto the main street and the long, low ramble of the
Hotel de Croissy, a private estate, and was thrilled to find a
plaque announcing that within was the garden where Debussy had
composed one of his most gorgeous piano pieces, ``The Garden in the
Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The day I spent in Orbec, I'd intended to end in Gace but never
made it. The day I intended to walk the four miles from the village
of Le Grand Couliboeuf to Ammeville, I never I got there, either.
The heartland of Normandy is a dense region of twisting roads and
visual surprises slowly revealed, a wonderful place to get
sidetracked, as I did on the way to Ammeville.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been walking the road between broad, flat fields bordered by
copses of oaks, chestnuts and noble beeches. Tractors were turning
over the earth redolent with centuries of human toil and warfare.
Then at an intersection, I came upon a life-size crucified Christ
raised high above a sign to Vaudeloges and followed the sign into
that gem of a hamlet with its long narrow houses whose shapes
whispered of the longships of the Norse, its rugged church,
clustered graves and the inevitable war memorial guarded by painted
shell casings. In this silent, secluded spot and with no one about
in the noonday sun, I felt I could either pray or picnic _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   One destination I set out for and achieved was the Monday market
at St.-Pierre-sur-Dives. I set out early from Pont-l'Eveque,
following the Touqes River south to Lisieux, then southwest to the
market. It's held at a vast 800-year-old hall whose roof was
destroyed during the war, then restored using traditional chestnut
pegs. The morning was brilliant and cold, the breath of the
shoppers and stallkeepers hanging white in the low sun and the
warmth from the chestnut vendor's little fire welcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the great gloom of the hall and around its outer walls, the
area's farmers and fisherfolk were offering salted hams,
headcheese, herring, choucroute, moules, coquilles, shrimp, sole,
bar. There were apples, of course, celery root, pumpkins, pears;
cages of live fowl _ turkeys, guinea hens, chickens, geese, ducks _
and rabbits, quick and not-so; and lettuce, leeks and shallots.
There was a stunning profusion of cheeses (many unpasteurized),
including those famed Norman varieties, Camembert, Pont-l'Eveque,
and Livarot.
</P>
<P>
   At a butcher's stall I counted 14 kinds of sausage, and when the
hearty, mustachioed proprietor saw me writing a note he said:
``Don't write. Eat,'' and cut off a hot, thick round of andouille,
poking it at me on the point of his knife. To a palate trained on
cheese whip and chicken-fat wienies, Norman food is often a strong
surprise. Putting the round into my mouth I tasted all of the
animal and its processes; it tasted like life itself instead of a
mechanized simulation.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 it was all over, the vendors drinking at L'Hotel de
France or Le Greenwich at the other end of the marketplace, the
shoppers gone home. Only a few smashed crates and some lettuce
leaves rolling over in the wind remained to suggest what an
intensity of activity had been here, and looking around the
deserted streets, you'd have sworn nothing had happened here since
the Allies raced through in 1944.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On my second evening at the Auberge du Vieux Puits, I decided I
had to eat more like a Norman. With Monsieur Foltz at tableside,
notepad ready, I ordered duck foie gras, wild boar with stewed
pears and chestnut pancakes, a cheese platter and small green salad
to follow, a bottle of '96 Gigondas, and a valedictory glass of
Calvados.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a stronger meal than you allowed yourself last
night,'' Foltz said, looking over the tops of his spectacles. I
said I'd been cowed by his disapproval of that previous dainty
order. He smiled and said he'd been partly joking. ``But this,'' he
continued, tapping the notepad, ``is a  &UR; Norman &LR;  meal.'' He clenched
his fist. ``It will sustain you!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it did, and following his suggestions, I went off the
next day in search of more regional sustenance, in the form of the
region's justly famous apple brandy, Calvados. As with the Normandy
cheeses imported to the United States, we simply can have no idea
of the authentic article, and the Calva, as it is called here,
exported by the big-time producers is a gross, inferior item, only
marginally better than our old-time New England applejack.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the small, independent Calvados maker in
this Pays d'Auge region is probably a bit overstated, but there's
no doubt they are far fewer than a decade ago. Nonetheless, here
and there are signs pointing you to farms where it's still made the
old way, and in Ste.-Foy-de-Montgommery, I followed one to the farm
of M. and Mme. Marc de Lesdain.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the lane, I'd read, Rommel in his staff car had been
badly wounded, strafed by a British fighter. Two big Alsatian dogs
bounded up to my car, but Madame de Lesdain was right behind,
uttering reassurances, and soon enough we were seated in their
parlor, where the Lesdains warmed me with samples of their product.
</P>
<P>
   In a reserved way, it was clear that they were proud of it, as
they had every right to be. Swirling it in my glass, closing my
eyes, and extending my nose into the bell of the glass, I received
a vivid sense of la Normandie profonde _ the earth, the grasses,
the wood and leaves of the apple trees and, of course, the
fermented fruit. That and the love and skill that had gone into the
making of this glorious drink that was guiding nature right into my
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   After such generosity, I drove, a bit aimlessly, northeastward,
stopping in Duranville at a roadside restaurant, thinking some food
might clarify matters. I was the only customer in L'Etrier II, and
the owner, Patricia Vauthier, was singing along to an opera tape.
She wore a sweatshirt proclaiming affiliation with the ``University
of Springfield California.'' When she produced my omelet and salad,
she glanced at my notebook and asked what I was writing. I tried to
explain, while complimenting her on a meal that was simple and
simply delicious.
</P>
<P>
   She had enough English that we could have a conversation about
the incursions of the fast-food purveyors, the decline of small
restaurants like hers. If L'Etrier II were in Manhattan or San
Francisco, I said, there would be lines outside. She appeared to
consider this imagined prospect a long moment, then shook her head
as if saying, non, this would not be appealing to her. For the
prospect she valued was the one she already enjoyed from her
window: the village church, the graves beneath the umbrageous
trees. This was where she was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   From my window table, I could see her point. In fact, I had been
seeing it, feeling it, for each of the splendid autumnal days I'd
been granted here, in her heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Flavors of Normandy
</P>
<P>
   You can drive to Normandy in two hours from Paris, if you can
find your way out of the city. It's better and saner to take the
train from Gare St.-Lazare to Rouen and rent a car.
</P>
<P>
   Two well-situated inns offer authentic regional cuisine. Auberge
du Vieux Puits, 6 rue Notre Dame-du-Pre, 27500 Pont-Audemer; (33-2)
32.41.01.48, fax (33-2) 32.42.37.28, is closed Monday and Tuesday _

smaller and rustic and some larger and more modern. Rooms are $45
to $62. The 12 rooms at Auberge du Prieure are sparkling, spacious
and absolutely quiet. They rent for $70 to $110 a night.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to redesign Medicare
and offer drug benefits to the elderly puts him squarely in line
with his party's drive to reshape the program by reducing the role
of government, increasing the role of insurance companies and
giving elderly people more choices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is also meant to serve an important political
purpose: to fend off attacks by Democrats who contend that Bush has
no true commitment to elderly people squeezed by rising drug costs.
Elderly Americans, long a key part of the Democratic coalition, are
considered a critical swing vote this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Democrats, Vice President Al Gore sees Medicare as one
of the greatest achievements of American social policy, and
basically approves of the course it has followed since its creation
35 years ago. Bush, by contrast, sees Medicare as a prime example
of government regulation run wild.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offers a uniform, standardized package of benefits with the
same premiums for most beneficiaries. Bush would subsidize a
variety of health plans offering different drug benefits and
charging different premiums and co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Gore's plan appears to offer more certainty,
more security and more generous benefits. But the total cost to the
government would be higher, and the Bush campaign asserted that
under Gore's proposal ``half of all seniors will pay more in annual
charges than they will receive in prescription drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   And with his proposal, which Bush outlined in a speech Tuesday
in Pennsylvania, the governor has set the stage for a reprise of
the health care battles of the last decade, revolving around a
fundamental question: Which do voters fear more, the government or
the insurance industry?
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to make greater use of private industry, including
insurers and health maintenance organizations, to deliver drug
benefits and other medical services to the elderly. The government
would still pay most costs, though, and would supervise insurers,
approving or disapproving all plans. In essence, Bush envisions a
large expansion of the role of HMO's, which now cover 6.2 million
of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on private health plans carries some risk, given the
recent experience of many Medicare beneficiaries. In the last two
years, HMO's have dropped hundreds of thousands of elderly
beneficiaries, saying the government did not pay enough for their
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's approach relies more on the traditional Medicare program
to deliver drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates agree that drug benefits should be voluntary _
an option available for an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's proposal, the government would pay at least 25
percent of the cost of premiums for drug coverage, even for the
most affluent beneficiaries. Under Gore's proposal, the government
would pay at least 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While both proposals would offer some assistance with drug costs
to all beneficiaries, neither would relieve the elderly of the
total cost.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, the government would pay all pharmaceutical
costs after a beneficiary had spent $4,000 out-of-pocket on drugs
in a year. Bush says that under his proposal, the government will
pick up all costs after a beneficiary spends $6,000 on health care
of all types. Both plans would subsidize part of the cost of
prescription drug insurance for people who elect it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would pump much more money into Medicare and drug benefits
for the elderly in the coming decade. But Bush's plan would cost
far more than a bill passed by the House in June to offer drug
coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says his plan would offer assistance more quickly because
he would offer money to the states _ $12 billion a year for four
years _ to provide immediate assistance to people with low incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, described the
difference this way: ``Governor Bush would provide seniors with
options and choices. Vice President Gore focuses on a
one-size-fits-all solution to the need for drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services,
described the Gore plan's uniformity of premiums and benefits as a
virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Bush plan, there would be wide variations across the
country,'' said Shalala, serving as spokeswoman for the Gore
campaign. ``It simply is not a Medicare benefit. It's not available
to everyone in every part of country at the same price.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Shalala argued, ``George Bush suggests seniors have a
big problem with the bureaucracy of the Health Care Financing
Administration,'' the agency that runs Medicare. ``What they really
have a problem with is the bureaucracy of HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to compare the Bush and Gore proposals. Bush
would encourage Medicare beneficiaries to obtain drug coverage and
other services through private health plans subsidized by the
government. Bush did not specify the level of drug benefits that
would be available under his proposal, nor did he specify the
premiums and co-payments &UR; 1 &LR;  for which the elderly would be
responsible. Those amounts could vary from one plan to another, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, under Gore's proposal, the government would specify
a standardized package of benefits. Medicare would pay half the
cost of each prescription, with no deductible. The maximum federal
payment would be $1,000 for $2,000 of drugs in 2002, rising to
$2,500 for $5,000 of drugs in 2008. Monthly premiums would start at
$25 in 2002 and would rise to nearly $51 in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A summary of Bush's plan, issued by his campaign, indicates that
drug benefits would be offered to Medicare recipients in the
original fee-for-service program, as well as to those in HMOs. All
health insurers in Medicare, including government-sponsored plans,
``will have to offer an expanded benefit package, including
outpatient prescription drug coverage,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that under the Bush Plan, ``the existing standard
Medicare benefit package would be expanded for the first time to
provide prescription drugs for those who remain in the
fee-for-service program. You would not have to leave Medicare to
get prescription drug benefits. But you would be free to shop
around, choose and compare.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was praised by insurance industry executives. Charles
N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, said, ``I think it's a serious proposal that will help
make prescription drugs more affordable for those most in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, which represents health maintenance organizations,
said her industry could ``play a role, definitely, in delivering
this benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and Democrats were just as quick to
criticize. Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
consumer advocacy group, said the record of HMOs and other private
insurers in delivering drug coverage to the elderly was ``at best
spotty.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the broader market-oriented changes contemplated by Bush,
Pollack said, ``We fear that this would wither away the
fee-for-service system that five out of six seniors depend on
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush's plan achieves its political purpose may depend
less on its specific details than on how skillfully he marshals
facts, figures and arguments in support of it _ in televised
debates and in his advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs loom large politically because they are a top
concern of critical constituencies _ the elderly, and the
generation aging just behind them. Republican strategists said that
Bush's plan would change the debate, which had taken a toll in
recent weeks on his support among older women.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who also works for the
pharmaceutical industry, said: ``Now, there's a legitimate debate
about which plan is better. That's a very different debate, with
significant merits on the side of what Governor Bush has
introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats argued that Bush's plan had huge vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The private sector marketplace that Bush envisions, said Geoff
Garin, a Democratic pollster, is ``an abstraction and an unknown
quantity that provides no comfort or reassurance to seniors.''

COMMENTARY: MINOR-LEAGUE MOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here at The New York Times, we were exceedingly
dismayed at the news that George W. Bush had called our redoubtable
reporter Adam Clymer ``a major-league (expletive deleted).''
</P>
<P>
   It caused quite a tizzy. How could we cope with that sort of
insult?
</P>
<P>
   By midday Tuesday we had searched our hearts and come to grips
with the delicate problem.
</P>
<P>
   Al Siegal, our estimable arbiter of language, sent a memo to the
editors on the political desk: ``Folks: If we have to refer to it
again, let's call Bush's word a vulgarity, not an obscenity. It has
nothing to do with sex. Nor is it profane, having nothing to do
with religion or the deity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people find reporters more worthy of censure than auto
mechanics. But at least in the old days, pols insulted journalists
with flair: We were pusillanimous pussyfooters. Or nattering nabobs
of negativism. We were elevated to an Enemies List. Now W. reduces
us to an uninspired vulgarity, a mere aside employed in some
puerile display of male bonding with ``Big Time'' Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have a fractious relationship with reporters because
they have a bedrock belief in their own goodness. So they get
deeply offended when reporters challenge their deeds, rather than
simply accepting them as nice, decent people bred to rule.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they failed to fathom press criticism of Cheney for
his nihilistic voting record on apartheid and Head Start. W.'s
baptism into Washington politics in '88 was not based in policy; it
was to make sure the Bush campaign was responsive to those who had
been, in Junior's favorite phrase, ``loyal to all Bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney was  &UR; loyal to all Bushes &LR; . That was the only litmus
test that mattered to them.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are not in a position to be  &UR; loyal to all Bushes. &LR; 
W. was angry at Adam Clymer for a story in April reporting on
Texas' abysmal health care record, and for a piece last week that
rated the accuracy of a new Republican ad on prescription drugs
``zero'' on its central claim.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s comment came before the reporter he denigrated had had a
chance to carry out his Monday assignment _ asking Cheney why he
had given such a piddling amount of his oil windfall to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The really troubling part of W.'s epithet was not the noun we
are not allowed to print. The Bushes always resort to a little
oil-riggers' swagger when they feel threatened. As in the father's
``kick a little (expletive deleted)'' line after his debate with
Geraldine Ferraro. The Skull &AMP; Bones men feel more manly when they
can play beef jerkies, crabbing about Harvard types from elitist,
liberal institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid that anyone think the Bushies are just flighty
preppies thriving on name and connections, looking for a splash
more coffee.
</P>
<P>
   No, the really troubling part about the epithet was the
adjective we are allowed to print: ``major-league.''
</P>
<P>
   That conjured up the old W. that his handlers keep trying to
hide, the inner frat boy, the undisciplined and vindictive smart
aleck.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend of mine put it, ``It's Deke terminology: We're
scoring a two-kegger with the Tri-Delts. There'll be some
major-league drinkage and some totally awesome babe-age. Be there,
Dubya, and score some treats.''
</P>
<P>
   President Smirk can't get elected. If W. is not mature enough to
hold his tongue around an open microphone during the big kickoff
day in a week when he desperately needs to turn things around, how
do we know he won't get up to his old frat pranks in the Oval
Office, chasing world leaders around bilaterals, trying to brand
them with hot metal coat hangers?
</P>
<P>
   W. has built his whole campaign on that famous Bush breeding. As
Dick Armey recently told The Los Angeles Times, ``George Bush is
going to demonstrate a new axiom: Good manners make good
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Since W. cannot argue that the country isn't thriving, he is
running on a promise to restore civility and bring a new tone of
collegiality.
</P>
<P>
   After his insult was broadcast Monday, the candidate of manners
refused to apologize. His campaign bragged that he was just
delivering what he promised: ``plain speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   W. is at his least appealing when he's down. He's only lucky
that Al Gore is at his least appealing when he's up. The vice
president is letting that supercilious tone creep back.
</P>
<P>
   Before W. makes any more snide cracks about the major leagues,
he should remember he's in them.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AIRLINES FETE BUSINESS FLIERS WITH WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication notice: also sent with `t' code)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably don't want to be reading this if, like so many
hard-pressed business travelers these days, you're crammed into
some awful middle-row seat in coach on an international flight,
counting the hours till arrival and wondering how you're going to
squeeze past that fat guy sleeping in the aisle seat to get to the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   This column is about what's going on up there behind the curtain
in the expensive seats. Party time, is what.
</P>
<P>
   Business-class and first-class seats are where the airlines make
most of their money and where they try to attract their most loyal
customers. In the past year or so, the competition for that market
has become fierce, as airlines scramble to outdo one another with
bigger seats, better food, more movie selections than a supermall
Cineplex _ and, yes, even wine.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine called Business Traveler International does an annual
survey article, ``Cellars in the Sky,'' in which a panel of experts
ranks the wines served in business class on about 40 world
airlines. The current top 10: Finnair, Aeromexico, Delta Air Lines,
Thai Airways, Virgin Atlantic, EVA Air, Spanair, Continental
Airlines, Alitalia and LanChile.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Chase, a self-described ``classically trained wine merchant
with an international reputation spanning the globe,'' pronounces
himself happy to see such robust competition. That's partly because
Chase has been busy promoting the efforts of one of those airlines,
Delta, to associate its recently revamped business-class brand with
high-quality wine service.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, who is Delta's wine consultant, isn't just flogging wine.
He is positively proselytizing it, even enlisting Delta flight
attendants in voluntary wine-tasting seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine consumption is not going up very much in the United
States, but we're drinking better wine,'' Chase said. Good times
translate into more business-travelers with a taste for wine. Among
them, incidentally, are the highly sought-after hordes of young men
and women with dot-com incomes who are ready to shed beer-bottle
tastes from their not-so-distant college days for the best from the
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not yet know a lot about wine, but they know it's an
important part of the lifestyle package,'' Chase said. By and
large, he added, ``they know a few favorite labels'' and don't
experiment much. ``The idea here to introduce the business-class
customer to a very wide variety of excellent wines.''
</P>
<P>
   All major airlines pay attention to wine in the premium cabins.
But obviously, not many people are going to select an international
airline exclusively or even mostly based on the quality of the
wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one of many product enhancements to upgrade the
experience for our international business passengers,'' said John
Kennedy, a spokesman for Delta, which has dropped first-class
seating on international flights in favor of an upgraded business
class.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Kennedy said, an amenity like top-shelf wine
doesn't matter all that much. ``Then it's basically, `How do I get
from New York to Atlanta; the wine's OK but I don't have to drink
it, and who cares anyway as long as I get there on time,''' he
said. ``But on an 8- or 12-hour trip, especially when you've spent
$6,000, you want a little more than just transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta's new wine-service program has a brand name, Vinum.
Business-class passengers get to choose selections from dozens of
labels in a 24-page wine list that is passed out, Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   To help encourage wine connoisseurship, says that he has been
preaching among the ranks of Delta's 20,000 flight attendants.
Incidentally, if there is one thing that airline flight attendants
do not welcome these days, it is extra work in the crowded skies _
including uncorking fancy wines for pampered passengers.
</P>
<P>
   So Chase, whose wine-consulting company is based in Canada, has
been wily. He came up with three ways to get at least some flight
attendants enthusiastically on board.
</P>
<P>
   Chase holds wine-tasting parties around the country, inviting
off-duty flight attendants to come in, sample a variety of
excellent wines, and listen to him talk on the subject. He also
publishes a wine newsletter for flight attendants and festoons
flight-attendant bulletin boards with helpful information. And he
is putting the finishing touches on his own compact-disc recording
of a wine course that will be distributed to Delta attendants later
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the all-expenses paid trip to what he calls
the ``Vinum Academy'' at a chateau on the Cotes du Rhone in
southern France. This year, 16 Delta flight attendants, chosen from
about 1,300 who have so far submitted entries in a wine
essay-question contest, will attend the week-long wine seminar
taught by Chase and other international wine experts at the Chateau
de Rochegude near Avignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take over the whole castle for the week,'' he said.
Graduating flight attendants become ``wine ambassadors'' and
receive gold pins that indicate they know their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want wine to be a chore for them,'' he said. The ones
who have participated in the seminars and last year's academy
``have become very enthusiastic'' about wine, he said, adding that
senior flight attendants are starting to convey the love and lore
of fine wine downward to the younger flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like that trickle-down effect,'' he said. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The summit meeting of world leaders gets under way
Wednesday at the United Nations, but most of New York and its
thousands of visitors could not wait to open the curtain on what
promises to be a world-class sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was backed up across the East Side Tuesday because of a
crush of limousines carrying VIPs everywhere from the U.N. Plaza
Hotel to the Bronx Zoo. (Denis Sassou-Nguesso, president of the
Republic of Congo, skipped some pre-conference hobnobbing to tour
the ``Congo Gorilla Forest'' exhibit).
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, some beating drums, some shouting with bullhorns
and some practicing silent meditation, squeezed into Dag
Hammarskjolkd Plaza at the United Nations, the global soapbox for
the week. Whether anyone was listening did not seem important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no peace without Yahweh's 613 laws of peace,'' a
religious group from Texas chanted. The reply from a pro-Taiwan
group: ``Say no to China.'' And members of the Chinese spiritual
movement Falung Gong, kept the yelling to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just focus inside,'' one of the meditators said.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary general, has called the three-day
conference a ``defining moment for the world's leaders and for the
United Nations.'' To be sure, some of the world's most vexing
problems, from poverty to disease, will be debated by presidents,
prime ministers, kings and crown princes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, President Mohammed Khatami of Iran delivered a speech
at a one-day conference ahead of the summit, in which he praised
Iran as one of the world's oldest civilizations and promoted his
campaign for a global ``dialogue among civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions also began among four African presidents on
Zimbabwe's troubled land-reform program. More than 700 other
meetings, dealing with local issues around the world, are expected
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, it was mostly hard to see the diplomacy past the
pre-summit spectacle, which spilled into every nook and cranny of
New York and promised to continue throughout the week. Even as
Khatami spoke, hundreds of demonstrators marched down 47th Street
in opposition to his government, their protests filling one slot in
a day of events and counter-events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this in bits and pieces before, but never like
this all together,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, who joined the
ranks of attention-seekers by releasing a letter to Madeleine
Albright, the secretary of state, requesting that the city be
reimbursed for the $10 million it is spending on the summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, home for the week to
about 30 heads of state, including President Clinton, finished
installing an elaborate telephone network that includes 4 miles of
additional cable, untold pieces of high-tech gadgetry and several
rooftop satellite links. Maintenance workers at the United Nations,
meanwhile, rushed to shore up a rain-soaked ceiling in a meeting
room where breakfast is to be served Wednesday to more than 150
invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed every New Yorker, permanent or just passing through,
also had a gripe about the once-a-millennium inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   A German tennis player, Nicolas Kiefer, advanced to the
quarterfinals at the U.S. Open in Queens, but only after surviving
a sleepless weekend at his hotel, the U.N. Plaza. Kiefer said he
had ``a very bad night'' on Sunday because there were no fewer than
four security alerts during the night. The Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, one of 18 dignitaries considered high security risks
by police, is among the hotel's guests.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer said he moved to the Waldorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow is the same thing again when Mr. Clinton is
going'' there, he said shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudoph Giuliani, who has a history of using U.N.
gatherings to dress down his least favorite world leaders, did not
go uncounted by attacking Fidel Castro of Cuba, who is making his
first visit to New York in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and sympathize with the sense of injustice that
much of the Cuban community feels with regard to Fidel Castro,''
Giuliani told a Midtown news conference. ``He's taken the land of
many people, displaced families, killed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro will get his chance to turn some heads Wednesday when he
addresses the summit meeting's opening session.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean leaders did not even make it to New York. They
abruptly returned home after being subjected to security checks at
the airport in Frankfurt, Germany. Choe Su Hon, the North Korean
deputy minister for foreign affairs, blamed the United States for
the security measures, carried out by American Airlines, which
apparently caused the delegation to miss its flight. The State De-
partment said the problem may have been a result of the Koreans'
not notifying U.S. officials of their travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will shed tears about the absence of the North
Koreans: All the more attention for the rest of us out there.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, the main speaker was a no-show and the crowd outside
a funeral home across the street was bigger than the media
contingent on hand. But the Friends of Zimbabwe pressed ahead with
its publicity campaign, one of an array organizations and people
across the city screaming, ``Hey, look at me!''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wareham, a Brooklyn lawyer, unveiled a poster of Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe at the Mt. Olivet Baptist Church on Malcolm
X Boulevard. The Rev. Charles Curtis, pastor at the church, spoke
of an international political and media campaign to discredit
Mugabe. And Amadi Ajamu, the group's publicity chief, handed out a
press release announcing the Zimbabwean president's appearance
Thursday night at the church, a sort of coming out party for the
African leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that he is not really well known in the black
community,'' Wareham said. ``People know Fidel,'' he said referring
to Castro, ``but if they've heard of Mugabe in the mainstream
media, they think he is some kind of maniac.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Mugabe were not alone in their frustration, as
evidenced by the flurry of press releases, some written by hand,
sent to media organizations around the city.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady of South Korea would like it known that she will
help raise money for HIV-infected children at the YMCA in Flushing.
Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, the India's ambassador to the United
Nations, will be happy to answer questions about a book he has
edited, ``Imagining Tomorrow: Rethinking the Global Challenge.''
The American Anti-Slavery Group, with the help of the Guardian
Angels, will attempt to make a citizen's arrest on President Omar
Beshir of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev will be talking about the ``state of the
world'' at a $5,000-per-person conference at the New York Hilton
and Towers.The Pakistan Muslim League USA will condemn military
rule in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Anderson did not write a press release, but she is starving
for some attention as well. She runs Al's Delicatessen at what has
become ground zero during Millennium Summit week, 44th Street
between First and Second avenues. Al's lies behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who requested Al's by name were allowed Tuesday to
slip past the police line, but none seemed to know this, and so
what would have been the 1 p.m. sandwich rush became a thin trickle
of secret service agents, police officers and the occasional
regular from the nearby Nigerian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in the area, Anderson can tell the difference.
``I can see if they're secret service or state department or with
the detectives or with the policemen,'' she said. ``They all behave
different.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, three men whisked in, placed orders for sandwiches and
headed for a table in the back corner of the room. The one who
seemed to be in charge was clearly a figure of note, Anderson
determined, someone `` very down to business.''
</P>
<P>
   The customer was Leon Fuerth, Vice President Al Gore's national
security adviser, and he polished off a turkey sandwich and a side
of cole slaw over a confab with two staffers that one of them
described only as ``important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't care for his bagel from the Delta Shuttle,''
confided the staff member, who asked that his name not be used.
With its paucity of customers, Al's was the perfect place to talk
foreign policy on the down-low. ``It gave us an opportunity to
engage in our discussion in a typical New York environment,'' the
staffer said.

 &HT;    Georgia hoping drink keeps it out of cramping pickle
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia is taking every precaution to avoid being
in, well, a pickle, in Saturday's Southeastern Conference opener at
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia trainers gave several of the players two ounces of
pickle juice before Tuesday's football practice. The NFL's
Philadelphia Eagles credit the briny liquid for not cramping in
Sunday's 41-14 win at Dallas in 109-degree temperatures. No Eagle
left the game with cramps while several Cowboys were dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had been drinking pickle juice in training camp.
Reportedly, pickle juice contains a combination of salt and
nutrients that help prevent cramps.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to convince Georgia coach Jim Donnan. Several
Bulldogs suffered cramping in last week's 29-7 victory over Georgia
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for Columbia, S.C., on Saturday calls for
temperatures near 90 degrees.``We're going with that pickle
juice,'' Donnan said. ``We got a gallon of it and our guys are
going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Georgia's players have acquired the taste.

BENNETT A FEW INJURIES FROM QB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is Drew Bennett the next John Fox?
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway. When Cory Paus separated his shoulder, it meant
that the only quarterbacks left for the next three weeks are Ryan
McCann, Scott McEwan (who has completed two passes in his career)
and freshman walk-on Roman Ybarra.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former starting quarterback who was moved to linebacker,
returned to his old position last season and led USC to a victory
over UCLA, snapping the Bruins winning streak in the rivalry at
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could be set for Bennett, who started two games at
quarterback last season before moving to receiver, to make a
similar move. It just won't happen yet.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff discussed the move but wants Bennett, who has
worked himself into the rotation at receiver and played sparingly
against Alabama, to stick to his position. For now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If disaster struck,'' Toledo said. ``He'd be our disaster
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Faoa returns: Strong-side linebacker Asi Faoa, who is
expected to back up Tony White this season, returns after his
one-game suspension for an off-campus fight. He's currently behind
White and true freshman Brandon Chillar after working with the
scout team for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Faoa, a redshirt freshman, spent Saturday watching the game in
the stands, sandwiched between the cheerleaders and the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a load off my shoulders,'' he said of his return. ``It
was disappointing to put myself in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Defensive end Kenyon Coleman (cold) and
receiver Brian Poli-Dixon (hamstring) didn't practice Tuesday.
Poli-Dixon suffered his injury early in the second half against
Alabama and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Ken Kocher tweaked his sprained ankle in
practice Monday and his status is in doubt for Saturday. Kocher was
expected to play sparingly. Linebacker Marcus Reese (sprained foot)
also is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   __ Change that grade:! It turns out it wasn't right tackle Mike
Saffer who was beaten on the sack that separated Cory Paus'
shoulder, as was noted in Monday's report card. Alabama end Jarret
Johnson blew past Saffer, but the responsibility for blocking him
belonged to fullback Matt Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a quarterback gets sacked, everybody thinks it's the
offensive line's fault,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Foster honored: Tailback DeShaun Foster was named the
national player of the week by CNNSI.com and USA Today.com after
rushing for 187 yards and three touchdowns on 42 carries in the
victory over Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   After examining game film, Toledo said Foster gained 105 of his
yards after making contact with defenders. While Foster, who has
battled injuries the past two seasons, had never carried more than
24 times in college, Toledo thinks he's capable of handling such a
load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly want to run him 42 times a game, but if
that's what we have to do to win the game . . .'' Toledo said.
``Maybe I'll give him two scholarships.''

AIKMAN FEELS OK, BUT STATUS UNCLEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Troy Aikman was said to be feeling good Tuesday
_ even better than he had hoped _ two days after receiving a ``mild
concussion'' against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of that encouraging bit of news from Aikman, the
Cowboys are prepared to start Randall Cunningham on Sunday night
against the Arizona Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly going about our business today as if Randall
Cunningham is going to be our starting quarterback,'' coach Dave
Campo said. ``I think that's the smart thing to do, and that's the
way we have to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo talked to Aikman on the phone and shared part of that
conversation at his weekly Tuesday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy feels very comfortable,'' Campo said. ``I told him my No.
1 concern was his health. He agreed with that, and said that he's
definitely keeping all his options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nature of post-concussion syndrome (headaches,
nausea, dizziness and lethargy), as well as the cumulative effect
of recurring head traumas, there has been much speculation since
Sunday that one of Aikman's options should be retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has had eight concussions with the Cowboys since 1989,
including three in his past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Campo said that Aikman never alluded to retirement Tuesday
or that retirement was out of the question, either. It just didn't
come up in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strictly a health talk ... how he's doing,'' Campo
said. ``We did not discuss if he was playing this week, or next
week, or the week after, or what's happening. I just personally
wanted to find out how he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman took 15 snaps and was gone early in the second quarter
Sunday. He was sacked four times, knocked down eight times in all,
and finished 0-for-5 passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some symptoms prior to that with an inner-ear
infection,'' Campo said. ``So, he's not quite sure where he's at as
far as the \Rconcussion-like\S symptoms are concerned. He feels
very good today, let me put it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said as recently as three months ago that age (33) was on
his side. He said then that age was as attributable to forced
retirement of a player with a history of concussions as the number
of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Roger \RStaubach\S. The concussions he had, in
and of themselves, were not the reason that Roger retired,'' Aikman
said in June. ``If he had been 33 or 34 years old, he would not
have retired. We've talked about that. And if Steve Young were 33
or 34, I don't know if he would've retired. Likewise, if I were 38
and had had the concussions that I had last year, maybe I would
have retired. It's hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   When they retired, Staubach and Young were 38 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman missed two starts last season with concussions received
Oct. 31 and Nov. 8. He visited two neurosurgeons who specialize in
sports-related head traumas. Tests were conducted and a base line
established for the purpose of comparative testing.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones talked this week to Aikman's neurosurgeons as
well as the team's medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: Before Aikman suits up again, a consensus
must be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a group decision _ including Troy, who will be the
biggest decision-maker,'' Campo said, adding that it will not be
Aikman's call alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be where we're trying to make a
\Rquarterback\S decision on Friday,'' Campo said. ``That definitely
is not in Troy's best interest, and probably not in ours, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham will get a personalized game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different style,'' said Campo, comparing the two quarterbacks.
``Obviously, Arizona will have to prepare for Randall's ability to
scramble now.''
</P>
<P>
   But because Cunningham joined the Cowboys on June 8 and never
before had worked in a timing-route offense, he is expected to
receive a scaled-down version of the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have an important ``Monday Night Football'' game at
Washington coming up after the Arizona game.
</P>
<P>
   The nod for Sunday night most likely will go to Cunningham,
unless Aikman walks into Valley Ranch today and gives the Cowboys a
reason to believe there's a choice to be made.

TV SPORTS: MILLER'S MONDAY NIGHT DEBUT A LESS THAN DIVINE COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we know what Dennis Miller sounds like in a great game when
he has consciously dialed back his shtick.
</P>
<P>
   Mediocre. Maybe not even necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Lite is not what ABC was looking for when it hired Miller
for ``Monday Night Football.'' Yet that is what he provided during
St. Louis' exciting 41-36 victory over Denver. Dan Fouts became the
undisputed No. 2 voice in the booth, and Miller reduced himself to
comments like, ``Not surprising that the ball may be slippery for a
guy named Griese.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, trying to be statistically profound, he said, ``Testimony to
Terrell Davis' greatness: He didn't play last year and he's still
averaged 1,000 yards a year for the past two.'' Sorry, babe, he did
play last season, rushing for 211 yards in four games before
tearing up his knee, although he did gain 2,008 yards in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Or, this nugget of wisdom that my gym coach once told me: ``You
can't teach quicks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller's travails Monday night may be traced to nerves or the
vintage 1970s banana-yellow ``Wide World of Sports'' blazer he
wore. But ABC's Miller Dilemma is this: it dreams of having classic
games like Monday night's, and yet such riveting broadcasts will
restrict Miller's verbal reveries and point him toward too much
football analysis, at which he is deficient.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers simply don't need Miller to tell them that Kurt Warner,
the Rams' quarterback, is ``impervious'' to a pass rush or
``downright contemplative in the pocket,'' unless he's prepared for
a rapid analysis that goes beyond saying the former Arena Football
League player ``must feel like he's coming from the bumper pool
table to the snooker table.''
</P>
<P>
   When Al Michaels noted that the Denver offensive line lacks
anyone weighing more than 300 pounds, Miller added that the
Broncos' offensive line coach is light, too. When did players start
reflecting the physical characteristics of their coaches? Did any
of the old Jets reflect Weeb Ewbank's short, dumpy look? Did any
New Orleans Saints adopt Hank Stram's hairdo?
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, the Miller imitator mocked mercilessly during the
Fox pre-game show on Sunday was funnier than the real Miller on
Monday night. Regrettably, I must report chuckles emanating from my
mouth during Jimmy Kimmel's segment with ``Miller,'' who said,
``Hey, Kimmel, nice place you've got here. It's like Gepetto and
his brotherhood of Italian puppeteer Local 257 set up shop in a
Kosovar bomb shelter, babe.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller encroached into the troubling terrain of overfamiliarity.
Four times he labeled Denver coach Mike Shanahan a genius and twice
he referred to him as Shanny. Maybe that's the swingin' Rat Pack
way of doing things, but hearing Miller sound like he has been
swapping offensive schemes with Shanahan for decades pushes the
comedian's ``analyst'' role.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're going to shill your network's programs, be
accurate. ``Let's hope Charlie Sheen is the comeback player of the
year in sitcoms,'' Miller said, regarding Sheen's addition to the
``Spin City'' cast. Sheen has never been in a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Miller needs the room to be funny and obscure, to make people
wonder what planet he's from and to use the game as his foil. Like
Warner, he's got to air it out, and the producer Don Ohlmeyer has
to give him the room to do it, even in tight, exciting games.
Because if Miller is to be the 21st century Howard Cosell, or at
least someone provocative enough to make people watch to hear what
he will say next, he will not do it by saying, ``Shanny's got to
love the resiliency of his team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Fouts, well, he's still just an OK analyst. Ohlmeyer said
he had detected a breakthrough in the last preseason game, but
Fouts seemed to be offering up the obvious most of the time on
Monday night. In one play early in the game, he praised Denver's
Rod Smith for reaching back to catch the ball on a long reception.
Isn't that what a wideout is supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   Fouts also lauded the ``makeup speed'' of the St. Louis
cornerback Dexter McCleon when he batted away a Griese pass. But
the replay clearly showed the ball was too high to be caught and
was coming back McCleon's way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michaels displayed his usual mastery of play-by-play, and called
Miller ``baby'' only once. Because Miller wasn't very funny,
Michaels wasn't laughing. He also did what was necessary to
describe the four felony charges against the Denver linebacker Bill
Romanowski, who is accused of using diet drugs prescribed for his
wife and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the sideline, Melissa Stark wasn't creating a new
paradigm for her role. She delivered the news about Davis' ankle
injury, but asked softball questions of Paul Tagliabue, the
National Football League commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Dickerson, the other sideline reporter, was so smartly
underused Monday night that he all but disappeared from ABC's
radar. What he contributed was nearly useless and badly presented.
Last week, Ohlmeyer said he regretted pushing Dickerson into a
reporter's role so quickly and was converting him to a sideline
expert analyst. He's no better at that, and his on-the-job training
is painful to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The production, led by Ohlmeyer and the new director, Drew
Esocoff, looked sharp. The use of the tiny camera on the umpire's
cap revealed some terrific shots, and the cameraman toting the
``Steadicam'' produced excellent angles of sideline scampers. Does
that guy have 4.4 speed? The halftime program improved simply by
not being set in an ESPN Zone restaurant, but showed a lack of
creativity with a stale compilation of NFL Films bloopers. Doesn't
everyone have that video at home?
</P>
<P>
   The game produced a 15.9 overnight Nielsen rating, down from a
16.2 for last season's first game, which was played a week later,
but up 8.9 percent from a Labor Day opening game two years ago. &QL;

METS SNAP SLIDE ON ZEILE'S HOME RUN
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The key, Todd Zeile said Tuesday afternoon, is to
realize you will come out of it eventually. Don't lose confidence.
Don't change the mechanics of your swing. Don't panic. The hits
have come before, said the Mets first baseman, and they will come
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are in an offensive free-fall, and Zeile has been one
of the fastest to plummet, batting .146 since Aug. 17. The slump
has largely been a mystery to a player who takes pride in
performing well late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this time of year,'' Zeile said. ``This is when I tend
to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile did well Tuesday night, and his heroics lifted the Mets to
their first victory in five games in September. Zeile drove in two
runs, including the game-winner on a home run in the 10th inning,
as the Mets beat the Cincinnati Reds, 3-2. The Mets managed only
six hits, but two came from Zeile, who knocked in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (7-4) nearly surrendered a game-winning homer to
Ken Griffey Jr. in the bottom of the ninth. But, with Wendell
waving the ball foul, Griffey's screaming liner landed about four
seats to the right of the foul pole, and the Reds slugger struck
out. Wendell survived the inning, and Zeile's homer off Scott
Sullivan (2-6) have him the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez worked a 1-2-3 10th for his 37th save, and the
Mets won for the eighth time in Rick Reed's last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   After laboring in his first start off the disabled list on July
17, Reed has been magnificent. In his last nine starts, Reed is 5-2
with a 2.80 earned run average, and he has gone at least six
innings with no more than three earned runs in every start but one.
</P>
<P>
   He worked only one 1-2-3 inning Tuesday night but avoided
trouble with fine defense and one Reds base-running blunder. Dmitri
Young led off the second with a single, and third baseman Robin
Ventura charged a Michael Tucker grounder and threw him out at
first. Young reached second on the play, and Chris Sexton singled
to right.
</P>
<P>
   Young chugged to third and was waved home by the third-base
coach Ron Oester. Timoniel Perez did not make an especially
accurate throw _ it was several feet up the line _ but Young was
even further away from the plate. Catcher Mike Piazza tagged him
for the out, and the inning ended one batter later.
</P>
<P>
   Reed held the Reds hitless until the fifth, when Sexton led off
with a double. Jason LaRue followed with a shot down the third base
line, but Ventura leaped to his right for a diving catch. Pokey
Reese singled in Sexton with two outs, but the damage could have
been worse had Ventura not prevented an extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is in an awful hitting slump _ he has not hit much all
year _ but he is still a superior fielder. Besides the charge and
dive, he made a strong, off-balance throw from behind third base,
bouncing it twice off the turf to catch the speedy Reese on a
grounder in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Reed left in the seventh after throwing his 100th pitch, which
was bunted for a sacrifice by Reds starter Pete Harnisch, who
worked seven strong innings. Rick White came in, got one out, then
allowed a single to Chris Stynes that tied the score, 2-2. John
Franco, in his first game since missing two weeks with a sore left
pectoral muscle, got out of the inning, then worked a scoreless
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Stynes' hit erased what had been a 2-0 Mets lead. The first six
Mets went down in order, but Jay Payton led off the third with a
single. Kurt Abbott flied to the warning track in center, and
Payton took second on the sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had been 0 for their last 12 with runners in scoring
position, but Benny Agbayani ended the string when he punched a
single to right, scoring Payton to give the Mets a 1-0 lead. It
also marked the Mets' first two-hit rally in 28 innings, since the
fourth inning on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They came right back with another two-hit rally. Edgardo Alfonzo
led off the fourth with a double, and after Piazza grounded out and
Ventura popped to left, Zeile rapped a single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young charged it, anticipating a throw home, but he
failed to get in front of the ball and it skipped past him, all the
way back to the wall. Alfonzo scored easily as Zeile pulled into
third. He was stranded there when Payton struck out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets had a 2-0 lead, and their offense seemed to be
breathing again. Zeile, who had been 7 for 49 with just three runs
batted in, had delivered. But the life-support machine started
whirring again, and the Reds held the Mets scoreless for the next
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Harnisch out of the game did not help. The rookie John
Riedling struck out two of the three he retired in the eighth, then
Scott Sullivan struck out the side in the ninth, getting Perez,
Alfonzo and Piazza. &QL;

DAY IN THE LIFE: COWBOYS OFFENSIVE LINEMAN KEEPS GROCERY SHOPPING
SIMPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys offensive lineman Jorge Diaz spends his
weekend pushing around 300-pound defensive linemen. His off day is
spent pushing around a 100-pound shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's errands Tuesday included a stop at Albertson's, which is
located less than a mile from his apartment near Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said he eats breakfast and lunch at the team's complex, but
he usually eats dinner alone in front of the TV. So with his
refrigerator empty of almost everything except ``liquid
beverages,'' it was time for a trip to the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been two weeks since I've really shopped,'' Diaz said.
``I try to go every two to three weeks. The funniest thing about
grocery shopping is you go back to the house and say, `This is all
I got?' I get lazy sometimes and just start eating out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Diaz spent 45 minutes filling up his cart with
$118.54 in groceries, which he paid for with a debit card.
</P>
<P>
   He shops like the bachelor that he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say that,'' Diaz said. ``I'm not going to
lie. I've got to make stuff that's easy. The frozen foods section
is big for me, because it's easy to throw in the microwave or the
oven. I like things that come with not too much hassle. I keep it
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his mother is a good cook, Diaz never learned for
himself. He admits he needs microwave directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a rule: If it takes longer to cook than to eat, I
don't do it,'' Diaz said. ``I'll go to the drive-through instead.
You can never copy your mom anyway. Moms do it a certain way. ''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, 26, shops without the benefit of a list or coupons. He
knows what he needs, and, with a contract that will pay him a base
salary of $413,000 this season, he can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see a special, like two for a dollar, of course, I'll go
for it,'' said Diaz, who spent four seasons with the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and owns a house in Tampa, Fla. ``You've got to find the
best buy. But I'm not going to flip through Sunday's paper and clip
out coupons. That's one of those things I don't mess with.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's cart included five bananas, a pound of roast beef sliced
for sandwiches, Kraft Deli Deluxe cheese slices, large cans of Chef
Boyardee and Star Kist tuna, Ruffles and, from the frozen section,
jalapeno poppers, chicken teriyaki and stuffed chicken breasts. He
also bought two pounds of fresh shrimp, which he used in a
marinara-and-pasta dish he had for dinner Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my speciality _ shrimp marinara and pasta,'' Diaz said.
``That's about the only thing I can cook up real good.''
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he also threw in two bottles of hot sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like salt and pepper,'' he said. ``Growing up in Texas, I
like hot, spicy food.''
</P>
<P>
   But the staple for Diaz is liquids. Lots and lots of liquids.
Enough fat-free milk, Gatorade, bottled water and Minute Maid fruit
punch to fill the back of his sport utility vehicle. But no pickle
juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say 75 percent of my groceries are liquid,'' Diaz
said. ``It's the most important aisle for me. It's so hot, I want
to make sure I replenish the fluids I lose at practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, who weighs 315 pounds, watches what he eats. The cookie
and ice cream aisles tempted him, but he resisted the urge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to watch the figure,'' Diaz said. ``I try to eat
right. I don't want to overdo it. There is a misconception that if
you sweat off 10 pounds, then you can eat whatever you want. But
you've only lost water weight, not those love handles some of us
have going.''

   Diaz usually gets in and out of the grocery store without being
recognized, but with a reporter and a photographer tagging along
Tuesday, his excursion attracted a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
   The butcher slicing Diaz's roast beef asked Diaz what he did for
a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play for the Cowboys, man,'' Diaz said. ``But after last
week, we don't want to talk about it. The tomatoes are pretty
close. People might start throwing them at me. We wouldn't want
that.'' nn

PENTAGON SECURITY GATE MISFIRES, INJURING GERMAN   OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Germany's defense minister was injured and briefly
hospitalized on Tuesday after a steel security barrier sprang up
beneath his motorcade as it arrived for an honors ceremony at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, suffered a scrape on his
head and a cut on his foot when his Town Car was struck by the
retractable barricade, just after 4 p.m. The defense attache at the
German Embassy, Brig. Gen. Peter Goebel, and an American security
aide were also slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said that the injuries
were not serious but that all three men were taken to Arlington
Hospital in Virginia this evening for tests. ``His condition is, I
think, very good,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two years that the Pentagon's security
system had injured a visiting defense minister. In September 1998,
Japan's defense minister, Fukushiro Nukaga, and five others were
injured in a strikingly similar accident at the same barricade.
</P>
<P>
   That accident, attributed to a faulty sensor, prompted the
Pentagon to install a new system for controlling the barricades,
which were installed in 1992 to prevent terrorists from driving too
close to the building.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon noted that thousands of cars had passed through the
barricades. ``We had no problems with the system until today,'' he
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred just before Scharping was to meet with
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen. When Cohen arrived at the
gate, Scharping was lying on the ground outside the car, which
remained hoisted on the barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came right away and came to the gate and greeted him while
he was still lying down,'' said Scharping's spokesman, Detlef Puhl.
</P>
<P>
   A military surgeon treated Scharping, Goebel and the American
security aide, John Salazar, in Cohen's dining room before they
were taken to the hospital. None were wearing seat belts when the
barricade struck their car.

TAXI KILLS TRUMAN'S GRANDSON
</HEADLINE>
  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A grandson of President Harry S. Truman died on
Monday from injuries he suffered when a cab hit him on Park Avenue
over the weekend, his family said. The accident is still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, William Wallace Daniel, 41, was the son of the
novelist Margaret Truman, the only child of President Truman, and
Clifton Daniel, the former managing editor of The New York Times,
who died in February. The second of four brothers, Daniel was a
psychiatric social worker at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not discuss the investigation, but his family
provided a copy of the police report, which said Daniel was trying
to cross Park Avenue at East 76th St. at 2:40 a.m. Saturday when
the yellow cab struck him.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel was hit just a few feet from the Park Avenue apartment
building where his mother lived, said his oldest brother, Clifton
Truman Daniel of Chicago, who flew to New York after the accident.
``He was just coming to spend the night, to sleep in his old bed,''
he said. ``We have no clue what happened. We don't know how fast
the cabby was driving or whether he was even speeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel died Monday from a head injury at New York Hospital,
family members and a spokeswoman for the hospital said. Besides his
mother and older brother, he is survived by two other brothers,
Harrison Gates Daniel of Manhattan and Thomas Washington Daniel of
Starksboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The cab driver, Mohamed A. Dawoud, 29, of Manhattan, did not
return telephone calls to his home Tuesday, but he told a police
officer that Daniel was crossing against the light, according to
the report. A spokesman for the cab's owner, &UR;  &LR; Kinky Cab Corp.,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's friends and colleagues recalled his good humor. ``He
was always the captain of everyone else's good time,'' said Mimi
Gaber, his girlfriend. ``He was always arranging something or doing
something spontaneous; the kind of guy who would hang glide across
the Grand Canyon if someone challenged him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the psychiatric institute, Daniel was the coordinator and a
chief researcher for a study aimed at reducing risky sexual
behavior among mentally ill men at risk of HIV infection, said Dr.
Ezra Susser, who is overseeing the study. Susser, who is chairman
of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia,
said Daniel's co-workers only just learned he was Truman's
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea who he was,'' Susser said. ``He never told
anyone. I guess he wanted to be known for his work, not his family
background.''

<P>
   (Phoenix) - Kartchner Caverns is drying out, and state officials
are ignoring the threat to its delicate formations, say the two men
who discovered the underground fantasy world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been kind of sticking their heads in the sand,'' Gary
Tenen said Tuesday. He and fellow cave buff Randy Tufts, both from
Tucson, discovered Kartchner in 1974 when they wriggled through a
small hole in the ground near Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State Parks took elaborate and expensive steps to
protect the cave's moist environment before opening it to public
tours a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ziemann, assistant director of Arizona State Parks, points
out that Kartchner was built and opened during a severe drought in
southeastern Arizona. He predicts recent rains will boost the
humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The state also is putting together a panel of scientists to
monitor data from the cave.
</P>
<P>
   Tenen worries that measurements show the evaporation rising
sharply from 1997 to 1999. The temperature also has climbed an
average of more than 1 degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we hear,'' he said, ``the more alarmed we get that
nothing has been done.''

WHICH IS BEST?: DEBATABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ College football fans are debating whether USC or
UCLA is the best team in town. And who's to say it's too early for
that?
</P>
<P>
   Each team opened the season with an impressive, upset victory
over a ranked opponent from a well-thought-of conference. Each is
moving up in the Associated Press poll, USC to No. 11 and UCLA to
No. 16, the first time in five years that both have been this high.
Clearly they're on their way to the top 10 and a battle of
unbeatens Nov. 18 at the Rose Bowl. The winner will be crowned
champion of the Pacific-10, which turns out to be the nation's
strongest conference, as widely predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Who, this side of George W. Bush, wouldn't want part of this
debate?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Paul Hackett, for one. The Trojans coach recoiled in
apparent pain when I offered him a chance to weigh in on the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard for me to worry about a team we're going to
play in nine weeks!'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks, but who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   So how do they stack up? Let's tackle the question from a few
different angles:
</P>
<P>
   __ Rankings: USC actually gained one spot while sitting idle
last weekend, even though Penn State, which it beat in the Kickoff
Classic, came back and lost to Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA gained 10 spots but remained lower than Alabama, which it
beat handily Saturday, because Alabama is still getting credit for
its undefeated offseason. Conclusion: UCLA has all the momentum and
poll voters need new glasses. !bold!Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Victories: USC jumped in front, returning a blocked punt for
a touchdown barely two minutes into the game, was in charge all the
way and barely was tested against Penn State. All we know for sure
about the Trojans' overall strength is that they're better than
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had to come from behind twice and overcome an injury to
starting quarterback Cory Paus to beat Alabama behind backup Ryan
McCann. It was a gutsy performance. !bold!Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   !tvspt!Experience: USC is starting nine seniors and 14
upperclassmen. UCLA is starting seven seniors and 16 upperclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   Each side can argue that its team is more seasoned, but UCLA's,
with nine juniors in the lineup, enjoys more room to mature.
!bold!Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaches: Hackett is 15-11 with no bowl victories at USC, and,
with his cap pulled down over his eyes on the sideline, is barely
distinguishable from an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Toledo is 30-17 with one bowl victory at UCLA, and his
prominent belly communicates an appealing image of ``power,''
``prosperity'' and ``excellent pizza in the student union.''
!bold!Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Passing game: USC quarterback Carson Palmer looked better on
the preseason magazine covers than he did on the field against Penn
State, going 10 for 20, for 87 yards, no touchdowns and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has the best quarterback in town so far this season. He's
flanker Freddie Mitchell, whose one pass was a perfect strike for a
31-yard touchdown against Alabama. !bold!Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rushing game: USC's Sultan McCullough looked like a Trojans
tailback of old by carrying 29 times for 128 yards against Penn
State, which didn't allow a 100-yard game all last season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's DeShaun Foster did an even better Anthony Davis
impression by carrying 42 times for 187 yards and three touchdowns,
breaking tackles all over the field, against Alabama. !bold!Edge:
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defense: USC held the Penn State offense to three points.
Penn State came back to score six on Toledo. All we know for sure
about the Trojans defense is that it's better than Toledo's.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA held the Alabama offense to 10 points and pitched a
second-half shutout, holding the great receiver Freddie Milons to
18 yards. !bold!Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and it's pretty obvious who would win if UCLA and
USC played each other this week.
</P>
<P>
   USC would win. USC !ital!always wins when both schools are
top-10 quality. Look it up. It takes a bad UCLA team to beat a good
USC team.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has nine or 10 weeks to work on that.

COWBOYS YET TO UNDERSTAND FULLY WHERE THEY WENT WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good thing the players' hallowed ``24-hour rule'' doesn't apply
to media.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, putting the opening-day meltdown against the Philadelphia
Eagles behind them after 24 hours and turning their attention to
Sunday's matchup against the Arizona Cardinals was probably the
highlight of the Cowboys' week so far.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo said the best thing about the Eagles
game is that the Cowboys have 15 games to go. And he's promising
that things will be different, starting in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Campo also said that the sloppy preseason performances
wouldn't be repeated on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but for those who chronicle the Cowboys' affairs, putting
the Eagles game in the rear-view mirror is not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   To move forward, you have to understand what happened. And even
the Cowboys don't know the answer to that.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``we weren't ready to play'' and that ``we got whipped
physically'' doesn't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   Not being ready to play for the season opener after downplaying
the importance of preseason games brings into question the
preparation of the coaching staff and the internal fortitude of the
players. What's going to get them ready this week?
</P>
<P>
   Getting whipped physically by the Eagles makes one wonder about
the overall talent on the Cowboys, which, according to the coaches,
is the best since the 1995 Super Bowl team. Either the upstart
Eagles are Super Bowl worthy or there are talent-assessment issues
at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming tackle Erik Williams, as Cowboys officials have, is foul
as well. Sure, Williams' 28-day holdout robbed him of conditioning
and robbed the offensive line of critical cohesion time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, helped create that environment. They
didn't try to force Williams into camp with a fine. And upon his
return, they downplayed the significance of his absence. To bring
it up now, in an effort to explain breakdowns in the offensive
line, is hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, blitzing teams have given the Cowboys fits for the past
three years. Just ask the New Orleans Saints. A full training camp
by Williams wouldn't have made that much difference.
</P>
<P>
   Also, consider that many of the Eagles' sacks were not the
result of communication breakdowns on blitzes but ``look out''
blocks. You know, the kind when a player gets beat, then yells
``look out'' to the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's talent, huh?
</P>
<P>
   More troubling was the Cowboys' inability to offset the Eagles'
defensive stunts with quick passes and hot routes. The
beat-the-blitz thrills that the St. Louis Rams gave us Monday night
are what the Cowboys promised when they brought back their old
offense and signed receiver Joey Galloway to a $42 million contract
during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Campo blamed some of their blitz problems on his high-powered
stars at receiver and quarterback by saying they missed sight lines
and checkoffs _ things they worked on in practice. More quality
work in the preseason might have helped, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Now, a torn anterior cruciate ligament has turned Galloway into
an expensive fan. And quarterback Troy Aikman is in concussion
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Eagles game revealed that defensive end Kavika
Pittman (Denver Broncos) and middle linebacker Randall Godfrey
(Tennessee Titans) were bigger off-season losses than cornerback
Deion Sanders (Washington Redskins). At least that's what the stats
imply.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain a rushing performance by Eagles running
back Duce Staley that invoked the names of Hall of Famers Jim Brown
and Eric Dickerson? Staley, who has yet to make the Pro Bowl, ran
through, around and over the Cowboys for 201 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dat Nguyen, Godfrey's replacement, was the fifth-leading tackler
against the Eagles with eight. Among the people in front of him
were safeties Darren Woodson and George Teague, with 13 each, and
cornerback Ryan McNeil, with nine. Pittman's replacement, Ebenezer
Ekuban, tallied only two tackles and was platooned on rushing downs
with Alonzo Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   We also learned that a suspect pass rush remains suspect. Is
defensive end Greg Ellis healthy? The Cowboys still have problems
against mobile quarterbacks. Arizona's Jake Plummer will give them
more fits than Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   And we still don't know if the Cowboys can cover anybody in the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of that matters now. The Eagles game is in the
past and the Cardinals are all that's important.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some football?

RUBEN SIERRA DONS RANGERS UNIFORM FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 1992
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ruben Sierra walked into the Rangers' clubhouse right
at 4 p.m. yesterday. The broad smile on his face might have
revealed about what was going on inside him more than anything he
said or did.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled as he hugged trainers Danny Wheat and Ray Ramirez, and
equipment manager Zack Minasian, friends from the old days. He did
the same with hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, who turned him into a
switch hitter way back in 1983, and outfield coach Bobby Jones, who
got sent down when Sierra was called up for the first time on June
1, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced himself to Mike Lamb, Chad Curtis and other
players he had not met before. He shook hands with bullpen catcher
Ken Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   Then he sat down at his locker and put on a Rangers uniform for
the first time in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a blessing,'' Sierra said. ``I'm very happy to be
here. I want to say thank you to the Rangers and thank God for
bringing me back.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a four-time All-Star, including 1994 with Oakland, and a
four-time Rangers Player of the Year. Manager Johnny Oates said he
once considered Sierra ``the all-around best player in the American
League.'' Now, at 34, he is a September call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Sierra said. ``I can't predict the future. I'm
here. I know what's happened. Right now, I feel good. I know I can
still play. I can still hit. I can still run.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra did not play last night in the Rangers' game against the
Chicago White Sox. Oates does not know how much he'll play, if at
all. Sierra is mainly a designated hitter, and Oates believes he
owes that time to Frank Catalanotto and Curtis. Sierra could play
the outfield, but Oates wants to keep looking at Gabe Kapler, Ricky
Ledee and Scarborough Green. Rusty Greer isn't going to sit,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with Ruben,'' Oates said. ``I've known him for a
long time. I don't know what will happen. Let's just watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra said, ``I can't tell you what's on their minds. But I
know what's on my mind. Help the young guys, try to do the best I
can and let them know Ruben is back.''
</P>
<P>
   He is back at least from baseball oblivion. Since the Rangers
traded him on Aug. 31, 1992, Sierra has played for six major-league
teams and three minor-league teams. He has been released four times
since the start of 1997. He played in an Independent League last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him in winter ball,'' Ledee said. ``He said `Look
at me as an example. I was in the big leagues. I was at the top of
the game. But I let myself down. Look at me. Don't let this happen
to you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That really got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra said, ``I lifted weights and got too big. I lost my
conditioning to hit the ball like I used to. I've learned from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians cut him in spring training. He asked the
Rangers for a job in spring training, but was turned down. General
manager Doug Melvin suggested Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Sierra, who has lost much but not all of the bulk that
brought him down, was persistent, and the Rangers' injuries
mounted. He was signed May 1 and sent to the Triple-A Oklahoma
Redhawks. He was given three weeks to show something.
</P>
<P>
   He showed he could hit, with a .326 average, and 18 homers and
82 runs batted in. The Rangers also liked his humble attitude and
his willingness to help young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was great,'' said shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt, who was also
called up Tuesday. ``He got along great with everyone. He was a
good leader in the clubhouse, especially with the young guys. If a
guy was struggling, he knew what to say. He handled himself well.''
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Dransfeldt said, ``He was awesome. The Ruben Sierra
I saw was the Ruben Sierra who played 10 years in the big
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers aren't sure about that; otherwise, he would have
come up earlier. They would have traded him during the season, but
only one team showed interest. Melvin said that team later backed
off.
</P>
<P>
   But Sierra still believes something is there. The kinder,
gentler Sierra still has his immense pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Ruben,'' Sierra said. ``I did what I had to do.
They sent me down to prove I can play. That's what I did. They
signed me a month and a week into the season and I still drove in
80-something RBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could still be a full-time player and drive in 80 to
100 runs, Sierra said simply, ``''Si''.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a model to follow. Former Pittsburgh Pirates star Dave
Parker was one of the best players in the game from 1975-81. But,
brought down by drugs and injuries, he had six homers and 29 RBI in
1982, and 12 homers with 69 RBI in 1983. He appeared finished and
was dumped on Cincinnati where his career experienced a rebirth. He
led the National League with a career-high 125 RBI in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a chance,'' Rangers first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro said. ``He's here, man. Give him an opportunity; you never
know what's going to happen. He was good, man, one of the best. I
think it's great he's here. He deserves it.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A potential transit strike that could create havoc
in Los Angeles was again averted but unions held the threat of a
walkout at any time over Metropolitan Transit Authority officials.
</P>
<P>
   While unions representing most MTA workers agreed Tuesday to a
five-day breathing period, the Amalgamated Transit Union,
representing more than 1,800 bus and train mechanics, rejected the
extension, saying little progress has been made in negotiations.
The other unions have agreed to strike if the ATU strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it day to day,'' ATU President Neil Silver said
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the MTA a comprehensive proposal. But they've got
brain gridlock. If they don't quit screwing around, you'll see a
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The critical issues beyond a gap in wage and benefit offers are
work rules and workers' compensation policies that drive up MTA
costs and demands that possible creation of a separate San Fernando
Valley transit zone not impact MTA workers.
</P>
<P>
   The United Transportation Union and the Transportation
Communications International Union, which together represent about
4,950 bus and train drivers and clerical workers, agreed early
Monday to extend their contract deadline to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials said they were encouraged talks would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely happy and appreciate that our transit riders
can continue to depend on the MTA,'' MTA spokesman Barry Liden
said. ``We hope that the ATU will continue to bargain with us.''
</P>
<P>
   No time has been set today for negotiations, but both sides said
they want to meet again as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA board of directors went into closed session Tuesday to
get an update on talks and to give negotiators directions on how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was leaning more toward the fact that although the
talks between the MTA and unions were positive, he wishes more
progress had been made,'' said Peter Hidalgo, spokesman for Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made reference to the fact that the board is united in this
whole process and he's very confident in the management of the MTA.
His objective is to make our bus system more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   A strike would clog Los Angeles freeways and shut down bus and
train service to the MTA's 450,000 daily riders, hitting low-income
commuters, seniors, the disabled and students the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   The unions and the MTA have been negotiating for months over new
three-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis imposed a 60-day cooling-off period in July to
delay the possibility of a strike until after the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The cooling-off period ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are seeking a variety of improvements to their
pension and benefit packages, as well as more than 12 percent pay
raises over three years, Liden said. The MTA is offering 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the major sticking points have to do work rules, work
schedules, creation of the San Fernando Valley transit zone,
subcontracting and workers' compensation. Hundreds of work rules,
some established in the 1930s, govern when someone can collect
overtime, who can do what kind of work and whether bus inspections
take place during rush hour or off-peak times, MTA spokesman Marc
Littman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation where a number of bus inspections are done
during peak hours instead of off-hours,'' Littman said. ``It's more
efficient to do bus inspections on off-peak hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA is seeking to streamline those rules to save money and
make the transit system more efficient. But the unions are fighting
to preserve the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Reed, a member of the MTA's Passenger Advisory Committee,
said one rule prohibits bus service attendants who make $13 to $17
an hour from replacing lights that burn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the lights are burned out, they have to write up a report
and get a $25-an-hour mechanic to come in with a screwdriver and
replace it,'' Reed said. ``This costs us huge amounts of tax
dollars and gives riders less service because they are not making
the most effective use of their resources and assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldy Norton, spokesman for the United Transportation Union,
said the work rules dispute is the major point of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this whole thing is about _ their attempt to
destroy our work rules,'' Norton said. ``I can't get specific about
it because no one would understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions are concerned that the creation of a San Fernando
Valley transit zone _ which would require the MTA to turn its
Valley service over to a new transit service _ could cost union
employees their jobs. Davis has until Sept. 30 to sign a bill that
would protect those workers' jobs by requiring the new transit zone
to hire them.
</P>
<P>
   Another bone of contention involves work schedules. The MTA
wants to add more part-time employees and expand on a four-day,
40-hour work week to save money on overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Bus and rail operators already make an average of $50,000 a
year, not including up to $20,000 in overtime. Mechanics average
$56,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the primary bone of contention,'' Norton said. ``I
can't go into the details. The rules in the transit industry are
quite different from normal work rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The other issue involves workers' compensation claims, which
costs the MTA $70 million a year, six times more than of New York
City Transit. ``That's the equivalent of putting almost 300 buses
on the road,'' Littman said. ``We need to make the MTA safer so
there are fewer claims filed.''

SIERRA CLUB ENDORSES HILLARY CLINTON FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton Tuesday won the
endorsement of the Sierra Club, one of the nation's oldest
environmental groups, whose backing set off a duel between the
Senate candidates over who has done more to protect natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club officials said Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican
Senate candidate, offered inconsistent support for environmental
matters in his eight-year tenure in Congress. And members of the
group said in an interview that Lazio did not demonstrate a firm
grasp of the environmental issues the group studies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, said Rhea Jezer, the chairwoman of the club's New
York chapter, Clinton ``showed an unequaled depth of knowledge on a
plethora of state and national issues.'' Clinton told the group,
which is nonpartisan but has historically supported Democratic
candidates, that she had worked to push the Clinton administration
to take greater account of children's health in setting air and
water quality standards and, if elected, would pursue protecting
forests and drinking water supplies from development and industrial
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Club members said that although Clinton does not have a
legislative record, her attention over the years to children and
health issues, like breast cancer research and treatment, indicated
she would be a powerful ally for environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe she will continue Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
legacy,'' said Robert Cox, the Sierra Club's national president,
who stood with Clinton as she accepted the endorsement at a park
here bordering the Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio defended his record and suggested the club's endorsement
was politically motivated. Lazio said the club had not endorsed a
Republican for statewide office in New York in more than 10 years,
an assertion club officials did not dispute, though they said they
had endorsed other Republicans in statewide races outside of New
York and in Congressional races in and out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to presume that it was not on merit, based on the
fact that I have such a strong record on the environment and my
opponent has no record on the environment,'' Lazio said after a
campaign stop in Rochester. ``So it's hard to make a judgment that
it was about anything but politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that although the group had endorsed Lazio in his 1996
congressional race, he later cast votes the club considered
detrimental to the environment. The club said Lazio voted for bills
that would weaken the Superfund toxic waste clean-up program and
reduce spending on measures to curb suburban sprawl, and voted
against attempts to strengthen protection of Utah's wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, his aides said, had believed he might win the club's
endorsement because of his support, among other things, for
legislation to clean up Long Island Sound. But Jezer said Lazio had
a mixed overall record on supporting environmental causes, and fell
short in his interview last month with club members.
</P>
<P>
   She said he did not seem knowledgeable about a variety of issues
and had to ask an aide about one of the issues on which the group
has been most vocal in opposing: New York City's plans to build a
water filtration plant under Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The
club considers the project a misuse of public parkland.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the group heavily weighs the opinion of
the local chapter nearest the candidate's home, and the Long Island
branch did not give a high rating to Lazio, who represents western
Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio pointed to endorsements by the League of Conservation
Voters, another national organization, in some of his congressional
races. Neither the group's national, nor its New York, directors
have announced an endorsement in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also pointed to his sponsorship of the Long Island Sound
Restoration Act, which provides $80 million annually to help clean
up pollution. He also said he supported legislation to provide
money to preserve open space, reduce gas emissions believed to
contribute to global warming, and explore the environmental effect
of the gasoline additive MTBE.

   BROADCOM CALLS INTEL PATENT SUIT SPECIOUS
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a patent infringement lawsuit filed last week by
Intel, Broadcom issued a statement saying the suit was specious
litigation aimed at discouraging Intel employees from seeking jobs
at Broadcom. Broadcom said that it had not infringed upon any Intel
patents. ``The notion that we need to misappropriate Intel's
technology to compete is nonsense,'' said Henry T. Nicholas,
Broadcom's president and chief executive, in the statement. He said
it was ``widely recognized in the industry and investment community
that Broadcom, not Intel, is the leader'' in digital cable TV,
cable modem ``and other key 21st-century technologies.'' Nicholas
said Broadcom would defend itself vigorously.

   WEB CONSULTANT ISSUES EARNINGS WARNING
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a familiar refrain in the Web consulting industry,
Xpedior warned that it expected revenue in the third quarter to
drop about 10 percent from the $62.9 million in the second quarter
of this year, largely because of diminished demand from dot-com
clients. Wall Street, in turn, reacted as it did when it first
heard that concern last week from two other companies: Xpedior's
stock dropped $2.56, or 23.7 percent, to close at $8.25, well off
its 52-week high of $34.75. It did not seem to matter that the
company estimated that third-quarter revenue would climb 65 percent
from the $34.5 million posted in the 1999 quarter.

   IBM TO USE AT&AMP;T DATA CENTERS
</P>
<P>
   To help meet growing demand from business customers that
outsource management of their Internet operations to IBM's Global
Services unit, IBM said it agreed to lease space in nine AT&AMP;T data
centers. IBM said that the deal, valued at $450 million, would
allow it to begin selling Internet services and computer capacity
at AT&AMP;T centers in the New York, Chicago, and Phoenix areas by the
end of the year and in six other cities by the third quarter of
2001. IBM now operates 12 Web-operation sites in the United States,
6 of them in partnership with other vendors. Earlier this year, it
announced plans to create 56 more sites around the world, including
28 sites in the United States with Qwest Communications.

OPENER SHOWS RAMS ARE STILL NOT SOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The popular thought in the off-season was that teams
would take the offense of the St. Louis Rams and dismantle it, the
way scientists stick bacteria under a microscope and investigate
its genetic structure for weaknesses. Based on what the Rams did
Monday night against the Denver Broncos _ displaying an offensive
explosion rarely seen in the sport _ apparently no defensive
coordinator has yet to devise the football equivalent of
penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   Denver tried everything to slow down St. Louis in the 41-36
track meet on the speedy artificial turf of the Trans World Dome.
The Broncos felt that the best defense against the Rams was to
attack quarterback Kurt Warner relentlessly. This season, St. Louis
was supposed to be vulnerable to pressure. Blitz, blitz, blitz and
Warner would wilt like week-old roses.
</P>
<P>
   That was the theory, and then the game begins, and the speed of
the Rams is overwhelming. Their quickness cannot be reproduced in
daily practices by third-string duds on the scout team. Warner made
the right reads on almost every blitz, especially on a screen to
running back Marshall Faulk, who took the pass and raced 72 yards
for a third-quarter touchdown. It was the kind of quick strike that
exemplifies how potent this Rams offense remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the name of our game,'' Warner said. ``That's what we
do. We spread it around. We get it to everybody and take advantage
of what defenses are doing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular thought in the off-season was that the Rams were
fat after winning the Super Bowl and would lose their toughness.
That hasn't happened, either. Defensive end Ray Agnew was hit by a
Denver offensive lineman on the side of his leg near his knee. It
wasn't the first time that happened to Agnew or his defensive
teammates during the game. Rams players felt Broncos offensive
linemen were purposely hitting low, a complaint that has been
leveled against Denver many times by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis defenders often responded to the questionable blocks
by getting into the faces of Denver defenders, which led to a
shoving match or two. The Rams wanted to make their objections
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone has any question about our toughness this year, we
didn't put up with that nonsense,'' defensive lineman D'Marco Farr
said of the Broncos' blocking. ``They were trying to destroy our
knees. That's not cool. Everyone in this league is trying to earn
money for their families and when you play Denver, those guys try
to take that away.''
</P>
<P>
   Farr added: ``But what goes around comes around. Those guys will
get theirs. If we see them in the Super Bowl, we'll see what
happens. But if we don't, other teams will watch what they were
doing to us on film, and will make those guys pay for how they
block. No player in the league will put up with that sort of
thing.'' Tuesday, it was announced that Farr will be lost a month
with torn knee cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were so angered by what linebacker Mike Jones called
``blocks that if you didn't use your hands to protect yourself,
your career was going to go up in smoke'' that defenders began
pleading to game officials to call penalties, as did Coach Mike
Martz. Rams players did not like the Denver offensive linemen's
blocking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos deny they use anything but legal blocks. A player
cannot purposely go after another player's knees, and players
cannot use ``high-low'' techniques. That means it is forbidden for
one offensive player to hit a defender high while another
simultaneously hits the same person below the thigh. Game
officials, unfortunately, sometimes miss those questionable moves.
</P>
<P>
   Is that tough enough for everyone? Any feeling that the 2000
Rams would not resemble last season's champions is wrong. Forty-one
points wrong. Three touchdowns of at least 78 yards wrong. Over 400
passing yards from Warner wrong. It wasn't simply the jaw-dropping
speed that made the Rams' first game on the road to defend their
title so impressive, it was their toughness, mentally and
physically. On offense, they withstood a brutal blitzing attack,
and on defense, the Rams endured what they called illegal blocking
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' performance should not be seen through a pessimistic
prism, but a positive one. Warner did throw three interceptions,
one of which was returned for a touchdown, and the defense did give
up 424 total yards. But Denver quarterback Brian Griese had a
career night and the Broncos played what will probably turn out to
be one of their best regular-season games of the year.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis responded not by falling apart in the face of Griese's
darts, or those nasty blocks, but by scoring 41 points, having
three players with at least 100 receiving yards, a first for the
organization since 1951, and sacking Griese twice late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one points. That's more than Seattle, Pittsburgh, New
Orleans, San Diego, Cleveland and Tennessee all scored on Sunday
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, St. Louis will be just fine. This is a 14-victory team,
maybe even 15. The best approach in trying to beat the Rams? Don't
blitz _ and stay away from their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you'll just make the Rams angry. &QL;
