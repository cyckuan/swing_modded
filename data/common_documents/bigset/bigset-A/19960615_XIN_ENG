DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) has lodged its "serious complaint" with Chief Election

According to the preliminary results declared by the Election
Commission (EC), the AL has won 133 out of 271 constituencies

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official in Cambodia For Talks on Election Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations
official left Cambodia today after a three-day visit to discuss
"substantial" support for the country's next general election, due
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Francec Vendrell, head of political affairs in the U.N.'s East
Asia and Pacific division, was quoted by newspapers here as saying
that the U.N. is prepared to help Cambodia by providing observers
for the upcoming elections, if asked.
</P>
<P>
During his low-key visit, Vendrell held separate talks with
co-Prime Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen over progress in
adopting electoral and nationality laws ready for the election,
and the U.N.'s readiness to fund election monitoring and vote
verification, according to a high level source familiar with the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. provided more than two billion U.S. dollars for
Cambodia's 1993 election, the first general election after a
U.N.-brokered peace pact ended the Cambodian civil war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the present multi-party coalition government doesn't have
the means to set up, staff and secure polling stations for the
next election due in 1998 and is now looking for international
donors to sponsor the poll.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief Calls for Intensified International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
forces operating in Liberia needs to be bolstered with a
"credible" and "overwhelming force" to enable it to discharge its
mandate in the country, a senior officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a parallel with NATO's use of force in Bosnia, the
field commander of the peacekeepers known as ECOMOG,
Major-general John Inienger, said that this is the only way
ECOMOG could extract compliance with the peace process from the
various factions.
</P>
<P>
The factions would be willing to respect the provision of the
peace process if they knew that they could be overwhelmed by the
"superior fire power", said the officer in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Such fire power, he explained, should be provided by the
international community which has lately shown increased interest
in the Liberian conflict, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He commended officers and men of ECOMOG for their "will and
determination in spite of the meagre resources available to
them", adding that the international community should match this
enthusiasm with the provision of armoured personnel carriers and
helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the war weariness would compel parties to the
dispute to respect the latest ceasefire and cooperate in the
successful implemenation of the Abuja peace accord signed last
August to end the civil war in the country.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Agree to Enhance Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, June 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia agreed here today
at their "16+1" meeting of defence ministers to post permanent
military officers at each other's military commands as an other
step to develop NATO-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the press after the meeting, U.S. Secretary of
Defence William Perry said that NATO and Russia essentially agreed
to build on the relationship which are already been formed as a
part of Russia's participation in IFOR and to "institutionalize
and make permanent those arrangements".
</P>
<P>
According to Mr Perry, this is going to include having senior
Russian officers assigned at NATO's military headquarters outside
Mons, Belgium, and at each of the Alliance's three regional
commands responsible for the northern, central and southern
sections of Western Europe and having senior NATO officers posted
permanently at the Russian general staff in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"It is an agreed concept. It is still, however, a concept,"
said Ashton Carter, Assistant Secretary of Defence for
International Security and the Pentagon's top Russia expert.
</P>
<P>
General George Joulwan, NATO's supreme commander, is to work
out the details of the officer exchange over the coming weeks with
Russian officers, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
An NATO official said that Grachev also requested Russian
participation in Combined Joint Task Forces operations organized
by NATO.
</P>
<P>
"There is an aspiration for deeper and closer contacts with us.
Russia is ready for that," Russian defence minister Pavel Grachev
said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the meeting reflected
a transformed relationship between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We have a new NATO. We have a new Russia. We need new
relations and we have one aim, which is the security and stability
of Europe and the world," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Grachev offered no objections when NATO
ministers urged the Russian military leader to continue the
Russian commitment to the Bosnia peace mission through the
completion of the IFOR mission at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But Grachev also repeated Russia's opposition to NATO expansion
to Central and Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rate Falls to Lowest for 20 Months in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Britain fell sharply
in May to its lowest rate for 20 months, with food prices rising
only half as quickly as they did in the same month last year,
according to figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The headline inflation rate, which tracks changes in annual
living costs by monitoring prices across a broad range of goods
and services, fell from 2.4 percent to 2.2 percent, the lowest
rate since December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The underlying rate, which excludes mortgages and is used by
the government as its target measure, also dipped to 2.8 percent
in May, from 2.9 percent the preceding month.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are feeling the benefit of declining cost pressures
at the manufacturing end of the economy faster than in the past
because of the determination by British companies to clear their
shelves of unsold goods by either containing or cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
Seasonal food prices rose by two percent in May compared with
4.1 percent in the same month last year. Prices for alcohol,
household goods and personal goods and services all rose less
quickly last month than in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The only sectors pushing inflation higher were motoring, travel
costs, fuel and light.
</P>
<P>
Some economists seized on the inflation news as a vindication
of last week's decision by the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to cut
bank base rates from six percent to 5.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Take More Detectives to Probe White </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri on Friday said he would deploy more police
officers to beef up the criminal investigations department's
fraud so as to help reduce white collar crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chihuri said, "I once promised that I would employ more people
to deal with the increased number of cases of white collar crime.
I want to ensure that companies especially those that are
involved in tax evasion are dealt with."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is losing hundreds of millions of Dollars through
various forms of company fraud including tax evasion schemes,
bogus companies, business fronts and smuggling activities which
the commissioner said had become a thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
More and more companies are reportedly folding up but before going
bust, they systematically transfer their funds to sister companies in
neighbouring countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Still World's Largest Arms Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is still the
world's biggest arms exporter, but Russia has emerged as a major
supplier of conventional weapons, a Swedish research group said
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. share of the 22.8 billion dollar world arms market
fell sharply from 56 percent in 1994 to 43 percent in 1995. But
Russia's exports surged dramatically from just four percent to 17
percent of the market, the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) said in its annual yearbook.
</P>
<P>
Overall world military spending continued to decline in 1995,
mainly because the biggest customer, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO), cut its spending by more than five percent.
</P>
<P>
Some countries, including France, Italy, Sweden and the United
States have cut military spending by 25 percent or more since
1987. Only India, Japan and South Korea increased their spending
significantly.
</P>
<P>
Global military research and development spending has slumped
by 50-55 percent over the same period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The institute forecasts further falls in global military
spending.
</P>
<P>
"The present trend of falling military spending in real terms
will undoubtedly continue into the next few years, as many NATO
countries ... have announced plans or indicated that military
spending will be cut further," the group said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in world military spending coincides with a drop in
major armed conflicts. Last year, there were 30 wars in 25
locations but in 1994 there were 32 wars in 28 places.
</P>
<P>
And all of last year's major conflicts were internal rather
than between states and the risk of global nuclear war has
diminished, said the group.
</P>
<P>
But the report warned that many developing countries continue
to maintain military expenditure at levels which are out of
proportion to their legitimate security requirements.

<HEADLINE> Roh Admits Sending Troops to Cabinet Meeting in 1980 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo admitted here today that he personally sent troops to a
government building in 1980, where the cabinet was meeting to
discuss extending martial law nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, Roh, on trial for mutiny and treason, rejected the
prosecution's accusations that the deployment of troops on May 17,
1980, was intended to intimidate the cabinet to approve the
extension.
</P>
<P>
Roh's testimony, which contradicted his earlier statement to
prosecutors, was made during cross-examinations by his lawyers
during the 13th session of his trial at the Seoul District Court.
</P>
<P>
Roh, 64, a former army general, is accused of helping his
predecessor Chun Doo-Hwan stage a premeditated coup in 1979 to
seize power. He faces a maximum penalty of death on charges
related to the coup and the subsequent massacre of demonstrators
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
He testified today that, "I knew that the major commanders'
meeting was to discuss the nationwide expansion of martial law on
May 17, 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Since the matter had to be approved by the cabinet, I
predicted that a cabinet session might be held later that day."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the deployment of troops to the area
surrounding the capitol building and cabinet session room that day
was not to intimidate cabinet members, but to guard the conference
room and safeguard the ministers in accordance with martial law
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Roh also denied that the deployment of troops to the venue of
the cabinet meeting was done at the request of the then Major
General Chun Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation
until February 1988. He was succeeded by Roh, who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chun and another 14 former army officers, including former Army
Chief of Staff Lee Hui-sung and former Defense Minister Chu
Yong-bok, have also been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their
alleged roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979, and in
the bloody crackdown of a civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted on graft charges for allegedly receiving illegal funds
from businessmen while in office.

<P>
TOKYO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police today raided the
Fukuoka branch of Garuda Indonesian Airways, whose DC-10 jetliner
crashed on take-off Thursday killing three people and injuring at
least 109 other passengers on board the Jakarta-bound flight.
</P>
<P>
Police also raided the airline's airport office and seized
flight-related documents. They suspect negligence in connection
with the crash after a failed take-off from Fukuoka airport, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
The triple-engine plane skidded off the runway and plowed
across a muddy field before bursting into flames.
</P>
<P>
Comments by a crew member, airport and investigation officials
suggest trouble with the right wing-engine might be to blame for
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The crew member said that the right engine caught fire
immediately after takeoff and the pilot quickly applied the
brakes, Kyodo said quoting investigation sources.
</P>
<P>
Investigators inspected the crash site today and found no signs
of fire and damage inside the engine on the rear fin, although a
large hole was found there.
</P>
<P>
The three-meter by two-meter hole may have been caused when the
engine was hit by part of the right landing gear, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The plane's three engines, manufactured by General Electric
Co. of the United States, are the main focus of the probe with
witnesses saying they saw flames coming out of one of the engines
during takeoff.

SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean parliament today
decided to go into recess until Monday to let the ruling and

parliamentary speaker and deputy speakers.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly has been deadlocked over the issue since

<P>
Opposition parties, including the National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP) and the United Liberal Democrats, blocked the
selection on June 5 and again yesterday as a protest against the
NKP.
</P>
<P>
They are angered at the way the NKP, which lost its majority in
the April general election, secured a new majority by recruiting
independent and opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The opposition is demanding an apology from the president for
engineering a "false" majority in the 299-member parliament and
say they will continue to block the selection of speakers until
the NKP apologizes.
</P>
<P>
The NKP fell 11 seats short of a simple majority of 150 in the
assembly. But it later lured into its fold 11 independent and
opposition lawmakers, giving it the majority it needed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that despite their promise to try to strike
a compromise, the rival parties are unlikely to agree a political
deal on the issue in the near future.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Economic Strategy Calls for Broad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Broad national agreement
between the South African government and its social partners is
needed to create an environment for rapid growth and quicker
delivery of services, according to the macro-economic strategy
unveiled today in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The government's long-awaited macro-economic policy framework,
entitled "Growth, Employment and Redistribution", was presented
to the National Assembly by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel on
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The framework indicated the immediate aim of the agreement
would be to ensure that the recent depreciation of the Rand did
not translate into a vicious circle of wage and price increases.
</P>
<P>
This would result in instability in the financial markets and a
decline in competitive advantage, the document said.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, it was important that wage and salary
increases did not rise more rapidly than the growth in
productivity, the document added.
</P>
<P>
However, a broad social agreement might address a wider range
of issues related to economic restructuring, income distribution
and social policies in the longer term, the same source said.
</P>
<P>
To this extent, orderly collective bargaining between
organized labour and employers should remain the foundation of
industrial relations, the document declared.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the government committed itself to an
accelerated increase in its contribution to "social and community
living standards".
</P>
<P>
For workers, this would give certainty that moderate wage
demands would contribute towards growth, job creation and social
benefits.

<HEADLINE> Tighter Measures to Target Foreign Taxpayers in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Stricter measures, including
suspending business operations in Vietnam, will be taken against
foreign representative offices who fail to report their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Doan Thi Kia, chief of Hanoi's Foreign Investment Taxation
Office, said that some foreigners are taking advantage of loose
management to "forget" to register their real income.
</P>
<P>
The official, who was covered by the latest issue of the
Vietnam Investment Review, listed over 100 foreign representative
offices that failed to register income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The representative offices, she was quoted as saying, "are
confusing tax office efforts to track them down."
</P>
<P>
"We will take stricter measures," vowed the official, who has
the authority to notify other agencies to suspend foreign
businesses' licenses for non-compliance with Vietnam's tax laws.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there have been over 450 foreign representative
offices in the capital city of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The magazine report also said that officials are now compiling
a list of foreign individuals employed in Vietnam who have not
paid their taxes.
</P>
<P>
The list will be handed over to the city's Bureau of Foreign
Economic Relations, which could bar those on the list from
obtaining an exit visa.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Finance Ministry stipulated that all foreigners
living and working in Vietnam for over 183 days must pay tax.

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from the 16
NATO member countries met at the NATO headquarters here today,
with France attending the meeting for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with such issues as NATO's internal reform
and the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) mission in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and other member countries
praised French Defense Minister Charles Millon's presence as
"another important step forward" after France's reprochement to
NATO announced last December.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, defense ministers gave specific directions for
implementing political decisions made by NATO foreign ministers
last week in Berlin, especially for the work of making the
Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF) Concept to reality, including
the location, size, number and structure of CJTF headquarters
elements and their operating procedure.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers decided to hold a CJTF exercise to test
the new military structures as soon as they are in place.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the work should start quickly on the defense
aspects to develop the European security and defense identity.
</P>
<P>
They launched the review of the defense planning system to
ensure that NATO be fully capable of supporting not only
collective defense but also crisis management and peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
The French defense minister announced France will resume its
participation in NATO's international military staff and send
officers for preparations for the CJTF.
</P>
<P>
On the IFOR mission in Bosnia, the ministers confirmed that the
IFOR will be maintained at approximately its current force levels
of 60,000 men through September, when the elections in Bosnia are
due to take place, and that the IFOR's overall capability will be
retained until the end of its mandate in December.
</P>
<P>
But the ministers did not discuss at the meeting what might
happen after the expiration of the Dayton mandate, which was for a
year.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the defense ministers meeting, 15 ministers, without
France, met briefly this morning within the Defense Planning
Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready for Closer Ties With NATO: Grachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready for deeper and
closer relations with NATO, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev
said today after talks with the western military alliance's 16
defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
The "16 plus 1" meeting was the second high level contact
between NATO and Russia this month -- Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov met NATO ministers in Germany last week.
</P>
<P>
Grachev told reporters that "from our meeting, I have come to
the conclusion that there was aspiration for deeper and closer
relations between Russia and NATO, and Russia is ready for that."
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, secretary general of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization), said that the meeting was "very friendly, positive
and constructive."
</P>
<P>
"We have a new NATO, we have a new Russia, we need new
relations and we have one aim which is the stability and security
of the (European) continent and the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still deep differences between the two sides
over NATO's plans to expand into central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes the plan, which seeks to bring many of
Moscow's former communist allies into the alliance's fold. And
Grachev said ahead of today's meeting that Russia's objections to
the idea of NATO troops and weapons moving closer to its borders
have not changed.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the meeting has been welcomed by NATO diplomatic
circles, raising hopes that Moscow may be prepared to show more
flexibility in its dealings with the military body.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it is taking place two days before the
presidential elections in Russia no doubt means that Boris Yeltsin
wants to show the public his ability to have a dialogue with
NATO," an alliance official said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in South Korea Up a Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in South
Korea rose 26 percent to 961 million U.S. dollars in the first
five months of this year boosted by an almost 100 percent rise in
investment from Europe to 359 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Capital inflow from the the United States rose a third to 307
million dollars, but investment from Japan fell by half to 113
million dollars, statistics from the Finance and Economy Ministry
show.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in foreign investment was attributed to the
government's support for foreign investment in high-tech
industries and the easing of regulations in almost all sectors,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector claimed the lion's share of investment
with 507 million dollars, up 47.8 percent in the first five months
of 1996 over the same period in 1995, while the non-manufacturing
sector saw an nine percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in South Korea has recovered
sharply over the last three years after a slump from 1.3 billion
to 890 million dollars in 1992. Last year, FDI soared 48 percent
to 1.94 billion dollars, up from 1.31 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of May this year, total foreign direct investment
in South Korea had reached 15.36 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Teachers Stage Indefinite Sit-in for Higher </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Swazi schools were closed
today as teachers extended Thursday's strike to an indefinite
sit-in, demanding for an 18 percent salary increase from the
government, reported the African Eye News Service.
</P>
<P>
About 30000 teachers and civil servants attended a meeting in
Manzini on Thursday to force the government to meet their
demands.
</P>
<P>
They rejected the government's offer of a 13.5 percent salary
increase.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's strike came after the break-down of the prolonged
pay negotiations between the government, the teachers association
and the swziland civil servant association on Wednesday when
government refused to meet their demands, including substantial
increases in housing and other allowances.
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister Sishayi Nxumalo accused strikers of
trying to destablize the country and said it would be the case of
"no work, no pay" for the striking teachers.

SEOUL, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Korean National Red Cross (KNRC)
announced here today that it is sending 572 tons of wheat flour to
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) this month, its
fifth shipment of aid.
</P>
<P>
The flour, worth some 250,000 U.S. dollars, was donated by

Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, including 10,000
blankets, 10,000 packets of instant noodles, 20,000 pairs of socks
and 186,000 liters of cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, the South Korean government decided to offer three

shortages caused by devastating floods which hit the DPRK last
summer.

<HEADLINE> Business Backs Investment Drive For N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) - Northern Ireland's top companies
today announced their backing for the first commercial
international conference (from 4-5 March, 1977 in Belfast) to
attract Asian and Middle east investors.
</P>
<P>
The move marks a growing confidence as Northern Ireland builds
on its success as a manufacturing gateway for the European market
and companies seek now joint ventures and partners in Asian and
the Middle East, Ian Walker, chief executive officer of MEC
(Middle East Consultants), said here this afternoon at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has experienced a success story for
international partnerships, attracting major Asian investor such
as Daewoo, Texmaco, Kyocera and the Canyor Corporation. +There is
already considerable interest in Asia and the Middle east from
major firms keen to learn more. The spirit of enterprise shown by
companies in Northern Ireland in backing the conference suggests
that there are many more deals waiting to be done+, said Walker.
</P>
<P>
During 1994-95, with 3 percent of the UK's population, Northern
Ireland attracted 9 percent of all new jobs promoted in Britain.
over the last 5 years the Northern Ireland attracted investment
projects promising employment for almost 8000 people, almost 8
percent of the current manufacturing workforce.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has now 80 inward investment companies
enjoying success in attracting investment from the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
It is learned the greatest potential for growth comes from
existing investors with nearly three in four companies (73
percent) indicating they have future investment plans for Northern
Ireland. The total value of future investment is put at more than
270 million pounds (405 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The planned two-day conference will look at case studies of
overseas investors who are finding that Northern Ireland is a
profitable manufacturing base for the European market place. It
will also look at companies from Northern Ireland that are
successful working abroad in joint ventures and through trade.

<HEADLINE> France to Provide Free Public Transport if Pollution Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- French commuters could get free use
of the country's public transport if pollution in urban areas
exceeds pre-set government limits, Environment Minister Corinne
Lepage said today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at keeping private cars off the road during
periods of high pollution to curb vehicle exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
The cost of providing the free service will come from higher
taxes on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Air quality has deteriorated sharply in French cities over the
last few years. A report published early this year found that 260
to 350 people a year die from the effects of pollution in Paris
alone.
</P>
<P>
The nation's public transport authorities said they are ready
to carry out the government decree as summer sets in, with high
temperatures and low atmospheric pressure making it more difficult
for vehicle emissions to disperse in the air, so aggravating
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government in Paris supported the decree and said
that it will provide commuters with free parking lots, in addition
to free transport, in a bid to encourage them to abandon their
cars for buses and subways.

<HEADLINE> Elections Underway in Chechnya Despite Threat of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Elections for a regional parliament
and the Russian presidency went ahead in Chechnya today despite
threats by separatist forces to block the vote which they claim is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops and pro-Moscow police units were on high alert
and police reinforcements have been sent into the capital Grozny
because of threats by the rebels to use violence to disrupt the
election.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations and election commissions across the rebel
Russian republic were also under guard.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have demanded the regional elections be postponed,
claiming that the ballot is a violation of a military agreement
signed with Moscow earlier this week that the parliamentary vote
could only be held after Russian troops leave.
</P>
<P>
The election is being held over three days, to give everyone a
chance to get to a polling station. Some 470,000 people are
eligible to vote in the ballot for local lawmakers and the Russian
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Yakub Sabirov, deputy chairman of the Chechnya Election
Commission, said "From the morning on, people have been coming to
the polling stations with their entire families," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow-backed Chechnya government has set up 374 polling
stations throughout the republic apart from the southeastern
region of Vedeno, which is controlled by the separatists.
</P>
<P>
Some 348 candidates are contesting 97 seats in the lower and
upper houses of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Japan Lagging Behind in Telecom, Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan lags behind other industrial
countries, the United States in particular, in telecommunications
and information, according to a government report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, known as a "white paper," by the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry, therefore calls for government
finance and public-private sector cooperation to catch up.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, the telecom and information environment is
developing rapidly with an estimated 9.47 million host computers
hooked up to the Internet computer network as of January this year.
</P>
<P>
But in Japan, only 269,000 host computers are connected to the
network, placing it sixth in the world, the report said. In
contrast, the United States has 20 times more than that figure, or
6,055,000 host computers, hooked up with Internet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japanese homes and offices possessing personal
computers were only one-fifth of those in the United States as of
1993, and its mobile phones were one-third of the latter's in 1994.
</P>
<P>
These statistics, said the report, indicated that Japan lags
far behind its competitor across the Pacific Ocean in use of
advanced communication tools.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-Pacific region, it noted, the United States is
working on the legislation for a more competitive
telecommunications market, and countries like Singapore and
Malaysia are aggressively arming themselves with advanced
communication systems.
</P>
<P>
The report, updated on annual basis, was submitted Friday to a
cabinet meeting of the Japanese government.

<HEADLINE> Mandate of UN Force in Tajikistan Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) for six months until
December 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the council said
that the mandate of UNMOT will be effective subject to the proviso
that the Tehran Agreement remains in force and the parties
demonstrate their commitment to an effective cease-fire, to
national reconciliation and to the promotion of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council further decided that this mandate of UNMOT
will remain in effect unless the Secretary-General reports to the
council that these conditions have not been met.
</P>
<P>
It expressed its grave concern at the serious deterioration of
the situation in Tajikistan and stressed urgent need for the Tajik
parties to adhere sincerely and in good faith to the commitments
they have made.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the need for an early resumption of talks between
the Government of Tajikistan and the United Tajik Opposition.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali submitted a report
to the Security Council earlier this month, which noted that
fighting escalated in the Tavildara sector in Tajikistan from
early May. The fighting resulted in many human losses, the
interruption of communication between the capital and a large part
of the country and a dramatic aggravation of the humanitarian
situation in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon the parties immediately to
cease hostilities and to comply fully with the Tehran Agreement
and all the other obligations they have assumed, and strongly
urged them to extend the cease-fire for the whole duration of the
inter-Tajik talks.
</P>
<P>
The council also called upon the parties to cooperate fully
with the Secretary-General's Special Representative, with UNMOT
and to ensure the safety of the personnel of the United Nations
and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wang Xuexian said at the council that the
fundamental solution for Tajik issue rested with peaceful
negotiations between the two parties so that they would put an end
to their differences and realize national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"We support the efforts of the Secretary-General and his
special representative in promotion of the comprehensive political
solution of Tajik issue. UNMOT has played and will continue to
play an important function in implementing the mandate. We hope
both parties will closely cooperate with UNMOT to ensure safety of
the UNMOT personnel and enable them to complete their tasks," he
said.

prosecution of indicted war criminals Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan

"We believe that wherever crimes are ascertained, they must
be punished. but people should not be condemned before the due

referred to trial for their moral and political responsibility,
this should be done equally for all sides," the minister said.
</P>

Pangalos held that crimes have been committed by all sides.
the problem is that those guilty on all sides should be punished,
and in this respect, the level of responsibility must be sought

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes Arab Summit to Iron out Differences: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian ambassador to Egypt Naif
Saud al-Qadhi today voiced hope that the coming pan-Arab summit
due to be held here from June 21 to 23 would bring about an end to
the Arab differences.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the summit would be followed by
other regular summit meetings to coordinate and strengthen the
Arab common stance toward the different Arab and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
today, the ambassador said his country was looking forward to the
Cairo summit following long years of divisions in the Arab rank.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the Arab League's 22 members will attend the
summit. Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 has caused rift in
the Arab world, will not be invited to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit will declare an Arab common stance on adherence to
the Middle East peace process and call on the international
community to support this process, the Jordanian ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the summit, the Arab leaders would call on
the new Israeli leadership to commit itself to the peace process
and carry out the Arab-Israeli agreements which have been singed.
</P>
<P>
The summit will constitute an opportunity for the Arab leaders
to express their support for Palestinian brothers in the final
stage talks with Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
They will also reaffirm solidarity with Syria and Lebanon and
support them to resume the peace talks with Israel and restore all
the Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit agenda tends to limit on just two major
issues: supporting the peace process and consolidating the Arab
solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Talks Reopened in Moscow on Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from Russia, Armenia
and Azerbaijan reopened today their talks on ending an eight-
year-old territorial conflict between the latter two republics.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that the talks, under the
mediation of a team from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, could last a week in this Russian Capital.
</P>
<P>
Russian mediator Vladimir Kazimirov was quoted as saying that
the parties in the talks would continue discussion on a draft
agreement on bringing long-lasting peace to Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
A kidney shaped territory surrounded entirely by Armenia and
populated mainly by ethnic Armenians, Nagorno-Karabakh was awarded
to Azerbaijan by the former Soviet Union authorities.
</P>
<P>
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh began agitating for independence
in the 1980s, and then fought Azerbaijanis out of the region and
seized some Azerbaijani territory in several years after 1988.
</P>
<P>
In the serious fighting, more than 15,000 people died and about
1 million more became refugees. The heavily forested mountainous
region is now populated almost entirely by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
In recent two years, the warring parties have mostly observed a
cease-fire, and the Russian government has helped arrange the
release of over a hundred war prisoners by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Russian, Azerbaijani, Armenian and Georgian
leaders held a summit meeting to speed up a negotiated solution,
thus creating a favorable atmosphere for the ongoing talks.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at the negotiation table now, as said by
Kazimirov, is "more favorable" to a solution than in the past to
decide on Nagorno-Karabakh's status.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemen expressed hope that the Arab
summit due to be held in Cairo from June 21-23 will constitute a
clear message on adherence to the Middle East peace process based
on the land-for-peace principle and the Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the September 26th weekly published today,
Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim
al-Iriyani attributed the significance of the summit to the fact
that "it is the first pan-Arab summit in six years."
</P>
<P>

eliminate all aspects of division left in the Arab rank over the
past years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the Arab League's 22 members will attend the
summit. Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 has caused rift in
the Arab world, will not be invited to the summit.
</P>
<P>
Al-Iriyani expressed hope that the summit would be "a clear
message for the international community to underline the commitment
to the Madrid peace conference which is deemed as an international
contract binding on all its signatories."
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the summit would adopt a call for holding
another Madrid conference to renew compliance with the principles
of the first one.
</P>
<P>
Al-Iriyani is expected to head a Yemeni delegation to an
unofficial Arab foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo some time next
week to prepare for the Arab summit in the Egyptian capital.

<HEADLINE> Four Children Killed by Bomb in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Four Children were killed in a
bomb blast in an Israeli-occupied buffer enclave in south
Lebanon this afternoon, and the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, accused Israel of being behind the "massacre."
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
said that the four children died in the explosion at Houla,
Marjayoun at 4:40 p.m. (13:40 GMT).
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb blast, the first
incident that caused civilian casualties inside the border strip
since a cease-fire was enforced in late April in south Lebanon,
the last battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The 850-square-kilometer buffer zone, patrolled by some 1,000
Israeli forces and the Israeli client South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia, is often attacked by guerrillas of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah in a warfare aimed at expelling Israeli
troops out of the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
After the blast, the Israeli-backed SLA militia immediately
closed the crossing point near Houla leading to the border strip,
and started door-to-door searches in the town, according to the
south Lebanese security sources.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah spokesman accused the Israeli intelligence of
"committing the massacre" in a bid to disfigure the Lebanese
resistance movement against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The Zionist intelligence committed the disgusting crime just
before the formation of a new Israeli government in order to
damage a joyful and proud atmosphere which the Lebanese people
were experiencing following a series of successful operations of
the Islamic Resistance," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nine Israeli soldiers were killed and 23 wounded in a series
of attacks by militants of the Islamic Resistance, the military
wing of Hezbollah, in south Lebanon since the cease-fire
understanding was reached between Lebanon and the Jewish state
on April 26.

<HEADLINE> Track-down of Terrorist Group Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The government has been urged to
take measures to track down the secret "black mamba" group
reportedly involved in violent activities in Zambia in the last
few weeks, Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Youth Association of Zambia (YAZ) has called on the
government to extensively use law enforcement agencies to clamp
down the "black mamba" group.
</P>
<P>
YAZ Secretary General Geoffrey Musosnda said in Lusaka today
that it was unfortunate for the "black mamba" to aim its
activities at innocent pupils who were not part of the group that
had made the constitution amendment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a bomb was planted near the wall fence of a
primary school in the densely populated Kamuchanga township of
Copperbelt Province. It was found out and diffusedlt by police.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Democratic Progress has also urged the
government to track down the "black mamba" elements to curb
tension gripping urban areas in Zambia. Its President Chama
Chakomboka said such people must be apprehended at all costs in
order to defuse fear among the residents.
</P>
<P>
Four bomb blasts took place in Zambia in the past few weeks,
for one of which the black mamba claimed responsibility. The
serious explosion was at the Lusaka international airport on June
6, killing one police officer and wounding another.
</P>
<P>
Police Public Relations Officer Francis Musando said today
that police shot and wounded one armed bandit and arrested
another during exchange of fire in a township of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place around 23:00 hours last night. During
the exchange of fire, four bandits abandoned a white Toyota
Cololla car and two loaded ak47 assault riffles.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the opposition parties have condemned
these crimes.

<HEADLINE> Irish President Urges IRA to Renew Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Irish President Mary Robinson
today urged the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to declare cease-fire
so that its political wing, Sinn Fein, could be included in the
on-going all-party talks for the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks aimed at seeking a way to govern Northern
Ireland started Monday with U.S. envoy George Mitchell serving as
the mediator. Sinn Fein was the only major party barred from the
negotiations because of the IRA's refusal to declare a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"There is an opportunity for direct negotiations," Robinson
told reporters at the National Press Club here. The Irish
president is paying a three-day state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have an extraordinary window of opportunity on the isle of
Ireland at the moment," she said. "One of the most important
factors in helping that would be to have a renewal of the IRA
cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
The IRA ended a previous truce with a truck bomb on February 9
that killed two men in London.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that the peace talks will tackle intercommunal
relationships within Northern Ireland, a British province, as well
as relations between Ireland and Britain.

<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Council welcomed the
forthcoming Arab summit aimed at restoring the inter-Arab
solidarity to face future challenges.
</P>
<P>
This came in the final statement issued today by the council
after its second session held in Nablus, the West Bank Thursday
night, according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian legislators, in their capacity as
representative of the Palestinian people, have expressed their
support for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in his efforts to
maintain the Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that declared stands of the soon-to-be-
formed Israeli government constitute a challenge to the peace
process and Arab security.
</P>
<P>
It touched on the right-wing Israeli Likud's aggression on the
Palestinian rights and lands, along with its attempts to Judaize
Jerusalem and renege on peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the Arab League's 22 members will attend the Arab
summit meeting, the first since the 1991 Gulf war, which will be
held here from June 21-23. Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990
has split the Arab world, was not invited to the summit.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Economic Policy Lays Out Medium Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's macro-economic
policy framework, unveiled by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel today,
has presented an integrated medium-term strategy to boost development
until the year 2000 and strengthen the economy's long-term
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Key components of the framework, included the acceleration of
the fiscal reform process, appropriate medium-term deficit
reduction to eliminate government dissaving, tax reform and
renewed focus on where money was spent.
</P>
<P>
The further relaxation of exchange controls, introduction of new
measures to stimulate trade investments, restructuring of state
assets, the expansion of infrastructure investment and labour market
flexibility were also envisioned in the framework.
</P>
<P>
A lowering of the fiscal deficit from 4.5 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product to four percent was proposed for the next
financial year.
</P>
<P>
''Two further reductions of 0.5 percent of GDP in each of the
subsequent years would bring the deficit to a satisfactory long-term
target of 3.0 percent of GDP in the 1999/2000 financial year,'' read
the framework.
</P>
<P>
The framework forecast a ''social agreement to facilitate wage and
price moderation, underpin accelerated investment and employment and
enhance public service delivery''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, projected growth levels for the economy in the scenario
were 3.5 percent in 1996, 2.9 percent in 1997, 3.8 percent in 1998,
4.9 percent in 1999 and 6.1 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
With regard to employment, the scenario also envisaged 126,000 new
jobs being created this year, 252,000 next year, 246,000 in 1998,
320,000 in 1999 and 409,000 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The document further budgeted for average annual foreign direct
investment of 509 million US dollars. It expected a consistent drop in
real government consumption from 19.9 percent this year to 18 percent
by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The framework received a mixed, but mostly positive reaction
from the business sector and political parties. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to End Standoff With UN Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq offered a solution
today to put to an end the standoff with United Nations arms
inspectors, according to diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz proposed in a letter to
the Security Council that Rolf Ekeus, the U.N. official in charge
of Iraqi disarmament, could be accompanied by three members of his
inspection team and he would have three officials on his side when
they wished to enter the sites Iraq considers related to national
security.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said at the noon briefing that
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali sincerely hoped that the
current standoff would not affect the progress toward implementing
the oil-for-food agreement, reached last month after four rounds
of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq expected that the agreement would be the first step toward
lifting economic sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials noted that Iraq's refusal to admit weapons
inspectors could encourage the United States and others to demand
strict conditions on Iraqi imports and exports and postpone the
implementation of the oil-for-food plan.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Launch Road Repair Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Ministry of Works and
Housing is to launch an innovative road rehabilitation program
tagged ''Road Vision 2000''.
</P>
<P>
This World Bank-sponsored project was aimed at rescuing
Nigeria's dilapidated road network, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's 200,000-km road network, mainly built in the last
decade, requires some 24 billion Naira (11.76 million US dollars)
annually to maintain. But most of the roads, including 35,000 km
of federal highways, are in severe state of dilapidation, said
Minister Major-General Abdulkarim Adisa.
</P>
<P>
So far a total of 34 billion Naira (400 million dollars) has
been available for the program, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
But the amount could only rehabilitate less than 30 percent of
the roads, he added.
</P>
<P>
To raise fund for the maintenance of the highways, the
ministry will start a privatisation scheme by way of BOT (build,
operate and transfer) practice, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Up to 50 companies have expressed willingness to take part in
the scheme which is expected to begin soon, he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> China to Build New Airports in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Haikou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- New airports will be constructed
in Shanghai, south China's Guangzhou and Haikou cities in the next
five years while the Beijing International Airport is being
extended.
</P>
<P>
Hongqiao International Airport of Shanghai transported over 11
million passengers last year, three times that of the early
1990s. Some 27 million passengers are estimated to travel by air
in Shanghai area by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Pudong Airport of Shanghai is being prepared so
that it would meet the rapid growing demand for air transportation
and to promote development of Pudong area, which is located in the
eastern suburb of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Baiyun Airport has reached its saturation by
transporting nearly 12.6 million passengers last year. Extension
of the airport was almost impossible for it was located near city
propers.
</P>
<P>
Xu Cunxin, director in charge of airports department from the
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), said that a new
airport will be built in Huadu City in northern suburb of
Guangzhou. The airport will be designed in accordance with the
transportation capability in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the design of Meilan Airport of Haikou City was
permitted by the government to have a flight area at the degree of
4E, meaning it would allow giant planes to take off and land.
</P>
<P>
The current Haikou Airport sent and received 2.8 million
passengers last year, which has already beyond its designed
capability.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that more than 60 airports across the country
have been built or extended since the late 1970s. China now has
135 airports in total, with many of them providing taking off and
landing services to aircrafts typed Boeing 737 or higher.

<HEADLINE> Forty-five Parties Register For Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- About 45 parties and 16
independent candidates have submitted their applications for
entering the upcoming Bosnian elections, spokeswoman for
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Joanna Van Vliet said that the numbers could even be higher
when counting into those who had registered with the OSCE regional
offices before the 1500 gmt deadline yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Parties and individuals from all three former warring factions
have submitted their applications, but OSCE could not provide a
break-down at the moment, Van Vliet said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton agreement, the Bosnian elections should
be held before September 14 under the auspices of OSCE, whose
current chairman, Swiss foreign minister Flavio Gotti will decide
by the end of the month a specific election date.
</P>
<P>
Many OSCE field workers and the Bosnian government have worried
that the elections will only reinforce the ethnic partition in the
country unless certain conditions such as the freedom of movement
are quickly improved.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and other Western powers have insisted on
holding elections on time, fearing that a delay would postpone the
withdrawal of Nato-led peace-keeping forces from Bosnia.

WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A suspect has been arrested in
connection with the fire that destroyed a black church Thursday in
Oklahoma in the United States, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Harper, 35, of Enid was arrested on Friday evening,
according to a police statement issued Saturday. Harper is white.
</P>
<P>
Enid police Capt. Jim Hood said detectives still don't know
whether the arson at the First Missionary Baptist Church was
motivated by race.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation to this point has revealed no information
that leads us to believe that this crime is the result of racial
issues," Hood was quoted as saying by The United Press
International.
</P>
<P>
Hood said local and federal prosecutors were reviewing that
case and charges against Harper were expected.
</P>
<P>
Arson was confirmed on Friday when a certified fire
investigator inspected the remains of the church with a special
sniffing dog.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms spokesman Steve Steele
said the dog detected the scent of some type of accelerant in the
burned out ruins of the church.
</P>
<P>
The ATF and FBI are trying to determine whether the blaze is
connected to the more than 30 fires at black churches across the
South in the past 18 months.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- More people died from tuberculosis
in 1995 than in any other year in history, the World Health
Organization (WHO) representative in Zimbabwe, Levon Arevshatian
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said nearly three million people died from TB in 1995,
surpassing the worst years of the epidemic around 1900, when an
estimated 2.1 million died.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the TB crisis will continue to grow unless
immediate action is taken.
</P>
<P>
"At current rates, up to a half billion could become sick with
often-incurable multidrug-resistant TB," he said.
</P>
<P>
TB was the leading infectious killer of youths and adults and
had become the principal killer of hiv-positive people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although WHO declared a global TB emergency in 1993, prompting
some governments to increase their response to the disease, the
epidemic continues to outpace these efforts, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Medicines that can cure every TB patient have been available
for the past 50 years but these tools are not being widely or
correctly used," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 million people have died of TB since its discovery in
1882.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe there are an estimatged 25,000 TB patients, a 400
percent higher than eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> Russians Set For Marathon Presidential Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia starts a 24-hour voting
marathon on Sunday as more than 106 million people across 11 time
zones go to the polls to elect a new president.
</P>
<P>
Starting in Chukotka in Russia's Far East, thousands of
kilometers away from Moscow, the marathon will kick off at 1900
GMT on June 15 and last 24 hours before winding up in Russia's far
Western enclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea at 1900 GMT on
June 16.
</P>
<P>
More than 520,000 Russians who live abroad temporarily or
permanently, will cast their ballots at 402 polling stations in
146 countries.
</P>
<P>
The voters will have to choose from 10 candidates after
communist candidate Aman Tuleyev quit the race four days ahead of
the polls and called on his supporters to back communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov to be the country's second president.
</P>
<P>
The top five candidates are:
</P>
<P>
-- Incumbent President Boris Yeltsin, 65. He became the first
elected president of Russia in June 1991, and launched
"democratic" and market-oriented economic reforms after the
break-up of the Soviet Union in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin believes he will win the election and says he needs
another term of office to complete the reforms, to ensure economic
growth and better social benefits for the people, to curb
inflation, make the rouble fully convertible and switch the army
from a conscription to a professional basis.
</P>
<P>
-- Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, 52. He has
headed the Russian Communist Party since 1993.
</P>
<P>
He wants to amend the constitution to reduce the strong
presidential powers that Yeltsin has enjoyed and strengthen the
legislature. He wants a mixed economy, preserving much of the
private sector but keeping effective state involvement in major
industries. He promises to end the war in Chechnya, boost
economic growth, fight corruption and the mafia and ensure
acceptable living standards.
</P>
<P>
-- Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 50.
He was the third in the 1991 presidential elections with 7.81
percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
He promises tough fight against crime, including capital
punishment. He says Chechen separatists should be eliminated, not
talked to. He promises that ethnic Russians would reign in the
country.
</P>
<P>
-- Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky, 44. He became known in
the country for his "500 days" economic reform program proposed
during the Soviet era, and has been heading the reformist Yabloko
bloc in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying popularity among the Russian intelligentsia, he
believes the principle of private property is inviolable. He
promises to reform the tax system and the financial market,
streamline the government, develop free medical care and education
and end the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
-- Law and order advocate retired General Alexander Lebed, 46.
He took part in the Afghan war as a career army officer and
paratrooper. He gained fame as the commander of Russia's 14th
army for bringing an end to the military conflict between the
former Soviet Union republic Moldova and its breakaway Dniester
region.
</P>
<P>
Respected for his harsh, military style and clear-cut speech
which most ordinary Russians can understand, he promises to fight
crime, reform the army, improve banking and tax systems and the
life of ordinary citizens. He believes that ethnic Russians
should be evacuated from Chechnya and its independence claim
should be decided at a referendum of ethnic Chechens.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates include:
</P>
<P>
-- Eye surgeon and businessman Svyatoslav Fyodorov. The
69-year-old "centrist" advocates a mixture of a capitalist
production system and socialist distribution.
</P>
<P>
-- Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. The former
president, known for his "perestroika and glasnost" (reform and
opening) is widely respected in the West, but hated in the former
Soviet Union for breaking-up of the powerful bloc. His economic
program boils down to the slogan that "reforms should be turned to
face the people."
</P>
<P>
-- Businessman and billionaire Vladimir Bryntsalov. The head
of Ferane, one of Russia's biggest pharmaceutical companies, was
completely unknown in the country before registering for the
presidential election. He says he is economically a "capitalist"
and politically a "Russian socialist".
</P>
<P>
-- Businessman Martin Shakkum, 45. He heads a large non-state
enterprise in the Moscow suburbs and is vice-president of the
International Fund of Economic and Social Reforms. The unknown
candidate says: "I am for a market economy, but it must be under
state control."
</P>
<P>
-- Ex-weightlifting champion Yuri Vlasov, 61. Several-time
Olympic, world and European weightlifting champion, he went into
politics during the Gorbachev era. As a State Duma (lower house
of the parliament) member, he calls himself "a representative of
the patriotic movement of Russia" and stands for the reunification
of former Soviet republics through referenda. He also stands for
tough state control over the market economy.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's voting, the winner of the first round ballot must
get an overall majority of 50 percent of the votes. If none
succeeds, the two leading candidates in the first round will go
into a run-off, which will take place on July 7 or 14.
</P>
<P>
The run-off works on a first-past-the-post basis, but the
winner has to get more votes than are cast against both contenders.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that only Yeltsin and Zyuganov are the only
two real contenders in the race, but neither is likely to win the
first round outright and will have to go for a showdown in the
run-off.
</P>
<P>
First preliminary results are expected after polls close in
Kaliningrad at 1900 GMT Sunday, and preliminary results from all
parts of Russia will be announced late on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's Constitution, approved in December 1993, the
president has wide powers which give him much more authority than
the other branches of power.
</P>
<P>
The president determines the main direction of the state's
domestic policy and exercises leadership of the country's foreign
policy. He is also Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and has
the final word in most state affairs.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Per Capita Consumption of Beer Rated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has the lowest per capita
consumption of beer in the region of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) with a record of only three
litres of beer per person per annum, reported Radio Uganda today.
</P>
<P>
A paper presented at the consultative group meeting of beer
industry here last Wednesday was quoted as saying that Kenya has

<HEADLINE> Israeli Discovery Opens Way To Control Of Autoimmune </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A key enzyme that acts as a
"suicide weapon" causing cells to self-destruct has been
discovered, according to an announcement by Weizman Institute of
Science.
</P>
<P>
This finding by the institute researchers, reported in the
June 14 issue of Cell, may help in the design of treatment for
autoimmune disorders caused by abnormal cellular self-destruction,
such as juvenile diabetes and multiple sclerosis. It also
advances the understanding of a variety of other normal and
abnormal process involving cell suicide.
</P>
<P>
"We've identified a crucial step in the self-annihilation of
cells and may now be able to control this process," says
Professor David Wallach of the Institute's Department of Membrane
Research and Biophysics, whose research team included graduate
students Mark Bodin, Tanya Goncharov and Yury Goltsev.
</P>
<P>
Human body's cells commit suicide regularly in a normal
process that enables organ to renew and repair themselves. But in
certain autoimmune diseases, the immune system erroneously
commands healthy cells to exterminate themselves.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have known for several years that in these
disorders certain cells receive the self-destruct message through
three receptor molecules on their surface, known as Fas/Apo-1 and
two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors.
</P>
<P>
Now Weizman Institute researchers have discovered the "suicide
weapon" that translates this message into action -- an enzyme
they called MACH. This enzyme cuts up certain vital proteins
inside the cell, thereby disrupting its normal functions and
causing it to die.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also found that the transmission of the suicide
message is surprisingly direct. Unlike many other cellular
processes that involve multiple stages and messengers, it is
relayed directly from the receptor to the suicide machinery
inside the cell.
</P>
<P>
The new understanding of the suicide mechanism may make it
possible to block it in autoimmune disorders. Moreover, since the
death signals are primarily transmitted via Fas/Apo-1 and TNF in
the case of disease, it may be possible to selectively block only
these abnormal signals while allowing other cell suicide processes
to continue in tissues where they are needed.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the MACH molecule also advances understanding
of the development of the brain and other organs because this
enzyme belongs to a family of proteins that play a crucial role in
cellular self-destruction involved in these and numerous other
body processes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new finding may help us understand the growth
of cancerous tumors, in which the cellular suicide mechanisms
responsible for maintaining the normal growth of tissues are
sometimes disturbed.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Calls for Emulation of Model Weather Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The regional government of Tibet
held a meeting here today, calling on officials coming from
interior areas to aid the region to follow the example of a model
weather man.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinshui, born in east China's Zhejiang Province, had
worked in Tibet for 33 years following his graduation from Beijing
Meteorological Institute in the 1950s. He worked under harsh
conditions at the Ando Meteorological Station, the highest in the
world, for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, deputy secretary of the regional committee of the
Communist Party of China, called on all officials and party
members in Tibet, especially leading officials at various levels,
to attach great importance to learning from Chen Jinshui and use
various forms to combine the learning of Chen with that of Kong
Fansen, an official who died on duty in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Raidi said that the officials from interior areas are an
important component of the official ranks in Tibet, and the
development and progress of Tibet is full of their intelligence
and energy. Chen Jinshui is an outstanding representative of them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the emulation of Chen is the call of the times and
an objective necessity under the new circumstances.

<HEADLINE> US Is Making Mistake: Iranian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that the United States is making a
mistake in using a language of force and compulsion to the people
of the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the latest U.S. second sanctions against the
Islamic Republic, the 61-year-old president said, "The Islamic
revolution has taught the world imperialism that one has to resort
to logic and reason to deal with moral and religious movements."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the statement here this morning while meeting
with members of the Islamic Coalition Association, the state-run
Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of negotiations with White House officials, House
and Senate Republican leaders, the U.S. House of Representatives'
Ways and Means Committee approved a bill Thursday, which would
require U.S. President Bill Clinton to impose sanctions on any
foreign company that invests 40 million U.S. dollars or more in
the Iranian oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president criticized the United States for making
threats to the Iranian people, saying that Americans "can not
bring the Islamic revolution and the Republic to its knees by
threats of using force or compulsion."
</P>
<P>
He said that application of threat as a weapon might be
effective in weakening the resolve of certain people but not on
those who choose their path with faith.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed sanctions on Iran a year ago to
punish it for alleged support for international terrorism and
efforts to produce nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Concern over Tajikistan Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed deep concern
over the renewed outbreak of factional fighting in Tajikistan,
calling the civil war "worrisome."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati submitted a letter
to the United Nations and voiced Iran's readiness to help in
conducting a new round of negotiations aimed at restoring peace
and stability in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The letter was reported by the official news agency IRNA and
was aired by the state-run Tehran Radio here today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to several rounds of inter-Tajik peace talks,
Velayati said the agreements, reached to date through the effort
and support of the U.N. and other observer countries, were a ray
of hope to the people of Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed in the letter that the recent events in
border areas and inside Tajikistan have become a cause of concern
for those who want tranquility to be restored.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to coincide with the extension Friday of
the mission of the U.N. Security Council observers in Tajikistan
for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the U.N. peace mission in Tajikistan requires
the implementation of the Tehran peace accord, the commitment of
the Tajik government and the opposition to establish a durable
peace in the country, their efforts toward reaching a national
consensus, as well as the promotion of democracy in the central
Asian state.
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted that the Tehran cease-fire agreement signed on
September 17, 1994, has reportedly been violated by the Tajik
government and the opposition on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no effective measures have been taken to date for
promoting and carrying out the parts of the agreement that have
not been breached, as a result of which the joint commission for
monitoring the cease-fire has been rendered inactive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has the strong conviction that during the transition
period, the central Asian region is in dire need of calm and
stability, Velayati said in the letter, underlining that
continuation of the current crisis in Tajikistan would adversely
affect the whole region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in keeping with the policy of extending
assistance to resolve regional crises, the Islamic Republic, as
one of the mediator countries working with the U.N. in Tajikistan,
underscores its commitment to continue inter-Tajik talks and fully
adhere to the accords already reached by both sides. These
measures offer the only viable solution to the crisis, Velayati
added.
</P>
<P>
He called on U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to
pay attention to the urgent need to hold inter-Tajik talks within
the shortest possible time, saying it was imperative to adopt
confidence-building measures.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Russia's Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- About 105 million Russians will
cast their votes Sunday to select among 10 candidates a new
president for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
This is the second presidential election in Russia, and the
first since the disintegration of the former Soviet Union at the
end of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Russia's first presidential election was held in June 1991
under the Soviet election law, in which the then 60-year-old Boris
Yeltsin was elected with 57 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Federal Constitution, and Russia's
presidential election law approved by the State Duma (lower house
of parliament) in March 1993, any Russian citizen above the age of
35 who has lived in the country for more than 10 successive years
is qualified to hold the office of president.
</P>
<P>
Any political party or group can nominate a candidate, whose
candidacy must be supported by petitions signed by the minimum of
1 million voters.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate gets an overall majority of votes in the June
16 election to win the presidency, the two leading candidates will
go forward for a second round of voting, probably on July 7 or
July 14.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 10 candidates competing for the presidency,
with the incumbent President Boris Yeltsin and Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov well ahead of other candidates in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
economist Grigory Yavlinsky, eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov,
paratroop general Alexander Lebed, former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, parliamentarian Vladimir Bryntsalov, political
scientist Martin Shakkum and writer Yuri Vlasov.
</P>
<P>
As the incumbent president, Yeltsin, 65, who has years of
experience in politics, has support from Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin with his party "Our Home Is Russia", local and
central government officials, business and financial circles, and
part of the "democrats."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Zyuganov, 52, as leader of Russia's largest
party, the Communist Party which groups 500,000 members across the
country, is supported by the "National-Patriotic Bloc", which is
backed by traditional Communist Party members, low-income earners
and dissidents of current policies.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that Yeltsin and Zyuganov, neither of whom
would likely receive half the votes in Sunday's voting, will have
to enter a second round in July, in which voters for other
candidates play a key role.
</P>
<P>
As neither Zhirinovsky nor any from the "third force", which is
formed by Yavlinsky, Lebed and Fyodorov, is likely to have the
opportunity to enter the second round, how their supporters will
cast their votes in the second round will greatly influence the
results of the election.
</P>
<P>
Both Yeltsin and Zyuganov attempted to seek support from
Zhirinovsky, and the "third force", which, however, claims that it
favors neither Yeltsin nor Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the second round will be announced
invalid if more voters select the "against all candidates" box in
the ballot paper than vote for the leading contender.
</P>
<P>
If either participant withdraws from the second round, he is
replaced by the candidate who scored the third highest number of
votes in the first round.
</P>
<P>
If no one wins the second round, a second presidential election
will be held four months after the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
According to the election law, the president-elect shall be
sworn in 30 days after the Central Electoral Commission announces
the final results. The president-elect shall submit to the State
Duma the nomination of the prime minister within 14 days and the
Duma shall review it within 7 days.
</P>
<P>
In case the poll is ruled invalid by the Commission, the
incumbent president will continue to assume his office.

<HEADLINE> Germans to Protest Against Government Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of Germans are
pouring into Bonn to stage a massive rally in demonstration
against Chancellor Helmut Kohl's planned multi-billion mark
government spending cuts, the Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 protesters, coming in by 5,400 buses and 74
special trains from all over the country, are expected to voice
their outrage against Kohl's 50 billion mark (33 billion
U.S. dollars) cuts and labor deregulation reforms, the DPA said.
</P>
<P>
The rally, called by the powerful Federation of German Trade
Unions, would be the biggest protest in Bonn since demonstrations
in early 1980s against the stationing of Cruise and Pershing
missiles in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions are trying to sink key parts of Kohl's planned
package of cuts for the 1997 budget, which had its first stormy
reading in the parliament Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police are watching closely a separate Bonn protest by
leftists, which is expected to draw hundreds of masked, left-wing
extremist street-fighters, known as "Autonomen." Leaders of the
main protest have distanced themselves from the leftists.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Lafontaine, leader of the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD), said the planned cuts would greatly affect people with
lower incomes and would destroy Germany's "social peace."
</P>
<P>
But Chancellor Kohl insists on his plan, saying "desperate
clinging to the status quo endangers the economic and social
future of our country."
</P>
<P>
"We have a choice: Either we show courage to make decisions now
for our future or we will be run over by world economic
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Demonstrations do not create jobs," the chancellor added.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Calls on Netanyahu to Discuss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher Friday telephoned Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the latter's planned trip to the
U.S. and the peace process, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyhau has postponed his visit to the U.S. from the original
late June to July, saying he needed enough time to prepare for
the trip. Meanwhile, he invited Christopher to visit Israel first.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was considering to make a trip to the Middle East
ahead of Netanyahu's visit to Washington, the Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of peace-making, Christopher called for patience
by parties concerned, it added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, U.S. President Bill Clinton also made a
phone call to Netanyahu, and expressed the hope that the Arab
leaders attending a Cairo summit on June 21-23 in Egypt would
reaffirm their commitments to peace, it said.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a chief peace
broker in the region, will host Arab leaders in the summit,
bringing together the largest number of Arab leaders since the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda is the discussion of the implications of the
May 29 Israeli elections, which swept the hardline Likud leader
Netanyahu to power, on the peace process and the Arab unity in
dealing with the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyhau, who is to form his new government Monday, has ruled
out any compromise on key issues of the peace process, including
the status of Jerusalem, establishment of a Palestinian state and
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau
Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak has already held several rounds of talks with
leaders of Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia ahead of the summit to
discuss the challenges facing the peace process in the wake of
Netanyahu's election victory.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Thursday met with visiting Jordian King Hussein to
discuss the peace process. He said he was encouraged by
Netanyahu's statements on peace process, adding that Washington
would give him the "elbow room" to assemble his new government.
</P>
<P>
In a move to calm the possible concern of the Israelis about
the Cairo summit, King Hussein said he hoped nothing at the
meeting would jeopardize the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, however, Netanyhau's office issued a tough
statement to warn the Arab leaders against making threats to
Israel, saying they would only have an adverse effect.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lashes out at US for Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian press today lashed out
at the United States for its second sanctions against foreign
companies investing in oil industries in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Two English-language newspapers Iran News and Tehran Times and
Persian daily Jomhuri Islami today published editorials, noting
that the sanctions are an attempt by Washington to make its
trading rivals capitulate to its bullying.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. unilateral actions and extra-territorial statutes are
contrary to the provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
destroying free trade," Tehran Times wrote. It noted that they
pose a serious threat to the economic and commercial interests of
the European Union (EU), Japan and other members of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed sanctions against Iran a year ago to
punish it for alleged support for international terrorism and
efforts to produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The paper underlined that American actions are doomed to fail
for three reasons: Iran's strength which enables it to offset the
sanctions; vociferous international reaction to the domineering
tendencies of Washington; and the opposition of American
entrepreneurs, industrialists and academics to the
Israeli-influenced sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iran News called on European countries to follow their own
interests rather than tread in the American footsteps. "We are
sure that Europe will give a befitting response to Clinton's lack
of vision."
</P>
<P>
Jomhuri Islami noted in its editorial "the United States
should understand that the era of U.S. bullying has come to an end
and that it must respect and recognize the preference of Europe."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee
approved a bill Thursday after weeks of negotiations with White
House officials, House and Senate Republican leaders, which would
require Clinton to impose sanctions on any foreign company that
invests 40 million U.S. dollars or more in the Iranian oil and gas
sectors.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Iranian authorities have not made any official
statements yet.
</P>
<P>
The official daily Tehran Times said: "The world community has
realized today that no country can assume that it has the right to
tell companies in other countries how they should behave."
</P>
<P>
"This is why other countries, specially members of the EU,
have vehemently protested against such unilateral actions," it
added.
</P>
<P>
It noted in conclusion that European and other industrial
nations "will not allow the White House to go ahead with its trade
bullying. U.S. trade partners should renew their objections...at
the meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) in France later this month."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran News recalled that in the past the U.S. also
used trade as a political weapon against Europe, and the same
policy is again being adopted against its adversaries who are not
ready to bow before its arrogant policy.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the embargo on Iran, Europe has already
reacted with anger and continues its...'critical dialogue' with
the Islamic Republic," it said.

CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Omani Head of State Sultan Qaboos
Bin Said left here for home this morning, ending his five-day
visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off at the Cairo International Airport by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and a number of senior officials.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Sultan Qaboos held talks with Mubarak on
bilateral relations and Arab issues, particularly the Middle East
peace process and the upcoming Arab summit to be held in Cairo on
June 21-23.

members. Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab
world, is the only Arab League member state which was not invited

a unified Arab front to continue the Middle East peace process
which is being jeopardized by the election of hardliner Benjamin
Netanyahu as the Israeli prime minister, Arab officials said.
</P>

Netanyahu has said that he will take a tougher line than that
of his predecessor Shimon Peres in Israel's negotiations with the

<HEADLINE> Asia's Upland Rice Farmers Face Challenges: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Asia's upland rice farmers are
facing tough challenges because of growing population in upland
areas and declining availability of irrigated lowland areas, the
International Rice Research Institute said in a press release here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Population growth, rapid expansion of cities and industry, and
increasing adoption of high-value cash crop farming in traditional
rice-farming regions" are putting pressures on upland rice
farmers, said the Manila-based institute.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 million people in the world depend on upland rice
for daily staple food while almost two-thirds of the world's
upland rice areas are in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are important producers of
upland rice varieties.
</P>
<P>
Growing population pressures have shortened fallow periods in
traditional slash-and-burn cropping systems, resulting in nutrient
depletion and weed increase, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
"Soil erosion is a severe threat to steeper areas as cropping
intensity increases. This in turn has destroyed the watersheds,
producing problems in the lands below." it said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said upland rice farmers are faced with an urgent
need to conserve the soil and the diversity of rice plant species
as well as to cope with the more frequent and severe weed and
disease infestations.
</P>
<P>
It said scientists in the institute are working to seek ways to
help farmers solve the problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An international tourism symposium
on the "Silk Road" has been scheduled for June 18 -20 in the
capital city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the World Tourism Organization (WTO) and
the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA), this will be the
first international special-topic tourism meeting sponsored by the
WTO in China.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop a highly competitive multi-national tourist
itinerary, the symposium has attracted more than 100 participants,
including senior leaders from WTO, the United Nations, the
International Travel Association, CNTA, and tourism departments
from more than 20 countries and regions including the United
States, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
They also will research the historical status and role of the
road, as well as measures to promote tourism there.
</P>
<P>
The "Silk Road" was the first and longest international travel
route in the world.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 km long, it originated in Chang'an (the present
Xi'an), capital of the western Han Dynasty, passed along the Gansu
corridor, Tarim Basin and the Pamirs, ran through Uzbekistan,
Turkmenia, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, and ended at the sea ports
in the Mediterranean in Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Boss: African Economy Burdenred With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) Ms Sadako Ogata has stated that the ever
highest number of refugees in Africa is hitting the continent's
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has the largest number of refugees amounting to 6.7
million. Additionally the number of persons displaced in their
own countries regrettably continues to increase," says the UNHCR
boss.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in Ms Ogata's statement to African
governments to commemorate the Africa Refugee Day which falls on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She appeals to African leader to remedy the situation, saying
that it is not too late and "the future is not bleak".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the refugees' repatriation, the UNHCR boss says
in the past one year, the UN body completed the voluntary
repatriation of some 1.7 million Mozambican refugees, the largest
operation so far undertaken in Africa.
</P>
<P>
She says she is optimistic that UNHCR will repatriate
300,000 Angolan refugees in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
On Rwandan refugees, Ms Ogata says host countries and donor
governments have shown impatience at the the continued presence
of some 1.7 million refugees in ecologically and economically
fragile communities.
</P>
<P>
She regrets that Burundi refugees fleeing with terrible
violence have difficulty in finding safety abroad.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Conference on Human Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Second United Nations
Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) ended here today
before dawn, making a new start for sharing solutions aimed at
improving life in human settlements with the endorsement of the
Habitat Agenda.
</P>
<P>
The closing plenary dragged on due to the attempt by Vatican
delegation to impose its religious dogma against family planning
and reproductive health principles on the final documents of the
conference. But it failed.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul Declaration and Habitat Agenda were passed in the
closing plenary by representatives of 171 countries from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
They endorsed the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter
for all and making human settlements safer, healthier, more
livable, equitable, sustainable and more productive.
</P>
<P>
The enabling strategy and the principles of partnership and
participation were also adopted as the most democratic and
effective approach for the realization of the countries'
commitments.
</P>
<P>
Since the goals and principles have been worked out, said
Habitat Secretary-General Wally N'dow, "Our cities, our towns,
our future will be determined by how the Global Plan of Action
is put into implementation."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Emre Gonensay, who made a closing
speech on behalf of President Suleyman Demirel of the host
country, urged all the participants not to leave these documents
"on some library shelf to gather dust" or regard them merely as
sources to refresh their memories.
</P>
<P>
"We must put them to effective use as the main sources of
reference to guide our future endeavors..." he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to N'dow, the two-week event succeeded in all of its
major goals of putting the problems of human settlements at the
center of local, national and international agenda.
</P>
<P>
Included in the process for the first time were
representatives from cities, the private sector, other local
authorities, grassroots organizations and non-government
organizations (NGOs), instead of just national governments.
</P>
<P>
Some 16,400 people participated in the debates and other
sessions from June 3-14 in Istanbul in the major U.N. conference
of the century.
</P>
<P>
The primary disputes arose over the definition of the "right
to housing," the question of whether developed countries should
greatly increase aid to developing ones to improve shelter, and
women's reproductive rights.
</P>
<P>
"We have solved most of these questions, through vigorous
debate and consensus," said N'dow. "A major reason why debate was
so spirited was because of the fresh infusion of voices into this
U.N. conference, from city and other local officials, NGOs and
grassroots organizations."
</P>
<P>
During the conference, 12 special urban development projects
were awarded "Best Practices for Improving Human Settlements,"
designed to encourage experimentation around the world's cities.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 heads of state or government arrived in Istanbul for
the last three days of the high-level meeting, most of them from
developing countries. Cuban leader Fidel Castro therefore lashed
out at the West for poisoning the planet but now showing little
interest to save the world.
</P>
<P>
N'dow emphasized that another major advance of the conference
was in its emphasis on the crucial role of women in the
sustainable development of human settlements.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, when people first arrived in the historical
city of Istanbul, they were greeted by banners wavering in main
streets to the conference valley, reading "Welcome to Istanbul to
Accomplish a World Mission".
</P>
<P>
Today, as they are leaving Istanbul, another slogan is seeing
them off -- "Be a Part of the Solution."

<HEADLINE> Japan's Government Bonds to Be Narrowly Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Prices of long-term Japanese
government bonds are expected to be mixed within a limited range
in directionless trading in Tokyo next week, the Kyodo News
Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the government's release of gross domestic product
(GDP) figures on Tuesday for the first quarter of this year, which
is a major indicator of the economy, will have some impact on the
market.
</P>
<P>
"If the GDP figures come in stronger than expected, the market
could come under selling pressure, albeit temporarily," a trader
at a major brokerage house was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But most traders predicted that bond prices will see little dip
because investors have been steadily buying bonds on declines for
recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
Bonds surged on news that the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund
Bureau has decided to resume bond buying operations without plans
to sell them, but edged down in fear of higher prices.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Foreign Ministers to Meet on Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of foreign ministers of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has been
scheduled for next month in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, to resolve
the current factional conflict in war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Foreign Minister Chief Tom Ikimi disclosed this on
Friday in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, during a working visit
to the ECOWAS peacekeeping force headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He did not give the date for the scheduled meeting.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today quoted him as saying "the
ECOWAS has decided to give the Liberian peace process another
chance".
</P>
<P>
The meeting is necessary because it would not be in the best
interest of ECOWAS to withdraw its troops or take any decision
based on media report, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's factional warlords -- Charles Taylor of the National
Patriotic Front of Liberia and Alhaji Kromah of Ulimo-k --
boycotted the last meeting called by the ECOWAS Committee of Nine
in Ghana last month at the outbreak of fresh hostilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECOWAS monitoring group's field commander
Major-general John Inienger, there is a need for the west African
peacekeeping force to be bolstered with "credible" and
"overwhelming force" to enable it to discharge its mandate in
Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Canada Tables Bill to Ban Commercial Surrogate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government tabled a
bill today that seeks to ban rent-a-womb contracts and
sex-selection of babies for non-medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
The bill also aims to prohibit commercial trade in eggs, sperm
and embryos.
</P>
<P>
"We are acting today to set boundaries of the use of new
reproductive technologies," said Health Minister David Dingwall,
who introduced the bill.
</P>
<P>
The government bill follows years of debate and study,
including the 1993 report of the Royal Commission on New
Reproductive Technologies, which recommended limits on the advance
of science in the human reproduction sphere.
</P>
<P>
The market for new reproductive and genetic technologies is
potentially large. Current data indicate that about 500,000 of
Canada's 30 million people are affected by infertility.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand children are born in Canada each year through
donor insemination -- through the insertion of donor sperm into a
woman.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Poll Likely to Complicate Bangladeshi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's just concluded election
results may produce a hung parliament with no single party having
a clear majority, in which case the third largest party would
probably emerge as the main power-broker.
</P>
<P>
The Awami (People's) League (AL) has come out as the leading
party in Wednesday's election to the 300-member parliament,
bagging 133 seats out of 272 announced so far by the Election
Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
The ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won 104 seats,
followed by Jatiya (National) Party (JP) with 29, Jamatte-e-Islami
with three and others with three.
</P>
<P>
AL President Sheikh Hasina reportedly approached JP leaders for
support in forming the government as her party seems to be short
of an absolute majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The JP, however, set a precondition for such support.
</P>
<P>
Acting JP Chairman Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury told reporters that
the release of his party's jailed chairman and former president of
the country, H. M. Ershad, would be the primary consideration
before their support for any party in forming the next government.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who won five seats in the polls, has been serving
prison terms on corruption charges since he was toppled down in
late 1990 by a democratic movement spearheaded by the AL and the
BNP.
</P>
<P>
The BNP defeated the AL in the 1991 election and formed a
single-party government with the support of the then fourth
largest party of Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
This time, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia is apparently
losing the polls monitored by a caretaker government after her BNP
government was forced to resign in late March in the wake of a
series of street agitation launched by the opposition troika --the
AL, the JP and Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia refused to admit defeat at her first post-election
press conference Friday and demanded repolling in 112
constituencies where what she alleged massive rigging took place.
</P>
<P>
"We will comment on the results only after polling in all the
seats is over and our complaints of irregularities lodged with the
EC are answered," she said.
</P>
<P>
The EC has declared that repolling will be held by June 19 at
123 centers of 27 constituencies where election was marred by
violence, and results of the other seats will be announced in one
or two days.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said they would not rule out the possible
formation  of a coalition government by the BNP and the JP if the
former can get enough seats in the remaining 28 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
There is also a good chance that the AL can get very close to
clear majority, in which case it would not be difficult for the AL
to get the independents and other smaller parties to support its
effort to demonstrate its majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Once installed in power, AL MPs could easily elect its
supporters to occupy most of the 30 seats reserved for women,
which will give the AL a comfortable majority to run the country
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Reports said at least two persons were killed and 50 others
injured in post-election violence across the country on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing violence indicates that a single election may not
solve the long-standing political wrangle in this turbulent
country, a poll observer warned.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Call for Execution of Hebron Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
has called on Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu to
fulfill Israel's commitment to the redeployment from Hebron
immediately after he takes office.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a statement issued at the end of a
lengthy meeting of the PA cabinet in Nablus Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The PA warned that violations of the agreement with the PA
will endanger the entire peace process. According to the Oslo 2
accord, Israel was supposed to have withdrawn from Hebron by
March this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime minister Shimon Peres put it off until after
Israel's elections on the grounds of a spate of suicide bombing
attacks in late February and early March. After election defeat,
however, Peres again decided to leave the problem for his
successor to grapple with.
</P>
<P>
PA Minister Saeb Erekat told reporters that Netanyahu's choice
is between peace and no peace, with no options in between. He
added that Israel still needs to open safety passage routes
between the Gaza Strip and West Bank and release more Palestinian
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The PA cabinet session took place against the backdrop of
increasing difficulties between the Israeli authorities and the
PA.
</P>
<P>
The 88-member Legislative Palestinian Council had to cancel
its two-day meeting scheduled to be held in Nablus earlier this
week to support the 22 Gazan members in their protest against
searches at the Erez Checkpoint on the Israel-Gaza border.
</P>
<P>
The PA cabinet meeting discussed, among other things, the
situation after the rightwing Likud leader's victory in Israel's
elections and preparation for the forthcoming Arab Summit in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat took the opportunity to announce
the establishment of a Palestinian stock market in Nablus and an
international exhibition ground will also be constructed there.
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting Arafat swore in PC Member Hannan Ashrawi
to the cabinet, but did not assign her specific portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat's office announced that he will travel to
China on June 18 for an official visit.

<HEADLINE> Factories Be Moved Out of 2,500-Year-Old Suzhou City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou, a 2,500-year-old
picturesque city in east China's Jiangsu province, may be more
beautiful by the end of this century, as the local government has
ordered all factories in downtown areas to move out.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xiaotang, secretary of the City Party Committee, said the
90 factories located in the city proper should be moved out in
three years.
</P>
<P>
About one third of these factories, all promising, state-owned
enterprises, will be moved to the the city's new high-tech
development zone.
</P>
<P>
Another one third of the factories which have caused pollution
and made small profits, will be closed. The others, that deal in
national culture and handicrafts, will be reorganized and
renovated.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, best known for its traditional beautiful gardens, is
one of the country's most famous scenic spots. An ancient Chinese
saying describes the city as "the paradise on the Earth."
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of the Suzhou gardens can be seen in the Summer Palace
in Beijing, a royal garden of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and the
largest of its kind in the world,
</P>
<P>
Yang said the central government requested that the ancient
gardens be well protected during future reconstruction. No
additional factories have been permitted to be built in the
downtown area since the new city proper and the Suzhou Industrial
Park went under construction several years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Industrial Park, located in the city's eastern
suburb, was the largest tract of land reclamation and Sino-foreign
joint venture ever in China. Established under an agreement signed
by the governments of China and Singapore, its construction was
scheduled to be completed in a period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the removal will benefit the protection and
reconstruction of the ancient city as well as bring new hope to
the reform of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Well-To-Do Farmers Invest in State-Owned factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of farmers-turned
entrepreneurs in north China's Shanxi Province are using their own
money to upgrade and retool some state-owned enterprises in the
cities.
</P>
<P>
With the deep-going nationwide reforms of state-owned
enterprises, some medium and small-sized factories in Shanxi
Province went into the red because of poor management and
out-of-date equipment.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1995, local authorities in Shanxi
Province decided to allow some affluent farmers to lease 50 medium
and small-sized factories in the central parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the country used to keep away from investment and
management of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
After conducting reforms on the property rights of 50
profit-losing state-owned factories, a group of farmer-turned
entrepreneurs leased the factories by way of risk mortgage.
</P>
<P>
The leased factories included the Yuci Paper Mill, Xiyang
Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, Lingshi County Chemical Fertilizer
Plant and five other factories.
</P>
<P>
The farmer-turned-entrepreneurs took their own self-made
fortunes or their fixed assets, to lease the loss-making factories
and turned over a fixed amount of rents to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
After a sum of nearly 10 million yuan (some 1,2 million
U.S. dollars) is injected into 50 factories, sales income and
profits of these 50 factories in the first five months of this
year were 24 percent and 71 percent up respectively over that of
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Tianren, a renowned milk cow keeper, leased a dairy
products company in Yinxian County. He has already turned over
1.06 million yuan (about 12,000 U.S. dollars) to the local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
With the investment of rich farmers, medium and small-sized
state-owned enterprises can be reactivated, and these factories
are no longer headaches of the local governments but generating
revenue for them instead, some local officials said.

liberation struggle that culminated into the final liberation of
Namibia and South Africa, has created a pemanent bond between
Cuba and the people of this continent," the president said.

Mkapa pointed out a lot could be done in trade, tourism,
agricultrual areas and other investments to improve the well
being of the two states.

<P>
PYONGYANG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The attempt by the United States
to strangle the Democratic People's Republic of Korean (DPRK) with
a policy of "strength" remains unchanged, and therefore the
citizens of the DPRK have been put on high alert, the country's
leading newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent maneuvers by U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea and Japan, Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the
Workers' Party of Korea, said that continuing U.S. military
exercises against the DPRK indicate clearly that it is the
U.S. that is aggravating tensions in and around the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper warned that the United States is wrong to think
that with strength it can do as it pleases.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Washington should abandon its policy of
"strength" and make a wise choice by withdrawing its troops from

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Create More Jobs Through New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
introduce new programs in the forthcoming budget for the 1996-97
fiscal year from next month to create more employment
opportunities in the country, according to Finance Minister
Ramsharan Mahout.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a pre-budget discussion program held here Friday,
Mahout said the new budget would focus on long-term economic
growth of the country by increasing national revenue and cutting
down expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister called on business community in the
country to overcome its sectional interest and pay taxes to the
government at the optimum capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, he promised to protect the interests of businessmen
saying that "national economy could not be strengthened without
protecting businessmen's interest".
</P>
<P>
Regarding the value added tax (VAT) system to be introduced in
the new fiscal year beginning from mid-July, Mahout said the
implementation of the VAT would strengthen national economy in a
more significant way. Local business circles in the last month
have criticized strongly against the government's decision to
introduce the new tax.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot agree with the views against the concept of the
VAT," the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government would make efforts to
diversify the country's export in the coming fiscal year, adding
that over 37 joint ventures with total investment of nearly 200
million US dollars had been granted licenses.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment would be mobilized to encourage more
competency of the industrial sector in Nepal, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the government would present its budget report
for the 1996-97 fiscal year to the parliament session to be
convened later this month.

<HEADLINE> India Not to Sign CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- All Indian political parties
have exhibited a rare agreement not to sign a comprehensive test
ban treaty (CTBT), it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
With the conference deadline of June 28 fast approaching for
India to make its position clear at the CTBT conference in Geneva,
the Deve Gowda government has begun the process of holding
discussions with political parties and leaders in the country to
evolve a consensus on India's national security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Cutting across party lines, all political parties and leaders
consulted so far have said that India should not be brow-beaten
into signing a treaty that does not take into account India's
commitment to global nuclear disarmament or its national security
concerns, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
"India should show its opposition to the chairman's draft text
which has not addressed any of India's concerns," they said.
</P>
<P>
The pressures on India have been increasing with the attempt by
the western countries, the US in particular, to project India as a
"spoiler" of the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Senior US officials said last week that the draft CTBT document
might have to be abandoned if the treaty was not wrapped up by
June 28 and that India's insistence that it be linked with a
definite date for global disarmament could be its undoing.

<HEADLINE> Indian Cabinet to Be Expanded Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- India's coalition government led
by Deve Gowda is planning to expand its cabinet soon, as promised
earlier, for a comprehensive representation of the 13 ruling
partners, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Gowda has repeatedly said that he would expand
the cabinet after his United Front won the confidence vote in the
Lok Sabha (lower house), which it did on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gowda assumed office of the prime minister on June 1 together
with 20 cabinet ministers. Some of the senior leaders of the
ruling partners were not included because of alleged involvement
in money scandals.
</P>
<P>
The United Front's steering committee is expected to start
discussions today on the question of inducting these leaders.
</P>
<P>
The tainted leaders have stressed that a distinction should be
made between blatant corruption and political donations.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Gowda may induct 20 more ministers in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
The possibility for the former ruling Congress Party to join
the coalition remains slim in the near future as the left-wing
parties have made it clear that they only support a non-Congress,
non-BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) government.

rocket, which exploded shortly after its maiden launch two weeks
ago, the Paris-based European Space Agency (ESA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The rocket exploded just 37 seconds after it veered off course
following blast-off on June 4 from Kourou in French Guiana, on the
northeast coast of South America.
</P>
<P>
The ESA said in a statement that a large part of the equipment
contained in the vehicle equipment bay has been recovered and
examined, and that experts have found a malfunction relating to
the inertial platforms in the rocket's operating mode.
</P>
<P>
However, an ESA spokesman said it was too early to say whether
the flawed positioning system was to blame for the failure of the
rocket which used a gyroscopic inertial system to fix its position
while in flight.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report, space experts suspected that faulty
software in the vehicle equipment bay was to blame for the failed
mission because there was no problem in the rocket's propeller.
</P>
<P>
Examination of all parts of the rocket has been strengthened
with the setting up of an investigation commission which consists
of nine experts of the ESA and the French National Center for
Space Studies. The commission will report the outcome of its
investigation in mid-July.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Rampant organized crimes have cost
the German economy 8.5 billion U.S. dollars over the past five
years and are threatening internal security, Germany's general
prosecutor Kay Nehm said today.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of a three-day seminar on organized crimes, Nehm
appealed to judicial authorities to take tougher measures against
organized crimes as there were 787 cases in 1995, involving 7,792
people from 87 countries, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that while organized crimes have caused losses
of 10.5 billion German marks (8.5 billion U.S. dollars) since
1991, the crime syndicates have raked in profits of some 4.1
billion German marks (3.8 billion U.S. dollars) during this period.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 legal experts attended the seminar in Bavaria
sponsored by the Hanns Seidel Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Consumer Price Index Rose 1.5 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid 1.5 percent
more for the goods and services contained in the consumer price
index basket in May this year than they had a year before,
Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was marginally higher than the 1.4 percent rise
reported for both March and April, said the federal fact-gathering
agency.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 1.5 percent increase was due to higher
transportation charges, especially for new vehicles, gasoline,
auto insurance and air fares.
</P>
<P>
Consumers also faced significant price increases for telephone
services, rental accommodation and restaurant meals.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they gained some relief from lower fresh
vegetables prices, mortgage interest charges and new house prices,
the agency said.

COLOMBO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Board of the World Bank has
approved two new credits totaling over 140 million US dollars for
education and development projects in Sri Lanka, media sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The credits will support the project of teacher education and
development (64.1 million US dollars) and that of the private
sector infrastructure development (75.9 million US dollars), the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The education project aims to enhance the quality of education
services in Sri Lanka by improving teacher education and training
and strengthening teacher hiring and development practices to
better respond to actual needs of specific areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The private sector infrastructure development project will
reduce dependence on the public budget for badly needed
infrastructure by increasing financial, technical and managerial
resources from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The project is also expected to help develop and strengthen the
government's regulatory capacity in infrastructure sectors, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
These two credits will be provided by the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending
arm, said the sources, adding that they carry no interest and are

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Elections To Be Held Mid-September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia will hold general elections by
September 14 as set out by the Dayton peace agreement, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today at the end of an
international conference in Florence to review implementation of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
September 14 is the most appropriate day for the elections,
which are the cornerstone of the Dayton agreement and vital to the
reconstruction of Bosnia and the stability of Europe, said Dini,
who chaired the two-day conference in Florence attended by
ministers and representatives from more than 40 countries and
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
"There are three months ahead of us. We trust there will be
positive developments before the elections," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the elections were a very complicated
procedure and had to be conducted fairly and rationally.
</P>
<P>
Conference participants also agreed on an arms control pact in
the former Yugoslavia which would reduce arsenals in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It's as comprehensive an arms control agreement as any of
those which have taken years to conclude," said U.S. envoy John
Kornblum.
</P>
<P>
It was signed by three former warring parties -- the Bosnian
Serbs, the Muslim-led Bosnian government and the Muslim-Croat
federation -- after they resolved a dispute over the wording of
the pact.
</P>
<P>
Arms control was a crucial plank of the Dayton peace accord,
which was signed in Paris in December 1995, ending four years of
war in the former Yugoslavia.

KATHMANDU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Nepal has
issued an interim order to stop providing special allowances to
members of parliament and staff of the parliament secretariat
until a final decision.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued Friday by a special court bench after
some former lawmakers under the partyless panchayat system filed
a writ petition against a remuneration and perks act passed by the
 parliament last year.
</P>
<P>
The former panchayat, or national assembly, members said that
the recently enacted act discriminated against them by allowing
pensions only to incumbent and former mps of the present
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Demanding the same facilities being paid to the present MPs,
they said in the petition that they were also former members of
the nation's supreme legislative body and the present parliament
was a continuation of the 30-year-old panchayat.
</P>
<P>
The writ petition named the parliament secretariat and the
cabinet as the main defendants.
</P>
<P>
Nepal abolished the partyless panchayat legislative system in
1990 after a widespread people's movement in the country and has
maintained a multi-party parliamentary system since then.

DHAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the ex-ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Begum Khaleda Zia Friday ruled out street
movement if formally announced to be defeated in the election held
Wednesday.

<P>
According to preliminary results issued by the Election

demanded repolling in 112 constituencies "where polling centers
were occupied by a certain political party and gave false vote to
reverse the people's mandate."
</P>
<P>
She claimed she had evidence that some BNP election agents, who
protested the vote rigging, were later forced away from the
polling centers by workers of "a particular political party."
</P>

She added that ballot boxes and papers were not sent in due
time to many centers.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 14 (xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky today said that Austria will not join any military
alliances under present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Under the current situation, he said, Austria's participation
in a military alliance can neither ensure the security of Austria
nor improve the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky appreciated Finland and Sweden for their recent
reiteration of their policies of non-alignment and neutrality.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the position of the two Nordic members of the
European Union fully conforms to my assessment of challenges to
European Security policies."
</P>
<P>
Both Finland and Sweden reaffirmed earlier this week that they
have no plans to join NATO and will continue to pursue their
policies of non-alignment and neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said that instead of drawing a new military
demarcation line on the European continent, Europe should set up a
European security coordination system to make central and eastern
European countries, including Russia and Ukraine, closer to the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said that Austria's participation in the peacekeeping forces
to Bosnia and its active involvement in NATO's partnership for
peace program show that Austria, as a neutral state, has always
been ready to take part in cooperation within the framework of
security, he added.

of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Steve Steele also said investigators were running
down some leads in the case but had made no arrests. "We are not
prepared to announce a suspect," he was quoted as saying by United
Press International.
</P>
<P>
Arson was confirmed Friday when a certified fire investigator
inspected the remains of the First Missionary Baptist Church aided
by a special sniffing dog. He said the dog got a "hit" in the
burned-out ruins of the church.
</P>
<P>
The investigator believes some kind of accelerant was
introduced into the building, Steele said, but "he can't say what
it was until we get the lab results back."
</P>
<P>
The way the fire spread also helped the investigator determine
that the fire was deliberately set, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said investigators have not found any evidence that a racial
motive might have been behind the torching of the black church.
</P>
<P>
Enid firefighters had suspected arson because of the intensity
of the fire which broke out at about 4 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 200-member church was predominantly black, but had two
white pastors and a number of white, Hispanic and American Indian
members, Pastor Alfred Baldwin said.

FUZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chen Baoxiang, a 22-year-old
self-employed man in Zhangzhou city in east China's Fujian
province, has become a provider for dozens of pensioners and
disabled children.
</P>
<P>
Owner of a motorcycle shop, Chen is not a tycoon, but he
voluntarily offers 100 yuan relief every quarter to each of 100
elderly people living alone, and 17 disabled children.
</P>
<P>
"Since I have benefited from the good policies of the
government, I should return my earnings to society, and help
relieve the government of its worries." he said.
</P>
<P>
Born to a poor family, Chen became a dropout before he finished
his junior middle school, and acted as porter at the municipal
railway station at the age of 15. But he always harbored a wish in
his heart that he would help the poor as soon as he become richer.
</P>
<P>
Chen reported his plan to the municipal civil affairs bureau
last September, and has been giving the relief according to a list
supplied by the bureau since last October. So far he has handed
some 35,100 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Two Deputy PMs in Chechnya Oppose Ongoing Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Chechen deputy prime ministers
today refused to take part in local parliamentary elections, which
began today, saying that elections for a regional parliament and
the Russian presidency could not be held at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Musalatov and Sagayev, both from the Moscow-backed Chechnya
government, said in a joint statement that such elections will
deteriorate the social and political situation in the breakaway
republic, according to the Itar-Tass News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
They said that both of them signed earlier this week a military
agreement reached between Russia and Chechen Rebel forces in
Nazrani, capital of the Ingush Republic.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, the Chechen elections could only be
held after the pullout of Russian troops and realization of
demilitarization in the republic.
</P>
<P>
However, Chechen Prime Minister Doku Zavgayev announced earlier
this week that the parliamentary elections would start from June
14 to 16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev also demanded a
delay of the regional elections Thursday and threatened not to
implement the signed military agreement with Russia if the voting
is not postponed.
</P>
<P>
Some 470,000 people are eligible to vote in the balloting for
local lawmakers and the Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Pro-Moscow Chechen government has set up 373 polling
stations across the republic, where some 348 candidates are
contesting for 97 seats in the lower and upper houses of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the elections should go smoothly, the Russian
troops and pro-Moscow police have stepped up security in the
Chechen capital of Grozny. Polling stations and election
commissions throughout the republic have been under protection.

<HEADLINE> Videnov More Than Survives No-Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarians seemed to be preferring
economic dilemma to political disorder as the Zhan Videnov
government survived on Thursday a parliamentary vote of
no-confidence, the third within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide stability, which may be marred by a nationwide
economic crisis, is aspired by the majority of Bulgarians,
including members of the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, 11 lawmakers from the opposition parties in
parliament became turncoats in Thursday's vote by supporting Prime
Minister Videnov and his Socialist government.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the vote was 135-99 in favor of the incumbent
government.
</P>
<P>
Most politicians reasoned that the existing cabinet should not
be held responsible for all of the accumulative crisis of economy.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties tabled the no-confidence motion in
Videnov's 18-month-old cabinet following a financial crisis which
has seen the Bulgarian currency of lev plummeting to record lows
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
A severe supply shortage of bread caused by excessive exports
of wheat last year at a time of high world grain prices has
aggravated economic uncertainty in this agricultural country.
</P>
<P>
In late May, the government has had to hike taxes for wines,
alcohol and tobacco products as well as for gasoline and diesel
oil.
</P>
<P>
The Videnov government also prepared to shut down scores of
loss-making state enterprises involving layoff of some 40,000
workers and close several insolvent banks in a bid to win crucial
loans from international financial institutions including the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
These measures have sparked protests in Sofia and some other
cities, where trade unions have thrown their weight behind
opposition calls for early parliamentary elections though the
current parliament's mandate runs until 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other foreign financial institutions are expected
to approve loans to Bulgaria in response to Videnov's austerity
measures.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reshuffled his cabinet last week to make it
more effective and more united behind his reform programs.
</P>
<P>
After surviving the third vote of no-confidence, Videnov told
the parliament that its decision showed common sense and national
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"With your support and the confidence of international
institutions, we have the political will and responsibility to
take the first steps (of reforms)," the prime minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Venezuela and
Bolivia today exchanged documents to put into effect an agreement
to control, prevent and punish the abuse and trafficking of
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in April 1992, commits the two nations to
expand cooperation against drug abuse and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Deputy Foreign Minister Milos Alcalay and Bolivian
Ambassador to Venezuela Guillermo Aponte Burela presided over the
exchange-of-documents ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Alcalay stressed the need to establish international mechanisms
to combat the drug scourge, which he said "destroys the moral
values of society."
</P>
<P>
He said that the war against drugs could not be waged by
individual countries alone but should be coordinated by law
enforcement agencies at the regional level.
</P>
<P>
The campaign must target both drug producers and consumers, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Bolivian Ambassador Aponte Burela praised the spirit of
cooperation between the two countries and expressed his
government's readiness to cooperate in the fight against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He said it was unfair that drug-producing countries should bear
the burden of responsibility in the anti-drug campaign since the
big consumer countries provided the demand and the money that
enriched organized crime.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Court Orders Arrest of Rebel General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A Paraguayan court today
ordered today the arrest of retired General Lino Cesar Oviedo who
has been charged with leading a rebellion in April.
</P>
<P>
Reports received from Asuncion, capital of Paraguay, said the
former army commander will be held at a military installation in
Capiata, 20 kilometers from Asuncion, after he is detained.
</P>
<P>
In April, Oviedo was asked by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy to resign as military chief but refused, sparking the
biggest political crisis in the country since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy offered Oviedo the post of defense minister as a
solution to the crisis. But the president revoked the appointment
on April 25 following fierce opposition from the public and
politicians who regarded it as a step backward in the South
American country's democratic process.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo, who formed his own political movement to contest the
1998 presidential elections, is campaigning in the central
department of San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
Last week, he accused Wasmosy of suggesting that he engineer a
coup to dissolve the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Judge Alcides Corbeta, who is hearing the case, said the arrest
warrant was based on a public statement the president made on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Wasmosy reiterated that Oviedo's refusal in
April to step down as army commander constituted rebellion and
caused a serious crisis in the Paraguayan democratic process.

BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Education Ministry is
expected to issue lottery tickets soon to raise money to subsidize
its career development fund, the local press said here today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has approved the proposal of the Education
Ministry, which hopes to collect 616 million baht (24.6 million US
dollars) from the lottery sales in eight draws.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will use 60 million baht (2.4 million US dollars)
of the funds raised to fill its career development fund, a
ten-year program designed to help 45,000 children in the country.
</P>
<P>
The career development fund, targeting children who fail to
obtain loans from the ministry's low-interest educational fund,
will be used in the establishment of scholarships in vocational
education and short-term job-training.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism that the lottery might encourage
public gamble, officials from the ministry said the priority of
the fund-raising plan is to help children get a good education.

BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Laos are expected to
sign an avoidance of double taxation agreement in the middle of
next month, according to Revenue Department Director-General
Suchart Javisida.
</P>
<P>
The agreement applying to personal income tax, would help
promote bilateral trade and investment, Suchart was quoted today

</P>
<P>
Essentially, Thai businessmen in Laos would not have to pay
income tax to their own country if the tax paid in Laos was higher
than what they would have paid in Thailand. If the rate is lower
in Laos, they would pay the balance to the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
Suchart said details of the draft agreement were to be
forwarded to the cabinet for endorsement on Tuesday, so that the
agreement can be signed next month in Laos by Thai Finance
Minister Bodi Chunnananda.

BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- COM DEV, a wireless communication
equipment maker from canada, plans to unveil a joint venture in
Xi'an, capital of the northern Shanxi Province next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The venture, COM DEV Xi'an (CDX), involves one million US
dollar in total investment whose products will be the first space
technology joint venture ever in China, and it will include
microwave filters, multiplexers for the satellite, space-qualified
microwave ferrite, waveguide switches for ground stations,
microwave components and etc, for communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
O'Donovan, the venture's president, said that he is encouraged
by the news that China will resume commercial satellite launching
next month.
</P>
<P>
China intends to build 16 new satellite system by 2000, to
improve telecommunications infrastructure and the monotoring of
natural resources. Roughly half of the total will be
communications satellites and the rest for remote sensing and
meteorological use, according to industrial sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the country will probably need two or three times as
many satellites as planned, to meet the growth in wireless
telecommunications demand, with some likely to be procured from
abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
And CDX should be able to win significant contracts to supply
components for these foreign manufactured satellites because
foreign satellite prime contractors will be required to maximum
local content, O'Donovan said.

NANNING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- With controlled exploitation and
protection of fishery resources, aquatic industry in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, south China, has undergone rapid
expansion during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Total production of the region's aquatic products in 1995
reached 1.01 million tons, 5.3 times that of 1985, and the
per-capita share of aquatic products was higher than national
level.
</P>
<P>
The fishing industry has become a pillar sector for the local
economy, with aquatic production reaching 7.1 billion yuan (854
million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, comprehensive fishery processing has developed so
much that the aquatic products are far more competitive on
international markets.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the autonomous region earned more than 50 million US
dollars from aquatic products, six times that of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, fishery management departments at various levels in
the region have been making efforts during the past decade to
raise awareness about the need to protect fishery resources.

<HEADLINE> ICRC: Humanitarian Situation in Yugoslavia Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Humanitarian situation in
Yugoslavia is worse than six months ago due to reduction of
international aid to refugees, officials of three humanitarian
organizations have said.
</P>
<P>
This was stated at a joint press conference held here today by
representatives of the Yugoslav Red Cross, the International
Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Red Cross Secretary-General Rade Dubajic said that the
Red Cross was assisting more than 500,000 users but the
international humanitarian aid was based on an assessment that
there were between 300,000 and 400,0000 users in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav government has said the country is housing and feeding
670,000 refugees from Bosnia and Croatia, but the international
humanitarian organizations believe the refugee number stands
around 450,000.
</P>
<P>
International humanitarian organizations sent to Yugoslavia
5,400 tons of aid per month in 1994, 3,789 tons per month in 1995
and the total of 4,761 tons in the first four months of 1996, thus
making the humanitarian situation in Yugoslavia went from bad to
worse, Dubajic explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the Yugoslav Red Cross had done well in assisting
hundreds of thousands of refugees in the past six months,
primarily due to its good cooperation with the IFRC and ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing head of the IFRC delegation to Yugoslavia Jean Ayoub
said the IFRC had invested about 100 Billion Swiss francs through
different programs in Yugoslavia in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The IFRC has requested another 35 million German marks and has
secured half of the amount for its 1996 programs of assistance to
410,000 refugees and 30,000 needy people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is making a new registration of refugees in the
country so as to provide the ICRC an accurate figure of refugees.
</P>
<P>
"If the registration of refugees in Yugoslavia shows that their
number is larger, the IFRC will call for an increase of funds," he
said.

Wang began to study diabetes with other doctors in 1984 and
invented a TCM capsule, which was especially effective for
diabetes. He went to Xiamen, a city facing Taiwan across the
strait, and began to use acupuncture and moxibustion along with
the capsules to treat diabetes patients.
</P>
<P>
Wang has so far treated more than 30,000 patients, with an
effective improvement rate of 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
He has been to the Philippines, Hong Kong and other countries
and regions to publicize the prevention and treatment of diabetes.

<HEADLINE> Poland Offers New Incentives to Private Enterprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Poland is offering favorable tax
treatment and technological assistance to small and medium-sized
enterprises to help them develop faster.
</P>
<P>
The country's 2.1 million small and medium-sized companies
already employ more than 50 percent of the country's labor force
and generate about 75 percent of the national revenue, according
to figures cited in local newspapers,
</P>
<P>
But their development has been hindered by old-fashioned
equipment, outdated technology and a lack of funds, the newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage their growth, the Polish government has
promised to reduce and even exempt from taxes small and
medium-sized enterprises which invest in risk-prone regions and
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Start-up operators of such companies will be allowed to
postpone payment of personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
The government has also promised to establish an information
network for small and medium-sized enterprises which will be fed
and run by legislators, scientists and raw materials suppliers.
</P>
<P>
A new law is being drafted to simplify procedures for small and
medium-sized enterprises to purchase new equipment.
</P>
<P>
The government has budgeted 45 million zlotys (about 16.2
million U.S. dollars) to guarantee bank loans to small and
medium-sized enterprises which will enable them to upgrade and
purchase equipment and to improve the competitiveness of their
products.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 80 percent of the country's small and medium-sized
enterprises employ from one to five workers and 44 percent of them
are in the service sector. Only 14 percent are in the
manufacturing sector.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria and Kenya Dominate Second Day at African Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, Cameroon, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian and Kenyan
athletes dominated the second day competition of the 10th African
Athletics Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria excelled in their favourite sprints, with Seun Ogunkoya
braving thrashing rain to claim the 100m title and lead his team
to four golds, while Kenya made mincemeat of their middle-distance
opposition, taking the 1,500m and 3,000m steeplechase and going
close in the 400.
</P>
<P>
Ogunkoya, an 18-year-old just out of school whose personal best
stands at a respectable 10.05, took advantage of the absence of
Nigeria's elite runners to skate home in 10.45 seconds, ahead of
Cameroon champion Benjamin Sirimov, at 10.54.
</P>
<P>
Glory Alozie added another gold for Nigeria in the women's
100m hurdles (13.62) ahead of South African Lana Uys while Saidat
Onanuga made it three over 400m (52.85).
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's fourth gold came in the 4x100m.

<HEADLINE> UK Post Workers to Stage 24-Hour National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The first national postal strike in
Britain for nearly a decade will start next Thursday evening, when
Royal Mail delivery and sorting staff begin a 24-hour stoppage,
the Communication Workers' Union announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the union Thursday after another round
of talks with Royal Mail management failed to produce a
breakthrough in an 11-month dispute over hours, pay and working
practices.
</P>
<P>
Further negotiations are scheduled for next Monday, but neither
side held out much hope of avoiding at least a one-day stoppage by
nearly 140,000 postal workers, beginning with the Thursday night
shift.
</P>
<P>
Richard Dykes, managing director of Royal Mail, said that he
was very disappointed with the strike decision. Royal Mail had
added 25 million pounds (38 million U.S. dollars) to its package in
the last few days, taking it up to 100 million pounds (150 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We have significantly improved our offer and we are astonished
that the union's only response is to threaten to hurt customers
with a totally unnecessary strike," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Alan Johnson, joint general secretary of the union, said
that he had informed Royal Mail about the strike "with the
greatest reluctance," and for many of the union members, a one-day
strike was the only way they could get a five-day week out of
Royal Mail.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Karamchemie GmbH (KCH) is
scheduled to begin its investment in China with a joint venture to
produce anti-corrosion materials in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Possessing the world's latest anti-corrosion technology, KCH
will join a company here to form the Wuhan KCH Anti-corrosion
Engineering Co., Ltd., funding 51 percent of the total 13 million
deutsche marks of investment.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will import advanced technology from Germany
to mainly produce anti-corrosion materials, especially plastic
anti-corrosion lining, which China has to import from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Once in operation, the joint venture is expected to generate
300 million yuan in annual output value.
</P>
<P>
In addition, KCH plans to join three more projects in China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the establishment of the joint venture, KCH provided
products to some of China's iron and steel complexes, such as the
Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and the Baoshan Steel Company in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Corrosion annually causes 20 billion to 40 billion yuan-worth
of economic losses in China.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Situation in Yugoslavia Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation in
Yugoslavia is worse than six months ago due to the reduction of
international aid to refugees.
</P>
<P>
Tration of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
tional humanitarian aid was based on an assessment that
there were between 300,000 and 400,0000 users in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government has said the country is housing and
feeding 670,000 refugees from Bosnia and Croatia, but the
international humanitarian organizations believe the number of
refugees stands around 450,000.
</P>
<P>
International humanitarian organizations sent to Yugoslavia
5,400 tons of aid per month in 1994, 3,789 tons per month in 1995
and 4,761 tons in the first four months of 1996, and the
humanitarian situation in Yugoslavia went from bad to worse,
Dubajic explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the Yugoslav Red Cross had done well in assisting
hundreds of thousands of refugees in the past six months,
primarily due to its good cooperation with the IFRC and the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing head of the IFRC delegation to Yugoslavia Jean Ayoub
said the IFRC had invested about 100 Billion Swiss francs through
different programs in Yugoslavia in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The IFRC has requested another 35 million German marks and has
secured half of the amount for its 1996 programs of assistance to
410,000 refugees and 30,000 needy people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is making a new registration of refugees in the
country so as to provide the ICRC with an accurate figure of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"If the registration of refugees in Yugoslavia shows that their
number is larger, the IFRC will call for an increase of funds," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Reinforces Anti-disaster System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province's farming area in
northwest China has invested more than 3.31 million yuan to repair
damaged anti-disaster projects, in an effort to greatly increase
its capability to deal with potential natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the famous Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the "roof of the
world", Qinghai ranks among the provinces which are most
vulnerable to disasters such as floods, snow storms and drought.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government attaches great importance to
publicity on anti-adversity knowledge among its people, and spares
no effort in upgrading the province's anti-disaster facilities.
</P>
<P>
The farming area in the eastern part of the province invested
1.85 million yuan in last year alone to support three state-level
anti-disaster teams in a move to provide effective service to
local residents in the event of possible disasters.
</P>
<P>
To date, an advanced weather forecasting network has been
introduced in the province, offering scientific, accurate and
urgent information for the province's anti-disaster activities to
serve agriculture and animal husbandry.

<HEADLINE> UN Receives Donation from Chinese Pupil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretariat
received this week 10 yuan in donation from a Chinese pupil living
in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy spokesman Ahmad Fawzi today read a letter by the
pupil to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The letter begins with "Dear Grandfather Ghali," a Chinese way
of addressing a respected elder man.
</P>
<P>
"I am a pupil of Grade 4. Recently, I am worried about the U.N.
financial crisis after I knew from Chinese TV news. I know that if
the U.N. doesn't have enough money, its routine work couldn't be
done smoothly and you could not fulfill the duty as the
secretary-general. Here I would like to contribute 10 yuan RMB to
the United Nations to express a Chinese pupil's wish for world
peace," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The pupil told Boutros-Ghali that he got the money from selling
things of no use to him and said it is a pity that the United
States and some other countries delayed paying their membership
fees.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the United Nations does its duty for world peace, human
advancement and development. The Chinese people who love peace
will support the U.N.'s work," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi said it was the first individual contribution from China
ever since the United Nations was plunged into a deeper financial
situation this year. He thanked the pupil on behalf the
secretary-general. The pupil did not leave his name on the letter.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation has been in a deeper financial crisis this
year. Although China and other 70 countries have paid up all their
dues of the current year, the situation remains precarious, simply
because the United States delays a large amount of dues. Among the
2.7 billion U.S. dollars owed to the world organization, the
United States accounts for more than a half.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns Against Continued Human Rights Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokesperson in Belgrade
Susan Manuel said today that despite efforts to implement the
Dayton accords, human rights were still violated in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, she mentioned the intimidation
and harassment of the remaining Serbs in the former Serb parts of
Sarajevo, problems relating to refugees' attempts to return to
their hometowns now held by other ethnics, the bombing of Serb
homes in the area of Sanski Most and pressure on opposition
parties in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, Sarajevo was handed over to the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation on March 19. Most Serb residents
left the affected areas but a few thousand Serbs remained in the
city and they were reportedly harassed and intimidated by the
Muslims who moved into the areas after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the fear of being arrested and accused of war
crimes in the territory of the other entity was hindering free
movement and such problems led to the conclusion that ethnic
division in those areas was more important than human rights and
the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The international community has said free movement is one of
the key conditions for a fair and free election slated in
September in Bosnia. Other conditions include mass repatriation of
refugees, arrest and trial of indicted war criminals, and freedom
of speech and association.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) Marwan Elkhoury told reporters that there were problems in
the movement and the return of refugees due to a lack of
cooperation with all authorities in Bosnia and due to a lack of
facilities available to the returnees.
</P>
<P>
Elkhoury said that the UNHCR would appeal to the international
community to create conditions for the return of 185,000 refugees,
which will cost 183 million U.S. dollars, including the expenses
for the reconstruction of facilities and infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> US Big Three Auto Makers to Increase Output in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Big Three auto makers of the
United States are planning to increase their production of light
vehicles later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that some industry
experts predict that the car companies are counting on the car
sales to continue running at strong levels. Therefore, they are
likely to add more vehicles to their third-quarter production
schedules.
</P>
<P>
The industry is operating with relatively lean inventories.
That's good news for the economy, because continued high levels of
industrial production are likely to offset the negative effects of
rising debt levels, economists say.
</P>
<P>
The three companies of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have
laid out plans to manufacture 2,532,100 cars and light trucks in
the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter, up from 2,439,400 units
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler set a 2 percent increase. Ford planned to increase
10.1 percent of its third quarter output. General Motors set plans
to match the output of the 1995 third quarter as the company is
undergoing extensive plant retooling for new models.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Beats Italy 2-1 in Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy's high flying hopes in the
European Soccer Championship suffered a dramatic set-back today
when the runner-up of the U.S. World Cup was defeated 1-2 by
unfancied Czech Republic in a thrilling group C match held at
Anfield Stadium, Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
The Czech team, which was defeated by Germany at an openig
match of the group, unleashed a powerful blow to the star-studded
Italian team by scoring a surprising opener at the 4th minute by
mid-fielder Pavel Nedved.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, full of confidence, launched waves of
counterattacks and talented young player Enrico Chiesa hit a
equliaser 14 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
However, the recovering situation suddenly became clouded when
defender Luigi Apollini was sent off for a second bookable offence
against Czech players.
</P>
<P>
Radek Bejbl, the Czech full back, restored the Czechs' lead at
the 35 minute by sending a volley into the goalmouth of the
Italian side.
</P>
<P>
The Italy-10 nearly dominated the second half of the match, but
unfortunately the Italian players, too eager to equalize, were
unable to calm down and find their normal attacking pace.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate effort to turn the tables, Italian coach Arrigo
Sacchi sent Pierluiqi Casiraghi, the hero to hit a double in a
match against Russia, onto the frontline, but Casiraghi was unable
to grab a great chance to equalize at the dying seconds of the
match.
</P>
<P>
Italy, which was once the second favourite to win the Euro
soccer tournament, is now the fourth favourites behind Germany,
France and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In group D clash between Portugal and Turkey held in Nttingham
this afternoon, the talented Portugeses players failed to dominate
the match, but its well-known full-back Fernando Couto moved from
back to break the deadlock by hitting thrilling volley home with
his left foot at the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish team had started the match brightly and played a
surprising even hand with their strong opponents, but the
inexperienced Turkish forgot the shooting boots at home and wasted
quite a few golden chances to score a goal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Portugese coach Antoio Olivera said,
"we deserve to win. They made it difficult for us physically and
psychologically but on the positive side we created a lot of
chances."

<HEADLINE> UN Condemns Iraq's New Non-Compliance Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (xinhua) -- The Security Council today
condemned the failure of Iraq to comply with Resolution 1060 of
June 12, 1996 by refusing access to sites designated by the U.N.
Special Commission on June 13.
</P>
<P>
"Coming after the denial of access on June 11 and 12, this new
dimension of non-compliance marks a serious step backwards in
Iraq's cooperation with the Special Commission," said Nabil A.
Elaraby of Egypt, president of the Security Council for June.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, he said that the council
considered that these events constitute a clear and flagrant
violation of its resolutions 687 (1991), 707 (1991) and 715
(1991).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its full support for the
Special Commission in the conduct of its inspections and the other
tasks entrusted to it by the council. The council rejected
attempts by Iraq to impose conditions on the conduct of
inspections by the Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council demanded once again that Iraq comply with
the relevant resolutions of the council, and in particular, allow
the inspection teams of the Special Commission immediate,
unconditional and restricted access to any and all areas,
facilities, equipment, records and means of transportation which
they wish to inspect.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Invites Ekeus to Solve Standoff with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi senior official has
invited Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), and representatives of Security Council permanent
members to Baghdad to supervise the inspection of sites to which
U.N. inspectors are still denied access.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said here today that Iraqi
permanent representative to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoun has been
instructed to hand over his letter to Ekeus, and copies of
invitation have also been sent to this month's president of the
Security Council from Egypt, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that the UNSCOM should first give
details of its doubts over the materials or documents which they
believe the barred sites contain. Copies of the same details
should be handed over to both permanent and non-permanent members
of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ekeus himself should lead a team for inspection in
Iraq and they can stay as long as they desire and carry out as
many inspections as they need.
</P>
<P>
For those sensitive sites related to Iraq's national security,
Aziz noted that Ekeus will be accompanied by him together with
three representatives from both the U.N. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the team will follow the procedures laid down by
the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that Ekeus must present a detailed and clear
report on the findings at the conclusion of the inspection.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy Premier Lashes out at UNSCOM Chairman, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said today that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM), is intentional to escalate
the current crisis between Iraq and the U.N. by asking to inspect
two other Republican Guards sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency
that the two Republican Guards sites which Ekeus has chosen for
inspection are also related to the National Security Council of
Iraq. Baghdad usually allows U.N. inspection team to investigate
other sites than the Republican Guards site, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He accused Ekeus of coordinating with the U.S. and Britain by
providing pretexts to deliberately escalate the tension between
the UNSCOM and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz reiterated Iraq's demand for a special mission
representing permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to be
directly involved in the ongoing U.N. inspection operation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, he said, should not allow a single
person, namely the UNSCOM chairman, to specify the fate of a whole
people.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Baghdad hides any U.N.-prohibited weapons,
saying that by implementing para 22 of U.N. resolution 687, Iraq
has fulfilled its essential obligations toward the weapons file
and the U.N. should immediately remove the sanctions imposed
on the country following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister expressed Iraq's desire to fully
cooperate with the Security Council. Iraq wants the Security
Council to directly know the fact that there are no prohibited
things in Iraqi sites as what the UNSCOM chairman has alleged, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the U.N. inspectors are still barred from entering
the Republican Guards sites in Baghdad. Confrontation between the
Iraqi government and the U.N. inspection team has intensified for
a fourth day. Iraq remains defiant despite a fresh U.N. resolution
which demands Iraq allow unconditionally access to any sites
the U.N. inspectors want.
