<HEADLINE> China Lost to Sweden in World Table Tennis Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China lost to Sweden 2-3
in the men's final of the 45th World Team Table Tennis
Championships at Putra Stadium here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Jorgen Persson, the 1991 world singles champion, clinched the
winning point when he fought back gallantly from a game down to
beat current world champion Liu Guoliang 18-21, 21-17, 21-18 when
the score level was tied up at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Sweden stunned the 10,000-odd crowds when Jan-Ove Waldner
defeated Guoliang and Persson outclassed world number two Kong
Linghui in two games.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, 34, recovered from a slow start as he beat Guoliang 19-
21, 21-7, 23-21 in 32 minutes with Persson easily wrapped up his
encounter with Kong Linghui, who made numerous unforced errors 21-
17, 21-19 in 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, China's third player Liu Guozheng played steadily to
reduce the gap to 1-2 when he outwitted Peter Karlsson 21-6, 21-16
in 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Kong Linghui then levelled the score as he overcame a tired
Waldner 21-9, 21-17 in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The match of the day went to the fifth tie with Persson playing
Liu Guoliang who looked set to seal the 13th victory for China
when he forced Persson to make mistakes and took the opening game
21-18 in 12 minutes after leading 20-15.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Persson then led 15-10 in the second game but
Liu Guoliang levelled it to 15-all with his own services. Liu
Guoliang then sent the ball out three times and to the net two
times for Persson to wrap up the game 21-17 in 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the championship's decider, Persson and Liu Guoliang played
cautiously as they drew level at two-all, three-all and four-all
before the Chinese world number three raced to 12-9.
</P>
<P>
Both players looked tense but Persson's mental looked strong as
he played cautiously with a neck-to-neck score of 12-all, 13-all,
14-all, 15-all and 16-all before he collected two more points to
lead 18-17.
</P>
<P>
He allowed Liu Guoliang to grab another point in the closely
contest match before getting three points in a row with the
winning point coming after Liu Gualiang's return went out.
</P>
<P>
"I have been in the sport for many years as a coach and player.
This is the happiest moment in my career. The team is not only
good but they also have a strong fighting spirit," said Swedish
chief coach Ulf Carlsson.
</P>
<P>
"When we took a 2-0 lead, the pressure is on the Chinese team
because they are the world champions. But, when the score level,
the match is a lot of nerves but exciting. To win against China,
you must have a strong team in the deciding match. You see, when
there were down 2-0, they fought back and this show that how good
they are," added Carlsson.

<HEADLINE> Federal Solution to Cyprus Issue Desirable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) --
Representatives from the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities on Cyprus met Sunday within the
framework of their efforts to promote
rapprochement and called for a settlement of the
Cyprus issue through a federal formula.
</P>
<P>
They met in the Pyla village in the Lanarca
district, south of the island, which is inhabited
by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Such a meeting
is rarely seen as Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash banned Turkish Cypriots from attending
most bicommunal meetings two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Members from both Cyprus' main opposition AKEL
party and Turkish Cypriot Patriotic Unity Movement
expressed the hope that the Cyprus issue would be
resolved through a federal formula, the Cyprus
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
AKEL parliamentary spokesman Andreas Christou
said the event aimed at accelerating
communications and rapprochement, removing
distrust, and cementing the efforts to bring the
two communities together so as to restore their
good ties and a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Izzet Izcan, general secretary of the Movement,
said that his Movement believes that maintaining
the unity of the country and its territorial
integrity is essential and a federal solution
which is based on political equality of the two
communities, a bizonal bicommunal solution is the
only way out at the moment.
</P>
<P>
He said "we will carry on with confidence
building measures to help our communities on both
sides to come together and to show the world that
people can come together, work together and live
together."
</P>
<P>
There are differences between the two
communities and "this is the only way to work them
out and bring peace to our country, which is all
of Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for a compromise," he said,
adding that "we cannot stick to the past."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then the United Nations has been trying
to reunify the tiny island country through a
bizonal, bicommunal federation formula.

<HEADLINE> Report on Deployment of Pro-Israel SLA in Cyprus Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cypriots have
rejected an Israeli press report on deployment of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanese Army (SLA) militias in the Turkish Cypriots-
dominated north Cyprus, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tahsin Ertugruloglu, a senior Turkish Cypriot official, said
over the weekend that the allegation was "ridiculous and baseless".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Turkish Cypriots-controled part
and a Greek Cypriots-dominated part since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the mediterranean island
in the wake of an aborted pro-Athens military coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The news was totally groundless, said Ertugruloglu. "Here is a
democratic and open land. Events take place in the eyes of
everybody."
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv-based Hebrew newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, published
a report claiming that the SLA militiamen and their families would
be deployed in the Turkish Cypriots-controled northern part of
Cyprus after Israeli troops withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ever since he took office last year, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has repeatedly declared to pull the Israeli forces out of Lebanon
in the year 2000, unilaterally if needed. Deployment of the SLA men
would be one of the issues that need to be solved under such a
scenario.

<HEADLINE> Minor Quakes Jolt Turkey Over Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- While aftershocks continue after
two strong earthquakes devastating west Turkey last year, minor
quakes shook other regions of the country over the weekend,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Kandilli Observatory and
Seismology Center of Bogazici University in Istanbul, four quakes,
which were 4.4, 4.0, 3.8 and 4.2 degrees on Richter scale
respectively, occurred in the Turkey-Iraq border region Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, four tremors measuring 4.0, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.1 degrees
respectively on Richter scale shook other places across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four aftershocks were registered in west Turkey in
the two consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is an earthquake-prone country known to be standing on
the Eurasia faults. In 1999, the country was visited by a 7.4-
magnitude earthquake on August 17 and then a 7.2-magnitude tremor
on November 12, both in west Turkey. Altogether 18,000 people were
killed and more than 43,000 injured. The property losses were
estimated at 20 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> 33 Bus Passengers Die in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three Zimbabweans died
and an unknown number missing after a bus was swept downstream
Friday when the driver tried to cross the flooded Mudzi river,
police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the bus was
going to Rwenya, about 15 kilometers from Nyamapanda on the
northeastern border.
</P>
<P>
"When they approached the Mudzi River Bridge, the river was in
floods and the driver decided to stop briefly until the water
subsided," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However when a bus from another company crossed safely, the
passengers in the bus and those who had disembarked from the first
bus urged the driver to drive across. Unfortunately the
Chawasarira bus was swept away," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said so far 33 bodies had been recovered and 27 of these had
been identified.
</P>
<P>
There were 18 survivors from the accident, including the
driver. The conductor did not survive, making it impossible to
determine the number of passengers who had been in the bus.
</P>
<P>
Bvudzijena said passengers from the first bus who had
disembarked out of fear of their bus being swept away, had also
jumped into the Chawasarira bus as it made its fateful attempt.
</P>
<P>
Bus drivers have on numerous occasions been warned not to
attempt to cross flooded rivers, but these warnings have fallen on
deaf ears which has resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives.

<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The Dubai government has set an ambitious target to
turn the emirate into an international center for business and
investments by drawing up a 2000-2010 development plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan focused on diversifying the emirate's economic basis,
improving production capacity by providing skilled work force and
creating favorable climate for investments, said a report by the
Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
</P>
<P>
Dubai's population will rise to 1.2 million in the year 2005
against an estimated 906,000 this year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the processing industries sector will
need an investment of 3.2 million U.S. dollars in the coming years,
the water and electricity sector 1.6 million dollars, the
communications sector 4.6 million dollars, 1.4 million dollars for
the trade sector and 1.1 million dollars for other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dubai government is expecting an annual growth
rate
in the gross domestic product (GDP) of some 5 percent, a growth
rate of 6.9 percent in non-oil sectors and an increase of
contribution of
the non-oil sectors to the GDP to 88.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government has finalized the public
budget for the fiscal year 2000-2001 which was projected at 110
billion Egyptian pounds (31.88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, top priority was given to those projects for
social development and the biggest part of resources will come from
revenues of the oil sector, the Suez Canal and expanded tax
collection.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget did not levy new taxes on people with low or
medium income.

DAMASCUS -- Syria produced 3,000 tons of dates in 1999. Date,
which has 22 types in the country, is grown on an area of 700
hectares in the central province of Tadmor and 293 hectares in Bu-
Kamal.
</P>
<P>
Syria has 176,000 date palms 70,000 out of which are yielding
ones at present.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Agriculture Ministry attaches great importance to
growing dates and it has set up four centers for breeding date
palms which serve as genetic mothers for different locally-produced
and imported breeds. The centers sort out the high quality types
that best suit the Syrian climate, said sources of the Farming
Affairs
Department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The General Organization for Seed Breeding built a laboratory
for breeding date palms and has imported 10,000 saplings of the
best types, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Highlights Egypt's Role in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Justice Minister
Yossi Beilin said here Sunday that Egypt is a pillar of the Middle
East peace process whose national interest requires peace making in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was working for peace and his
frequent meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were part
of his efforts in the pursuit of peace, Beilin told reporters after
meeting with Mubarak in the day.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak would meet with other leaders in the region
soon in a bid to move forward the stalled peace process and make
parties concerned understand each other in a better way, he added.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak was optimistic at the possibility of
overcoming the current difficulties within the coming months, said
the minister. The leaders in the region are generally willing to
see peace prevailing in the Middle East and are well aware of the
price involved, he said, indicating that the Arabs are ready to pay
the price, but not any price.
</P>
<P>
Although the Arabs are feeling down about the deadlocked peace
talks, said Beilin, they understand that the chances for making
peace are still there and they are willing to grasp the chances.
</P>
<P>
There is no more time to waste and the atmosphere has to change
as soon as possible to break the impasse in the peace talks on the
Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the provocative statements recently made by
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Lebanon, Beilin said what is
important is peace and not talk.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said he has known Levy for years as a man committed to
peace even after he became a member of the hardline Likud party
because he voted for peace many times, adding that as a foreign
minister he should adhere to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that Levy's remarks that Israeli soldiers
would leave Lebanon in less than 130 days, were not acceptable and
did not come at the right time.
</P>
<P>
Levy, addressing the Knesset (parliament)last week, threatened
to make Beirut pay "blood for blood, soul for soul, child for
child" if Israel was attacked from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beilin added that Israel was not concerned with labelling the
Lebanese Hezbollah as a group of freedom fighters or terrorists and
that his country was giving top priority now to closing this file.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's repeated talks about the importance of peacemaking
without taking genuine steps, Beilin said that a line should be
drawn between the situation in the Palestinian self-rule areas and
that in Lebanon because bombing Lebanon is not a goal in itself and
Israel is ready to get out of Lebanon as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated what Israel had been claiming that it
was ready to pull out of the agreed-upon 6.1 percent from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is committed to working for peace, he
said, and it wants to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue this
year.
</P>
<P>
The two parties know each other well and are willing to foot the
bill even if one or the other party was a bit intransigent on a
given point, he added.
</P>
<P>
On peace with Syria, he said Israel is ready to pay the price
for peace with Syria and is also ready to pull out of Lebanon and
reach a settlement with the Palestinians. But this did not mean
that it would meet all the Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are negotiating out of mutual appreciation and the
desire to reach a final solution quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a role to play in the peace talks and the confidence-
building, Beilin said, adding that President Mubarak also has a
role in boosting peace prospects and bridging the gap in viewpoints
of the parties concerned, he said, voicing hope that hurdles could
be overcome.
</P>
<P>
The returns of peacemaking in 2000 will be high in the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis want to reach a compromise with the Palestinians
and there is no adamant position on the 6.1 percent land transfer
and the two sides could reach an agreement though the 1993 Oslo
accord did not require such an agreement on handing over lands, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said that a final solution is more important than the 6.1
percent which was only part of the interim phase.

<HEADLINE> Barak Admits No Certainty of Agreement on Lebanon Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak admitted Sunday that there is no certainty that Israel will
reach a deal with Syria and Lebanon before the promised deadline
for Israeli troops withdrawal from south Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks at a special cabinet session on Israel's
Lebanon policy, which was the first thorough cabinet debate on the
issue since the current government came to power nearly eight
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The ministers focused their debate on Barak's proposal to bring
Israeli soldiers based in the Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south
Lebanon back home by July 7 "with or without an agreement" with
Lebanon and Syria, the main foreign power broker in Lebanon,
according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Barak reaffirmed that the pullout from Lebanon will serve
Israel's national interests in the long run and therefore, Israel
should go back to its international border with Lebanon and defend
its northern territory from there.
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncertainty of an agreement, Barak also expressed
the hope that the withdrawal could be carried out under a peace
deal in hand, saying that the door to the negotiations with Syria
and Lebanon is still open.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet debate, held at the request of Transport Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, was still going on after several hours of
discussions in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The lengthy meeting, which was scheduled to last more than eight
hours, will give every minister a chance to express his or her
opinion toward the pullout plan.
</P>
<P>
Israel unilaterally set up a buffer zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a self-declared purpose of protecting its northern border
areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli army has encountered fierce resistence in the
zone from Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah since
then, which has claimed at least 200 lives of Israel soldiers.
</P>
<P>
To turn the trend, Barak promised to bring his soldiers back
home by July 7 this year, a year after he was elected prime
minister. He expected that the withdrawal will strip Syria's last
card on the negotiation table, and then lead to a permanent peace
agreement with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed their peace talks last December after a
45-month deadlock, however, the talks hit a snag again earlier this
year only after two rounds due to differences over Israel's
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which it seized from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The recent flare-up of fighting between Israeli troops and
Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon and the Israeli bombing of
Lebanese civilain targets in the past few weeks have dashed hopes
that Israel and Lebanon can reach a peace agreement in July.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock in the Syrian and Lebanese peace tracks had made
some military experts worry that a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli
army will be a catastrophic retreat in disorder, accompanied by "
convulsions" and clashes in the course of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barak will ask Sunday's cabinet meeting to
declare that the government is determined to withdraw the Israel
Defense Forces from Lebanon with an agreement, but will reassess
the situation in two months.

<HEADLINE> Barak: U.S. Wants Israeli-Syrian Deal by May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that U.S. President Bill Clinton wants Israel and
Syria to reach a peace agreement by May, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks at a weekly cabinet meeting, the first
thorough cabinet debate of its kind on Israel's Lebanon policy
after the current government came to power nearly eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
Linking the Israeli troops pullout from Lebanon with peace
contacts with Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, Barak said
the political clock of President Clinton was ticking and the
American leader wanted an Israeli-Syrian peace deal by May.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the ardent sponsor of the Middle East peace process,
will hesitate to make any major political efforts to revive the
process in the second half of this year, when the U.S. 2000
presidential campaign gets into a white heat, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president is reportedly eager to ensure
comprehensive peace in the region before then in order to turn his
farewell party into a victory celebration and lay the carpet to the
award ceremony of a Nobel Peace Prize at his feet.
</P>
<P>
Barak made another surprise announcement during Sunday's cabinet
discussions that Yitzhak Rabin, when he was prime minister,
signaled to Americans that Israel would withdraw from the Golan
Heights to the June 4, 1967 lines under certain conditions. Israel
used to deny that Rabin had ever made such an oral promise.
</P>
<P>
Barak also told his ministers that the secret contacts with
Syria conducted by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government through U.S. businessman Ron Lauder, were also under the
assumption of the withdrawal position.
</P>
<P>
Barak stressed that the door to the negotiation with Syria and
Lebanon is still open. He hinted Israel regards Syria's promises on
security arrangements, normalization, demilitarization and the
solution to water issue as "certain conditions".
</P>
<P>
These remarks made some analysts speculate that Barak will
concede to Syria's demand for a written promise about Golan Heights
withdrawal before their negotiations could resume.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resumed last December after a
45-month break, hit a snag again earlier this year only after two
rounds of talks due to differences over Israeli troops withdrawal
form the Golan Heights, which was occupied by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel's public pledge to a full withdrawal
to the June 4, 1967 borders. But Israel insisted on discussion of
security arrangements and normalization of bilateral ties first.
</P>
<P>
The focus of Sunday's cabinet meeting was Barak's proposal to
bring Israeli soldiers in the Israeli-occupied buffer zone in South
Lebanon back home by July 7 "with or without an agreement" with
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The lengthy meeting, held at the request of Transport Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, gave every minister a chance to express his or
her opinion toward the pullout plan.
</P>
<P>
Barak reaffirmed during his two-hour briefing that the pullout
from Lebanon will ensure Israel's national interests in the long
run and therefore, Israel should go back to its international
border with Lebanon and defend its northern territory from there.
</P>
<P>
But some ministers expressed their worries about a unilateral
withdrawal without an agreement, which according to some military
experts will be a catastrophic retreat in disorder, accompanied
by "convulsions" and clashes in the course of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
After more than six hours, the meeting ended with no decisions
announced. It is reported that the deliberations would continue
next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel unilaterally set up a buffer zone in South Lebanon in
1985 with a self-declared purpose of protecting its northern border
areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli army had encountered fierce fightback in the
zone from Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah since
then, which left at least 200 deaths of Israel soldiers.
</P>
<P>
To turn the trend, Barak promised to bring his soldier back home
by July 7, a year after he was elected prime minister. He expected
the pullout will cancel Syria's last card on the negotiation table,
and then lead to a permanent peace agreement with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent flare-up of fighting between Israeli
soldiers and Hezbollah guerrillas in South Lebanon and Israel's
bombing of Lebanese civilian targets in the past few weeks have
dashed hopes that Israel and Lebanon can reach a peace agreement
before July.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Stresses Traditional Rulers' Role in Social Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice President Atiku
Abubakar has called on the nation's traditional rulers to ensure
the peaceful co- existence among the diverse ethnic groups in
their domains, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Calling them custodians of the country's unique culture, he
said in Lafia traditional ruler's domain in central Nigeria's
Nassarawa State that " what has happened in Kaduna State is
something to be condemned by all decent human beings".
</P>
<P>
About 300 people died in last week's clash between Christians
and Moslems in the country's northern city Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
The NAN quoted Abubakar as saying in a turbaning ceremony
performed by the Emir of Lafia, Assarawa State, at which the
Nassarawa State's Governor Alhaji Adamu presented the traditional
ruler with the staff of office.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that irrespective of their ethnic differences and
religious background, Nigerians should live with each other in
peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Senate President Chuba Okadigbo and Speaker of the
House of Representatives Alhaji Na'abba were among the guests to
attend the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Floods in Southern Mozambique Continue to Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Flooding in the city of
Xai-Xai, capital of the southern Mozambican Province of Gaza, has
continued to worsen over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday morning, according to Radio Mozambique, the flood
waters of the Limpopo river had split the city in two, cutting off
the main commercial part of Xai-Xai from the higher part of the
city.
</P>
<P>
The city is without electricity because the floods have swamped
the Xai- Xai power station. The lack of power makes it impossible
to work electric pumps, and so shortly the city will run out of
fresh water as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those who had ignored earlier appeals from the
provincial authorities to leave the low-lying part of the city
were trying frantically to leave Xai-Xai on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A new flood peak is moving down the river. On Saturday night
this new wall of water hit the town of Chokwe on the middle
Limpopo.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that this new flood wave could bring the height of
the river at Chokwe to over 10 metres. This would be two metres
higher than the highest level the Limpopo reached during the
massive floods of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Much of the population of Chokwe had already left the town
during the flooding early this mouth. Some of those who declined
to leave then are now making their way to the town of Macia, some
50 kilometers south-west, and one of the parts of the province not
affected by floods.

"Pakistani troops are not involved in any such action and no

<HEADLINE> Indian Corporation Takes Over British Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DElHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- In the biggest-ever deal in
Indian corporate history, Tata Tea Limited (TTL) has bought out
all the brands of British Tetley Tea for 271 million pounds
sterlings (some 434 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of the worldwide Tetley tea business, which is
twice the size of Tata Tea, a branch company of the Tata Group,
represents the largest cross-border takeover of an international
brand by an Indian company.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed on Saturday night in Mumbai, 1,
400 kilometers southwest of New Delhi, TTL would, through a 100
percent subsidiary in Britain, make a formal offer for acquiring
all the shareholding of the Tetley group, the Press Trust of India
(PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The takeover includes the private label tea business in the
United States but excludes its coffee business there, which was
recently sold by the existing shareholders separately.
</P>
<P>
Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata reportedly said at the signing
ceremony that it was a momentous occasion for the Tatas as this
was the largest ever acquisition by an Indian company abroad in
terms of acquiring an international brand.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Tetley, which has an annual sales of some
439 million dollars, will be financed with 70 million pound
sterlings of equity, of which 60 million pound sterlings would
come from TTL and 10 million pound sterlings will be from Tata Tea
Inc., a Tata subsidiary based in New York.
</P>
<P>
TTL vice chairman R K Krishna Kumar said the debt component of
20 million pound sterlings would be raised through instruments
like subordinate vendor loan notes and debt offerings arranged by
Rabo Bank, which acted as the financial and strategic advisor as
well as sole lead manager for this transaction.
</P>
<P>
Kumar estimated that the combined turnover of Tetley and Tata
would be at 28 to 29 billion rupees (some 651 to 674 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tetley had a market share of 22 percent in the United Kingdom
while it was the number two in the U.S. market with a share of 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
The deal took a long time as the huge process of due diligence
had to be completed, he said, adding the venture capitalists had
sold the coffee business only on February three.

Thursday that the attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas on Israeli
occupation troops in southern Lebanon were "terrorist acts".

He said that France's attitude toward Israel and Arab countries

STOCKHOLM -- Columns of ash started to spew from Iceland's most
active volcano Hekla at about 1715 GMT Saturday in its first
eruption for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, lava began to flow from Hekla at a speed of 10 to
15 kilometers an hour, which is 150 kilometers southeast of the
capital Reykjavik. According to an Icelandic radio station, up to
early Sunday morning, the lava had already flowed over 10
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As there are few people living around the volcano, the eruption
would pose no danger to life and property, but the smoke and ash
from the eruption have caused difficulty for people living in
farther areas. (Iceland-Vocano-Eruption)

<P>
HARBIN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Wang Hong, a 36-year-old farmer,
lost nearly 16 pounds after a six-hour operation to removed a
basketball-sized cyst in her abdomen.
</P>
<P>
The cyst weighed 7,250 grams, was 40 centimeters long, 30
centimeters wide and 25 centimeters thick.
</P>
<P>
The enormous cyst filled up most of her abdominal cavity and
had caused her internal organs to shift from their natural
positions.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said Wang is in good condition and will leave the
hospital in a week.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the cyst has been growing for at least three
years. She was told by a doctor in a small hospital that she was
pregnant. When the pain became unbearable, she sought medical
treatment in an armed police hospital.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guolin, vice-president of the hospital, said he did not
exclude the possibility that the cyst has been forming in Wang's
belly since she was a fetus.

<HEADLINE> China Removes Some Grain Strains from Price Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China will remove some
inferior grain strains from the State's price protection this year
in order to urge farmers to optimize their crop-growing mix and
produce more high-quality crops.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular released by the General Office of the
State Council, the grains affected include spring wheat in
northeast and north China, early indica rice in south China, and
wheat and corn in the Yangtze River valley and regions south of
the river.
</P>
<P>
The circular said the adjustment is of great importance to
improving the distribution of China's grain production and
protecting farmers' long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
It will also spur farmers to grow other varieties of grain or
cash crops and increase their income, said the circular.
</P>
<P>
Local grain processing enterprises are allowed to purchase
grains directly, and farmers are encourage to sell their produce
on wholesale and retail markets. The grain markets will be open
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
Market management should be strengthened to prevent illegal
grain purchase, added the circular. The Agricultural Development
Bank of China will offer loans for grain purchase and sale
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has been purchasing
farmers' surplus grain output at protective prices, aiming to help
them maintain their grain production capacity. The latest move to
narrow the scope of price protection came at a time when the
country has had ample grain supply in the last few years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Call for Enhanced Leadership Over State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
Vice Premier Wu Bangguo have called on the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) to strengthen its leadership over the country's key State-
owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
In his message to today's meeting of the CPC Central Committee
Working Committee of Enterprises, Zhu asked the committee to make
further studies of the new situation and problems and establish a
more effective system to carry out the party's work in key SOEs.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance the party's leadership over State-owned enterprises
is an urgent need for the enterprises' reform and development,"
said Wu, also secretary of the working committee.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that the Party be given a more visible role in
the enterprises so as to ensure their smooth reform and
development, Wu told the meeting, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu listed four aspects of work that should receive more
attention in enhancing and improving the party's leadership over
the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the party's leadership must be strengthened; this
is a key element that should never be compromised, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Second, more should be done to improve management in key SOEs.
It is vital that managers who have both ability and integrity be
selected according to the party's criteria.
</P>
<P>
Third, it is imperative that the anti-corruption battle be
intensified and that leaders of enterprises be honest and clean.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the supervisory system in the enterprises should be
further improved.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier noted that this is the last of the three years
during which the SOEs are required to meet the reform targets,
including money-losing SOEs getting out of the red.
</P>
<P>
The key SOEs that are directly supervised by the State Council
should set a good example in the reform. Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Revealing Truth of Nanjing Massacre Gets Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A former Japanese soldier
determined to tell the truth about the war crimes committed by
Japanese troops in Nanjing in 1937 today won strong support from a
crowd of experts who have researched the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Local historians, teachers, legal professionals, and some
survivors of the massacre held a symposium today to express
support for Azuma Shiro, who published his wartime diary to reveal
the atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers during the slaughter
in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese Supreme Court has denied Shiro's appeal
in which he sought to acknowledge the history of the invasion of
China.
</P>
<P>
"The astonishing results (of the trial) have taught us that we
must never relax our vigilance against Japan's militarism," said
Gao Xingzu, an expert on the massacre, in which about 300,000
innocent Chinese were murdered.
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Hall to Victims of the Nanjing Massacre and a
Japan-based committee to support Azuma Shiro will co-publish a
three-volume set of the full text of the diary, along with photos
and articles denouncing Japanese right-wing activists who attempt
to deny the massacre occurred, it was announced at the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The hall also received some copies of an Osaka newspaper, which
covered the massacre from December, 1937, to January, 1938.
</P>
<P>
The 88-year-old former soldier left Nanjing for Beijing tonight
to continue his tour of China, his sixth since 1987. He told the
symposium audience he will fight against Japan's right-wing forces
until he wins.

<HEADLINE> Resistance Against Occupation is People's Legitimate Right: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said it is the legitimate right of the people to resist occupiers,
the official Middle East News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Germany's Der Spiegel magazine to be
published Monday, Mubarak noted that Lebanese Hezbollah group is
fighting Israeli occupation and that the Israeli soldiers killed
in the Israeli-occupied zone were in Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed by Lebanese guerrillas
in South Lebanon since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak criticized Israel for "making a fuss" over his recent
visit to Lebanon and accused the Jewish state of trying to turn the
United States against Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak visited Lebanon on February 19, the first-ever visit by
an Egyptian president, after Egypt expressed concern about the
stalemate in the Middle East peace process and support for Lebanon
following the large-scale Israeli air raids against Lebanese
civilian targets on February 8.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Lebanon was aimed only to show support to the
Lebanese "who are feeling that they are alone in the ring," Mubarak
said.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that Israel's continued bombing of Lebanon,
which has injured dozens of civilians and devastated three power
plants in Lebanon, has further diminished its credibility.
</P>
<P>
However, Mubarak ruled out the possibility of another war in the
Middle East region, while he cautioned that if peace was not
achieved, the region would be more vulnerable to violence.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to "stop his
circumventions and manoeuvres" and take brave decisions to withdraw
from the Golan Heights it seized from Syria in 1967, saying that "
peace will benefit it more than war."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak noted that the Middle East peace process would not be
settled unless the Palestinian issue, the center piece of Arab-
Israeli conflict, is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Although Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, they
have been keeping what many analysts called "cold peace."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks U.S. to Stop Meddling in Others'  Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR , February 27 (Xinhua) Malaysia asks the
United States to stop behaving like the world's policeman and to
stay out of other countries' internal affairs, according to the
local daily "The Sun" Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"They should stay out of other countries' internal affairs and
stop passing judgment on others," Minister in the Prime Minister's
Department Rais Yatim was quoted as saying in response to the US
State Department's annual report on global human rights abuse,
which reportedly criticized Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "They should instead look at their own
backyard first as the number of human rights violations in the US
itself is horrendous.
</P>
<P>
"The rampant human rights violations taking place in the Bronx
area in New York, for example, were never told to the world...so
before meddling in other people's affairs, they should look into
theirs first," the minister told the daily.
</P>
<P>
Rais said every country has its own set of sovereign laws and
therefore, the US should not pass judgment.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there is not one system in the world which
is above criticism, the minister said Malaysia has prospered under
its own democratic governance.
</P>
<P>
He said "I urge the State Department to stay out of our
internal affairs because we are surely not going to submit to its
judgment."
</P>
<P>
The State Department's report reportedly stated that Anwar
Ibrahim's case was "indicative of human rights violations in that
country". Anwar who was former Deputy Prime Minister and sacked in
September 1998 were sentenced to six-years' imprisonment for
corrupt practices.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Grant Aid to Control Iodine Deficiency in  Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grant assistance will be used for supplying 130 metric tons
of potassium iodate, and training, monitoring and evaluation of
the project in collaboration with Bangladesh Small and Cottage
Industries Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by iodine
deficiency disorders in the world. To overcome this problem,
Bangladesh started implementing CIDD in 1990 with the assistance
of UNICEF by universal iodization of salt in all salt factories
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Control of iodine deficiency and disorders has proved to be the
most cost-effective and successful public health program in
Bangladesh.Preliminary data from national survey indicated a
steady reduction in number of population at risk, with low iodine
level down from 69 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in 1999.

NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- British driver Richard Burns
took the title at Kenya's 47th Safari Rally on Sunday, followed by
defeating runner-up Juha Kankkunen of Finland in four minutes, 37
seconds in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Didier Auriol of France was third in the three-day race across
central Kenya, trailing 22:44 behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
Burns, driving a Subaru Impreza WRC, led Kankkunen, also
driving an Impreza, by 4:55 entering the final day of the 2,691-
kilometer race.
</P>
<P>
Only few of the original 46 starters raced in Saturday's field.
Fourteen vehicles withdrew, including defending champion Colin
McRae and Marcus Gronholm, who were forced out with transmission
problems.
</P>
<P>
The rally is third in the 14 series of World Championship
circuit and counts for both drivers and manufacturers awards.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya race began in 1953 to celebrate the coronation of
Queen Elizabeth II, when Kenya was still a British colony.

<HEADLINE> First Sci-fi Copyright Infringement Case Reported in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China may permanently stop the
presses at a literary magazine that has pirated the copyright of a
science fiction periodical.
</P>
<P>
This is the first case of copyright infringement of science
fiction in China, where the genre has long been controversial.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bo, an official with the State Press and Publications
Administration, told Xinhua that Hebei-based Popular Literature
magazine will be possibly closed down, because it published
stories and photos carried by Science Fiction World, the country's
most renowned sci-fi periodical and a winner of the World's Best
Sci-Fi Magazine award issued by the World Sci-Fi Organization.
</P>
<P>
Internet chat rooms are buzzing with discussions about the
unusual case, as science fiction was taboo here until just a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, it was regarded as "spiritual pollution" and "
pseudoscience" and was banned from publishing, while science
fiction writers were looked down upon by others.
</P>
<P>
Official newspapers criticized some sci-fi stories, saying
their detailed predictions of gloom for the future "could possibly
lead to chaos and social instability."
</P>
<P>
Sci-fi did not stage a comeback until the mid-1990s, when
Chinese authorities stressed that science and man's imagination
are vital for the nation's creativity and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's national university entrance exam used
science fiction as the theme in the essay writing portion of the
test, causing a tremendous reaction in society, saying that this
is helpful to fostering students' imagination.
</P>
<P>
"Piracy is to be condemned, but this case does show that
science fiction is for the first time widely accepted in China
which had for 5,000 years seen imagination and free thinking as a
threat," said sci-fi writer Zheng Jun.
</P>
<P>
He said the case demonstrates that China is changing from a
traditional society into a modern one and that people are paying
more attention to the future than the past.
</P>
<P>
Sci-fi, a genre of literature mainly exploring change and the
future, is considered to be a product of the industrial revolution
in Western countries.

<HEADLINE> China Investigated Wrongdoing of 700 Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorial bodies
in charge of anti-corruption and supervision over law enforcement
have stepped up efforts in wiping out corruption from within their
own ranks.
</P>
<P>
Last year 694 prosecutors involved in 606 cases were
investigated for wrongdoing by disciplinary and supervision
departments of people's procuratorates across the country, the
Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) said today.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on disciplinary and supervision work held
by the SPP was told that investigations have been concluded for 88.
6 percent of the cases, in which 544 prosecutors were given
disciplinary punishment, 55 went to trial and 73 were criticized
and required to be educated.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ke, head of the working group of the Central Commission
for Disciplinary Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party
stationed in the SPP, delivered a work report at today's
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that "procuratorates cross the country have seen a
pleasing turn for the better in aspects of honesty, self-
discipline, and fair and rigorous enforcement of the law thanks to
the power of political and ideological education."
</P>
<P>
Following a new rule that the head of a procuratorate will be
held responsible for corruption cases uncovered in his work unit,
top prosecutors in eight provinces were ordered to Beijing to
criticize their own mistakes in 1999, and 33 other regional
prosecutors reviewed their responsibilities to offices at higher
levels.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-nine heads of procuratorates across the country were
investigated and affixed for their responsibilities in 79 cases,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He told disciplinary bodies of procuratorates to intensify
their supervision over officials, especially heads of
procuratorates, law enforcement procedures, appointments and
replacements, financial accounts of prosecution offices and off-
duty activities of prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan, ROK Agree on More Cooperation in Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The environment ministers of
China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) issued a joint
communique here today, outlining their future priority areas of
regional cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The communique, signed today by the ministers at the end of a
two-day meeting, said the three countries will strengthen their
cooperation in environmental protection projects at both regional
and international levels.
</P>
<P>
The ministers have already considered proposals for
cooperation in publicity campaigns to raise public awareness about
environmental problems, for projects involving prevention of fresh
water pollution and land-based marine pollution, and cooperation
among the environmental industry.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) of China, Kayoko Shimizu, director-general
of Japan's Environment Agency, and Kim Myung-Ja, ROK environment
minister, commended the efforts of the three countries in
promoting the ongoing joint projects, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Included are the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East
Asia, and the three countries' joint research project on Long-
range Transportation of Air Pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The document also calls for cooperation between the three
countries in habitat conservation and restoration of damaged
ecosystems so as to protect bio-diversity and better manage
sustainable water resources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the second after the first one held in Seoul last
year, aimed at carrying out the environmental protection
agreements reached during separate summit meetings between the
three countries in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Leader Demands Apology from French PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Lebanese
Hezbollah on Sunday demanded that French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin apologize for branding guerrilla attacks against Israeli
occupation troops as "terrorist" acts.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naem Kassem said
Jospin should make an apology if he wants to visit Lebanon in the
future since he has become persona non grata for his "obvious
insult against the resistance movement and the Lebanese people."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he acclaimed the demonstration staged by Palestinian
students during Jospin's visit to the Birzeit University in the
West Bank city of Ramallah on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 students, angered by Jospin's remarks about Hezbollah
resistance, confronted the French premier and hurled stones at him
when he was leaving the campus after addressing the university
teachers and student representative.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat condemned the attack and
ordered the university to be closed for three days.
</P>
<P>
Kassam said the Palestinian students regarded Jospin's remarks
as hostile and inconsistent with the French claimed policy of
supporting Lebanese sovereignty and the French role in the
committee overseeing conflicts between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee, grouping representatives from the United States,
France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was formed in August 1996 under
the understanding reached between Hezbollah and Israel after a
massive Israeli attacks on Lebanon, killing 200 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, on the second day of his four-day visit in Jerusalem,
said Thursday "France condemns Hezbollah's attacks, and all types
of terrorist attacks which may be carried out against soldiers or
possibly Israel's civilian population."
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the remarks, Hezbollah issued a statement Friday
accusing that Jospin's stance was hostile, racist and went against
the French principles and French interests in the Middle East
region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is
spearheading Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation of
southern Lebanese border areas where Israel carved out a buffer
zone with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Christians in Nigeria's northern
state of Kuduna, where religious conflicts took a death toll of
some 300 last week, Saturday called upon the federal government to
spilt the state into two.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Sunday quoted
Archbishop Peter Jatau, Chairman of the 19 Northern States
Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), as saying that "my candid
appeal to President Olusegun Obasanjo is to create a new Kaduna."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any other way for the solution of
Kaduna problem, " the religious leader said.
</P>
<P>
Jatau told a federal government delegation responsible for
investigating last week's havoc that Kaduna state, where
Christians and Moslems are almost evenly divided, has seen too
many unfortunate accidents.
</P>
<P>
He cited the examples of the Kafanchan riot in 1987, Zango
Kataf crisis in 1992, Jema'a emir installation in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The federal delegation, consisting of Nigeria's Minister of
Internal Affairs Sunday Afolabi, Minister of State for Education
Alhaji Batagarawa, Minister of Women Affairs Ayeshatu Ismail and
Minister of Solid Mineral Development Alhaji Gwadabe, is currently
in an opinion listening process in Kaduna state before giving
suggestions to President Obasanjo.

<HEADLINE> Russian General: Chechen Gunmen to Be Destroyed Shortly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian commander said
Sunday that only 1 percent of Chechen territory are still
controlled by the rebels who will be destroyed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The federal troops are regrouping to give "the last and
decisive battle to gunmen and to destroy the last bandit hiding in
the mountains" of the breakaway republic, said Gennady Troshev,
deputy commander of the United Army Group in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the federal forces were facing major obstacles
in fighting the rebels as the Argun gorge, where most militants
were concentrated, is a fortified area.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 militants, together with their ringleaders, were
surrounded in several towns and villages near the Argun gorge.
Despite the fortified defense, moral was low among the rebels,
Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the proximity between the federal troops and the
rebels, air strikes will be suspended shortly to avoid harming
friendly forces, while trench mortar, machine guns and rockets
will be used instead, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In Argun, Commander Vladimir Bulgakov of the Northern Army
Group in the North Caucasus also confirmed plans to seize the
gorge in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"The task of federal troops is to wipe out all bandits in the
mountains, and this task will be settled in the near future," Tass
quoted Bulgakov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating fierce resistance by the rebels, Bulgakov warned
his troops of "fierce battles in store."
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign against the Chechen
rebels last September shortly after two waves of armed Chechen
incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate of terrorist
bombings, also blamed on the Chechen militants, which killed some
300 people in Moscow and two other cities in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities said some 1,500 federal troops have died in
the military campaign against the rebels, which is said to be
popular among the Russians.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Columns of ash started to
spew from Iceland's most active volcano Hekla at about 1715 GMT
Saturday in its first eruption for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, lava began to flow from Hekla at a speed of 10 to
15 kilometers an hour , which is 150 kilometers southeast of the
capital Reykjavik. According to an Icelandic radio station, up to
early Sunday morning, the lava had already flowed over 10
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As there are few people living around the volcano, the eruption
would pose no danger to life and property, but the smoke and ash
from the eruption have caused difficulty for people living in
farther areas.
</P>
<P>
Disregarding government warning about not to going too close to
Hekla, many local residents, especially residents from Reykjavik,
drove on Saturday night to enjoy the rare wintry landscape of fire
against the snowy background.
</P>
<P>
Hekla has erupted over 20 times since the 11th century, and its
last eruption was in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Turkey Open Talks on Trade, Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Muhammad Rashid and visiting Turkish State Minister Edip Safter
Gaydali held talks here Sunday on trade and economic ties, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Rashid stressed that the visit of the 200-
member Turkish delegation headed by Gaydali, which arrived here on
Saturday, reflects the depth of bilateral trade and economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We will exert much efforts to establish distinguished relations
between the two countries," said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gaydali affirmed Turkey's readiness to ensure
needs of the Iraqi market within the framework of the United
Nations oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited
amount of oil to buy humanitarian goods under U.N. supervision for
its people.
</P>
<P>
He extended gratitude for the assistance Iraq offered to the
victims of two major earthquakes striking Turkey last year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the U.N. trade embargo imposed on Iraq
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait would be lifted as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Gaydali was here to attend the 12th session of the Iraqi-Turkish
Joint Committee for Trade, Economic and Technological Cooperation.
The last session was held in Baghdad in April, 1997.
</P>
<P>
During his seven-day visit, Gaydali will discuss with Iraqi
officials ways of strengthening cooperation, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, the Turkish minister told INA that due to the 10-
year-old trade embargo, Turkey has lost 30 billion U.S. dollars in
trade with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq and Turkey have not been able to implement a
deal signed in 1997, under which a 1,100-kilometer-long pipeline
worth 2 billion dollars should be laid to transfer 10 billion cubic
meters of Iraqi gas to Turkey annually.
</P>
<P>
During the previous six phases of the oil-for-food program,
Turkish companies got 477 million dollars worth of contracts to
provide Iraq with detergents, medical appliances, equipment and
various spare parts, and ranked the ninth largest exporter to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, political relations have remained cool between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long criticized Turkey for allowing the United States
and British war planes to use its bases to patrol the northern no-
fly zone set up after the 1991 Gulf War with the so-called aim of
preventing Iraqi government troops from attacking the Kurds in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the two no-fly zones, the other one in
southern Iraq set up by the U.S.-led western allies allegedly to
protect the Shiite Muslims, as they were not authorized by the U.N.
Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Occupational Disease: Biggest Health Threat to Chinese Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Occupational diseases have
become the biggest threat to workers' health as well as the
leading cause of early retirement due to disability, according to
the Ministry of Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
A MOH official today warned that the development boom of
private and township enterprises would make the situation even
worse because the general job safety requirements are often
limited in those enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"It's very common in some areas that plant owners sacrifice
workers' health for making more money," Vice Health Minister Yin
Dakui said, though he stressed that most State-owned enterprises
have effectively controlled occupational hazards.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics from the MOH showed that pneumoconiosis
or black lung, a deadly illness occurring among miners, has preyed
upon at least 420,000 workers and killed about 130,000. About 15,
000 to 20,000 new cases are reported each year.
</P>
<P>
Accidental poisoning commonly reported in shoe-making and
garment factories was another leading killer, claiming several
hundred lives every year, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
He urged some 30,000 professionals involved in supervision and
prevention of occupational hazards to enhance their law
enforcement in their work.
</P>
<P>
The country's highest legislative body will discuss a draft law
on prevention of occupational disease, giving laborers a more
powerful legal weapon for protecting their health, he said.

HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A huge commercial cum office
complex has gradually emerged at Kai Tak, Hong Kong's old airport

</P>
<P>
To date, about 20,000 square meters in the former Passenger

management.
</P>
<P>
"Managing Kai Tak and putting it to good use is a new challenge
to us. It is such a vast place, covering some 246 hectares," said
Albert Lai Kwok-ying, a government property administrator.
</P>
<P>
"The land and hangars located to the northwest were required
for new development right away. The runway, the main apron areas
and the Passenger Terminal Building are not required for
development immediately. These have to be put to positive
temporary uses."
</P>
<P>
The Territory Development Department has been carrying out
decontamination and other jobs to pave the way to new housing. The
Lands Department looks after the land involved and has turned part
of the runway into a golf driving range.
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying to make use of these premises for
government offices or commercial purposes, as far as possible,"
Lai explained.
</P>
<P>
The former departure hall in the Passenger Terminal Building
now accommodates Hong Kong's largest bowling center and a car show.
</P>
<P>
The bowling center, which is now in trial operation, is
situated in the middle of the hall. The car show is adjacent. Both
are operated by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Part of the former hangar of the Government Flying Service (GFS)
is rented to a private helicopter company to do maintenance and
repairing.
</P>
<P>
"We are like a middleman, matching suitable users with
available properties with the aim of deriving the greatest
possible benefits from the former airport before its ultimate
redevelopment," Lai stressed.
</P>
<P>
The airport site will be redeveloped around 2004. By that time,
Kai Tak will have another new face.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Paper Rebukes Jospin's Controversial Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper of Syria's ruling
Baath Arab Socialist Party on Sunday commented on the statements
made by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, accusing them of
triggering a violent shock throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The daily Baath pointed out that the statements are
contradicting the balanced moderate foreign policy France has been
adopting towards the Middle East and are regarded as a violation of
principles in international relations.
</P>
<P>
In statements made during his visit to Israel, Jospin described
the attacks launched by Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon to
end Israeli occupation there as "terrorist" acts.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian paper said that Jospin took an entirely biased
attitude in favor of Israel and denied Lebanon's legitimate right
in resisting and fighting against the Israeli forces occupying
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that Jospin forgot the fact that he represented
a great country which has always sought to adopt positive positions
in supporting the legitimate rights of countries and nations.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Ministry on Saturday summoned the French
ambassador in Damascus to protest against Jospin's controversial
statements, and ask for official clarifications.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Afghan Plane Passengers to Be Deported From London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Almost all the 79 remaining
passengers of the hijacked Afghan plane, which landed at a London
airport earlier this month, are to be deported after their
applications for asylum were found to be bogus.
</P>
<P>
The British government will make such an announcement within
the next two days, The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
That decision is expected to meet protests from refugee
organizations and is certain to face legal challenges which will
prolong the passengers' stay in Britain for at least another month,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
But a Home Office official said that Home Secretary Jack Straw
might be seen to be encouraging hijacking if he allowed the 79
passengers to stay.
</P>
<P>
It was suspected that some of the passengers were involved in
the hijack, as many of them were carrying an unusually large
amount of luggage for what was ostensibly an internal flight.
</P>
<P>
An Afghanistan Ariana Boeing 727 plane was forced to fly to
London's Stansted airport on February 7. The hijack later ended
peacefully when the hijackers surrendered after a four-day stand-
off.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 men, 14 women and 28 children under 16 asked for
asylum following the hijack, claiming that they would face
persecution if they were sent back to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people have appeared in a court, charged with
hijacking the plane and seventy-two others have already flown back
to Afghanistan.

<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Reza Ardakan on
Saturday voiced Tehran's readiness to provide the Gulf states with
more than 2 billion cubic meters of fresh water, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with officials of the World Water Council on the
sidelines of the "Water Security in the Arab World" conference in
Cairo, Ardakan also expressed Iran's interest in the transfer of
the experiences to other regional states, the Muslim countries in
particular.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Production of aluminum ingots during the current
Iranian year (ending on March 20) reached 138,000 tons, a four-fold
increase compared to 1980, the English-language Iran Daily reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This figure is expected to increase to 350,000 tons by the end
of the Third Economic Development Plan (2000-2005), an official
from the Mines and Metals Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Production of aluminum ingots in 1997 and 1998 was 95,000 tons
and 124,000 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
The official added that a new aluminum production unit with an
annual production capacity of 280,000 tons is in the final stages
and will go on stream next year.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has earned 600 million U.S. dollars from exports
of hand-woven carpets since the beginning of the current Iranian
calendar year, IRNA reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Iran Handcrafts Organization Abdulhamid
Khalili said Saturday night in Kermanshah, western Kermanshah
province, that the exports showed an increase of 68 percent
compared to the same period last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Khalili believed that the country's exports of hand-woven
carpets would reach 700 million dollars by the end of the current
Iranian year, adding that at present some 5 million people
throughout the country are professionally involved in carpet-
weaving industry.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey-Iraq Joint Economic Commission (JEC) will
convene in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad after a four-year interval,
the Anatolia News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish delegation is in Iraq to discuss ways to revitalize
the commercial relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Turkey and Iraq reached 3 billion dollars
before the 1990 Gulf Crisis caused by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The
figure dropped to 100 million dollars due to the United Nations
embargo on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Injured in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A militiaman of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was injured Sunday in a roadside bomb
attack by Lebanese guerrillas in the Israeli-occupied zone in
southern Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
claimed responsibility for the attack on the Khardaly bridge in the
eastern sector of the "security zone," which brought to 12 the
number of SLA members wounded in the region since the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the occupation zone
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been leading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli
troops and SLA militiamen from southern Lebanon, where Israel
carved out a buffer zone in 1985 with the claimed aim to protect
its northern territory.

<HEADLINE> Chirac: France's Mideast Policy Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Apparently trying to ward off
the controversy caused by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's remarks
in the Middle East, French President Jacques Chirac has stressed
that his country's Middle East policy remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the clarification in a telephone conversation with
Jospin on Saturday night after Jospin said in Jerusalem on
Thursday that the attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas on Israeli
occupation troops in southern Lebanon were "terrorist acts".
</P>
<P>
In the telephone conversation, Chirac said that France's
attitude toward Israel and Arab countries should be one of "
impartiality", said a communique released by the Elysee
presidential palace on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The head of state has reaffirmed the consistency of the
foreign policy of France and the balance which inspires the action
of our country in the Middle East," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's comment sparked fury among Arab countries and violent
protests ensued when he visited the University of Bir Zeit in the
Palestine-controlled West Bank on Saturday. Angry Palestinian
students threw stones at the French prime minister and jumped on
his bullet-proof Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused Jospin to cancel a scheduled visit to a
Palestinian refugee camp and a planned news conference at the end
of his three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Besides the diplomatic embarrassments in the Middle East,
Jospin's controversial remarks also ruffled up political feathers
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing politicians and the French press accused the
socialist prime minister of damaging France's image abroad by
trying to score political points against Chirac in the run up to
their battle for the French presidency in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Members of the socialist, green and communist parties defended
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
"This is disastrous for France's image. The prime minister has
made a serious slip," former right-wing prime minister Alain Juppe
told France 3 television.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Edouard Balladur, who shared power with
socialist President Francois Mitterrand from 1993 to 1995, told
LCI television it is vital for France to speak with one voice,
especially as France is taking over the rotating presidency of the
15-nation European Union in July.

<HEADLINE> China-Japan Trade Expected to Rise: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The two-way trade between
China and Japan is expected to continue its growth this year, the
China Daily Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Trade expert Xu Changwen told the weekly that he expects the
Sino-Japanese trade to reach 70 billion U.S. dollars this year, as
compared to 66.17 billion US dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained China's largest trading partner for seven
consecutive years last year. Both imports and exports recorded a
record high last year with China's imports from Japan jumping 19.4
percent to 33.77 billion U.S. dollars, and exports to Japan grew 9.
2 percent to hit 32.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The strong trade growth indicates that the two-way trade has
recovered from the impact of the Asian financial crisis which
drove the Sino-Japanese trade volume down to 57.9 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998 from 60.8 billion U.S. dollars in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the growth to the fast economic growth in
China and the recovery of Japanese economy as well as a strong
Japanese yen and a stable Chinese renminbi.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that he expects both Chinese and Japanese
economies to perform better this year, which will further fuel the
development of bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> 15 Health Contracts Blocked by U.S., Britain: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Minister Umid
Medhat Mubarak accused the United States and Britain of blocking
medical contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies under the oil-
for-food program, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to INA, Mubarak said the U.S. and British
delegates at the United Nations Sanctions Committee put on hold 15
health contracts last month.
</P>
<P>
The minister condemned that the conduct of Washington and London
represented "a war of genocide against the entire population of
Iraq and all peace-loving nations."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and Britain of impeding the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal by deliberately blocking
the approval of its contracts for purchasing humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Under the humanitarian program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil and use the revenues, under
U.N. supervision, to buy humanitarian goods for its people, who are
suffering from the decade-old sanctions imposed on the country in
1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Iraq's health ministry
recently, some 1.27 million children and elderly people died as a
result of the continuation of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
Saturday condemned the students who threw stones at and wounded
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin at Birzeit University as "
forces of darkness," and shut down the campus for three days.
</P>
<P>
Several students were arrested and will be prosecuted, West Bank
Preventive Security Service chief Jibril Rajoub told the Jerusalem
Post.
</P>
<P>
Jospin and his entourage were assaulted as they left an
auditorium of the hilltop campus near Ramallah following his speech
to students. The assailants were apparently protesting against
Jospin's calling Lebanese anti-Israel Hezbollah guerrillas as "
terrorists" in remarks last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Iran has provided Lebanon with Fajr rockets with a firing
range of up to 70 kilometers, putting Israel's Haifa bay area
within range of a direct hit from Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
The missiles have not been supplied to Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas, but are being maintained by Iranian militants stationed
in Lebanon as a strategic reserve in case of intensified military
conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The reality now facing Israel is that in the case of a
confrontation in which Fajr missiles are used, hundreds of
thousands of people living in the north of Israel, and not just
areas along the international border between Israel and Lebanon,
will have to seek refuge in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Defense Force is drawing a plan for withdrawal from
the Israeli-occupied buffer zone in South Lebanon unilaterally,
instead of seeking a withdrawal with peace agreement between
Israel, Lebanon and Syria, the major foreign power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the change. Barak
promised to bring Israel soldiers in the zone back home by July 7
this year. However, he had stressed several times in the past that
he believes negotiations with Beirut and Damascus will result in
peace agreements by then.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to summon his cabinet on Sunday to discuss the
situation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- During the weekend fighting between IDF and Hezbollah, Israel
Air Force was given permission to attack targets less than 100
meters away from a Lebanese civilian village.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time IDF implemented the new policy adopted by
the inner-circle security cabinet 10 days ago, which permitted IDF
to retaliate Hezbollah guerrillas hidden near populated areas.
</P>
<P>
These decisions, which will possibly cause great civilian
casualties, had earned severe criticisms from Arab countries and
even the United States, the major patron of Israel in the world
politics arena.

<HEADLINE> Six Indian Soldiers Reportedly Killed In Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- India said that Pakistan
attacked one of its early warning post on Sunday in Naushera
sector of the disputed Kashmir, killing at least six Indian
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Official sources at the Defense Ministry said here today that
the post, surrounded on three sides by Pakistani army positions
across the so-called line of control (LOC), was raided by
Pakistani forces at 0430 hours local time (1000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
While six Indian soldiers were killed in the raid, one junior
commissioned officer and one other rank were missing along with
their weapons, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The post has been used to monitor movement of Pakistani troops
and militants along the LOC in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, the losses on the Pakistani side
could not be immediately known.
</P>
<P>
This is reportedly the third major flare-up in the area in
recent weeks. Last month, 18 Pakistani soldiers were killed when
they tried to capture an Indian border post in an area adjacent to
Naushera, according to Indian media.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, five Pakistani soldiers and four Indian
army troops were reportedly killed during the fire exchange
between the two sides in Akhnoor sector of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, official sources here denied reports from Islamabad
that Indian troops crossed the LOC last Friday and killed at least
Pakistani civilians.

<HEADLINE> British Officials Own Land In Zimbabwe: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
resisting Zimbabwe's efforts to compulsorily acquire land for
re-distribution because some of its top officials, including its
Minister of State in the Foreign Office Peter Hain, owns land in
Zimbabwe, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Local Government and National Housing
John Nkomo, who is also the National Chairman of the ruling party
Zanu-pf, confirmed the reports, saying that he had personally
quizzed Hain over the issue.
</P>
<P>
There has been no comment from Hain yet. However, British
Deputy High Commissioner in Zimbabwe Ian Hay Campbell said he
needs enough time to verify whether there are any British top
officials who own land in the African country.
</P>
<P>
On whether the British constitution allows foreigners to own
land in Britain, the deputy high commissioner said, "In Britain
there is no existence of anything that you can genuinely call a
constitution as one can find in other countries."
</P>
<P>
According to Nkomo, after being quizzed, Hain responded by
urging the Zimbabwean government to be forward looking instead of
reverting back to history.
</P>
<P>
"I told him that the history he wanted us to forget had a
bearing on the present status quo and that we can only solve the
present problems by addressing the injustices of the past," Nkomo
said.
</P>
<P>
Without divulging any names, Nkomo said the British government
would be embarrassed if the top officials who own land in
Zimbabwe were to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
He said it was Hain who had written letters to the
International Monetary Fund instructing the institution not to
release any funds because of alleged "lack of democracy and human
rights abuses in Zimbabwe".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War
Veterans Association Chenjerai Hunzvi Saturday said in Harare that
his association is aware that there are some British top officials
who have farms in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the war veterans are going to grab all those farms
before the general elections in April because it is their
"birthright to own it".
</P>
<P>
"We are left with no option but to take all the farms whose
owners had gone to court to resist the acquisition," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's National Museum Damaged by Heavy Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains have destroyed
books and artifacts at the Livingstone Museum, Zambia's National
Museum, according to a report by the Sunday Times of Zambia
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the 50-year old two-storey building,
which has not had a major facelift since it was built, was last
week flooded with water leaking in through cracks on the roof and
walls after four days of continuous torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
The water, whiaccording to director Vincent Katenekwa, are priceless
assets because they do not have back up copies.
</P>
<P>
Several artifacts were also soaked and arrangements were being
made to have them moved to a drier building, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The most affected part is the library, we have had to move the
whole library to a smaller drier room, most of the old books and
valuable photographs need attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the leaking was compounded by the fact that the
structure had a flat roof which retained water after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
A rehabilitation project was planned in 1993 at a cost of
271,000 U.S. dollars but has since been gathering dust.
</P>
<P>
Located inside the Livingstone town, the Tourist capital of
Zambia in Southern Province, the national museum has exhibits that
record the complete history of human being in the couambia-Museum

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Not Allowed to Run For Third Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ruling party
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Saturday rejected proposals to amend the
Zanzibar constitution seeking to allow President Salmin Amour, a
CCM member, to run for an unprecedented third term, local media
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The CCM National Executive Committee (NEC), at the end of a
session in Tanzania's central city of Dodoma, resolved that
discussion on the possibility of amending the Zanzibar
constitution to allow for a third term of presidency will be done
after the forthcoming general elections slated for October.
</P>
<P>
The NEC has resolved to postpone discussions on proposals to
amend the Zanzibar constitution until some time after the
elections, CCM Secretary General Philip Mangula was quoted by the
Sunday Observer newspaper as saying after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
This means that Salmin is automatically disqualified from
running in this year's Zanzibar presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The NEC resolution came two days after heated debate by the
Central Committee of the NEC of CCM meeting here behind closed
doors from Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the island.
</P>
<P>
It is a semiautonomous state with its own government and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Salmin became Zanzibar President in 1990. He was reelected in
1995 after claiming a narrow victory over the opposition Civic
United Front party, which accused the then ruling CCM party of
rigging the elections.

LUSAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba met here Saturday with the dismissed doctors in a bid to
end the impasse at the country's biggest hospital and other major
ones caused by the doctors' striking in last December and January.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has called
for a meeting to review terms of reference of all lodge owners and
operators in Livingstone, a famous tourism city in the south of
the country, following persistent allegations of racism against
black tourists.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia quoted Acting Southern Province
Permanent Secretary Patrick Banda as saying that he will this week
hold a meeting with all the lodge and tour operators to resolve

</P>
<P>
Some tour operators have been accused of blocking blacks from

</P>
<P>
"Yes, I can confirm to you that we have been receiving numerous
 complaints about this segregation of who goes to this lodge and
who does not," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The accused tour operators are said to be advising would-be
black lodgers to make reservations through their overseas agents
when the lodges are not at full capacity, a move which has
frustrated the locals, according to the local newspaper.

<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
set staff establishment ceilings for all primary schools and
instructed districts to recruit teachers immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education and Sports has laid down a strict
timetable for the recruitment in order to enable the teachers to
get on to the payroll by May 10, the New Vision reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to ministry's timetable, all vacancies must be
advertised by the end of February and interviews are to be
conducted by the district service commissions beginning from
March 9 and letters of appointment issued before April 10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it stipulated that all the necessary documentation
of the recruitment should reach the Ministry of Public Service
before April 26.
</P>
<P>
The report said that total primary teaching staff has been set
at 101, 601 teachers for the expected more than six million
pupils.
</P>
<P>
Since the country launched the Universal Primary Education
(UPE) program in January 1997, pupil enrolment in primary schools
has more than doubled. Now every district across the country is
lack of primary school teachers and classrooms. The UPE program,
which provides free primary school education for four children in
each family, is aimed to reduce illiteracy rate and widespread
poverty. At president, more than 40 percent of the population is
still illiterate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, EU Trade Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade with
the European Union (EU) has been declining over the past 25 years
despite of the preferential trade instruments provided by the EU,
the Sunday Observer newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a EU-ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific)
trade report as saying that Tanzania's exports to the EU market
declined from 52.9 percent of its total exports in 1991 to 36.9
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tanzania's imports from the EU, which stood
at 31.3 percent in 1991, declined to 30.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to EU Economic Councilor for Tanzania Klaus Schmidt,
in 1990, the trade balance between Tanzania and the EU stood at
222.696 million euros while in 1998, this figure slumped to 62.899
million euros.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the imports from the EU to
Tanzania, which stood at 399.644 million euros in 1990, dropped to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Human Rights Record in 1999 (19) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1999, countless cases of the United States' violation of
human rights of other countries were reported.
</P>
<P>
In March 1999, over 400 Canadians, representing more than 1,000
victims of contaminated blood transfusions received from prisoners
in the U.S., filed a class action suit in a U.S. court for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that it was known as early as 1980 that blood
transfusions from prisoners, many of whom are gays and drug
addicts, might lead to AIDS, the United States continued to export
the plasma to Canada, Japan, Europe and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The practice has caused thousands of recipients to be infected
with AIDS, hepatitis C and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates show that the number of victims of the
tainted plasma in North America and Caribbean Region exceeded 10,
000.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, 1999, a Russian newspaper, Rossiiskaya Gazeta,
reported that after the attack on Pearl Harbor, over 120,000
Japanese-Americans were arrested without charges and held in
remote camps in desert areas.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Japanese-Americans were still in prison
at the end of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, 1999, Hong Kong-based newspaper the South China
Morning Post reported that during the Vietnam War, the United
States sprayed 42 million liters of bio-chemicals in non-military
zones in rural Vietnam, an act which still affects five million
Vietnamese and has left 600,000 seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
In early October 1999, American media such as the Associated
Press and Newsweek magazine, citing eyewitness accounts from
American veterans and survivors, reported that in July 1950, the
early period of the Korean War, U.S. troops massacred hundreds of
Korean refugees, including women and children, with machine-guns
in No Gun Ri.

<P>
According to An AP report on November 29, 1999, in the United
States, 14.5 million children - nearly one in five- experience
poverty. In 1998 11.1 million children younger than 18 had no
health insurance. And each year, three million American teens are
infected with AIDS, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.
And about 6.4 percent of the population at or under 12 use illegal
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The use of child labor is rampant in the United States. A 1997
survey based on federal government data found that 290,000
children were working illegally, 14,000 under 14 and some under
nine years old, according to an article carried by Reuters on July
14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are many children of migrant workers in the farming and
horticultural sectors, where between 400 and 600 were injured and
many killed annually in accidents, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Children are the leading victims of the culture of violence in
the United States. Many juvenile delinquents have learned to shoot
people with guns through seeing films and TV and playing computer
games which have violent and sexually explicit content.
</P>
<P>
A 1999 survey by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
showed that in 1997, 268 out of every 100,000 juveniles were
arrested for crimes involving violence, almost double the figure
of 1970. A report by the U.S. Department of Justice in June of
1999 said that among all gun-related murders, nearly one-fourth
were committed by young people between 18 to 20 years old, most of
whom were students.

According to a report released by Reuters on October 6, 1999,
an apartheid-era germ and chemical warfare campaign against blacks
in South Africa was based on a U.S. government biological and
chemical program.
</P>
<P>
On October 25, 1999, British weekly magazine New Statesman
quoted a new book about the U.S. and biological warfare by two
Canadian scholars as reporting that after World War II, the United
States secretly granted pardons to Japanese war criminals who
participated in human biochemical weapons experiments in China,
and used their experimental results to develop biochemical weapons
that they later used against China and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
U.S. human rights violations have shown no sign of decreasing
with the appearance of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
On January 13, 2000, Staff Sergeant Frank Ronghi, a U.S.
soldier with the Kosovo peacekeeping force, was arrested and
transferred to the U.S. army's central prison in Germany after he
allegedly sexually assaulted and murdered a 12-year-old Kosovo
girl.
</P>
<P>
Following the case of three U.S. soldiers who gang-raped a
Japanese girl in Okinawa in 1995, which triggered mass protests in
Japan, a rape attempt of a Japanese woman by a soldier of U.S.
navy in a dancing hall in Okinawa on January 14, 2000 is another
example of human rights violations by U.S. troops based in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States ranks first in military spending in the world,
with the 1999 total reaching 287.9 billion U.S. dollars, about 150
percent of the combined military expenditures of the European
Union, Japan, Russia and China that year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S military budget for 2000 is expected to reach 300
billion U.S. dollars, exceeding the record high of 291.1 billion U.
S. dollars in the mid-1980s, when the U.S. was conducting a "Star
Wars" program and a large-scale arms race against the Soviet Union.

<P>
The U.S. had been the world's biggest arms supplier for the
eighth consecutive year from 1991 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
With its powerful military strength, the U.S. has been using
its all military might to indulge in aggressive wars, violating
sovereignty and human rights of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. used its military force overseas more than 40 times in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, ignoring the international norms and bypassing the
United Nations Security Council, the U.S.-led NATO forces launched
78 days of air strikes against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia,
a war in the name of "avoiding humanitarian disaster," causing the
biggest humanitarian catastrophe in Europe since the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
During the war, U.S.-led NATO air forces completed 32,000
sorties and dropped 21,000 tons of bombs on Yugoslavia, equivalent
to four times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima,
Japan, by the United States during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The bombs used by U.S.-led NATO in their aggression against
Yugoslavia include cluster bombs, depleted uranium bombs and other
weapons banned by international laws, and newly-developed but more
destructive weapons such as electromagnetic pulse bombs and
graphite bombs.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 innocent civilians were killed and 6,000
injured in Yugoslavia during the air strikes, which also left
nearly one million people homeless and more than 2 million without
any sources of income.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale bombing paralyzed the manufacturing facilities
and infrastructure for daily life in Yugoslavia, which brought
about a 33 percent increase in unemployment and pushed 20 percent
of the whole population below the poverty line, leading to direct
economic losses of 600 billion U.S. dollars and producing lasting
and disastrous impact on the ecological environment of Yugoslavia
and Europe as a whole.

<P>
Worse still, NATO went so far as to bomb the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists and seriously
damaging the buildings of the embassy in a gross violation of
Chinese sovereignty and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also maintained a poor record in participating and
observing the international conventions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the only country other than Somalia that has not
yet joined the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and one of
the few countries that have not yet signed the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
</P>
<P>
It has been 23 years since the U.S. signed the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but it still has
not ratified the covenant.
</P>
<P>
The United States has refused to recognize the superiority of
international laws over its domestic laws, and has made numerous
statements and rationalizations regarding international
conventions on human rights according to its domestic laws.
</P>
<P>
As for the international conventions on human rights it has
ratified or joined, the U.S. federal government has simply let its
states go their own way and refused to meet the obligations to
implement them nationwide. It has even failed to hand in reports
of implementation on time as required, and has been ignoring the
criticism and comments from other organizations under the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The United States does not have a good human rights record of
its own, but likes to play the role of the "world's human rights
judge" and makes unwarranted accusations about other countries'
human rights records year after year.
</P>
<P>
The American government needs to keep an eye on its own human
rights problems, mind its own business, and stop interfering in
the internal affairs of other countries by utilizing the human
rights question.

<HEADLINE> Caucasus Pact Initiative to Be Discussed in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The framework of a proposed
Caucasus stability pact will be discussed in Tbilisi early in
March, Turkish press reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the United Nations, the United States, Russia,
Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia will gather in the Georgian
capital for discussions.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first concrete move on the proposal since it
was raised by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel during his
official visit to Georgia last month.
</P>
<P>
"A stability pact for the Caucasus region has to be worked out,
as it was for the Balkans," Demirel told a press conference jointly
held with his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze in Tbilisi
on January 16.
</P>
<P>
"Stability and peace in Caucasus should be under European
guarantee because this is important not not only for Georgia and
other countries of this region, but for their neighbors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Demirel, Shevardnadze termed the proposal as a very
important and historic one that could bring long-awaited peace to
the region.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified official close to the Turkish government was
quoted as saying that Turkey, neighboring the Caucasus region,
insists on the establishment of such a pact in order to secure the
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Emin Gurses from University of Sakarya in western
Turkey said "The Caucasus pact is actually planned by the United
States, and Turkey is just an instrument."
</P>
<P>
"If you ask why the United States is playing a key role in
establishing the pact, I can tell you that the region has great
amount of oil and natural gas resources. The United States does not
want trouble in the Caucasus," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov is
scheduled to pay a two-day official visit to Turkey starting on
February 28.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source told Turkish press that Klebanov, as a
special envoy of Russian acting President Vladimir Putin, would
bring Demirel a letter from Putin with regard to the suggestion of
Caucasus stability pact.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Strengthens Control Over Energy Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe announced that his office has taken over the Ministry of
Transport and Energy following the resignation of Minister Enos
Chikowore on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made this announcement on Saturday night in an
interview with the Sunday Mail newspaper at the Manyame Airbase
following his tour of areas hit by floods in Chiredzi and
Beitbridge of southern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"I have accepted Minister Chilowore's resignation and the
ministry will for now work in our office," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we will continue to work on the fuel situation
and try to rectify the problem."
</P>
<P>
The country has been facing a serious fuel shortage since
December last year because of shortage of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that we should not just resolve the problem in an
ad hoc way. What we must ensure is that we have adequate fuel for
a long period and on a permanent basis," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would soon negotiate with a "friendly
country" for an arrangement to fill the strategic tanks. But he
did not specify which country, earlier reports said that South
Africa would most likely come into its help.
</P>
<P>
The solution is not in getting one or two ships bringing in
fuel or getting new lines of credit, he said, stressing that "we
have to have an assurance on fuel supplies."
</P>
<P>

</P>

The Civil Protection Unit is now in control of the situation,
with all the troubled spots having been identified and measures
being put in place to provide distressed villagers with food,
shelter, blankets and clothes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The national death toll due to Cyclone Eline has risen to 29

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Calls for Sound, Stable Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ambassador to the
United States, Li Zhaoxing, Saturday urged all peace-loving
Americans to take actions to defeat the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act (TSEA) and help secure congressional approval of
permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) for China.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Americans to oppose U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and
other actions that go against the spirit of the three joint
communiques between Beijing and Washington so as to ensure a sound
and stable relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people, including the compatriots in Taiwan, love
peace and treasure Sino-U.S. relations. Americans should do the
same, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Normal bilateral ties on the basis of the three Sino-U.S.
communiques and bilateral cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit are conducive to peace and prosperity in the Asia-
Pacific region and the whole world at large," the Chinese
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a reception in the Chinese Embassy on
Saturday evening in honor of 20 American governors who were here
for the annual meeting of the National Governors' Association (NGA)
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1999 witnessed ups and downs in Sino-U.S. relations,
Li said. Fortunately, thanks to joint efforts by the two
governments, bilateral ties, which suffered a serious setback due
to the U.S.-led NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
last May, was gradually brought back on track, especially after
the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Aukland, New Zealand, last September.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, whenever Sino-U.S. ties make some headway,
there are always a handful of American politicians who cannot wait
to jump to their feet and revert the healthy trend. Those people
try every means to interfere in China's internal affairs and
encroach upon its sovereignty, using all kinds of pretexts they
cook up, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Those politicians are now defiling the white paper on the
Taiwan issue recently published by the Chinese government as a "
provocation" which they say may lead to higher tensions in the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
It is simply because of those politicians, who fanned up the so-
called "China threat" and pushed Congress hard to pass the TSEA
and approve the sale to Taiwan of large quantities of advanced
weapons, that separatists in the island have been encouraged, thus
creating tensions in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"This is the real root cause for the deteriorating situation in
the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
Michael O. Leavitt, governor of Utah, who heads the NGA, said
the fact that so many governors are gathering in the Chinese
Embassy sends an important message to China -- "We love China and
respect the Chinese people" and the development of U.S.-China
relations is crucial to the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Leavitt said he understood the concern of the Chinese
government over the Taiwan issue, which he believed should in no
way impede the growth of relations between the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his support for expanded trade with China and
for giving China a permanent NTR. His stand was echoed by other
governors present at the reception.

According to the Reserve Bank of India, the 0.19 percentage

<HEADLINE> U.S. Human Rights Record in 1999 (17) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women are the major victims of domestic violence. The U.S.
Department of Justice estimated that there are at least 4.2
million cases of domestic violence in the country each year, and
95 percent of the victims are women.
</P>
<P>
The human rights of female prisoners are seriously violated in
the U.S. In 1997, some 138,000 women were incarcerated in the
United States, three times more than in 1985, according to a
report from Amnesty International in March 1999. Male prison
guards are also accused of sexually harassing women inmates during
routine searches, and female inmates are often raped.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 41 percent of the personnel who come
into contact with women inmates in the U.S. are male, which runs
counter to regulations established by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 to 1998, more than 2,200 pregnant women were imprisoned
and more than 1,300 children were born in prison, said Amnesty
International. In at least 40 states, babies are taken from their
imprisoned mothers almost immediately after birth or at the time
the mother is discharged from hospital. In many American prisons,
female inmates have to wait for several months before they can
receive medical care from doctors.
</P>
<P>
The state of children in the U.S. is grim. The United States,
one of the few countries which have death penalty for juveniles,
has the highest number of juveniles sentenced to death in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, 43 American states have revised their juvenile
delinquency laws, and made sure juvenile delinquents receive the
same punishment as adult criminals, which violates the regulations
of the United Nations.

IV. Rights and Interests of Women and Children Violated
</P>
<P>
Gender discrimination is a chronic malady in the United States.
According to a report of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in January
2000, the U.S. Congress is made up of only 12.9 percent women. The
latest survey from the National Women and Police Center showed
that from 1990 to 1997, the number of women in the law enforcement
departments across the country increased by just 3.2 percent. One-
third of the 176 police organizations surveyed have no women as
senior officers, according to a report in USA Today on April 14,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Women, who make up some 45 percent of the U.S. work force,
earned on average only 75 percent as much as men, black women only
65 percent, and Hispanic women only 57 percent, according to a

The United States has poor labor rights protection and social
security for women. American women have only three months of
unpaid maternity leave, and are not allowed any time off for
breast-feeding after they go back to work, according to an
International Labor Organization study of 152 countries released
in February 1998. It also showed that about 40 percent of the
female employees with children have no medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported on September 21, 1999 that the marriage rate
has plummeted by a third since 1960. It said there were about 73
marriages per 1,000 unmarried women aged 15 and up in 1960. In
1996, the rate was about 49 per 1,000.

<P>
An AP report on November 23, 1999 said that a survey of the
University of Chicago showed that the percentage of American
households made up of married couples with children dropped from
45 percent in the early 1970s to just 26 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of single-mother families in the United States is
increasing, and poverty is becoming a bigger threat to these
families. From 1995 to 1997, the income of poorest single-parent
families headed by women, which make up one-fifth of the total
number of American families, has dropped by nearly seven percent,
according to an article in the British journal the Economist
released on August 28, 1999.

III, Serious Problems of Racial Discrimination
</P>
<P>
Racial discrimination is the most serious social problem
plaguing the United States. The U.S. Administration's handling of
Chinese American scientist Wen Ho Lee's alleged spy case once
again revealed the racial discrimination prevalent in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Without any FBI evidence to prove Lee's alleged act of
espionage, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Lee on charges
of illegal use of classified information and some other charges.
</P>
<P>
The report said a former FBI head had been involved in an act
similar to Wen Ho Lee, but he was only prohibited access to any
classified documents.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee has been under surveillance by FBI agents for over
one year and has been held in prison without bail.
</P>
<P>
People widely believe that Lee has been unfairly targeted
because of his race.
</P>
<P>
U.S. bi-monthly Workers' World pointed out in its December 23
issue that a U.S. survey conducted in October, 1999, indicated
that racial prejudice is deeply rooted in U.S. culture -- a fact
that Americans either do not realize or do not willingly admit.
</P>
<P>
Racial discrimination is a nationwide phenomena in the U.S.
Though the number of black people stands at only 13 percent of the
total U.S. population, the number of black prisoners accounts for
49 percent of all U.S. prisoners.

On February 5, 1999, four New York police opened fire on a 22-
year-old black west African immigrant and killed him with 24
bullets, saying they mistook him for a suspect. The high-profile
case has come to symbolize the violent behavior of the American
police.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported on May 2, 1999, that black families,
either rich or poor, are afraid of being mistaken as criminals and
shot by police.
</P>
<P>
Race-related killings are also on the rise. Various white
supremacy groups have formed throughout the country, based on the
principle that all black, Jewish, and Asian people are inferior
and constantly arranging racially-motivated acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that the number of such hate groups has
increased from 474 in 1997 to 537 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Justice has announced that out of nearly
9,000 murder cases in 1998, over half are race-related.
</P>
<P>
The statistics released by the Department of Justice in 1999
showed that between 1992 and 1996, 124 of every 1,000 Indians over
12 years old were victims of criminal acts. The figure is twice
that for black children and 2.5 times more than the country's
average.

BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council today released an article titled "U.S. Human Rights
Record in 1999."
</P>
<P>
The article said that the human rights report of the year 1999
issued by the U.S. State Department on February 26 ignored China's
improving human rights and vigorously attacked China again out of
its unflinching political bias.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report also criticizes almost every other country for
its human rights situation, but is silent about the human rights
problems in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore quite necessary to have a look at the U.S.
human rights record in 1999," the five-part article says.

 I. Civil, Political Rights Endangered
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the safety of the general public and
individuals is threatened by the presence of a huge number of
privately-owned firearms and widespread violent crime. According
to the latest estimates by the U.S. Department of Justice,
Americans now own about 235 million guns, roughly one per person
on average.
</P>
<P>
According to a Reuters report on April 22, 1999, the United
States reports an average of one million gun-related murders
annually. Since 1972, over 30,000 people have died in gun-related
homicides, accidents and suicides every year.
</P>
<P>
An AP report on April 16, 1998, citing a government study,
showed that "the United States has by far the highest rate of gun
deaths -- murders, suicides, and accidents -- among the world's 36
richest nations."
</P>
<P>
DPA, the German news agency, reported on May 10, 1999, that in
1995 there were 21,600 murders and accidental killings in the
United States, including 15,551 shootings causing 35,673 deaths.
Between 1985-1995, the number of juvenile crimes tripled, while
the number of gun-related murders by juveniles quadrupled. In 1997,
there were 6,044 gun-related murders involving young people aged
between 15-24.

Shooting rampages at high schools have frequently made
headlines in the United States, with one out of every ten schools
witnessing at least one severe criminal incident every year. The
number of cases of gun-related violence has been increasing. In
1997-98, 48 people were killed as a result of violence in schools.
In April 1999, in the most notorious and tragic case in U.S.
history, two high school students with guns and home-made bombs
slaughtered 13 teachers and students and injured another 25 at
Columbine High School in the state of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, an average of 15 out of every
100,000 young Americans are shot dead annually. The accidental
shooting death rate among American children under 15 is 15 times
higher than that of the total of other 25 industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Police brutality is common in the U.S. and cases of judicial
corruption are on the rise. According to a U.S. newspaper Workers
World on March 25, 1999, 65 incidents of police brutality were
reported in Chicago between 1972-91, but none of the police
officers involved were dealt with. In 1996, 3,000 people sued
local police officers in this American city, but none of the
accused were dismissed. In San Francisco, between 1990-95, 4.1 out
of every 100 murders were caused by police shootings. And not a
single police officer has been sued for shootings at random in the
city, though there were 1,000-2,000 complaints against local
police officers in the city each year.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, 756 former law-enforcement officials
have been convicted of corruption, brutal conduct and other crimes,
setting a new record in this regard. By June 1999, there had been
655 inmates in the federal prisons who were formerly law-
enforcement officials, compared with 107 inmates in 1994, an
increase of five times, according to USA Today's report on July 29,
1999.

The United States, which calls itself the "land of the free,"
ranks first in the world in the proportion of prisoners among the
population. According to statistics issued by the bureau of
justice statistics of the U.S Department of Justice in 1999, the
number of American adults in prison, on probation and on parole
topped 5.92 million in 1998, accounting for three percent of the
total population, while 1.82 million of them were incarcerated in
state or federal prisons, more than double the figure of 744,000
reported at the end of 1985 and setting a new record.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985-98, the number of prisoners in the country
increased by 7.3 percent annually. Meanwhile, the imprisonment
rate went up by more than 100 percent as the number of prisoners
out of every 100,000 Americans increased from 313 to 668. AFP
reported on February 16, 2000, that by February 15, 2000, the
number of American prisoners had topped two million, to account
for one fourth of the world's total, ranking first in the world.
</P>
<P>
In overcrowded American prisons, inmates are mistreated and
violence prevails. Between 1990-97, the average jail term of
American prisoners increased from 22 months to 27 months, while
the rate of inmates to be released dropped to 31 percent from 37
percent every year; the number of paroled convicts who were
sentenced again increased by 39 percent; and the number of new
inmates rose by four percent, according to a report by Chicago
Tribune on March 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
By December 31, 1998, state prisons reported they were housing
13-22 percent more convicts than their facilities were designed to
accommodate; the figure was 27 percent in federal prisons, and 100
percent in 33 state prisons.
</P>
<P>
The leading American newspaper the New York Times reported in
April, 1999, that in a prison in Nassau County in the state of New
York, an shockingly large number of inmates had been brutally
beaten and some died as a result of the abuse, but none of the
prison guards involved were charged for their criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the number of inmates who have died of
senility in prison is higher than the number of those who have
been released from jail after serving their terms. In 1999, there
were over 36,000 elderly inmates, compared with around 9,500 in
the early 1980s. Over 220,000 more inmates are expected to join
the ranks of the aged within 10 years.

The Boston Globe reported on September 26, 1999, that prisoners
in 94 federal prisons under the U.S. Department of Justice were
working for a company to manufacture electronic parts, furniture,
clothing and other goods. In 1998, the company generated nearly
540 million U.S. dollars in sales.
</P>
<P>
Some American prisons have begun to charge prisoners for fees
of imprisonment. American companies that were looking for cheap
labor abroad in the 1980s are now taking advantage of the 1.8
million prisoner-laborers at home. Two American firms have signed
contracts with government departments on managing and charging
nearly 100,000 inmates in over 100 jails. The two contractors
would charge each prisoner 35 U.S. dollars per day for food and
management and they could earn 12.78 million U.S. dollars within
the contract term, if the number of the prisoners would not
decline, the U.S. Insight Weekly reported in its May 4, 1999
edition.
</P>
<P>
The United States insists that there is no political prisoner
in the country. But the April 29, 1999 issue of the U.S.-based bi-
monthly Workers' World reported that at least 150 political
prisoners were jailed in the country. Many of them were
incarcerated as a result of an FBI counter-intelligence operation
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which targeted all those who
took part in campaigns against oppression and Southeast Asian wars
and supported the independence of Puerto Rico. Some 768 members of
the Black Panther organization were arrested and jailed following
the FBI operation.

According to the book, between 1987-96, 500 large American

In the same period, "donations" from major U.S. cigarette
manufacturers to congressmen and the two parties exceeded 30
million U.S. dollars. Health and medical companies donated 72
million U.S. to congressmen, while the Congress helped large and

Although gun-related tragedies have become all too common in
the United States, the National Rifle Association (NRA) spent 1.5
million U.S. dollars over a two-month period to lobby the
congressmen who bowed to the NRA and vetoed a gun control bill
which was strongly favored by the majority of the American people.
The veto of the bill, coupled with other practices, has soured the
American people on their political interest, and the voting rate
for the 1998 mid-term election hit a record low of 36.1 percent.
Compared with 1994, voting rates in 36 states declined, with a 4.3-

But the American working class are suffering from the infringement

A vast chasm exists between the rich and the poor in America.
The British weekly magazine, the Economist, said in an October 3,
1998, article that the income of the richest families, accounting
for one fifth of the total American families, made up a half of
the total income of American families, while the earnings of the
poorest families, about one fifth of the total, earned a mere four
percent of the overall figure.
</P>
<P>
A September 1999 report by the U.S. Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities showed that the income of the 2.7 million richest
Americans was equal to that of the 100 million poorest. Another
report released last month by the U.S. Economic Policy Institute
and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that in the
late 1990s, the average annual income of the richest one fifth
families stood at 137,500 U.S. dollars, 10 times that of the
poorest one fifth, which was about 13,000 U.S. dollars. The
disparity in the U.S. capital of Washington ranks first in the

In the past 10 years, the average annual income for the richest
one fifth of families has increased by 15 percent, while for the
poorest one fifth the increase is less than one percent. In fact,
the average annual income after taxes for the poorest families has

salaries of senior managers and ordinary staff in American
companies grew to as much as 419:1 in 1998 from the 1980

other words, one out of every 6.5 Americans is poor.
</P>
<P>
A survey published last April said that the United States has
60 million poverty-stricken people, which represents 22.5 percent
of the total population. A Columbia University report in 1999
noted that 29 percent of New York residents live under the poverty
line, while the income of five percent of New Yorkers is only one-
fifth of the sum set for the poverty line, and 17 percent of New
Yorkers often cannot afford to pay their bills on time, according
to a report released by the Efe news agency on March 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The number of Americans who suffer from hanger and are homeless
has been increasing. A report issued by the American Conference of
Mayors on December 16, 1999, said that the number of the homeless
and hungry in big cities who are in urgent need of food and
shelter is higher than at any time in recent history. In 1999, the
number of people who applied for urgent food is the largest ever
and 18 percent more than the figure of 1998.

According to another report issued on January 20, 2000 and
picked up by Reuters, more than 30 million Americans live in
families that are short of food, 7.2 percent of American families
cannot secure their daily need, and children in 15.2 percent of
American families are starving. In 1999, the number of people in
big cities who applied for temporary housing went up by 12 percent.
In San Francisco, nearly 14,000 were homeless and at least 169
people died of exposure, drug addiction, illness and violence in
the streets.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 study made in New York after a series of incidents
involving vagrants being killed showed that 80 percent of these
homeless had become the target of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to an AFP story on December 16, 1999, a survey
published last December found that among the homeless questioned,
66 percent were suffering from chronic illness, one-third of them
were parents, one-fourth were children, one-third were veterans,
and 49 percent were mental patients in need of treatment.

<HEADLINE> High Global Oil Price Posts Pressures on Chinese Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Increases in prices of
petroleum products on the world market are threatening the
security of China's oil supply, which has prompted an urgent
adjustment of the country's energy strategy, reported today's
China's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper's Business Weekly said in a front-page report that
the dramatic fluctuations in international crude oil prices
negatively affected China because the country has become
increasingly dependent on imported oil since 1993.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an industry official as saying that China can not
accept endlessly rising oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The country imported nearly 40 million tons of crude oil and
oil products last year, or 20 percent of the country's total
consumption, the paper quoted Chen Geng, deputy director of the
Station Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industries, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The demand for crude oil is expected to grow at an annual rate
of 4 percent during the 21st century. It expects to import 42
million tons of crude oil this year.
</P>
<P>
China plans to develop other energy resources, such as natural
gas and hydropower to augment or replace its use of crude oil, the
paper noted.

However, the American working class has suffered heavily from a
loss of economic and social rights because of the polarization of
society, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The incomes of the richest families, making up one-fifth of the
total American families, account for half of the total incomes of
American families, while the earnings of the poorest, about one-
fifth of the total, claimed a mere four percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, almost all American workers have
experienced a declining wage to a certain degree, while their
working hours have increased, according to a report in the Chicago
Tribune on September 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The international federation of free trade unions said in a
July 1999 report that the United States had been engaged in a "
large-scale, sustained and surprising" infringement of the rights
of laborers, including violation of the rights of trade unions and
using children and prisoners as laborers.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that racial discrimination is the most
profound social problem in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Racial discrimination is deeply-rooted in American culture -- a
fact that Americans do not willingly admit, according to a wire
story released by the Associated Press on October 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Racial discrimination is a nationwide phenomenon in the U.S..
Police violence stemming from racial discrimination occurs all too
frequently, and cases of racial killings are constantly on the
rise.

The United States, known as the "land of the free," ranks first
in the world in its proportion of prisoners to the entire
population, the article says.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics issued in 1999 by the U.S Department of
Justice, the number of American adults in prison, on probation and
on parole, topped 5.92 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The self-proclaimed freedom of the United States has always
served none but the wealthiest citizens. In 1998, a book entitled
"The Buy of Congress: How Special Interests Have Stolen Your Right
to Life, Liberty, &AMP; the Pursuit of Happiness" was published in the
United States to expose how the Congress has become a tool of the
special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
This has soured Americans' interest in politics, and the number
of voters who went to the polls for the 1998 mid-term election hit
a record low of 36.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. boasts that it has freedom of press. Actually, the
American media has become the "resources of state power" and a
propaganda machine used by the authorities to manipulate public
opinion, the article notes.

The United States is the most developed nation in the modern
world, with its economy growing for the ninth successive year. (

<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the 0.19 percentage
fall in the annual rate of inflation to 2.37 percent from 2.56
percent in the previous week was triggered by the decline in the
Index of Primary Articles and manufacturing products.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's inflation was higher at 5.12 percent
during the corresponding week in 1999.
</P>
<P>
After rising to a 32-week high of 3.31 percent for the week on
January 22, 2000, the inflation rate has been steadily falling due

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is determined
to increase its exports from 300 million U.S. dollars in 1999 to a
hefty 1 billion dollars in the next five years, said a senior
official Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by the presidential office,
Secretary Filemon Uriarte of the Department of Science and
Technology (DOST) said this is through the implementation of the
200 million peso (5 million dollar) Virtual Center for Technology
Innovation in Information Technology (VCTI).
</P>
<P>
The country's export rose to 35 billion dollars last year,
buoying hopes that the government could hit its targeted export
value of 50 billion dollars in the year 2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
"DOST has decided to prioritize information technology (IT)
because this sector, particularly software development, has high
added value that caters to a large potential market requiring
minimal capital investment," Uriarte said.
</P>
<P>
He said the project was also designed to spur electronic
commerce development in the Philippines, which has been hobbled by
the absence of a payment backbone and a legal framework to tackle
such legal issues as intellectual property rights and consumer
protection.
</P>
<P>
Uriarte said with the implementation of VCTI, the Philippines
hopes to capture a substantial portion in the global markets for
local IT products and services.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to produce at least 5,000 certified IT
professionals in the next five years to spearhead software into
the 1 billion dollar level, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Mason Arrested, Charged with Third-Degree Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Charlotte Hornets forward
Anthony Mason was arrested and charged with third-degree assault
after an altercation this morning outside a bar in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
According to a police spokesman, Mason and four other men were
involved in a fight with three other men this morning at a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The three men allegedly assaulted by Mason's group were
hospitalized with minor injuries. According to police, Mason was
not injured in the fight.
</P>
<P>
Mason rejoined the Hornets early in the second quarter of
tonight's game against the New Jersey Nets. It was unclear whether
Mason was arraigned, released or posted bail.
</P>
<P>
Mason, 33, played five years with the New York Knicks before
being traded to Charlotte in July 1996. He was arrested in New
York during All-Star Weekend in 1998 on a statutory rape charge.
</P>
<P>
He later agreed to a plea bargain in which the more serious
charges were dropped and was sentenced to 200 hours of community
service.
</P>
<P>
Mason is averaging 10.7 points, a team-leading 8.2 rebounds and
4.1 assists in 53 games for the Hornets this season.
</P>
<P>
Mason helped the Knicks reach the NBA Finals in 1994 and led
the NBA in minutes played in the 1995-96 season. He was traded to
the Hornets forward Larry Johnson.

<HEADLINE> China Lashes Out At U.S. Human Rights Record (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China lashed out at the United
States today in an article carrying detailed examples of the poor
human rights record in the U.S., making it clear that America is
in no position to judge others on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "U.S. Human Rights Record in 1999," was
released by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-word article says that the U.S. State Department
annual human rights report issued on February 26, dismissed China'
s improving human rights and vigorously attacked China out of its
unflinching political bias.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report also criticized almost every other country for
alleged human rights abuses, but is silent about the human rights
problems in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore quite necessary to have a look at the U.S.
human rights record," the five-part article says.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that in the United States, the safety of the
general public and individuals is threatened by the presence of a
huge number of private firearms and widespread violent crime.
</P>
<P>
According to latest estimates by the U.S. Department of Justice,
there are 235 million private guns owned by Americans -- almost
equal to the total U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
The United States reports an average of more than one million
gun-related murders each year.
</P>
<P>
Shooting rampages at high schools in the United States, with
one out of every ten schools witnessing at least one severe
criminal incident, the article says.

RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer, has
pledged to raise oil production to help rein in the buoyant oil
prices in the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia made the promise in a joint statement issued with
visiting U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson Saturday. But the
statement did not give detailed output plans of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Richardson arrived here from Kuwait and his visit came in an
apparent attempt to convince Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the two
major members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), to help bring down the robust oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC adopted a year-long policy last March to slash its member
states' oil output to prop up the sagging oil prices, which have
recently jumped to a nine-year high of nearly 29 U.S. dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers will meet on March 27 in Vienna to discuss the
current situation and future policies. Some consuming giants,
especially the U.S., want the oil producing states to pump more
oil to tame the oil prices. (Saudi Arabia-US-Oil)

BERLIN -- The German government said Thursday it hopes its

the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
despite the candidates from Japan and the United States compete
with him for the job.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diplomat Expelled to Canada for Flight to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. authorities Saturday
expelled a Cuban diplomat ignoring an expulsion order and put him
on a flight bound for Montreal, Canada, where he will be flown to
Cuba's capital of Havana.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, Jose Imperatori, earlier Saturday announced he
went on a hunger strike to protest the U.S. expulsion order.
</P>
<P>
"The diplomat in question no longer enjoys the privileges and
immunities conferred by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations," the U.S. State Department said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"He has been expelled from the United States for not
voluntarily departing by the appointed time," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department announced last week Imperatori should
leave the United States by 1:30 p.m. Saturday and his diplomatic
privileges and immunities will be removed after the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference just before the deadline,
Imperatori said he would clear his name of allegations that he was
a contact of a U.S. immigration official charged with spying for
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"I have become the victim of a major slander. I have been
wrongly accused of doing intelligence work in the United States,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Imperatori said he resigned his post as consular officer at 7 a.
m. Saturday, thus voluntarily eliminating his immunity six hours
before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
"I shall remain in the same apartment where I have lived, and
as of this moment I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have
been absolutely cleared of the accusation brought against me," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The State Department announced earlier this week that
Imperatori may be arrested if he failed to leave the country by
the U.S. deadline.
</P>
<P>
"I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and
jailed. My morale and my truth will be my shield," Imperatori
said.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the deadline, agents from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation went to his apartment in Maryland and drove him to
the Ronald Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
Imperatori said that Cuban Interests Section officials have
been "categorically and precisely instructed not to do
intelligence work in the United States" since the mission was
opened 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Such instructions have been strictly observed and with
absolutely no exceptions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department declared Imperatori "Persona Non
Grata" after FBI concluded he was the Washington contact for
Mariano M. Faget, a Miami-based official of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS). Faget was arrested a week ago
on charges of spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government said that the expulsion is nothing but a
maneuver to block the return of six-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who
was rescued in the sea off Florida after his mother drowned when
their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
The father of Gonzalez, backed by the Cuban government, asked
the boy to return to him. INS ruled the boy belongs to his father
and should be returned.
</P>
<P>
But the boy's relatives, supported by Cuban exiles and anti-
Cuba congressmen, insisted Gonzalez stay in the United States.
The boy still remain in Florida with his relatives.

BUENOS AIRES, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of privately

1993 to 1.938 million, authorities said Saturday.
</P>

crimes are registered.

<P>
CHENGDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to accelerate the
development of water resources on the upper reaches of the Yangtze

MOSCOW -- The Russian Security Council, the country's top
security policy agency, Friday made a decision to establish
interim administration in coming days and to restore economy in
the liberated parts of the rebel republic of Chechnya as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Russian Central Election Commission Chairman Alexander
Veshnyakov plans to visit Chechnya to acquaint himself with the
preparations for the March 26 Russian presidential elections in
the republic, Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov said after
Friday's council session chaired by Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
In coming two weeks the government will complete the
preparation for a measure program on restoring the power
structures and the social and economic sectors in Chechnya, Ivanov
predicted.
</P>
<P>
To organize new power structures, "a transitional period will
be required, since now it is unrealistic to set up in Chechnya
republican power similar to that in other federal territories,"
Ivanov said, noting that he regards this as "an issue for long-
term discussion." (Russia-Chechnya-Plan)

HAVANA -- Cuban diplomat Jose Imperatori in the United States
resigned the post and started a hunger strike on Saturday in
protest against an accusation of spying.
</P>
<P>
The deadline given on February 19 by the U.S.Department of
State to Imperatori to leave the United States, after being
charged with alleged links of spying for the island with Mariano
Faget, an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) official,
comes due Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government announced that it would ask its diplomat
to remain in Washington to demonstrate the fallacy of the
accusation, whatever the consequences.
</P>
<P>
"My decision is voluntary. I do not belong anymore to the
Office of Interests. I will assume the responsibility and the
consequences," said Imperatori in a letter entitled "To the United
States people," published in this capital.
</P>
<P>
He said he will remain in the apartment where he has been
living and in hunger strike, until the accusation is completely
cleared."I will not resist if I am arrested, if I am manacled and
if I am jailed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State spokesman James Rubin said
Tuesday that if the Cuban representative does not go, he will lose
his immunity and will be subjected to U.S. laws. "If there are
reasons to arrest him, he will be arrested," said Rubin. (US-Cuba-

PARIS -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin returned to Paris
Saturday evening from his visit to Israel and the Palestinian
autonomous territories, which was marked by a violent attack upon
him by Palestinian demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Jospin was injured in his head by a stone thrown by the
Palestinians at the University of Bir Zeit in the West Bank
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place after Jospin said on Thursday in
Jerusalem that the attacks upon Israeli troops by Hezbollah
guerrillas in southern Lebanon were acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
When he ended a visit to the University of Bir Zeit, Jospin was
attacked by a rainfall of stones from Palestinian students who
surrounded him and his delegation members, including French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
His car was seriously damaged after being stoned and kicked for
several minutes by violent demonstrators, who blocked the exit
route of the motorcade of Jospin's.
</P>
<P>
Jospin cut short his visit to the Palestinians territories and
cancelled a visit to a refugee camp and a joint press conference
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Before he left Israel for home, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak called Jospin and expressed his support and salutation. (

<HEADLINE> Bayern Munich Beats Frankfurt 4-1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Reichenberger scored Frankfurt's only goal in the 49th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Munich has now won four and drawn one since the winter break
and appears in top form as it resumes its pursuit of three titles
Wednesday against Real Madrid in the Champions Cup.
</P>
<P>
Munich stayed five points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, which also
appeared inspired by the balmy temperatures to run over Hertha
Berlin, the league's other Champions Cup team. It won in a 3-1
rout,while lining up four strikers.
</P>
<P>
Third-place Hamburger SV, eight points behind, beat
Kaiserslautern 2-1 despite having a player sent off the field with
a red card as its scoring goalie, Hans-Joerg Butt converted his
ninth penalty. That left him one behind the league's top marksman.
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen seized on Berlin's shaky defense and led 3-1 by the
half on goals by Ulf Kirsten, Ze Roberto and Paulo Rink.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Stefan Beinlich was at the center of most of
Leverkusen's goals, after his team was shocked by Marco Rehmer's
ninth-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
Beinlich, who will join Berlin next season, sent a low cross
into the box in the 13th minute which a diving Kirsten, feet-first,
drove into the net. His hard shot in the 28th was fisted away, but
Rink followed through for the 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Bremen also got a 83rd minute goal from Peruvian forward
Claudio Pizzaro to earn a 2-2 draw with Wolfsburg and Stuttgart
finally won 3-1 against Duisburg. On Friday, Rostock and Freiburg
drew 1-1 in a relegation battle.
</P>
<P>
Stuttgart snapped a four-match losing streak, behind 26th and
43rd minute goals from Bulgarian Krassimir Balakov, once the team'
s star but now in danger of losing his starting role. A late score
came from Sean Dundee.

The association will also carry out scientific education
project in western China over the next five years, setting up 100
showcase educational centers and 100 farming technology societies
there. It will also use its wide connections to introduce
outstanding talent to the west.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media have stirred up waves of publicity about the
development of the region, as major newspapers and TV channels
have devoted many pages and prime-time shows to this development.
The People's Daily said in an editorial that carrying out the
strategy of developing western China is a major strategic choice
made by the government and this vast region will surely take on a
new look as a result of the consistent efforts of several
generations.
</P>
<P>
Democratic parties and non-governmental organizations also
strongly support this development. For example, at a coordination
meeting of local branches in 11 provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions, the China Democratic National Construction
Association (CDNCA) said that it will organize specialists among
its members to study and put forward suggestions for developing
the west, and pledged to supplement the government's effort to
carry out this strategy plan.
</P>
<P>
Minority ethnic groups may be the most enthusiastic about the
government plan, since most of them live in western China. Ismail
Amat, a state councilor from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
said that developing the west provides a historic opportunity for
minority ethnic groups to accelerate development.
</P>
<P>
He said that accelerating development of western China will not
only narrow the gap between eastern and western parts of the
country and consolidate unity among all ethnic groups, but will
also develop new growth areas for the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at all levels and relevant government
institutions have already began to coordinate their efforts to
implement the strategy for the development of the region.

BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people from all walks
of life enthusiastically welcome and support the strategy the
Chinese government has adopted to develop the vast areas of
western China.
</P>
<P>
The government said recently that since the time is right, the
country will accelerate the development of western China to
invigorate the economy of the area, promote overall economic
growth, and realize the long-term goals of modernization.
</P>
<P>
Many corporations have expressed strong interest in the market
opportunities that are arising in the process of developing the
backward areas of west China.
</P>
<P>
The Xiyang Fireproof Material Company, a township enterprise in
northwest China's Liaoning Province, set up a 900-million-yuan
fertilizer factory in Guizhou Province in the southwest this month.
General manager Zhou Furen said that since Guizhou has rich
mineral resources such as phosphorous, his company is seizing the
first opportunity provided by government policy to tap into these
resources.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in the east China coastal province of Zhejiang have
created scores of projects in western China, selling more than 100
billion yuan worth of goods and services in the area every year.
</P>
<P>
The All China Industry and Commerce Federation, the national
organization of non-government businesses, called for private
enterprises to push forward the industrialization of the farming
sector, tap into the mineral and tourism resources, and promote
the growth of trade and the service industry in the western region.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese government has adopted measures
to facilitate investment in western China. According to the
Ministry of Railways, China will invest 100 million yuan in
railway construction in the region over the next five years, and
by the end of 2005, the total length of railways in this area will
increase to 18,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and educational circles also have been quick to act.
The China Science and Technology Association, a national
organization of scientists, has decided to hold its annual meeting
in western China later this year, with the theme "Developing West
China--Science, Technology and Sustainable Development."

<HEADLINE> Czech Shatters European Record to Win Heptathlon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENT, Belgium, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Tomas Dvorak not only
led a Czech one-two in the men's heptathlon at the European indoor
athletic championships but also set up a continental record en
route to winning the event on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech heptathlete, twice world champion and world record
holder for the 10-event decathlon, garnered 6,424 points from the
two-day seven-event competition, beating the eight-year-old
previous European mark of 6,418 points held by Frenchman Christian
Plaziat.
</P>
<P>
He ran a 6.92-second 60 meters, long jumped 7.81 meters, shot
put 16.82 meters, cleared 2.04 meters on the high jump, clocked 7.
78 seconds over the 60-meter hurdles, pole vaulted 5.00 meters and
was timed 2:45.68 for the 1,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Dvorak's shot put distance was more than two meters further
than the previous record holder's 14.53 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Czech grip on the heptathlon title was more than secured
when Dvorak's teammate Roman Sebrle finished runner-up with 6,271
points, 71 points ahead of Estonia's Erki Nool who got the bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
Muriel Hurtis of France won the women's 200-meter race with a
clocking of 23.06 seconds while compatriot and pre-race favorite
Fabe Dia finished a distant sixth and last at 24.38 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kajsa Bergqvist got Sweden a sweet gold medal by winning the
women's high jump event with a clearance of 2.00 meters, followed
by Zuzana Hlavonova of the Czech Republic and Olga Kaliturina of
Russia on 1.98 and 1.96 meters respectively.
</P>
<P>
Romania also got on to the gold medal chart on Saturday as
Violeta Szekely won the women's 1,500-meter race with a timing of
four minutes 12.82 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the past medal grabbers at the European championships,
got its first gold medal of the current championships by winning
the women's triple jump event.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Lebedeva hit 14.68 meters on her second outing of the
day and skipped her last two outings altogether to take the gold
medal for Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cristina Nicolau of Romania jumped 14.63 meters on her first
outing to clinch the silver medal while Iva Prandzheva of Bulgaria
did not come within medal range until her final outing when she
cleared an identical 14.63 meters only for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian fouled four times and jumped 14.26 meters on her
good jump on the fourth outing.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Stevens entertained a Saturday turnout of local crowds
by clinching the host country Belgium's lone medal so far as he
finished runner-up in between two Britons in the men's 200-meter
finals.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian clocked 20.70 seconds for the silver while
Christian Malcolm, the pre-race favorite, lived up to his
expectation by winning the event with a clocking of 20.54 econds.
</P>
<P>
Russia got its second gold at the Gent European championships
as Larisa Peleshenko shot put 20.15 meters to win the women's
title while France also hit a second gold medal when Linda Ferga
led a French one-two finish in the 60-meter hurdles with a
clocking of 7.88 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Leicester to Keep Heskey Next Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Leicester City manager Martin O
'Neill has promised to "move heaven and earth" in a bid to keep
Emile Heskey at his club next season.
</P>
<P>
Despite continued speculation that Heskey will be leaving
Filbert Street this summer in a 10 million pounds move to Anfield,
Leicester boss O'Neill insists that no such deal has been done.
</P>
<P>
As he prepared for Sunday's Worthington Cup final against
Tranmere Rovers, O'Neill said he hoped to persuade Heskey to stay
at the club for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
"I'll move heaven and earth to try to keep Emile at Leicester
City Football Club," said O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
"I thought for a moment or two we might have lost him this time
last year, but we didn't. He stayed on and I'm hoping he might
give us at least another year again.
</P>
<P>
"I shall sit down and talk to him as soon as possible after the
Worthington Cup final, but the decision will eventually be down to
him.
</P>
<P>
"Emile is still only 22 years of age and he has had four
glorious years here. It is happening for him now and I am
delighted for him because he is a Leicester boy."
</P>
<P>
O'Neill rubbished suggestions that Heskey had already agreed to
join another club at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There is no legally binding deal with any other club.
The player is in pole position because he'll make the choice. We'
ll try to dissuade him but if he chooses to go then there is not a
great deal we can do about it.
</P>
<P>
"But we will do everything we can to keep him. Emile has put
himself right into the limelight after his performance for England
this week, but he did nothing at Wembley that I haven't seen
before.Obviously there will be plenty of speculation about him,
simply because of who he is and the fact that he plays for us, and
that everybody else is racing after him - there is phenomenal
interest in him," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shearer to Retire from International After Euro 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- England football team captain
Alan Shearer is to retire from international soccer after this
summer's European Championships.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Shearer, Newcastle United striker, said: "After
a huge amount of thought I have decided to retire from
international football.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to play, if selected, in Euro 2000 and then bow
out so that the manager has time to plan effectively for the 2002
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I have spoken to both Bobby Robson and Kevin Keegan and they
understand my reasoning."
</P>
<P>
Shearer made his England senior debut in February 1992 at
Wembley, scoring in a 2-0 win over France.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 he won the Golden Boot as top goalscorer at Euro 96
after netting five times, against Switzerland, Scotland, the
Netherlands (two) and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, 29, has been an automatic selection for England
manager Kevin Keegan despite criticisms of his goal-scoring form.
</P>
<P>
It was Keegan as Newcastle manager who paid a record 15 million
pounds to bring the striker to the club.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, explaining his decision, said he would have to pace
himself if he was to give Newcastle full value over the remaining
four years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I want everyone to understand that I am not walking
away from a challenge. I am hugely patriotic and my time as
England captain has made me incredibly proud.
</P>
<P>
"However, I realise that if I want to give Newcastle value for
money in the remaining four years of my contract with them, I will
need to pace myself a bit more than I am able to do at the moment.
"
</P>
<P>
He added: "I am not saying that I would never play for England
again - if there was an injury crisis or real need for me to help
out, I would always be honoured to answer the call.
</P>
<P>
"However, football is about planning for the future and
hopefully my decision today will help England become even more
successful in the coming years."
</P>
<P>
Keegan also revealed he had attempted to persuade Shearer to
change his mind but insisted that "everyone should respect his
decision - I certainly do".
</P>
<P>
Shearer informed Keegan of his intention to bow out of
international football after the European Championships a full 24
hours before England played Argentina at Wembley last week.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I was very sad and I tried to persuade him to change
his mind," Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
"But I know that what makes Alan Shearer special is that he is
his own mand record speaks for itself. A total of 28 goals in 57
games for his country has been a tremendous achievement and, who
knows, the best could be yet to come at Euro 2000," Keegan said.

delighted with the three points."
</P>
<P>
A minute's silence was held before Saturday's matches as a mark
of respect for Sir Stanley Matthews, the great England winger who
died on Wednesday at the age of 85.

<P>
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police
on Sunday seized a major arsenal allegedly
belonging to the clandestine Islamic Hezbollah
group in southeast Turkey, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Gaffar Okkan, police chief in the southeastern
provincial capital of Diyarbakir, disclosed that
the arsenal of rifles, pistols and silencers was
found in the southeastern town of Mardin.
</P>
<P>
The operation was part of the month-long
nationwide crackdown on the Hezbollah
organization, which has resulted in the unearthing
of 57 corpses and arrests of hundreds of suspects.
</P>
<P>
Okkan said that the search was conducted upon
confessions made by Edip Gumus and Cemal Tutar,
two hard-core members of Hezbollah who were
captured in earlier police raids.
</P>
<P>
"We have established from ballistics tests that
50 attacks involving killings and woundings
between the years 1992 and 1995 were carried out
in Diyarbakir with these weapons," Okkan said. "In
these attacks there were 36 deaths and 36
injuries."
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-based Hezbollah, which reportedly
has no links with the Lebanese Hezbollah group
that has been engaged in guerrilla war against
Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon, seeks
to establish a fundamentalist regime in
constitutionally secular Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Its earliest victims in secret killings were
believed to be supporters of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), leading to suspicions that
the group was backed by the state. The Turkish
government has strongly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Okkan admitted that Hezbollah members had
sometimes worn police and other official uniforms
during their attacks in and around Diyarbakir and
consequently "gave the image that the state had
been behind them."
</P>
<P>
As the PKK fell at a low ebb after its leader
Abdullah Ocalan's arrest last year, Hezbollah
emerged as a major anti-government secret body.
The fact that dozens of businessmen were reported
missing late last year has prompted police to
start a major crackdown on the group since January
17.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Saudi
Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal and his visiting Syrian counterpart
Faruk Shareh on Sunday affirmed both countries' common views on the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Press Agency monitored here quoted Al-Faisal as saying
that Riyadh supports Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians in their
efforts to regain all their legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
The peace process ground to a halt as the escalation of fighting
between the Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon and the
Iranian- and Syrian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas. Israel
has launched massive air raids on Lebanese civilian targets, which
outraged the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gulf region and means of promoting
bilateral relations in various fields between Saudi Arabia and
Syria were also discussed during the meeting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister conveyed Saudi Arabia's King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz the greetings of Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad.

<HEADLINE> Demilitarization of Cyprus Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Turkish Cypriot community on Cyprus on Sunday expressed support for
the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
Izzet Izcan, general secretary of the Turkish Cypriot Patriotic
Movement, said on the sidelines of a bicommunal event, organized by
his Movement and the left-wing Greek Cypriot AKEL party, that "we
do not need an army on this island," including the British bases.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two communities on the island should be
security guarantors of each other and "that should be our target
and goal and we should work in that direction."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Cyprus "should be an independent and sovereign
state."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AKEL parliamentary spokesman Andreas Christou urged
the Cyprus government to demand the termination of alleged
espionage activities by the British bases.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bases "have been established on our territory,
against the will of the people of Cyprus, Greek and Turkish
Cypriots, and continue to operate against the interests of the
people."
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports said that the British bases were using
their monitoring network to spy on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said one of the British-American ground
satellite monitoring stations, which tapped into the world's fax,
telephone and radio exchanges, is located within the British bases
on Cyprus, cueing a media frenzy about British "spying" activities
on the island.
</P>
<P>
Britain retains two military bases in Cyprus since granting the
island independence from colonial rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island following a failed
pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Students Stage More Protests Against French PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Palestinian students
on Sunday took to the streets in the West Bank in protest against a
just-concluded visit to the Palestinian self-rule areas by French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Hebron University students set afire French national
flags and Jospin's photos, according to eyewitnesses. And the
protesters chanted anti-French slogans such as "Jospin, Take off
the Mask, Show Your Jewish Face."
</P>
<P>
The protests, which entered its second day on Sunday, were
triggered by Jospin's remarks during his visit to Israel on
Thursday that the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group was "
terrorist."
</P>
<P>
The words aroused widespread criticism by Lebanon and the whole
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning students of the Birzeit University threw
stones at Jospin and his entourage during his visit to the
university. One of the journalists was slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat apologized to Jospin at a press
conference held at his presidential office here Saturday afternoon
on behalf of himself, the Palestinian people and the university.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Jospin that the incident was totally "condemnable"
and that he had ordered the closure of the university for three
days pending investigation.
</P>
<P>
He described those who stoned Jospin as "force of darkness
rather than representatives of the Palestinian people and
students".
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police chief in the Gaza Strip Mohammed Dahlan said
that Arafat told the security agencies in the West Bank to
investigate into the incident in full within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jospin said he understood what had happened in
Birzeit, denying that the incident would affect the French-
Palestinian ties.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams U.S. Report on Human Rights Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi on Sunday categorically dismissed the
allegations made by the U.S. State Department on human rights
situation in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Terming the allegations as unfounded and biased, Asefi described
the U.S. State Department's annual report as an attempt to mislead
the world public opinion, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. administration has failed to accurately
evaluate the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The magnificent parliamentary elections (held on February 18)
with the massive turnout displayed an example of democracy and
reinforcing the law as well as respecting the nation's votes and
honoring their rights," Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. State Department has released annual report on
human rights in the world while the U.S. community suffers from the
worst kind of human rights violation, racial discrimination,
violence, torture and mistreatment of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He added that violation of human rights in the U.S. is the prime
concern of the human rights organizations and the other non-
governmental humanitarian agencies.
</P>
<P>
Human rights are always respected in the Islamic Republic of
Iran thanks to the Islamic teachings which require the Islamic
government to do so, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran respects the human rights on the
basis of its religious belief, the stipulations of the constitution
and regards it as the national and international commitment," he
said, noting that the government has put the issue of human rights
as the fundamental aspect of its platform.
</P>
<P>
The impartial international observers have admitted that the
Iranian government is committed to its obligations concerning human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman advised the U.S. statesmen to think about
improving the human rights record in their own country instead of
making biased report on human rights record in the world.

<HEADLINE> French FM Defends Jospin's Statement on Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Sunday defended the statement made by Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin on the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah, saying
that Jospin's words were founded on his "heart and conviction."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio-Television Luxembourg and LCI
television channels, Vedrine said that "extremist forces" always
want to break up the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
But he refrained from defining the actions of Hezbollah
guerrillas against Israeli troops as "terrorism," as Jospin did
Thursday in Jerusalem during his visit in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time in the Middle East that each time
when people move forward (in the peace process), you have the
extremist forces who want to break up the movement," said the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military operations in southern Lebanon
launched by Hezbollah have the clear objective of "thwarting this
perspective" of peace.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also said that the statement of Jospin does not mean
that France's position on the Middle East, which he described as
an engagement for peace, has changed.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the Socialist government wants to "give
more body and substance to the relations with Israel."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that as Israel is preparing to pull
out its troops from southern Lebanon, all the sides involved in
the conflict should refrain from taking any military action.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that some leaders in the Middle East don't know
how to seize a chance of peace after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak came to power last May.
</P>
<P>
"This hope (for peace) is in the process of turning into
impatience and worry," said Vedrine.

<HEADLINE> 33 Bus Passengers Die in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three Zimbabweans died
and an unknown number missing after a bus was swept downstream
Friday when the driver tried to cross the flooded Mudzi river,
police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the bus was
going to Rwenya, about 15 kilometers from Nyamapanda on the
northeastern border.
</P>
<P>
"When they approached the Mudzi River Bridge, the river was in
floods and the driver decided to stop briefly until the water
subsided," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However when a bus from another company crossed safely, the
passengers in the bus and those who had disembarked from the first
bus urged the driver to drive across. Unfortunately the
Chawasarira bus was swept away," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said so far 33 bodies had been recovered and 27 of these had
been identified.
</P>
<P>
There were 18 survivors from the accident, including the
driver. The conductor did not survive, making it impossible to
determine the number of passengers who had been in the bus.
</P>
<P>
Bvudzijena said passengers from the first bus who had
disembarked out of fear of their bus being swept away, had also
jumped into the Chawasarira bus as it made its fateful attempt.
</P>
<P>
Bus drivers have on numerous occasions been warned not to
attempt to cross flooded rivers, but these warnings have fallen on
deaf ears which has resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls for International Help to Put out Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia on Sunday
appealed for international help to stop the fire from destroying
the forest in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Agriculture Belay Ijigu told a press briefing
the appeal mainly focused on fire extinguishing operations with
chemicals as well as technical support.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out 17 days ago, has been rampant in the
Bale and Borena regions, some 300 kilometers south of Addis Ababa,
having destroyed about 30,000 hectares of forests.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged dry season, windy weather and the rugged nature of
the topography were among the main factors exacerbating the fire,
according to the vice minister.
</P>
<P>
He said fire breaking structures were being constructed to stop
its advance fanned by gusty winds to the Bale Mountains National
Park and Lege Denbi gold mining suburbs.
</P>
<P>
A national committee was set up and over 5,000 people have
joined the efforts to snuff out the fire, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged to Play Leading Role in ECOWAS Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A visiting senior official of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said Sunday
that Nigeria could play a leading role in accelerating the
organization's integration process.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate was speaking at the
Nigerian House of Representatives Committee on Cooperation and
Integration in Africa in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria, with the restoration of democracy after long
military rule, could play a leading role in the realization of the
objectives of the 16-member organization, most of whose programs
had been stalled by lack of leadership.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said ECOWAS, with a population of about 250 million,
must integrate its economy in order to survive in the
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only option for us if we are not to be
marginalized in the international economic arena," he said, adding
that this was the only way that Africa could overcome the legacies
of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said that the sub-region had all the ingredients for
economic progress, including the size of its population as well as
its human and material resources, which should be used to generate
the momentum for economic development.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged To Prepare WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- African countries need to
consult extensively and involve all stakeholders in preparing
their positions for the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks, a
leading Zimbabwean development consultant said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Imani Development Consultant Executive Richard Hess was
speaking at a three-day workshop organized by the Southern African
Regional Institute for Policy Studies in Harare to deliberate on
emerging trade links on the back of rapid globalization.
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be a consultative mechanism in each country to
discuss and prepare positions for negotiators, this body should
have a strong private sector representation as well as
representation from all relevant government departments," he said.
</P>
<P>
A WTO Ministerial Conference held in Seattle, the United
States, late last year was aborted after developing countries
refused to be arm-twisted into accepting the principles governing
a free global economy that they felt would prejudice them.
</P>
<P>
The WTO general council is preparing another attempt to push
its proposals through and the break should give African countries
extra time to prepare their arguments, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the agenda has not been set for any new round, dates
have already been set for commencing the previously-mandated work
in services and agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first session on agriculture is scheduled for March 20 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Stresses Traditional Rulers' Role in Social Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice President Atiku
Abubakar has called on the nation's traditional rulers to ensure
the peaceful co- existence among the diverse ethnic groups in
their domains, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Calling them custodians of the country's unique culture, he
said in Lafia traditional ruler's domain in central Nigeria's
Nassarawa State that " what has happened in Kaduna State is
something to be condemned by all decent human beings".
</P>
<P>
About 300 people died in last week's clash between Christians
and Moslems in the country's northern city Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
The NAN quoted Abubakar as saying in a turbaning ceremony
performed by the Emir of Lafia, Assarawa State, at which the
Nassarawa State's Governor Alhaji Adamu presented the traditional
ruler with the staff of office.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that irrespective of their ethnic differences and
religious background, Nigerians should live with each other in
peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Senate President Chuba Okadigbo and Speaker of the
House of Representatives Alhaji Na'abba were among the guests to

<HEADLINE> Floods in Southern Mozambique Continue to Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Flooding in the city of
Xai-Xai, capital of the southern Mozambican Province of Gaza, has
continued to worsen over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday morning, according to Radio Mozambique, the flood
waters of the Limpopo river had split the city in two, cutting off
the main commercial part of Xai-Xai from the higher part of the
city.
</P>
<P>
The city is without electricity because the floods have swamped
the Xai- Xai power station. The lack of power makes it impossible
to work electric pumps, and so shortly the city will run out of
fresh water as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those who had ignored earlier appeals from the
provincial authorities to leave the low-lying part of the city
were trying frantically to leave Xai-Xai on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A new flood peak is moving down the river. On Saturday night
this new wall of water hit the town of Chokwe on the middle
Limpopo.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that this new flood wave could bring the height of
the river at Chokwe to over 10 metres. This would be two metres
higher than the highest level the Limpopo reached during the
massive floods of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Much of the population of Chokwe had already left the town
during the flooding early this mouth. Some of those who declined
to leave then are now making their way to the town of Macia, some
50 kilometers south-west, and one of the parts of the province not
affected by floods.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Strengthens Control Over Energy Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe announced that his office has taken over the Ministry of
Transport and Energy following the resignation of Minister Enos
Chikowore on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made this announcement on Saturday night in an
interview with the Sunday Mail newspaper at the Manyame Airbase
following his tour of areas hit by floods in Chiredzi and
Beitbridge of southern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"I have accepted Minister Chilowore's resignation and the
ministry will for now work in our office," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we will continue to work on the fuel situation
and try to rectify the problem."
</P>
<P>
The country has been facing a serious fuel shortage since
December last year because of shortage of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that we should not just resolve the problem in an
ad hoc way. What we must ensure is that we have adequate fuel for
a long period and on a permanent basis," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would soon negotiate with a "friendly
country" for an arrangement to fill the strategic tanks. But he
did not specify which country, earlier reports said that South
Africa would most likely come into its help.
</P>
<P>
The solution is not in getting one or two ships bringing in
fuel or getting new lines of credit, he said, stressing that "we
have to have an assurance on fuel supplies."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the floods, the president assured the nation that
 everything possible is being done to alleviate the plight of
thousands of Zimbabweans who have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Protection Unit is now in control of the situation,
with all the troubled spots having been identified and measures
being put in place to provide distressed villagers with food,
shelter, blankets and clothes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The national death toll due to Cyclone Eline has risen to 29
and 250, 000 people have been left homeless in heavy rains.

<HEADLINE> British Officials Own Land In Zimbabwe: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
resisting Zimbabwe's efforts to compulsorily acquire land for
re-distribution because some of its top officials, including its
Minister of State in the Foreign Office Peter Hain, owns land in
Zimbabwe, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Local Government and National Housing
John Nkomo, who is also the National Chairman of the ruling party
Zanu-pf, confirmed the reports, saying that he had personally
quizzed Hain over the issue.
</P>
<P>
There has been no comment from Hain yet. However, British
Deputy High Commissioner in Zimbabwe Ian Hay Campbell said he
needs enough time to verify whether there are any British top
officials who own land in the African country.
</P>
<P>
On whether the British constitution allows foreigners to own
land in Britain, the deputy high commissioner said, "In Britain
there is no existence of anything that you can genuinely call a
constitution as one can find in other countries."
</P>
<P>
According to Nkomo, after being quizzed, Hain responded by
urging the Zimbabwean government to be forward looking instead of
reverting back to history.
</P>
<P>
"I told him that the history he wanted us to forget had a
bearing on the present status quo and that we can only solve the
present problems by addressing the injustices of the past," Nkomo
said.
</P>
<P>
Without divulging any names, Nkomo said the British government
would be embarrassed if the top officials who own land in
Zimbabwe were to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
He said it was Hain who had written letters to the
International Monetary Fund instructing the institution not to
release any funds because of alleged "lack of democracy and human
rights abuses in Zimbabwe".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War
Veterans Association Chenjerai Hunzvi Saturday said in Harare that
his association is aware that there are some British top officials
who have farms in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the war veterans are going to grab all those farms
before the general elections in April because it is their
"birthright to own it".
</P>
<P>
"We are left with no option but to take all the farms whose
owners had gone to court to resist the acquisition," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's National Museum Damaged by Heavy Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains have destroyed
books and artifacts at the Livingstone Museum, Zambia's National
Museum, according to a report by the Sunday Times of Zambia
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the 50-year old two-storey building,
which has not had a major facelift since it was built, was last
week flooded with water leaking in through cracks on the roof and
walls after four days of continuous torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
The water, which also seeped into the main library on the first
floor, destroyed hundreds of rare books dating over a century ago
and which, according to director Vincent Katenekwa, are priceless
assets because they do not have back up copies.
</P>
<P>
Several artifacts were also soaked and arrangements were being
made to have them moved to a drier building, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The most affected part is the library, we have had to move the
whole library to a smaller drier room, most of the old books and
valuable photographs need attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the leaking was compounded by the fact that the
structure had a flat roof which retained water after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
A rehabilitation project was planned in 1993 at a cost of
271,000 U.S. dollars but has since been gathering dust.
</P>
<P>
Located inside the Livingstone town, the Tourist capital of
Zambia in Southern Province, the national museum has exhibits that
record the complete history of human being in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is particularly well known for its collection relating to
the life and work of David Livingstone, including a notebook in
which the British explorer recorded the actual date on which he
first saw the Victoria Falls.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Not Allowed to Run For Third Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ruling party
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Saturday rejected proposals to amend the
Zanzibar constitution seeking to allow President Salmin Amour, a
CCM member, to run for an unprecedented third term, local media
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The CCM National Executive Committee (NEC), at the end of a
session in Tanzania's central city of Dodoma, resolved that
discussion on the possibility of amending the Zanzibar
constitution to allow for a third term of presidency will be done
after the forthcoming general elections slated for October.
</P>
<P>
The NEC has resolved to postpone discussions on proposals to
amend the Zanzibar constitution until some time after the
elections, CCM Secretary General Philip Mangula was quoted by the
Sunday Observer newspaper as saying after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
This means that Salmin is automatically disqualified from
running in this year's Zanzibar presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The NEC resolution came two days after heated debate by the
Central Committee of the NEC of CCM meeting here behind closed
doors from Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the island.
</P>
<P>
It is a semiautonomous state with its own government and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Salmin became Zanzibar President in 1990. He was reelected in
1995 after claiming a narrow victory over the opposition Civic
United Front party, which accused the then ruling CCM party of
rigging the elections.

essential drugs, medical and surgical supplies.
</P>
<P>
The strike spread to other major hospitals in the country
affecting badly operations of the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
On January 4, the striking doctors were dismissed after they

The accused tour operators are said to be advising would-be

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Fewer Parties, Restoration of People's Faith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Acting President
Vladimir Putin said Sunday that Russia should have fewer parties
and those parties should act as "a backbone for powerful national
spirit" to restore people's faith in the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Putin, addressing a conference of the Unity movement, said the
Russian people were tired of confrontational politics.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of some 200 parties in Russia is not
beneficial for its political sphere. "A working system is a system
of two, three or four parties."
</P>
<P>
"Today it is clear to all that political confrontation has had
its day in Russia. The citizens of Russia are bored with
ideological battles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 47, became acting president after Boris Yeltsin's abrupt
resignation on December 31. He is the clear front-runner in the
presidential election on March 26.
</P>
<P>
Unity, set up last autumn to back Putin's presidential bid, is
the second biggest party in the new State Duma lower house of
parliament after the Communists. It gained a surprisingly strong
performance in December's Duma elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that Unity should become a strong, nationwide party to
rival the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Unity too will become a truly representative,
strong and solid political force able to exert real influence on
the fate of the country and its regions," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Unity delegates elected Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shoigu as
its formal party leader. Shoigu, who is also minister of emergency
situations, was a founding member of Unity.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu told the delegates that support for Putin in the
presidential race is the party's "first and main task."
