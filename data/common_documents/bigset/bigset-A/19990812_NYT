   LOS ANGELES _ Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., a white supremacist
suspected in the shooting of five people at a Jewish community
center here, turned himself in to the FBI on Wednesday morning,
saying he wanted the attack to send a message to the nation,
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials also said that Furrow admitted to
fatally shooting a Filipino-American letter carrier, Joseph Ileto,
shortly after the first attack. Conviction in the death of Ileto
could carry a death penalty, since he was shot while on duty for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, surprised officials by showing up at the FBI office
in Las Vegas at 8:55 a.m., after eluding a police dragnet by taking
a taxi 275 miles across the desert, and paying a $800 fare, then
spending the night in or near the city, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow said that he fired at the day center, a federal
law-enforcement official said, because ``he was concerned about the
decline of the white race and he wanted to send a message to
America by killing Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of uncertainty about when and where he would face
charges, Furrow appeared before a federal magistrate in Las Vegas
late Wednesday and was charged with the murder of a federal
employee in the course of his duties and of being a felon illegally
in possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   He was then taken to the airport in Las Vegas and returned to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was a city of anger, fear and relief on Wednesday,
with security tightened at many Jewish organizations alarmed by the
seeming randomness of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan also sought to ameliorate the shock by
insisting people should not allow fear to change their lives. ``Let
us not let this incident cause us to lead our lives in terror,'' he
said. ``Our city is made up of people who care for each other, who
respect each other and who want our children to live their lives
without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said Furrow had been ``very cooperative,'' and that
he would be brought back to Los Angeles within a day or two if he
does not fight extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's surrender touched off a fierce behind-the-scenes
struggle over who would try him first. Los Angeles officials want
to prosecute the man they say is responsible for a crime that
shocked their city and federal officials are eager to try him on
charges that could lead to his execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles district attorney's office and the U.S.
attorney's office here said that they would hold a joint news
conference on Thursday morning to announce details of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, who lived in Washington state, has belonged to white
supremacist groups in the Pacific Northwest for several years.
After his arrest on assault charges last year, he told officials
that he had fantasized about committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   The police said he came to Los Angeles with a daunting arsenal
of weapons, including an Uzi machine gun, a high-powered rifle and
hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not detail what Furrow had told the phalanx of
local and federal investigators in Las Vegas. But one person said
police believed he had acted alone in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five people shot at the Jewish community center in
the San Fernando Valley suburb of Granada Hills, two children at a
day camp there, a receptionist and a teen-age volunteer, are in
stable condition and recovering. But a 5-year-old boy shot in the
leg and the abdomen remained in critical condition after undergoing
more than six hours of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's confession to the shooting of Ileto, 39, was a major
break, one person with knowledge of the investigation said, since
there were no witnesses to the murder, which took place on a leafy
street of ranch-style houses and horse corrals, and there was no
other direct evidence linking Furrow to it. .
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police had been baffled by the seemingly random
murder and said they did not know of any connection between it and
the shootings at the community center. A Postal Service
spokeswoman, Pamela Prince, said Ileto was a part-time Post Office
employee and was not on his regular route when he apparently just
chanced upon Furrow on a street a few miles from the community
center.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Wednesday sounded almost relieved that Furrow had not
shot more people, given the preparations he had made. ``It appears
to be an arsenal with someone who had an intent to create a
significantly larger tragedy in the city,'' said Bernard Parks,
chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center was heavily guarded on
Wednesday morning, and some of the parents insisted that, while
they were frightened, they wanted to attempt to return to normalcy
as soon as possible. Many parents and some officials struck a note
of defiance, taking pains to say that such attacks would not force
them to alter their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bendavid-Arbiv, the mother of two girls, 5 and 7, brought
her children back to the day camp on Wednesday, but admitted that
her children had been afraid. ``That's why we're here, to see that
their friends are still here and their counselors are still here,''
said Ms. Bendavid-Arbiv.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Rouss, executive vice president of the community center,
said, ``We want to show that an act of terrorism will not stop the
Jewish community in the North Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were concerns at how Furrow amassed such an
arsenal, transported them here and then vanished in spite of the
intensive police manhunt thrown up almost immediately after the
first shootings on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The spree began shortly after 10:45 a.m. Furrow strode into the
North Valley Jewish Community Center on Rinaldi Street, which is
next to an Episcopalian church in a quiet, middle-class
neighborhood, and used an Uzi submachine gun to shoot first the
68-year-old receptionist, and then the four youngsters. Police said
he shot more than 70 rounds in just a few minutes, then raced out.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that he escaped in a red van that he had purchased
on Saturday in Washington state and used to transport his arsenal.
About 20 minutes later, he abandoned the van near the Van Nuys
airport and carjacked a Toyota Corolla. About 40 minutes later,
Ileto, the postal worker, was shot in the head, chest and shoulder
and killed. There were no witnesses, but neighbors on the street in
Chatsworth, heard shots and called police.
</P>
<P>
   The police conducted a door-to-door search for the suspect
around the community center, but found nothing. The stolen Toyota
was found in the parking lot of a hotel in the same vicinity about
4 p.m. Police cleared the area and surrounded the hotel, but Furrow
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He told the FBI on Wednesday morning, law enforcement officials
said, that he paid a total of $800 to take a taxi to Las Vegas.
When he showed up at the FBI office on Wednesday morning he was
unarmed, said Sgt. John Pasquariello of the Los Angeles Police
Department, who flew to Las Vegas on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prince of the postal service said that Ileto, who was not
married and had no children, had been a letter carrier for just two
years but had received several commendations for his hard work.

CHINESE FIRM'S GIFTS TO U.S. EMBASSY OFFI CIAL DETAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Chinese corporation's top executive in Phoenix provided gifts
to a U.S. Embassy official in Beijing in an attempt to induce him
to grant visas for travel in the United States, according to a
congressional report obtained Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Republican majority staff of the House
Committee on Government Reform alleges wide-ranging misconduct by
Charles Parish, embassy consul from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' reported in March that while Parish was
the chief arbiter of visa applications in Beijing, he received
blue-ribbon treatment as a guest of COFCO's Phoenix-based
subsidiary, BNU Corp.
</P>
<P>
   COFCO is the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import
&AMP; Export Corp. ``Fortune'' magazine last year ranked the
Beijing-based corporation 309th on its list of the world's 500
largest companies. BNU operates the Chinese Cultural Center in
Phoenix, imports shoes from four company-owned factories in China,
provides consumer credit and manages property.
</P>
<P>
   Parish stayed at BNU apartment complexes in Norwalk, Calif., and
Las Vegas as a guest of BNU President Elizabeth Mann, ``The
Republic'' reported. The committee report added that he also was a
guest at an unidentified COFCO property in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, a native of China, is now a U.S. citizen and directs the
Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mann cultivated a relationship with Charles Parish as a way of
ensuring that COFCO officials received visas from the embassy,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and COFCO on Wednesday sharply denied impropriety. While
they are refusing to respond directly to questions from ``The
Republic,'' their attorney responded with a written statement
defending their acquisition of visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``BNU and COFCO are significant corporations with investments in
the Untied States and would have no reason whatsoever to obtain
visas for their limited non-U.S. staff in the United States other
than through completely legal channels,'' New York attorney Charles
J. Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the report ``filled with inaccuracies,'' Conroy said BNU
``looks forward to the opportunity of providing a full response to
these untrue allegations at the earliest opportunity and in the
appropriate forum.''
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity could come soon. Jim Wilson, a committee
investigator, said Wednesday that the congressional panel is
continuing to examine Parish's relationship with BNU and Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Committee investigators will be contacting her in the
not-distant future,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Los Angeles Times'' reported in May that Parish
acknowledged that his free stays at BNU properties ``came after he
had reversed a subordinate's decision and approved a visa request
submitted by a representative'' of COFCO.
</P>
<P>
   The report claims that Parish, who invoked the Fifth Amendment
last month in refusing to testify at a committee hearing, had
improper relationships with a variety of Chinese individuals and
corporations who applied for the coveted visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Parish's malfeasance ranges from apparent bribery, to
improper receipt of gifts and gratuities, to violation of embassy
rules regarding fraternization with Chinese citizens,'' the report
states.
</P>
<P>
   The bribery allegations stem from testimony in May by Johnny
Chung, an American citizen who has figured prominently in
allegations of illegal Chinese contributions to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Chung testified that Parish received a bagful of cash from an
executive of Haomen Beer, one of China's largest brewers, which was
seeking to expand its business to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cites information from Phoenix resident and
former COFCO executive Jianwei Ding, who once worked under Mann and
who has been waging a series of bitter legal battles with her since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report says Ding ``saw Mann pass an envelope and several
wrapped boxes to Parish while Parish was dining with COFCO and BNU
officials in both Beijing and Phoenix.'' The report provides no
further details.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ding blew the whistle on what he said was a insider
deal by Mann to buy the Cultural Center site and sell it quickly to
BNU at a $2.4 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation of fraudulent insider dealing triggered a state
grand jury investigation that was aborted after the deal was
unwound just prior to the scheduled closing.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and COFCO subsidiaries then sued Ding in Maricopa County
Superior Court, claiming he had defrauded the company of $30,000 in
a kickback scheme with another Chinese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and COFCO won a summary judgment on that claim in April. On
Wednesday, they won a summary judgment on a claim that Ding
misappropriated more than $5,000 of corporate money to attend an
investment seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the court decisions, Conroy said his clients were
``confident that the House Committee will find the same lack of
credibility (in Ding's statements to the staff) as did the Arizona
Superior Court today.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish, 52, retired from the State Department last year. &QL;

a taxi 275 miles across the desert, and paying a $800 fare, then

</P>
<P>
   When Furrow showed up at the FBI office on Wednesday morning, he
was unarmed, said Sgt. John Pasquariello of the Los Angeles police,
who flew to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow said that he fired at the day center, a federal
law-enforcement official said, because ``he was concerned about the
decline of the white race and he wanted to send a message to
America by killing Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of uncertainty about when and where he would face
charges, Furrow appeared before a federal magistrate in Las Vegas
late Wednesday and was charged with the murder of a federal
employee in the course of his duties and of being a felon illegally
in possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   He was then taken to the airport in Las Vegas and returned to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was a city of anger, fear and relief on Wednesday,
with security tightened at many Jewish organizations alarmed by the
seeming randomness of the attacks.

   The police said Furrow had been ``very cooperative'' throughout
a day of interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's surrender initially touched off a fierce
behind-the-scenes struggle over who would try him first. Los
Angeles officials want to prosecute the man they say is responsible
for a crime that shocked their city and federal officials are eager
to try him on charges that could lead to his execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles district attorney's office and the U.S.
attorney's office here said that they would hold a joint news
conference on Thursday morning to announce details of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, who lived in Washington state, has belonged to white
supremacist groups in the Pacific Northwest for several years.
After his arrest on assault charges last year, he told officials
that he had fantasized about committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   The police said he came to Los Angeles with a daunting arsenal
of weapons, including an Uzi machine gun, a high-powered rifle and
hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not detail what Furrow had told the phalanx of
local and federal investigators in Las Vegas. But one person said
police believed he had acted alone in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five people shot at the Jewish community center in
the San Fernando Valley suburb of Granada Hills, two children at a
day camp there, a receptionist and a teen-age volunteer, are in
stable condition and recovering. But a 5-year-old boy shot in the
leg and the abdomen remained in critical condition after undergoing
more than six hours of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's confession to the shooting of Ileto, 39, was a major

there were no witnesses to the murder, which took place on a leafy
street of ranch-style houses and horse corrals, and there was no
other direct evidence linking Furrow to it. .
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police had been baffled by the seemingly random
murder and said they did not know of any connection between it and
the shootings at the community center. A Postal Service
spokeswoman, Pamela Prince, said Ileto was a part-time Post Office
employee and was not on his regular route when he apparently just
chanced upon Furrow on a street a few miles from the community
center.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Wednesday sounded almost relieved that Furrow had not
shot more people, given the preparations he had made. ``It appears
to be an arsenal with someone who had an intent to create a
significantly larger tragedy in the city,'' said Bernard Parks,
chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center was heavily guarded on
Wednesday morning, and some of the parents insisted that, while
they were frightened, they wanted to attempt to return to normalcy
as soon as possible. Many parents and some officials struck a note
of defiance, taking pains to say that such attacks would not force
them to alter their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bendavid-Arbiv, the mother of two girls, 5 and 7, brought
her children back to the day camp on Wednesday, but admitted that
her children had been afraid. ``That's why we're here, to see that
their friends are still here and their counselors are still here,''
said Ms. Bendavid-Arbiv.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Rouss, executive vice president of the community center,
said, ``We want to show that an act of terrorism will not stop the
Jewish community in the North Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were concerns at how Furrow amassed such an
arsenal, transported them here and then vanished in spite of the
intensive police manhunt thrown up almost immediately after the
first shootings on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The spree began shortly after 10:45 a.m. Furrow strode into the
North Valley Jewish Community Center on Rinaldi Street, which is
next to an Episcopalian church in a quiet, middle-class
neighborhood, and used an Uzi submachine gun to shoot first the
68-year-old receptionist, and then the four youngsters. Police said
he shot more than 70 rounds in just a few minutes, then raced out.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that he escaped in a red van that he had purchased
on Saturday in Washington state and used to transport his arsenal.
About 20 minutes later, he abandoned the van near the Van Nuys
airport and carjacked a Toyota Corolla. About 40 minutes later,
Ileto, the postal worker, was shot in the head, chest and shoulder
and killed. There were no witnesses, but neighbors on the street in
Chatsworth, heard shots and called police.
</P>
<P>
   The police conducted a door-to-door search for the suspect
around the community center, but found nothing. The stolen Toyota
was found in the parking lot of a hotel in the same vicinity about
4 p.m. Police cleared the area and surrounded the hotel, but Furrow
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He told the FBI on Wednesday morning, law enforcement officials
said, that he paid a total of $800 to take a taxi to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prince of the postal service said that Ileto, who was not
married and had no children, had been a letter carrier for just two
years but had received several commendations for his hard work.

SUSPECT HAS PAST IN WHITE SUPREMACY MOVEMENT

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years ago, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. was
teaching hand-to-hand combat to young neo-Nazis at the Aryan
Nations Youth Training Camp in Idaho, an acquaintance said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even among his comrades, Furrow was considered an especially
ardent white supremacist, who believed in the violent methods of
international terrorist groups, said T.J. Leyden, a former Aryan
Nations member who trained with Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed really hard-core,'' recalled Leyden, now a
researcher for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ``You've
got to understand something: These guys think they're in a war, and
killing children is an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyden and other hate crime experts said Furrow's attack on the
North Valley Jewish Community Center was designed to trigger other
racial attacks, by example.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman may have acted on the ``lone wolf'' philosophy
popular among white supremacists, that individuals acting alone can
wreak far more damage than organized groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sending the message to other lone wolves to commit acts
of terrorism, to go out there and try it,'' Leyden said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances said Furrow's attack was a logical step for a man
who recognized his own violent tendencies and tried to commit
himself to a psychiatric hospital in October. He was discharged
when he tried to stab a staff member and pleaded guilty to
second-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I could just lose it and kill people,''
Furrow told doctors at Fairfax Pychiatric Hospital in Kirkland,
Wash., during an interview last Oct. 28, when he tried to commit
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, twisted and violent road for 37-year-old Furrow,
who grew up in Las Vegas and Metaline Falls, Wash., as a lonely,
bespectacled overweight boy teased by his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow went to Rancho High School in Las Vegas for ninth and
10th grade, in 1975 and 1977, but didn't get involved in student
groups, officials said. In 1977, his family moved to Metaline, a
small mining and timber town in eastern Washington, known as a
haven for racist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow graduated from high school in 1979 and joined the Army in
August 1980. He lasted two months _ he didn't make it through boot
camp, a Pentagon source said. His father had retired in 1977 as a
chief master sergeant in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after high school, he got involved with neo-Nazi groups
near his home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Southern California and lived in Rosemond near
Edwards Air Force Base while working on Northrop Grumman's B-2
stealth bomber program in Palmdale from 1990 to 1993 as a
manufacturing engineer, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, Furrow's involvement in the white supremacy
movement deepened.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center learned that in March 1995
Furrows ``married'' Debbie Mathews, the widow of the founder of The
Order, which follows Christian Identity beliefs that white people
are superior to Jews and nonwhites.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the marriage was legally binding, but
the ceremony took place at the Aryan Nations compound in Idaho,
where 5-foot 10-inch, 185-pound Furrow was in charge of keeping
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acted as a security guard at the Aryan Nations World
Congress in July 1995,'' said Joe Roy, director of the center's
Intelligence Project. ``At that time, he was a first lieutenant. I
understand he has since gone up in rank.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow met Mathews at the headquarters of the Aryan Nations, a
neo-Nazi and Christian Identity group based in Hayden Lake, Idaho,
according to Anti-Defamation League spokeswoman Myrna Shinbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow lived with Mathews for nearly two years in the mid-1990s
in Metaline Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were rebuffed when they attempted to interview Mathews
on Wednesday at her home in a wooded area posted with ``no
trespassing'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Furrow plunged headlong into racism.
</P>
<P>
   When authorities found what they say was Furrow's abandoned van
in North Hills, it contained boxes of ammunition, survival gear _
and a book written by the founder of the American Nazi Party.
</P>
<P>
   That book, ``War Cycles/Peace Cycles,'' was written by Richard
Kelly Hoskins, an adherent to the racist and anti-Semitic Identity
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow and Mathews broke up, and he moved back to western
Washington. Last year, Furrow tried to admit himself to a
psychiatric hospital outside Seattle, but tried to stab a staff
member, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was sentenced to 165 days in jail for attempted assault
and was released in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't come as much surprise to us that someone with ties
to a hate group is responsible for this,'' said Aaron Levinson,
director of the San Fernando Valley office of the Anti-Defamation
League.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said The Order has been active in the San Fernando
Valley through its splinter group, the National Alliance. The
National Alliance on June 24 mailed a Jewish Family in suburban
Studio City a hate crime flier and last fall was linked to graffiti
sprayed at a synagogue and anti-Semitic fliers sent to Valley
residents, Levinson said.

ANGRY MONDESI WANTS OUT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Raul Mondesi's deteriorating relationship with the
Dodgers hit rock bottom Wednesday when the right fielder said he
wants to be traded immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mondesi's reaction for being benched for the second
straight day after arriving late to the team stretch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want me here, bring in somebody else and let me
go someplace. I told my agent, `Get me the (expletive) outta here
as soon as possible,' '' Mondesi said. ``I can't take this
(expletive) anymore. I can't deal with it anymore. I was here 10
minutes before the stretch. I said, `If I don't play (Tuesday), I
don't want to (expletive) play tomorrow.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, 28, didn't start in the Dodgers' 9-7 win against
Montreal. He pinch-hit in the eighth and remained in the game after
grounding out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If that's the way you feel, I'll accept it. I want
people in there who want to play,' '' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson. ``I think he's a little confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where he's coming from. I really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Mondesi will start today in the final game of the
10-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's petulance, and the Dodgers' displeasure in him, have
been an ongoing saga since spring training. Before Wednesday,
Mondesi was upset with Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone two
weeks ago, when Malone criticized the right fielder for sitting in
the bullpen rather than returning to the dugout between innings in
a loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Malone wouldn't talk about Mondesi's demand, but sources said
the Dodgers will try to move the outfielder in the offseason.
Getting equal value for the Mondesi may be difficult, given his
hefty contract and recent play.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi will earn $9 million this season and is guaranteed $20.5
million over the next two years. He also has two options years
totaling $25 million. Some scouts are saying Mondesi is already on
the downside of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about Raul Mondesi, but I'm supportive
of Davey Johnson doing what's in the best interest of the
Dodgers,'' Malone said. ``It's not about an individual, it's about
a group of individuals. It's about a team. I'm not focusing on one
player. I'm focused on a winning team. Part of the problem is some
people don't care about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation came to a head Tuesday. Not only was Mondesi late
for the stretch, but sources said that later in the game Mondesi
didn't pinch-hit at a pivotal juncture because he wasn't prepared
to do so. Mondesi and Johnson then argued after the game in the
Dodgers' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Johnson said, ``I'm too (ticked) off to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson tried to diffuse the situation, Mondesi vented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want me to play, let me play for somebody
else,'' Mondesi said. ``If they don't want me here, get me the
(expletive) out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has believed for much of the season that he's been
singled out by Johnson and Malone. He's been upset about being
moved around in the order after he began the season batting
cleanup; several times he voiced he was upset about the way Johnson
and Malone handled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started swinging the bat better in New York, had four or
five hits and I'm not playing here,'' Mondesi said. ``I'm tired of
it. (Expletive) them. I love my teammates, I love the city, I love
the fans. If this is the way (expletive) Malone, (expletive) Davey
want it, let's go to another city. (Expletive) both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mondesi has exerted outright defiance to some of the
Dodgers' rules. He's repeatedly been late to the team stretch and
was fined for missing a mandatory workout after the All-Star break.
He sat in the bullpen in Arizona and has been fined numerous other
times.
</P>
<P>
   Through the turmoil this season, Johnson still tried to protect
him, saying he was giving Mondesi days off to rest the outfielder
on several occasions. However, sources said Mondesi has been taken
out of the lineup a few other times for not adhering to team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that Mondi is misconstruing what I'm trying to
get to,'' Johnson said. ``He is thinking about himself and not
thinking about the team and we can't have that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where it's coming from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it has to be more than his and my relationship.
There's got to be more. It's not like I've not played him or
pinch-hit for him. I've not so much as raised my voice to him. To
me there has to be more to this _ off-field problems, the agent, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has been upset with the current regime since rumors of a
deal to Cincinnati surfaced last winter. He said he was hoping the
Dodgers would trade him before the July 31 non-waiver trading
deadline. Now, he must clear waivers to be traded this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi also talked repeatedly with his agent, Jeff Moorad,
about being traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul and I have talked at length about his frustration,''
Moorad said in a statement. ``It was our hope that these issues
would not come to a head during the season. I'm sure the Dodgers
will do what they believe is best for their organization this
offseason. For the meantime, let's not lose sight of the fact Raul
has appeared to regain the playing form he showed during the early
part of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first two months of the season, Mondesi was the Dodgers'
best player. He hit .305 with 18 homers and 44 RBI through May, but
since then he's seen his average dip to .248. He's hitting .216
with six homers and 23 RBI since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi came into this season, his seventh with the Dodgers, a
lifetime .295 hitter who's averaged 25 homers and 82 RBI in his
five full seasons. He hit 30 homers each of the last two seasons.

NAVAL BASE CITED BY OSHA FOR WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whidbey Island Naval Air Station has been cited for 15 major
workplace safety violations that posed a serious health threat to
its 9,300 military and civilian employees, federal officials
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a detailed inspection of the Oak Harbor base in April, the
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration told the Navy
that it had found the violations, most involving workers operating
in confined spaces with limited ventilation where hazardous or
toxic materials are present.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the citations are for ``willful violations'' of federal
health rules, a senior OSHA official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just a case of ordinary neglect,'' said Dean
Ikeda, the safety agency's director for Washington state. ``We
believe there was some intentional disregard for the requirement
for confined space standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The citations came as a shock to the base, which has captured
numerous environmental awards in the past decade, including the
Commander-in-Chief's Installation Excellence Award as one of the
best-managed U.S. military bases worldwide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ikeda said the problem arose in large part because Whidbey
Island did not receive adequate money from the Pentagon in recent
years to implement and manage the safety program required by
federal law. ``The (financial) resources crunch has contributed to
what we saw at Whidbey Island,'' Ikeda said. ``It's not the only
reason, but it is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a very good `confined space' entry program,''
Whidbey Island base spokesman Howard Thomas said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the base has taken steps to bring it into compliance
with the federal safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   The OSHA inquiry at Whidbey Island was triggered by a large
number of workers'-compensation claims in 1998, Ikeda said. More
than 250 claims were filed from the 1,700 civilian employees at the
base, including a small number of employees who claimed injuries or
illnesses from working in such confined spaces as sewer manholes,
tanks, steam pits and liquid oxygen pits.
</P>
<P>
   These ``confined'' spaces must be clearly labeled as such, and a
formal safety and training program must be in effect for employees
who may have to work in the spaces, Ikeda said.
</P>
<P>
   The OSHA inspection of the base identified more than 3,000
spaces that met the criteria as ``confined,'' and the majority were
not properly labeled, Ikeda said. The OSHA inspection team found
the two ``willful'' violations _ the most serious charges _
involved the Navy's failure to identify the spaces and inform
employees of the strict safety rules for working in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In at least one case, an employee was injured while performing
work in a tank,'' Ikeda said. ``He was exposed to vapors from paint
he was applying, subsequently suffered dizziness and nausea and
sought medical attention. Subsequently he suffered from seizures,
and we believe that case was directly related to deficiencies in
the Navy's `confined space' program.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, OSHA can inspect and cite federal facilities
for workplace violations and impose an abatement program to curb
the problems, but cannot impose fines. Ikeda informed Whidbey
officials that had they been in charge of a civilian corporation
rather than a Navy base, OSHA would have imposed a $202,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Whidbey Island was able to obtain $10,000 to
organize a safety training program for confined space operations,
and has added two full-time specialists to the base safety office
to manage the issue. The ``confined spaces'' have been properly
identified and tagged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA officials plan to meet with Whidbey commanders on Friday to
discuss the corrections, and plan to reinspect the base next month
after a 30-day abatement period, Ikeda said.

1 KILLED, MORE THAN 100 HURT AS TORNADO STRIKES SALT LAKE CITY

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Unusual atmospheric conditions just west of the
Rocky Mountains produced a tornado Wednesday that ripped through
Salt Lake City, killing one person, injuring more than 100 others
and damaging numerous buildings in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   While meteorologists described the twister as a rare event for
Utah and as relatively benign, compared with tornadoes that
typically tear through the Midwest, it was nonetheless the first in
Utah to cause a death.
</P>
<P>
   `'In all my years in Salt Lake City, I've never seen anything
like it,'' said Mayor Deedee Corridini.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado touched down southwest of the city just before 1
p.m. Mountain time and took direct aim at the city's central
district, moving northeast toward the state Capitol. While the
Capitol was not damaged, other buildings were, including the Delta
Center, which is home to the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball
Association, and the Wyndham Hotel, where windows were blown out
and guests were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado also blew off roofs throughout the city, uprooted
trees, caused numerous gas leaks and power outages, disrupted phone
service and left debris everywhere in its wake. By Wednesday
evening, calm had set in, but the downtown area was still a
patchwork of flashing lights from emergency vehicles, wailing
sirens and blinking traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities closed off many downtown streets to keep people
from interfering with cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Collins, a deputy with the Salt Lake County sherrif's
department, said many of the injured were within a
five-square-block area that included many of the city's largest
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City police identified the dead man as Allen
Crandey of Las Vegas, Nev., who died after a steel beam fell on
him. The police said that many were treated at the scene and that
70 people were treated at hospitals. As many as 15 of those were in
serious condition, the polce said.
</P>
<P>
   Many downtown hotels were filled with visitors attending a
convention of outdoor sports retailers. When the tornado hit,
hundreds of the conventioneers were caught in two large outdoor
tents, where vendors were exhibiting their goods. Crandey, who was
helping set up booths for the convention, was killed near the
tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lunch hour. It's just a miracle more people weren't
killed and injured,'' said Sgt. Kenneth Hansen, a spokesman for the
Salt Lake City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said the the trade show, the Outdoor Retailers'
Convention, which was expected to attract 25,000, was scheduled to
open on Thursday. Had the tornado struck Thursday, the damaged tent
in the parking lot behind the Salt Palace Convention Center would
have been crowded with conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a disaster,'' Hansen said. Officers with
specially trained dogs were sent to the site of the collapsed tent
to see if workers setting up convention booths were trapped in the
debris.
</P>
<P>
   The police also said that 121 houses had been damaged and that
34 could no longer be lived in.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. William Brass, a spokesman for the Salt Lake County Fire
Department, said, ``This caught us by surprise. We get dust devils
and it gets a little windy, that's usually all. But this was no
dust devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City last had a tornado in 1968, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes are rare in Utah, which had 32 in 25 years, said Tim
Shy, a researcher at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana. Over the same 25 years, Oklahoma had 1,326.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Larry Burch, lead forecaster with the Salt Lake City office of
the National Weather Service, said the tornado was detected about
12:45 p.m. Mountain time, but the weather service's radar, about 40
miles from downtown, indicated only a severe thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:48 p.m. the weather service issued a warning of
``damaging'' winds in excess of 60 mph and large hail of up to
three-quarters of an inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed no tornadic signature,'' meaning rapid changes in
wind velocity, Burch said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service estimated that the tornado left a ``damage
track'' as wide as a half-mile and as long as two miles. It touched
ground for at least five minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Sears, general manager of the Peery Hotel downtown, said
the tornado ``was humongous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This circular cloud was right on the ground, and I could just
see big chunks of metal that were folding like cardboard,'' Sears
said. ``I walked up one block to some other hotels to see if they
were OK, and there were bricks missing out of the sides of
buildings. But then there were cars still in the parking lots right
next to them, with some of the bricks in the front seats. There was
broken glass everywhere.''

he saw the tornado when he was driving not far from downtown. ``I
looked out over the valley, and I thought those are some of the
biggest thunderstorms I've ever seen around here,'' Dwan said. ``I
saw the clouds making these swirling motions, and explosions, and I
thought, `My God, that looks like a tornado, but it can't be

POSTAL WORKER IN WRONG PLACE AT WRONG TIME

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Postal worker Joseph Ileto's luck ran out when
Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. came across him within an hour of shooting
up a day camp and hijacking a car, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto, 39, a Filipino immigrant, was assigned as a fill-in
carrier to deliver mail Tuesday in the Valley Circle Boulevard area
where the white supremacist went on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that Furrow could plan to shoot Joe Ileto. It
appears to be that (Ileto) was in the wrong place at the wrong
time,'' said David Mazer, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow surrendered in Las Vegas on Wednesday and confessed to
the shooting spree at the North Valley Jewish Community Center and
the slaying of Ileto, said Postal Inspector Pamela Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``He confessed to both shootings,'' Prince said.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto, described by family and co-workers as a model employee
with a winning smile and lively sense of humor, was found dead near
his postal delivery truck shortly before noon Tuesday, about an
hour after the community center shooting and half an hour after
Furrow allegedly commandeered a car in North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto, who lived with his brother in Chino Hills, was a
part-time postal carrier at Chatsworth's main office. He covered
other carriers' routes as a substitute. He got a 6:30 a.m. call
Tuesday telling him that he would be assigned to a route he
sometimes worked in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we were reading from a script. He had no
problems, no enemies. He just tried to be a respectable person.
Everybody loved him,'' Prince said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the gunman shot down Ileto in the driveway of a
house across the street from the Oakwood Memorial Park cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:53 a.m., the Los Angeles Fire Department received a call
that Ileto had been shot while hand-delivering a package, Mazer
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot at least six times _ in the head, chest and
shoulder, Prince said.
</P>
<P>
   A commander in the Los Angeles Police Department, David Kalish,
said ballistic evidence linked Furrow to the Ileto shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Chavez Ruiz, 40, was cleaning the corrals when shots rang
out next door.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said he heard six or seven shots that went ``tat tat tat''
like an automatic weapon. He hid behind the house until police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   When paramedics arrived, Ileto was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police and postal officials initially doubted that Ileto's
killing was linked to the Jewish Community Center shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As homicide detectives investigated the mail carrier's death,
other officers checked out a hotel where the gunman's stolen
getaway car was found, across the street from the Chatsworth Post
Office where Ileto had worked for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The case took an abrupt turn Wednesday with Furrow's surrender
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Postal inspectors sent out a memo to all Chatsworth personnel
that Furrow had confessed to both shootings, said Terri Bouffiou, a
post office spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto's family, friends and co-workers reacted with shock and
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was a very good man, very nice, quiet, an
easy-going guy. He had no enemies. He's a very good man,'' said his
29-year-old sister, Carmina.
</P>
<P>
   Another sister, Raquel, added, ``He was a very, very good
person. He was the nicest brother anybody could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ileto's father died recently, co-workers said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter carrier's customers were just as shocked.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Ellison, who lives next door to where the shooting occurred,
described Ileto as ``a very, very nice gentleman'' who occasionally
covered that route.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one who would drive up on my property to leave
me packages.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the post office presented Ileto with a special
achievement award that was approved by the U.S. postmaster,
Bouffiou said.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto worked at AVX Filters Corp. in Sun Valley as an
electronics technician from 1983 to 1997, when he resigned to work
for the postal service, said Linda Shoemake, personnel director for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to make some extra money in May, he returned to AVX part
time, said Carlos Uribe, who worked and car-pooled for years with
the man he and others nicknamed ``Joe-Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ileta was a man who would drive 20 miles out of his way to pick
up a friend for work, Uribe said. He was also an avid reader and
chess player who participated in tournaments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an all-around good guy,'' Uribe said. ``There's a lot
of tears here this morning, including from me. We're all still in
shock. We can't believe it. I just want to know why? Why would
anybody want to hurt Joe? Out of all the people in the Valley this
guy could have taken his hatred out on, why him?''
</P>
<P>
   Crisis counselors were available Wednesday at both of his
workplaces to help those who knew him deal with the murder.

DISTRACTED DODGERS RALLY FOR WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In a season that's been an abomination only getting
worse, Wednesday's 9-7 Dodgers win against Montreal seems all to
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros hit his first career grand slam and the Dodgers
rallied from a six-run deficit. Yet not many seemed to notice, or
care, particularly because right fielder Raul Mondesi turned the
Dodgers' clubhouse upside-down by stating he wants a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's demand came after an argument with manager Davey
Johnson. Mondesi was unhappy about being benched for arriving late
for Tuesday's team stretch. It came after the listless Dodgers
showed some life by winning three straight against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get something going, we get another
distraction,'' said Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of distractions, Mondesi's was at Defcon 5. It's
also shaken, and angered, an organization that's tried to gloss
over other disciplinary problems Mondesi's had.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is point people to where we want to
go,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I want to have
25 players that want to win and understand what it's like to be a
teammate and what it takes to win. We're trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players talked to Mondesi before Wednesday's game in an
effort to console him, telling him nothing could be gained by
making such a demand. But that advise went unheeded within minutes
of such discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do so much,'' center fielder Devon White said. ``He
was late for practice, and that's the reason he was benched. It's
happened a lot. Not taking sides, but if I'm managing a team... if
you're late for practice, somebody else is going to get more
playing time. And it's not the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey Johnson is fed up with that (stuff), so Davey Johnson is
doing something. Maybe it'll shake (Mondesi) up.''
</P>
<P>
   It also left teammates in an awkward position of trying to show
support for Mondesi while realizing how counter-productive the
situation is now. Mondesi's disdain for not being in the lineup
affected the Dodgers when sources said he wasn't ready to pinch hit
in a key eighth-inning at-bat in Tuesday's 6-4 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``As players, we realize and understand what's going on with
both sides and try not to say one way or another,'' Sheffield said.
``You let the organization handle it. The organization is more
important than the individual. I tried to explain to Mondi there
can be worse situations than playing with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the organization. It's us, as players. We created
this. They went out and spent the money to bring players here.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed incidental the Dodgers had their biggest rally of the
season, a six-run seventh inning to tie it 6-6 on Adrian Beltre's
two-run homer and Karros' grand slam. They scored three more in the
eighth and held on for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``(That made it) more sane around here,'' Johnson said. ``Mondi
and I have a great relationship. I'm not too sure what brought all
this on. Our relationship is a great relationship. He plays hard,
gives you all he's got and is fun to watch.''

 STATE BOARD OKs SCIENCE STANDARDS WEAKENING TEACHING OF EVOLUTION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ Conservatives won a major victory in Kansas on
Wednesday when the state Board of Education approved new science
standards that dilute the teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-4 vote, the board ignored the recommendations of a
27-member state committee of scientists that spent a year drafting
new standards. The board adopted a modified version of the
standards that leaves the question of teaching evolution to the
state's 304 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives hailed the decision as a step forward. But John
Staver, co-chairman of the committee of scientists that drafted the
standards, called it a ``travesty to science education'' and added:
``Kansas just embarrassed itself on the national stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the battle over science standards in Kansas has
attracted attention across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Staver said all of the members of the science writing committee
he had talked to _ more than half the total _ wanted their names
removed from the standards.
</P>
<P>
   They also want the board to remove the committee's dedication at
the top of the standards, which said: ``Our children are the future
of Kansas. With this document, we pass on the legacy of our own
teachers, who helped us to know that as lifelong learners of
science, we can live more productive, responsible and fulfilling
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise version approved Wednesday was put together by
conservative board members Scott Hill and Steven Abrams, and by
Harold Voth, who had been considered a moderate. Joining in the
vote to adopt it were Linda Holloway, John Bacon and Mary Douglass
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The version deletes references to macroevolution, the process of
change from one species to another, but leaves references to
microevolution, or changes within species.
</P>
<P>
   It does not prohibit the teaching of evolution. But some fear
that teachers will drop the teaching because macroevolution will
not be included on state tests. There also are concerns that groups
could bring pressure on teachers to drop evolution from the
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, board member Janet Waugh complained that she
did not have enough time to study the compromise version. She
wanted to delay the vote a month, she said, but was told before the
meeting that the vote would go forward.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Hill said that 95 percent of the material in
the compromise version was picked up from the writing committee's
fifth draft, which the board never voted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see (the other 5 percent) as that huge of a change
that we had to start the process over again,'' he said, commenting
on Waugh's request for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards simply give more latitude to local school
districts in deciding what to teach about the origin of life,
conservatives said. Most teachers probably will continue to teach
evolution, Hill predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going to get a textbook that doesn't have
evolution in it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staver, however, said he believed the changes approved remove
evolution as a unifying concept tying the sciences together. Also,
he said, they open the door for the teaching of creation science
and the theory of intelligent design, which essentially says a
higher power created the universe.
</P>
<P>
   A science specialist in the Kansas City, Kan., School District
who was on the writing committee said she fears the changes also
could open the door to the teaching of concepts that the
conservatives don't want, such as New Age philosophies or
``occult-type things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a teacher somewhere or a group somewhere who
would try to force that in,'' said Mary Blythe, district science
specialist for K-5. ``It's a sad day for science in Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who do not learn about evolution will be at a
disadvantage when they take college entrance exams, she and others
said. The conservatives, however, dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   National groups that monitor the teaching of evolution had
predictable reactions to the board vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research, a
California think tank of scientists that deals with issues of
origin, applauded the action.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil records and other facts ``seem to fit the creationism
version of history better than the evolutionist version,'' Morris
said. ``I think what the Kansas school board has done is a strong
step forward for producing good students, good thinkers and good
scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Molleen Matsumura of the National Center for Science
Education, a Berkeley, Calif., group that supports the teaching of
evolution, said no one should downplay the changes made by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the most extensive changes I have seen,''
she said. ``There were paragraphs and paragraphs that were just
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most important underlying concepts of evolution were
removed, she said, and whether they will be taught will now be the
option of local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to make it optional is like trying to make it optional
to talk about gravity in a physics class,'' she said. ``The real
losers are the children of Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution has been tested in enough states now to grab the
attention of the national media, Matsumura said. The media probably
got interested in Kansas because the debate has dragged on for
months, she said, and because even the governor came out in the
foray, expressing opposition to the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards could face a legal challenge from either the
American Civil Liberties Union or Americans United for Separation
of Church and State, a Washington group. Both expressed their
concerns to the board before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the national science organizations that supported the
writing committee's drafts want to take a close look at the changes
the board has adopted, Staver said. They want to make sure the
standards don't attribute anything to them that they disagree with.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, the board chairman, said the board planned to consult
with its attorney to see if the new standards would meet a legal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she said, the board will move forward with
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   The standards will be sent to all school districts, she said,
and teachers will be trained in them. At the same time, she said,
assessments will be built for testing the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are expected to take effect in the 2000-2001
school year.

14-YEAR-OLD REVIVES LIBRARY IN KANSAS TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TRISHA L. HOWARD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For almost 20 years, more than 1,000 books gathered dust in a
locked room that used to serve as the McLouth, Kan., library.
</P>
<P>
   Now 14-year-old Kalila Dalton, who hadn't been born when the
library closed, is making big plans for the library.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, she has invested about 20 hours a week in making
the library in McLouth, population 1,050, functional again.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Kalila wants to be a librarian. She is merely a
confessed bookworm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a book lover since time immemorial,'' she said.
``And I've always wanted to work around books.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest library to the Daltons is in Oskaloosa, almost 15
miles away. Kalila had heard about the McLouth library, once the
project of a local 4-H group. So when she wanted to volunteer at a
library, she decided to reopen the one in her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy. Kalila has had to reorganize most of the
1,300 books according to subject and alphabet. Eventually, she
said, she will arrange the catalog according to the Dewey Decimal
System.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills she used in organizing the library she learned
almost by osmosis, from going to libraries all these years,'' said
Brenda Dalton, Kalila's mother and homeschool teacher. ``That's how
she was able to categorize the books ... almost automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalila's neighbors have pitched in to help the library reopen.
McLouth residents and the library in nearby Lansing, Kan., donated
more than 2,000 books, Kalila said. She picked about 200 to add to
the library's collection. This past weekend, she sold the rest,
raising about $20 for the library's greatest need: more shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Another donor gave a computer, which Kalila will put to use for
the library's online catalog.
</P>
<P>
   And Kalila has recruited four McLouth residents, including two
of her grandparents, to keep the library open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
on Fridays and Saturdays. The library needs more volunteers if, as
Kalila wants, it is to stay open all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that hasn't stopped her from making plans. What she
wants is a separate building for the library, which is currently
housed in the town's community center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to turn it over to someone who can do this more full
time,'' she said.

UCLA SUSPENDS TWO RESERVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has suspended reserve football players Eric
Whitfield and Keith Brown for two games for using bogus disabled
parking placards.
</P>
<P>
   Their participation in the parking scam was uncovered by the
UCLA Police Department during an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal investigation against (Whitfield and Brown) is
continuing, and if we develop enough information to warrant
presenting it to the city attorney, we'll do that,'' assistant UCLA
police chief Karl Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation is now campus-wide, not just athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a tailback, and Whitfield, a safety, face the same
penalties as the players who were disciplined July 28. In addition
to the suspension, they must meet with the Chancellor's Advisory
Committee on Disability and assist in educational programs to raise
awareness about the rights of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, we have tried to be strict and fair,'' Chancellor
Albert Carnesale said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA begins practice Saturday and opens the season Sept. 4
against Boise State.

STATE LAWMAKER FACES ADDITIONAL CHARGES OVER PUBLIC FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missouri Rep. Vernon Thompson and an associate used a nonprofit
program to defraud Kansas City and a public employment agency of up
to $54,855 in public funds meant for youth and anti-poverty
programs, a federal indictment alleged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are unrelated to an indictment earlier this summer
that charged Thompson, Kevin Sallard and two other men with
conspiring to misappropriate more than $250,000 from seven public
housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. said Thompson, a Kansas City
Democrat who represents the 37th District, used his elective office
to defraud taxpayers of money meant for the public good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public servants should not enjoy this type of private gain
from the public treasury,'' Hill said. ``These moneys were designed
to go to good causes and not to line the pockets of any
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sallard and lawyers for Thompson quickly issued strong denials
and predicted their eventual acquittals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally innocent of all these charges,'' Sallard said
Wednesday evening. ``There are records to prove that, and I am
confident I'll be vindicated on all those charges. I think this is
harassment from the government to put pressure on me; for what, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Greg Vleisides, who represents Thompson, said prosecutors
had misunderstood the work his client had performed under the
contracts in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have no problem proving that the government is wrong
again,'' Vleisides said. ``They apparently do not understand how
the programs work. We will be able to prove without any doubt that
everybody was in full compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is charged in each of the indictment's 19 counts, which
include conspiracy, fraud and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Sallard faces nine fraud and money laundering counts.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that in 1996 and 1997, Thompson and
Sallard used a nonprofit agency _ the Youth Action Coalition _ to
get contracts totaling $54,855 from the office of Kansas City Mayor
Emanuel Cleaver and the Full Employment Council. They then did
little work on the contracts, the charges stated.
</P>
<P>
   Once Sallard and Thompson obtained the federal grant funds, the
indictment alleged, ``the vast majority of the funds were used for
defendants' own personal benefit and for the benefit
of...Thompson's close personal friends and family members, and not
for the benefit of disadvantaged young people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, Thompson helped found the coalition
in 1970 and has listed himself as ``executive director'' of the
organization on state disclosure documents.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver declined to comment Wednesday on specifics of the
$10,000 grant his office gave to the coalition in 1996, noting only
that he was interviewed about it by federal authorities before he
left office in April.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew of no illegal activity related to the grant and
could only tell investigators about what had happened in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have their own theories about what happened afterward,''
Cleaver said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Hill stressed that Cleaver and his
office were victims of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is important to emphasize that this case contains
no allegations of any criminal activity on the part of anyone at
the mayor's office or anyone else at City Hall,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges also allege that in 1996 and 1997, the coalition
received grants totaling $44,855 from the Full Employment Council,
a publicly funded nonprofit agency that provides job training and
employment opportunities to disadvantaged communities.
</P>
<P>
   While the coalition was supposed to have provided the agency
with ``outreach services to unemployed and underemployed
residents,'' the charges state that Thompson and Sallard again
spent most of the money on themselves and their friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Catherine Donnelly, who also represents Thompson, said
the Full Employment Council had no complaints about services
provided by the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence will show that the Full Employment Council, which
received (employment) referrals under this program, were pleased
with the performance of the Youth Action Coalition,'' Donnelly
said. ``We'll bring in witnesses to testify to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde McQueen, president and chief executive of the Full
Employment Council, could not be reached for comment Wednesday
evening.

MOST SERIOUSLY WOUNDED CHILD RECOVERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The youngest and most gravely injured victim of
the attack at the North Valley Jewish Community Center underwent a
second round of surgery for gunshot wounds Wednesday but was
fighting back to health.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, is listed
in critical condition. He remained on a ventilator and under
sedation in the pediatric intensive care unit at Childrens Hospital
Los Angeles, but was alert and responsive when awake, said hospital
spokesman Steve Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing as well as we could hope for at this point in time
and we just have to be patient and see how he responds to the
injury,'' said Greg Tiao, the chief surgical resident at Childrens
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was struck by bullets to the hip and thigh when a lone
gunmen burst into the center and blasted a room full of children
with about 70 gunshots. Washington resident Buford O'Neal Furrow
Jr., 37, admitted to the rampage when he surrendered Wednesday
morning in Las Vegas, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old boy was transferred to Childrens Hospital shortly
before midnight Tuesday after six hours of surgery at Providence
Holy Cross Medical Center to repair damage to his upper and lower
intestines caused by a bullet that tore through his hip and into
his abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Wednesday he was recovering well.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart is working well, his breathing numbers are good, his
kidney function is good,'' Tiao said. ``So those are some of the
things we look for in the acute, immediate phase after surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors operated on the boy for about 45 minutes Wednesday,
installing four steel pins in his shattered left thigh bone, said
orthopedic surgeon Richard Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   He said the leg should heal in 12 to 16 weeks, after which
doctors will remove the pins. He said the boy should recover full
use of his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Tiao said doctors hope to ease him off the ventilator and allow
him to resume eating in the coming days, but are still guarding
closely against potential infections from the gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another gunshot victim, 6-year-old Joshua Stepakoff, was
airlifted to Childrens Hospital on Tuesday after suffering gunshot
wounds to his hip and left calf. The bullet to his hip lodged
beneath the skin and was removed in the emergency room Tuesday, and
doctors fitted his leg with a walking cast.
</P>
<P>
   He was listed in good condition Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is getting into the mode of walking with support and is
starting to eat,'' said Tiao, who said the boy was being held for
antibiotic treatment and would likely be released within days.
</P>
<P>
   The families of both boys declined to comment directly, but
Stepakoff's parents issued a written statement through the
hospital, acknowledging the widespread concern for their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to thank everyone for their prayer's and
encouragement,'' they stated. ``Our son is recovering well. His leg
is in a cast and he is comfortable. He is playing Nintendo with his
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful to the paramedics, police and everyone who has
taken care of our son.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Finkelstein, a 16-year-old camp counselor, was treated for
two gunshot wounds to her upper and lower right leg at Kaiser
Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills, but suffered no
serious bone or vascular damage and was in very good condition,
said Shirley Suda, assistant area medical director for Kaiser
Permanente, Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Suda said Finkelstein may be released today or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll have tenderness for a while, but she's a very motivated
patient,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Chatsworth High School yearbook identifies the
teen-ager as a leader of the junior varsity softball team, serving
as the team's captain and first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   She also is a member of the steering committee for the junior
class.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein was surrounded by family and friends who were
encouraging her and helping her move around, Suda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very concerned about the other children who were
injured in this trying event,'' and relieved and comforted that the
suspect was arrested, Suda said.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old boy, who was listed in very good condition at
Granada Hills Community Hospital, was expected to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Shalometh, the Jewish Community Center's receptionist,
was treated and released Tuesday for bullet wounds to her back and
left arm.

SEDALIA TYSON POULTRY PLANT SPAWNS INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal justice officials in Kansas City have launched a
criminal investigation of the Sedalia Tyson plant, one of
Missouri's largest poultry processing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal search warrants were served last week at two facilities
of the plant in Dresden, Mo., which is just outside Sedalia.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal or other charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for evidence of suspected violations of the
federal Clean Water Act,'' said Chris Whitley, a spokesman for U.S.
Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. Whitley said he could not say what
searches of those facilities uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court affidavits filed in support of the search warrants
remain under seal because of the ongoing federal investigation,
Whitley said. He could not predict when the federal investigation
might be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Several agencies _ the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, the Missouri Department of
Conservation and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources _
participated in the Aug. 5 search.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson Foods Inc., based in Springdale, Ark., released a public
statement on Wednesday about the federal search of its Sedalia
plant. The search began about 9:30 a.m. and ended about 5 p.m.,
Tyson stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Tyson Foods, we are committed to protecting the environment
in and around Sedalia, as well as all of our other locations,''
Tyson stated. ``We are also committed to full compliance with all
local, state and federal laws and regulations, especially those
dealing with the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Tyson added that the company, with a few
exceptions, has a good environmental compliance record in Sedalia.
``When we have had a problem, we have always worked with the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources to resolve the problems
and mitigate any impact on the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials in Kansas City and Missouri Department of Natural
Resources officials in Jefferson City declined to comment on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But state records of violations at the Sedalia plant show
numerous instances in which Tyson failed to comply with
requirements in its clean-water discharge permits _ one as recently
as last week, according to state records.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in 1997, once in 1998 and, most recently, on Aug. 6 _ the
day after the federal search _ Missouri regulators cited Tyson for
violations of its wastewater discharge permit.
</P>
<P>
   One notice of violation can cite numerous illegal discharges
over several days. The most recent violation, for example, cited
failures to meet permit limits on July 7, July 14 and July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal Clean Water Act, some violations are pursued
by regulators as civil matters for which the state seeks penalties.
But the federal act also provides for criminal prosecution in cases
where operators negligently or knowingly pollute streams or sewer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Sedalia plant has a permit to discharge into a branch _ now
known as Tyson's Branch _ of Little Muddy Creek. Missouri
Department of Conservation studies have shown that Little Muddy
Creek has been seriously degraded by pollution from the Tyson
plant, said Scott Dye, agriculture coordinator of the Missouri
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely high levels of phosphorous, a pollutant that is
commonly associated with pollution from animal wastes, were found
in Little Muddy Creek, Dye said.
</P>
<P>
   Dye also pointed to the federal search of Tyson as more evidence
that Missouri regulators are not enforcing the federal Clean Water
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that it appears that the federal government
has to come in and clean up Missouri's messes,'' Dye said. ``It's
embarrassing. Why can't we clean up our own messes?''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, federal officials announced they had launched their
own investigation of Premium Standard Farms, Missouri's largest hog
producer. The federal investigation came just days before Missouri
Attorney General Jay Nixon announced a settlement with Premium
Standard of its past water pollution violations. In return, the
large hog producer promised to pay up to $1 million in fines and
install up to $25 million in new pollution-control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Missouri attorney general's office declined
to comment Wednesday on the Tyson case.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, Nixon negotiated a state consent decree
that resulted in Tyson Foods paying more than $64,500 in penalties
and other costs to resolve alleged water pollution violations since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The state alleged excess ammonia and high temperatures in the
creek, resulting from the Tyson discharges, violated the wastewater
permit.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyson plant employs more than 1,000 people in its Sedalia
plant. It operates a similar-size plant in Noel, in southwest
Missouri.

BOARD'S VOTE ON EVOLUTION WILL HAVE SMALL IMPACT, SCHOOL OFFICIALS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A vote Tuesday by the Kansas Board of Education may exclude the
theory of evolution from state assessment tests but apparently will
have little impact on area schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The teaching of evolution in classrooms is likely to go on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We think evolution is a valid subject to be taught in
classes,'' Kansas City, Kan., School District President Ray Daniels
said. ``I hope we continue to use it as we have used it and teach
it as we have been teaching it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state board voted 6-4 to leave what to teach on the
controversial subject up to local school boards. However, Education
Commissioner Andy Tompkins said he believed new science standards
will de-emphasize evolution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The standards are used to prepare state assessment tests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While state assessment tests are one consideration schools use
to shape curriculum, there are several others. School districts
also gear curriculum to prepare students for college work and for
standardized tests such as the American College Test and the Iowa
Test of Basic Skills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our curriculum is based on both state and national
standards,'' Olathe School District Superintendent Ron Wimmer said.
``You have to consider all standards in relation to the body of
knowledge students need to know to adequately prepare them for the
future.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wimmer said it was too early to say how the state board vote
would affect what is taught in Olathe schools, but such
determinations would be made in coming weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   School boards have the role of approving curriculum, but
administrators and teachers play the leading role in shaping
curriculum. &QL;

KANSAS REGULATORS POISED TO TOSS OUT KEY KCP&AMP;L-WESTERN MERGER
TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas regulators are poised to make big changes in the proposed
merger of Western Resources Inc. and Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.
before approving the deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three members of the Kansas Corporation Commission said
Wednesday that they would not support an agreement that was worked
out in May by their staff and the two utilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners were critical of a key provision in the
agreement that would recover from Kansas ratepayers $300 million of
the acquisition premium that Western is paying for KCP&AMP;L. All three
commissioners said that was unacceptable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say from the get-go I had some serious
reservations,'' said Cynthia Claus, one of the commissioners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners' views, which were heard for the first time
Wednesday, raised questions about the merger's fate. Both utilities
have previously said the merger could be completed only without
serious regulatory changes in how the deal's costs were recovered.
Neither KCP&AMP;L nor Western would comment Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But others, who have been critical of the agreement between the
commission's staff and the two utilities, said the commissioners'
views indicated that consumers would get a better deal if the
merger occurs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory for consumers,'' said Walker Hendrix, counsel
for the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board, which represents
consumers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Zakoura, an attorney for the group Kansas Industrial
Consumers, which had also objected to the staff agreement, said the
commission appeared to be leaning toward a more equitable division
of any benefits that would accrue from the merger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all we've ever asked for,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three commissioners met in Topeka to give direction to their
attorneys, who will write the order approving or rejecting the
proposed merger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners had not discussed their views, even with one
another, before the meeting Wednesday. An order on the merger could
be issued by late September. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Wine, the commission's chairman, said that the changes
contemplated were not ``deal killers'' but that it was clearly not
in the public's interest to approve the merger under the terms
agreed to by the commission's staff and the utilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Kansas Corporation Commission reopened the record
to add as evidence the Missouri agreement on the merger. Missouri
does not intend to allow its ratepayers to be charged any of the
acquisition premium, which is the amount of the sale price over the
book value. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western objected to putting the Missouri agreement in the record
and said unfavorable treatment of the merger could cause its two
electric utilities, KGE and KPL, to eventually be sold to an
out-of-state company. Western also said it was unfair to compare
the Missouri and Kansas agreements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wine said Wednesday that while the Kansas agreement was not
unreasonable, the Missouri agreement showed ``there is a better
way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas agreement would have allowed a rate increase
moratorium while the merged company kept any savings from the
merger, which is similar to the Missouri agreement. But after four
years, when the moratorium would be lifted in Kansas, $300 million
of the acquisition premium would be charged to customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners said they did not object to the merged company
reaping some of the benefits from cost savings that could be used
to pay the premium. But putting the $300 million in the rate base
was going too far. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An alternative suggested by one commissioner, Brian Moline, was
to have a rate case to ensure that Westar, the name of the company
that would absorb KGE, KPL and KCP&AMP;L, was not ``overearning.''
Westar would then be allowed to keep any cost savings for an
unspecified number of years, but could put none of the acquisition
premium in the rate base. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners are to meet next week to further discuss the
issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of the new approach, the $45 million in credits that
Kansas ratepayers were to receive under the staff agreement could
be omitted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix said that benefit, which would have been worth about $1
a month per consumer during the moratorium, would be far outweighed
by putting more of the risks of paying for the deal on the merged
company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The moratorium shifts the risks back,'' he said. &QL;

HELLING'S 6-HITTER CARRIES RANGERS (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Billy Loes, who won a career-best 14 games as
a 23-year-old pitcher for the 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers, once explained
his lack of desire to become a 20-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win 20 games,'' he said, ``they want you to do it every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Rick Helling, a 20-game winner last year,
appreciates Loes' candor. Helling _ who pitched a six-hitter as the
Rangers defeated Detroit, 8-2, last night _ might be pitching
better than he did last season but he almost surely won't win 20
games. Now 9-7, he has only nine and perhaps 10 starts remaining
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand what he meant,'' Helling said of Loes'
one-line jewel, ``but I don't put that kind of pressure on myself.
If the fans or the media don't think I'm pitching as well as I did
last year because I'm 9-7 instead of 15-7 at this point in this
season, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But they would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitching better than he did last year,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``His numbers are better. A pitcher has no control over
his wins and losses. The only number a pitcher has control over his
earned-run average.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling went 20-7 with a 4.41 ERA and six no-decisions last
year. This year, his ERA is 4.18, but he has nine no-decisions. The
Rangers are 6-3 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Run support has been the problem. Last year, the Rangers'
offense provided 6.61 runs per nine innings in support of Helling,
helping him become only the 12th 20-game winner with an ERA over
4.00.in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Only four American League pitchers _ Boston's Tim Wakefield
(7.29), New York's David Cone (6.89) and David Wells (6.84) and the
Rangers' Aaron Sele (6.69) _ received better run support per nine
innings than Helling (6.61) did a year ago.] Helling entered last
night with 4.67 runs of support per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Rangers provided plenty of support, scoring five
runs in five innings against Tigers starter Willie Blair (1-9),
including solo home runs by Rafael Palmeiro and Roberto Kelly. ``We
got the five runs early, and he did the rest,'' Oates said of
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers managed their two runs on solo homers by left fielder
Juan Encarnacion and second baseman Damion Easley. Meanwhile, the
Rangers' Nos. 7-9 hitters _ Kelly, Royce Clayton and Goodwin _ kept
the Tigers busy by combining for seven hits, five runs and five
runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to do some things down there in the dungeon,''
Clayton said. ``We can contribute by getting on base and doing some
running. We can put some fear in people from down there. We take a
lot of pride in what we do. It's somewhat of a challenge, but it's
important to have some guys down at the bottom who can
contribute.''

Jimmy Sexton, the agent for Rockets forward Scottie Pippen, says
Pippen would like to be traded to the Los Angeles Lakers to be
reunited with longtime coach Phil Jackson.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A source close to the Rockets' discussions with Pippen said the
perennial All-Star forward has asked Robert Barr, Rockets senior
executive vice president for basketball affairs, to attempt to
trade him to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Barr resigned Wednesday, however, and would not comment about
discussions with players. The source said Barr's resignation would
intensify Pippen's interest in leaving the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of the Lakers has been talked about,'' Sexton said.
``There have been discussions with the two clubs. They told us that
the Rockets have some distance between the offer and what the
Rockets would be willing to do.''

   Sources have said the Lakers have offered forwards Glen Rice and
Robert Horry for Pippen, and the Rockets have repeatedly turned
down that deal. There would have to be additional adjustments made
to the offer to offset the $14.795 million of salary-cap space
Pippen currently assumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Phil Jackson have an extremely close relationship from
11 years working together day in and day out (with the Chicago
Bulls),'' Sexton said. ``Scottie is an attractive piece of the
puzzle for a lot of teams, but it probably would not be an issue if
Phil Jackson was not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not anything against the Rockets or any coaches with the
Rockets' staff. It's just about the very close and unusual
relationship with Phil Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich said he and Pippen have discussed Pippen's role
for next season, but the Rockets coach would not say if the team
would attempt to move Pippen, citing the team's policy about not
commenting on player personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't talk about things we said in private,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``Scottie and I talked about a lot of things, and I listened
to him and asked for his ideas. I don't want to get into what
exactly we said.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said Tomjanovich had assured Pippen the Rockets would
move to a more up-tempo style better suited for Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rockets in 1999, Pippen averaged 14.5 points per game,
his lowest scoring average since his rookie season of 1987-88. As a
Rocket, Pippen made a career-low 43.2 percent of his shots,
averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists and was named to the NBA
All-Defensive first team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be lying if I told you Scottie was not extremely
frustrated playing in that system last season,'' Sexton said. ``I
don't think he could make it another year like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they did say they would play a more up-tempo game with
more movement and motion, running up and down the floor. Now, you
have one of the best players in the game throwing in entry
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have not made any player moves in the offseason.
They met with Jazz guard/forward Shandon Anderson last week.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a sign-and-trade agreement with the Jazz, the Rockets
could offer Anderson only the $2 million veteran's exception, less
than half the offer Anderson has received from the Jazz. If he
signs for the exception, Anderson would have to play three full
seasons before he would have ``Larry Bird'' free-agent rights. Only
then could a team exceed the salary cap to re-sign Anderson at a
level high enough to make up for several seasons playing for a
contract below market value.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, sources said, is considering offers from the Pacers,
Spurs and Clippers, in addition to the Jazz and Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to sign Clippers forward Rodney Rogers, who signed
with the Suns, the Rockets have worked toward signing their own
free agents, primarily Charles Barkley and Sam Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, acquired in a sign-and-trade agreement with the Bulls in
January, has four more seasons remaining on his contract with the
Rockets.

CRENSHAW IRKED AT CUP PAY ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ U.S. Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw sounded off
yesterday against the play-for-pay stance for Ryder Cup competitors
espoused by Tiger Woods and David Duval, the top two players in the
world golf rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's comments came in the wake of a Tuesday meeting in
which Ryder Cup organizers assured top American players that their
input would be sought in deciding which charities would benefit
from the projected $23 million profit the 1999 event is expected to
generate. The event is scheduled Sept. 24-26 in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval began pounding the drum for player payments, or
at least a say in charitable contributions, after last week's
``Golf Digest'' report that the 1999 Ryder Cup will net $63
million, including $23 million in profit for its organizing body,
the PGA of America. As has always been the case in the Ryder Cup,
competitors will not be paid for their services. But they are
scheduled to receive a $5,000 travel stipend.
</P>
<P>
   In Crenshaw's estimation, the prestige of representing one's
country in the biennial competition should be compensation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally disappointed in a couple of people that were in
that meeting. I mean that. And they know who they are,'' Crenshaw
said. ``Whether some players like it or not, there are some people
who came before them that mean a hell of a lot to this game. And it
burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can't show up and you can't play for your country, if
that's not reward enough, that's when my heart bleeds for the game
of golf. I came away from that meeting a little empty. If playing
for your country isn't a reward, I don't know what is. It's a duty,
I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, 47, cited Hall of Famers such as Byron Nelson, Ben
Hogan and Arnold Palmer as willing Ryder Cup volunteers from
yesteryear who ``provided a few fruits and rewards'' that current
golfers enjoy and _ in some cases _ take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy called ``the Ryder Cup'' an exhibition and he hasn't
even played in it,'' Crenshaw said, referring to Duval. ``It's not
an exhibition. It's an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 23, and Duval, 27, could not be reached for reaction
after Crenshaw's comments.
</P>
<P>
   But both reiterated their pay-for-play stance in Tuesday
interview sessions, with Woods calling for players to receive
between $200,000 and $500,000 for their Ryder Cup participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I would donate all of it to charity. But I think it
should be up to the player's discretion what they want to do with
it,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiment leaves Crenshaw shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the other generation,'' said Crenshaw, who stressed
that the issue would not distract the U.S. team. ``I'm extremely
sentimental and I get emotional talking about this. I can't help
but state my viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difference of opinion with his top two players,
Crenshaw said: ``I think all of those guys are intent on doing
their best in Boston. There's no conflict among the players.''

   LOS ANGELES _ In announcing the arrest Wednesday of Buford
O'Neal Furrow Jr., Mayor Richard Riordan praised the effort of city

respect each other and who want our children to live their
childhoods free of fear.

TMS NOT IN SMITH'S OFFER TO GET 2ND DATE FOR VEGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Simon Gonzalez 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway received its initial
Winston Cup date when track owner Bruton Smith closed down North
Wilkesboro Speedway and NASCAR officials shifted one of the two
races at the North Carolina track to the new facility in far north
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the motorsports mogul whose Speedway Motorsports Inc.,
owns six tracks with Winston Cup dates, is ready to use the same
tactic to secure a second stock-car race for one of his tracks. But
this time TMS wouldn't be the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials want Smith to make improvements to Sears Point
Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., especially to the garage area. Rather
than sink more money into that track, Smith would shift the race
date to one of his other facilities, Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR is getting very frustrated, and I guess you could say
we are too, and we're ready to move that event to Las Vegas,'' said
Smith, who was at TMS yesterday to announce the construction of a
four-tenths-mile dirt track that will play host to two World of
Outlaws races next year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he still wants two Cup races per season in Fort
Worth. However, he's waiting for NASCAR to create a second date for
TMS.
</P>
<P>
   The track deserves another race on its merits, Smith contends.
Crowds of 150,000-plus attended the first three Winston Cup events
at TMS, and the facilities for drivers and spectators are as good
as any on the circuit, and better than most.
</P>
<P>
   More important, because TMS gained its place on the Winston Cup
calendar when Smith closed North Wilkesboro, NASCAR never has given
the track a race. Smith said he has been told that eventually will
be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR owes us this date,'' Smith said. ``They've promised
repeatedly, repeatedly, we need to be in Texas twice. For three
years now we've been promised this date. We're still waiting for
them to fulfill that promise.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have a long wait. Dates figure to continue to be hard
to come by with new tracks either under construction or in the
planning stages in Kansas City, Mo., Chicago, Denver and
metropolitan New York.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, though, has a solution: Move races from smaller tracks
that currently have two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see some dates moved from where they don't
belong now,'' he said. ``There's dates out there that don't belong
there. I'm not going to name them, but people know where they are.
I think you'll see some movement there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving dates is what he wants to do with Sears Point and Las
Vegas Motor Speedway. But even if NASCAR lets him _ and the
organization's stance is that the dates are NASCAR's, not Smith's,
to give _ it wouldn't benefit TMS.

DICKINSON THEATRES CEO CREDITS NEW HABITS FOR COMPANY'S
TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten months ago, Dickinson Theatres was failing financially. It
was slow to pay vendors, who began pulling orders. Staff meetings
lasted only 15 minutes because employees wouldn't talk to one
another. Theater managers thought it was them against the company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Wood Dickinson ``blew up'' the company, dismissing almost
half the corporate staff, including most of the department heads.
His plan was to reorganize and renew his company using the
best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as his
guide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to turn a traditional command-and-control,
low-trust business into a high-trust, open-communication business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was extremely nervous about what we'd done,'' said
Dickinson, chief executive officer of the company, which is based
in Mission. ``From the outside, it looked sudden. But I saw it
coming for a year. I blew up the company so I could put it back
together differently.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dickinson Theatres will see some of the fruits of the
reorganization when it opens the Dickinson EastGlen 16 Theatres and
FunHub. The new Lee's Summit theater has two private-screening
rooms and an indoor entertainment center with arcade machines and
pool tables. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Covey's 7 Habits is designed to get people focused on
what they should be doing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common sense, but not common practice,'' Covey said in a
recent interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Covey's book has been a best seller for more than a decade. More
than 20 million copies have been sold in 32 languages. His latest
book, Living the 7 Habits, includes a profile of Dickinson
Theatres' turnaround. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson Theatres was founded by Wood Dickinson's grandfather
in 1920. When Wood Dickinson took over the company in 1992, it was
challenged on nearly every front by the much larger theater chains.
The company needed to become more innovative to compete. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a command-and-control-type management structure: `Do
what you are told. Wait _ don't do any more until you are told,' ''
Dickinson said. ``We weren't trying to get people in the field to
think independently, act independently. They are there every day,
but we were running it more like we knew what was best.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Theater companies also felt pressured to expand as fast as they
could and worry about financing later. After a slow year,
Dickinson's expansion program was outpacing its financing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wood Dickinson tried other management programs but found they
didn't build trust among employees. To build trust, all sides must
have the character and competence to do what they promised they
would do, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Would a theater manager trust me to pop the popcorn today? No,
I would burn it. I haven't done it in years,'' Dickinson said.
``They had been making bad decisions, spending too much money here
and there. So we had to look at the reason for the problems, fix it
and build that trust.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The family-owned Dickinson company also had become top-heavy.
The management setup made it difficult for theater managers to
respond quickly to challenges. Corporate managers had no clue what
was going on in the individual theaters, yet they were dictating to
the theater managers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson fired 17 of the 36 corporate staffers, including most
department heads. John Hartley was named president, the first
nonfamily member to preside over the company. But Hartley was
better at numbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to put the company back in alignment, no matter
what,'' Dickinson said. ``Everyone was touched by this, including
me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson Theatres sold nine properties, including two in
Overland Park, and paid off much of its debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson employees are now working on a new mission statement
proclaiming that employees will be their own boss and management
will be their coach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas in the statement: Happiness is contagious. Employees
at all levels are part of the company family. The company must
communicate with employees honestly, through good times and bad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One particularly troubled property was the Olathe Landing
theater. The work environment was so hostile that a good general
manager quit. So Andrew Armstrong, director of theater operations,
put 7 Habits to work there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong sat down with employees and went over procedures
designed to make the theater operate more efficiently. Armstrong
let employees know what was expected and what resources would be
available to help them do their best. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's win-win or no deal,'' Armstrong said. ``If the employee
is not going to do the job, then you lose and they win.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once new procedures were in place, the employees won because
they got off at least an hour earlier Fridays and Saturdays.
Dickinson won because the theater was cleaner and payroll costs
were lower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wood Dickinson first used 7 Habits when the company was sued
several years ago by two hearing-impaired teen-agers who wanted
sign language interpreters in the theaters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson took the lawsuit personally and was angry, he said,
because the company had long been ahead of the curve in
accommodating customers with special needs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But then he decided to sit down with the teen-agers. (Habit 1:
Be proactive.) He listened to what they had to say about his
business. (Habit 5: Seek first to understand.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson wanted to find a solution that would be an alternative
to either giving in to their demands or fighting the teen-agers.
(Habit 4: Think win-win.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both sides wrote down their goals. (Habit 2: Begin with the end
in mind.) Both sides wanted all customers to be able to enjoy the
movies, eat popcorn, drink soda pop and pay a reasonable price for
the experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson also wanted to make a reasonable profit, and the
teen-agers agreed. Now the two sides were working together for a
common goal. The team eventually came up with a special showing
with sign language interpreters. (Habit 6: Synergize.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire relationship changed when the two opposing sides
felt they were being understood,'' Dickinson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson Theatres now has more than 175 screens in Missouri,
Kansas and Oklahoma. It plans to expand outside larger metropolitan
areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Covey's ``Life is Short,'' a two-and-a-half minute trailer, is
playing at all area Dickinson theaters. The video tells viewers
they need to do four things in life to live it to its fullest:
live, love, learn and leave a legacy. Otherwise they will die
unfulfilled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adversarial staff meetings are a thing of the past at the
theater company, replaced by a team approach, Dickinson said.
Unjustified criticism is out; creative suggestions are welcomed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more worry about protecting one's turf,'' Dickinson
said. ``Instead the whole philosophy is, `How can we improve
together?' '' &QL;

SUSPECTED GUNMAN HAD THREATENED VIOLENCE AGAINST HIMSELF, OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nine months before Buford O. ``Neal'' Furrow Jr.
allegedly sprayed bullets into a Los Angeles-area Jewish community
center, a Seattle jail psychologist pushed for him to be committed
to a mental health facility.
</P>
<P>
   His family supported that, telling a bail bondsman who posted
the $15,000 bond that they ``didn't feel fit to have him released
to the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The family wanted him in treatment,'' said Troy Hanson, the
bail bondsman.
</P>
<P>
   A King County deputy prosecutor on Nov. 2 also pressed for
incarceration and treatment after he threatened mental health
workers, saying Furrow, 37, posed a ``grave risk of danger to
himself and society should he be released,'' court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, wanted in the shooting of five people, fled to Las Vegas
in taxis and Wednesday morning walked into an FBI office there and
confessed, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was his second in less than a year. In October, he
was arrested for threatening two workers with a knife at a mental
health center in Kirkland, Wash., a suburb of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow admitted to using a knife to mutilate his own finger and
slice open his forearm. He also had warned that he fantasized about
killing himself and shoppers at Alderwood Mall in Lynnwood, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy laws in Washington state block release of mental health
treatment records. However, court records show Furrow also was
treated at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center after his October
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A condition of his sentence required him to continue to take
prescription medication and to stop drinking.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrested him after he brandished a knife at staff of
the Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in Kirkland last October, Furrow
had four knives, a 9mm pistol and a handcuff key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a white seperatist (sic),'' Furrow wrote in his statement
to police after the hospital incident. ``I've been having suicidal
and homicidal thoughts that I would kill my ex-wife and some of her
friends then maybe I would drive to Canada and rob a bank. I wanted
the police to shoot me.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... Sometimes I feel like I could just loose (sic) it and
kill people. I also feel like I could kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's former employer in Colville in Eastern Washington said
he almost expected to see his old hydraulic shop assistant in the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised at all this morning when I saw his picture
on TV,'' said Dan Villers, his boss at LaDuke and Fogle Equipment,
a Colville farm machinery company. ``Whenever I saw or heard
something about hate groups, I always expected to see him on the TV
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's surrender ended a manhunt that began with Tuesday's
assault on the Jewish community center. An hour after the attack,
police say, Furrow allegedly shot and killed a Los Angeles postal
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI and law enforcement agencies piece together Tuesday's
crime spree, a more complete picture of Furrow is unfolding. It is
a portrait of a man with extreme ideological beliefs, driven by a
deep hatred toward others and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal records in Washington, Idaho and California _ the
states where Furrow lived most of his life _ showed only the
second-degree assault conviction in King County last fall, and two
citations for driving without a license in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   What the records don't show is Furrow's extensive involvement
with white separatist groups. Furrow, by all accounts, was proud to
be white, and he sought out others who shared his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Up until last year, Furrow lived with the widow of one of white
supremacy's modern martyrs in tiny Metaline Falls, located in the
northeast corner of Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Mathews, Furrow's companion from 1995 to 1998, was the
widow of Robert Mathews, who died in a shootout with police on
Whidbey Island in 1984. Mathews had built a stronghold on the
island that was the meeting place for The Order, a white
supremacist organization he founded.
</P>
<P>
   After Mathews' death, Furrow and Debbie Mathews married in a
ceremony performed by Pastor Richard Butler, patriarch of the Aryan
Nations compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources described the marriage as a way of providing
Mathews' son, Clint, with the father figure whom the boy had lost
in the Whidbey Island shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Outside her house in the woods on Wednesday _ posted with three
no trespassing signs _ Debbie Mathews refused to talk to reporters.
She makes crafts from local products and sells them in town.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday from his compound, Butler
said he married Furrow and Debbie Mathews sometime in 1996, though
the union was not recorded with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said Furrow may have attended services at his Church of
Jesus Christ Christian (Aryan Nations) a few times several years
ago, but he did not know him well.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow may also have served as a security guard during the
group's Aryan World Congress gatherings in the mid-1990s, he said.
Furrow was pictured working as a security guard at the Aryan
Nations National Congress in Hayden Lake in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might have motivated Tuesday's shootings, Butler
replied: ``The war against the white race. There's a war of
extermination against the white male.''
</P>
<P>
   But Furrow was easily angered, as well.
</P>
<P>
   He `` had a violent temper,'' said Meda VanDyke, who described
herself as a 20-year friend of Debbie Mathews. The couple broke up,
she said, because, ``he wanted to control everything and tell her
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crawford, the research director for the Coalition for
Human Dignity, a Northwest group that documents hate groups, said
Debbie Mathews still has a very high standing among violent white
supremacists. ``She was the wife of the premier martyr for
anti-black, anti-Semite hate groups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's bloodshed also shocked those who knew another side
of Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were ``wonderful people,'' said junior-high
schoolmate Loni Merrill. She said Furrow, who grew up in Olympia,
used to get teased about his allergy medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a loner, a kind of bookish guy _ what they'd call a
nerd these days. But he was always nice to me,'' Merrill said
Wednesday. ``He wasn't somebody that stood out. He was somebody who
nobody knew.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the couple concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very pleasant individual,'' said Shannon Haney,
president of the local 4-H club, who occasionally ran into Furrow,
Mathews and her son at meetings in Metaline Falls. ``I never had
any problem with him at all. He was very pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   But they never discussed political views, Haney said. And Furrow
was quick to voice his opinions to many others.
</P>
<P>
   He often bragged about his ties to the Aryan Nations, known for
its strong views on maintaining the purity of the white race and
its antipathy towards minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it quite well known he was a strong believer in the
Aryan Nations _ his position there,'' said Villers, Furrow's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me a lot about the camps they had _ a week long each,
and he was basically a security supervisor there.''
</P>
<P>
   What's unclear is when Furrow adopted such beliefs. The son of a
career Air Force enlisted man, he graduated from Timberline High
School in Lacey, Wash., near Olympia, in 1979. In February 1980, he
enlisted in the Army, only to wash out of basic training because of
a bum knee. He was honorably discharged in October.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently spent much of the next decade in Rosamond, Calif.,
a town in the high desert of California, a few minutes from Edwards
Air Force Base, where his father had once been stationed, and about
40 miles from Granada Hills, where police believe he started
shooting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He spent time between Rosamond and Everett, where he worked as
an engineer doing computer-assisted design at North West Gear, an
aircraft parts manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Furrow was charged by federal prosecutors in the
slaying of the postal worker. He said little during a court
appearance in Las Vegas and waived extradition to Los Angeles, said
his attorney, Art Allen. He was expected to be taken back in a U.S.
Customs helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge asked if he understood the charges, Furrow
responded: ``Yes, I do,'' Allen said. Reporters were barred from
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   As he was led out of the federal courthouse, a man shouted at
Furrow: ``You are a coward! You are a coward!'' Furrow smiled, then
was hustled into a car.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not detail what Furrow had told the phalanx of
local and federal investigators in Las Vegas. But one person said
police believed he had acted alone in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's surrender touched off a fierce behind-the-scenes
struggle over who would try him first. Los Angeles officials want
to prosecute the man they say is responsible for a crime that
shocked their city and federal officials are eager to try him on
charges that could lead to his execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles district attorney's office and the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles said that they would hold a joint
news conference this morning to announce details of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County prosecutor Craig Hum said he would file a
warrant charging Furrow with five counts of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles, said it was uncertain whether federal civil rights charges
also might be brought against Furrow. Federal civil rights statutes
are so narrowly defined that the shooting might not be considered a
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shootings, Bill Wells, Furrow's uncle in
Columbia, S.C., remains puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love all people,'' Wells said. ``He (Furrow) was raised the
same. We like all people. There's nowhere back in our family that
there was any racism in our family or any slave owners. They're
just good, hard-working, honest people.''

METS DEFEAT PADRES, 12-5
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edgardo Alfonzo is routinely overlooked when the New
York Mets are discussed. The conversations often start with Mike
Piazza's power, shift to John Olerud's sweet swing, move to Robin
Ventura's overall play and veer into Rey Ordonez's snazzy defense.
What about Alfonzo? Sometimes the quiet second baseman receives
cursory mentions, but not often enough.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo was the primary reason the Mets survived a frustrating
start by Octavio Dotel and rallied to defeat the San Diego Padres,
12-5, on Wednesday night at Shea Stadium. Dotel's erratic pitching
twice put the Mets into deep holes, but Alfonzo helped turn the
exasperation into exhilaration with a homer, a double and five runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been our guy,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He's been
valuable. He's been our guy, day in and day out. He's been our most
consistent player.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for Alfonzo's effort on Wednesday night, the Mets
might not have rebounded so easily against the Padres. If it were
not for Alfonzo's performances this season, the Mets might not be
challenging the Braves for first place in the National League East.
With 17 homers and 80 runs batted in, Alfonzo has set career highs
in both categories. Now Alfonzo has 47 games to improve those
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to do my best every day,'' Alfonzo said. ``The
numbers I put up should make people realize and think about it and
see all that I can do. Every day, I try to do my job and put up
numbers. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Dotel was bruised for five earned runs on four hits and
five walks in four and one-third innings, Pat Mahomes calmly
continued to excel, taming the Padres on no runs and one hit in two
and one-third innings for the victory. Mahomes improved to 6-0 and
might also have a future as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets erupted for four runs off Sterling Hitchcock to
take a 6-5 lead in the sixth, Mahomes, who had the game-winning hit
in a 5-4 victory over the Cubs on Aug. 1, began the outburst with a
single. He is 5 for 13 as a hitter this season. Rickey Henderson
walked, and Alfonzo missed his second homer by about five feet when
he drilled Hitchcock's high fastball off the right-field fence for
a two-run double. Alfonzo also tied Jeff Kent for the most rbi by a
Mets second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza then grounded a single past shortstop to score Alfonzo
with the tying run. San Diego stayed with Hitchcock, and Benny
Agbayani singled Piazza to second and Shawon Dunston lined a
two-out single to center to put the Mets ahead by a run. In the
seventh, Ventura had his team-best 26th homer and Olerud and Piazza
knocked in two runs apiece as the Mets scored six runs off a
terrible bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   While improving to 19-7 since the All-Star Game break, the Mets
remained a half-game behind Atlanta, which completed a three-game
sweep of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The learning process continues throughout the pennant process
for Dotel. Every five days, the talented rookie pitches and tries
to continue showing that he belongs. Dotel, who had won three of
his last four starts, wound up fizzling in the fifth as the Padres
clipped him and two relievers for three runs to take a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After John Vander Wal's run-scoring single put San Diego ahead,
3-2, Chuck McElroy replaced Dotel and allowed Wally Joyner's
sacrifice fly to push the lead to 4-2. Of the 30 runners McElroy
has inherited this season, a stunning 17 have scored. Mahomes was
summoned, and Phil Nevin stroked a double to lift the lead to three
runs. It was the only hit Mahomes allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The game began after an 82-minute rain delay. Dotel trotted to
the mound and soon wished that it were still raining. He had a
horrific first inning in which he walked four batters, threw 20 of
40 pitches for strikes and lacked velocity on his fastball. He
usually fires fastballs in the low 90s, but fluctuated between 87
and 89 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Jackson walked to lead off the game, stole second two
pitches later and motored to third on a roller. Dotel jumped ahead
of Tony Gwynn, 0-2, but could not subdue him, and Gwynn smacked a
2-2 pitch over the mound for a 1-0 lead. It was Gwynn's 3,007th
hit, tying Al Kaline for 20th place on the career list. Gwynn later
left the game with a sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel walked two more hitters to load the bases and then
surrendered Nevin's sacrifice fly. Mahomes was warming up, but,
after Dotel walked Carlos Baerga to fill the bases again, he
briefly saved himself by striking out Ben Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did Dotel a favor by quickly erasing the 2-0 deficit.
Alfonzo followed Henderson's single with a 416-foot homer over the
center-field fence. The two-run shot gave the Mets a reprieve,
which is what Alfonzo helped provide again later. &QL;

COWBOYS MAY GO INTERIOR COMMITTEE IN LETT'S ABSENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The yet-to-be-determined sentencing phase
of two-time Pro Bowl selection Leon Lett's NFL drug suspension
continues to underscore the critical nature of training-camp
auditions being held on the interior of the Cowboys' defensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   While the expansion Cleveland Browns were barking, blitzing and
running reverses, the Cowboys used Monday night's Hall of Fame Game
in Canton, Ohio, to take a long, classroom-like look at an area of
concern on the defense. Aside from Chad Hennings, who starts at
nose tackle, the team is short on NFL experience, but the first two
weeks of training camp seem to indicate that the Cowboys are long
on talent in the department of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Hennings, an eight-year veteran, plays the two-technique _
lining up over center. Second-year player Michael Myers plays the
three-technique and lines up as a true defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes 6-foot-5, 312-pound Nathan Davis, a third-year
pro who was waived by the Atlanta Falcons early last summer. He
came up huge Monday night as Henning's replacement on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who leads the team in body piercings, was Atlanta's 1997
second-round pick, 32nd selection overall. Fifteen months later, he
was released by the Falcons and signed by the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he didn't like them and they didn't like him,''
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said of Davis' short career in Atlanta.
``But I'm all for giving a guy a second chance to see what he can
do, and \RDavis\S is a big, strong guy inside. He played pretty
good in his last game. What he has to do now is to establish a
level of consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason that he was a second-round draft choice,''
Gailey added. ``But the reason that he was a second-round draft
choice is out the window just as the reason he didn't work out in
Atlanta is out the window. He has to do it here and now. That's
really the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive line coach Jim Bates was impressed with Davis'
ability to shed double-teams against the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RDavis\S held the line of scrimmage with good power,'' Bates
said. ``A couple of times he took on two blockers and still freed
up one of the linebackers. It was a real good first-game
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Myers didn't have a good outing in Canton. ``He gave
good effort; he just didn't have his best game,'' Gailey said. ``We
still have high expectations of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Hennings, who has played both the two- and the
three-technique, could move back to defensive tackle to allow Davis
to play the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad has that kind of flexibility,'' Bates said. ``There's
always a possibility that we could move Chad to the three technique
without any problem. He's played there before. We're still trying
to work out to see what is our best combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Free agents Brandon Noble and Robert Newkirk have been taking
snaps at both positions. Darren Benson also can play both spots,]
Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Lett is under suspension for violating the NFL's substance-abuse
policy. There is nothing new on his status. He is expected to miss
a considerable chunk of the season. Just how much will be
determined between now and Sept. 12 by NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations on Myers; the flexibility of Hennings, and the
emergence of Davis and the smaller, quicker Noble, who is coming
off a full season with the Barcelona Dragons of NFL Europe, combine
to give Cowboys coaches confidence that Lett can be replaced
possibly by committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I did a real good job rushing the passer, but I
think I did a real good job against the run,'' said Davis, who
played all but the first two series of the first half Monday night.
He strictly played on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was cut by Atlanta long before anyone was mentioning the
Falcons and the Super Bowl in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real hard job to do when you're not having fun with
it. I wasn't in Atlanta. I am here,'' said Davis. ``I still have
some good friends on the team, and I was happy for them. But I
didn't miss it. I didn't regret not getting a ring. I'm so much
happier just being away from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said of the 6-2, 285-pound Noble: ``He's an interesting
guy. He's not the biggest guy in the world, so you worry about him
getting knocked around in there. He's not the fastest \Rdefensive
tackle\S on the team, either. He plays on instinct and technique,
and you just have to see if that's enough to get him by.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is aware that Noble is coming off a 10-game grind playing
in NFL Europe _ ``you know the guy is going to be fresher in the
third week of the season'' _ but Gailey isn't about to give Noble
that as an out in trying to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining four preseason games will go a long way in
determining the Cowboys' strength or weakness on the interior of
their defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   As will Tagliabue's decision on Lett.
\Nsubheds:Department of the Interior With suspended Leon Lett's
fate yet to be determined by NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, there
is plenty of competition on the interior of Cowboys' defensive
line. The team is expected to keep eight or nine defensive linemen.
The candidates include: Player Height Weight Years Pro Comment Chad
Hennings 6-6 291 8 Not the prototype nose tackle, but he's smart
and anticipates well. Michael Myers 6-2 288 2 1998 fourth-round

FURROW GIVES SELF UP TO FBI IN LAS VEGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writers Greg Gittrich, David Baker, Robert
Monroe, Deborah   Sullivan and Rick Orlov contributed to this
story) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE AND HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ White supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr.
surrendered to the FBI on Wednesday, confessing to killing a mail
carrier and wounding five people during a rampage through the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Eluding a nationwide manhunt for almost 22 hours, Furrow turned
himself in about 8:30 a.m., telling FBI agents that he carried out
the attack because ``he wanted this to be a wakeup call to America
to kill Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for me. I killed the kids in Los Angeles,''
Furrow reportedly told agents.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, appeared before a federal magistrate on charges of
murder and weapons possession and then was put on a helicopter
bound for Los Angeles where he arrived at 9:35 p.m. The charge of
killing a federal employee carries a possible death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Attempted murder charges in the shooting of three boys and two
staff members at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in
Granada Hills may be filed later.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a cream-color polo shirt and blue jeans, Furrow was
led into a Las Vegas courthouse under heavy guard and wearing body
armor and shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, a laid-off tractor repairman, told a federal magistrate
he could not afford his own attorney. He waived his right to fight
extradition, but did not enter a plea.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the courthouse, someone in the crowd of about 25
yelled, ``You coward!''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow smiled and shouted back, ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   He was then hustled into a sport-utility vehicle with federal
agents and Los Angeles detectives. From there, he was placed in a
helicopter and flown to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For Los Angeles residents, the capture eases the fears of a city
that had been on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all relieved that Buford Furrow is in custody,'' said
Mayor Richard Riordan. ``We can rest assured that no more harm by
this man will come to our children and other Angelenos.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the city escaped more serious tragedy, given
Furrow's armament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be an arsenal of someone who had intent to
create a much larger tragedy in the city,'' said Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks. ``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a
greater tragedy than the one we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before police surrounded a Chatsworth hotel where they
believed Furrow was barricaded, he had slipped away and took two
taxicabs paying about $800 in cash to go from Los Angeles to Las
Vegas, authorities said. He stayed in Las Vegas for about eight
hours before turning himself in to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information we have at this time is that he was working
alone,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is suspected in the slaying of mail carrier Joseph Ileto
of Chino Hills, who was shot as he started his route in Chatsworth
about an hour after the community center shootings, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow confessed to the shooting, according to postal
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, he could face many charges, including attempted
murder and carjacking, in addition to prosecution for hate crimes,
said Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office spokeswoman
Sandi Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas and District Attorney Gil
Garcetti are scheduled to hold a 10 a.m. news conference today to
announce what charges will be filed against Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Furrow will be tried in federal court or state court
first was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking sources in the District Attorney's Office and the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told the Daily News
that Mayorkas and Garcetti were squabbling over who would prosecute
Furrow first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little turf war that will likely be settled shortly,
but still hasn't been decided,'' the ATF source said.
</P>
<P>
   A source in the District Attorney's Office described the talks
as ``the normal ... battle over a high-profile case that you really
can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great case with a total villain and lots of evidence,''
the source said. ``Everyone wants a piece of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Furrow traveled all the way to Las Vegas and decided to
surrender remained a mystery, although he attended high school
there in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   After eluding police at the community center and hijacking a
car, Furrow returned to the 7-Star Suites Hotel in Chatsworth where
he had been staying since at least Sunday, according to a police
source.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the neighbors of the hotel saw him walking around at
about 6:30 that night,'' the source said. ``Apparently, he became
spooked when he saw the helicopters overhead and left.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Las Vegas said Furrow arrived there about 12:30
a.m. Wednesday. It was not clear how he spent the eight hours
between arriving and surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was not armed when he surrendered, but police found
weapons in the carjacked Toyota Corolla found in Chatsworth that
they believe was the weapon used at the community center.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   They also found 6,000 rounds of ammunition, survivalist gear,
neo-Nazi literature and body armor in the van he left at the scene
of the carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the van he abandoned before hijacking the car, police
found ammunition, explosive devices and audiocassettes of hard rock
music, including one that Furrow apparently made himself with songs
about violence, suicide and one with the lyrics of ``kill, kill,
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The stolen Corolla was discovered at the hotel as a matter of
coincidence as officers were responding to a burglary call. As they
circled the parking lot, they discovered the stolen car and alerted
other officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to police sources, Furrow might have been in the
Valley for several days planning the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering that theory, Simon Wiesenthal Center officials said
Wednesday that he might have visited Los Angeles several months ago
in search of targets.
</P>
<P>
   A man believed to be Furrow visited the Museum of Tolerance two
or three months ago, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of
the Wiesenthal Center. Staff members recognized Furrow from the
photo released by police Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man entered the museum with a tour group, but raised the
suspicions of docents by his apparent lack of interest in the
museum's exhibits, which focus on the Holocaust. They watched him
fall back from the rest of the group and wander around the museum,
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   One docent alerted security, but by the time guards went to look
for the man, he had left, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said it was hard to avoid the conclusion that Furrow had
been casing the museum as a possible target.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously didn't come to be educated about tolerance,''
Cooper said. ``I think he realized the museum had excellent
security, and he left.''

<P>
   Buford O. ``Neal'' Furrow Jr. was a failure. He couldn't make it
through Army boot camp. He couldn't hold a job.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't even get himself admitted to a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Furrow, an adherent to a violent branch of racism and
anti-Semitism, may just figure he has finally become a success.

<P>
   Furrow belongs to a small but violent group of racists who
believe that hate is not enough, analysts say. Racists like Furrow
believe they must take lives to cleanse a nation for themselves and
their fellow white Christians. And they are being encouraged by
some groups to act alone, in displays of ``leaderless resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he thinks of himself as a hero,'' said Chip Berlet,
senior analyst with Political Research Associates, a progressive
think thank in suburban Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proud of what he did. In his self-definition, he is a
hero. He is doing what he thinks should have been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents seem to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle of a resurgence in right-wing extremist
criminal activity that really started following Ruby Ridge and
Waco,'' said Mark Pitcavage, director of the Ohio-based SLATT
(State/Local Anti-Terrorism Training) Program. The program, for law
enforcement agencies, is conducted in conjunction with the U.S.
Justice Department and the non-profit Institute for
Intergovernmental Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows no sign of letting up at this point,'' said
Pitcavage, who earned a doctorate from Ohio State University as one
of the few expert scholars in right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Furrow told FBI agents that he intended his spree to be
a ``wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' And in Hayden Lake,
Idaho, Furrow's sometime spiritual adviser compared him to a
warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war against the white race'' was Furrow's motivation, said
Richard Butler, founder of the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that Furrow followed the path of Butler and
others. He carried a card indentifying himself as a white
supremacist in October when he was arrested after threatening staff
members with a knife at a Kirkland mental hospital, according to
the King County Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   He began his statement to King County deputies with this
sentence: ``I'm a white seperatist (sic).''
</P>
<P>
   For three years he lived with the widow of Robert Mathews,
founder of a neo-Nazi group The Order. Mathews died in a shootout
with federal agents in 1984, and the rest of The Order is either
dead or in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Butler even told The Associated Press that he believes he
married Furrow and the widow.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it may be the Christian Identity faith that Furrow
follows that is at the root of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of the Identity movement believe that Jews are
children of Satan, non-whites are subhuman and white Northern
Europeans are the chosen people, said Eric Ward, regional
coordinator for the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious
Harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him, to go in and shoot Jewish children is no different
than shooting a dog,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how many believers there are varies from hundreds
to hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But both Pitcavage and Berlet agree that few are willing to take
part in extreme violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though all white supremacists are accidents
waiting to happen,'' Pitcavage said. ``Most of them confine their
extremism to slurs and bitching on the Web page.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people have ``psychological aberrations'' that become
explosive when motivated by an ideology based in anger and hate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the white-supremacist movement keeps pumping
these people out on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, movement leaders have urged a new tactic. Stung
by law enforcement crackdowns on groups like The Order and huge
civil judgments against groups like the Ku Klux Klan, they have
urged individual action.
</P>
<P>
   They talk of ``a pattern of leaderless resistance'' and
``seemingly random acts of violence to foment revolution.''
Followers consider themselves members of the ``Phineas
priesthood,'' carrying out their own race war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the 1980s, the whole doctrine of leaderless resistance
has been big in the (white supremacist) movement,'' said Mark
Potok, spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has
Furrow in its files.
</P>
<P>
   Potok said there was a ``direct link'' between Furrow and
``leaderless resistance'' through a book, ``War Cycle, Peace
Cycle'' found among his belongings by Los Angeles police.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Richard Kelly Hoskin, also wrote ``Vigilantes of
Christendom,'' a manifesto that equivocates Bible stories to
justify ``Phineas priests'' who claim to go out and kill on God's
orders, Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   When Pitcavage heard of the L.A. Jewish community center
shootings Tuesday, he said he hoped it was a random act of
violence, rather than ``one of `my' so-called guys, something based
on mental illness rather than deliberately evil targeting these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I suspected early on it was a hate crime, a white
supremacist,'' Pitcavage said. ``There's been a lot of currency in
the movement, in the wake of Benjamin Smith (a young man who shot a
black basketball coach and an Asian-American in the Midwest in
recent months) about the notion of `lone wolves,' people
unassociated with these groups who go out and do it on their own
for the so-called `white cause.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tied to an ideology,'' added Ward. ``That's what makes it
so difficult for our American society to respond to. We're much
more prepared to act against a conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcavage said the recent spate of activity _ the shootings in
Los Angeles and the Midwest and synagogue arsons in Northern
California _ is likely another of the spikes that occur
periodically.
</P>
<P>
   But Berlet said he worries that the start of the new century
will bring even more acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument is that as we approach the millennium we will see
more and higher acts of violence,'' he said. ``The idea here is
that there is the final battle between good and evil.''

   JAPAN-TEMP-WORKERS (Tokyo) _ Workers like Yoshiko Kitani, who is
hopping from job to job, represent the future of the job market in

dragged toward with its heels planted firmly in the ground. By

   KASHMIR (Srinagar, India) _ The Vale of Kashmir, once exalted
for the lotus blooms in its lakes and the yellow tapestry of its
mustard fields, has become a valley of despair _ a place haunted by
senseless murder and hideous torture. For a half-century, India and
Pakistan have fought over this land, sustaining a hatred so
venomous as to rival any in the world. For each, possessing Kashmir
is a matter of life and death, with both persistently willing to
forsake the former for the latter. By Barry Bearak.

   U.N.-PEACEKEEPERS (United Nations) _ Overriding objections from
a number of countries that contribute peacekeeping troops to the
United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan has ordered that all
forces operating under the organization's command abide by
international laws protecting civilians and governing the conduct
of soldiers in war. Until now, peacekeepers under U.N. command have
operated in a gray area of international law, not strictly

   ALEXANDER-CAMPAIGN (Mashalltown, Iowa) _ Lamar Alexander, who
has been running longer than any other candidate, is trying hard to
stay positive while he runs out of money, but his bitter belief
that the Republican Party's whole nominating process is being
short-circuited by big money and big media has become a consuming

   ECLIPSE (Plain an Gwarry, England) _ Despite the best efforts of
Druids who had performed sun dances barefoot among magic stones for
the past several days, rain clouds eclipsed the eclipse here. And

nothing to do but grumble over their pasties about an event that

take over in that event, it is unclear how much of the process they

order General Motors Corp. to pay $4.9 billion to six people
severely burned when the fuel tank of their car exploded was an

that GM had a policy of forgoing inexpensive safety features. Yet
the award was outrageously high, and will probably be set aside, or
at least greatly reduced, when GM appeals. By Michael M. Weinstein.

the fire-sale price of $350,000. Schlackman's eye for a bargain,
however, was sharper than his eye for an interior. ``Like so many
New York bachelors,'' his friend Thom Filicia recalled, ``he had an
L-shaped leather sofa, a big TV with speakers the size of
Volkswagens, and a 45-watt halogen lamp in a corner that was
supposed to light the whole place. He was right out of Playboy
living.'' But, Flicia added dryly, noting Schlackman's fondness for
sailing and cigars and fine wine: ``His bachelor pad didn't groove

Ruth Yoe, the editor of the University of Chicago Magazine. ``It

ATLANTA _ One if by land, two if by squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot a flare. Equip everyone with beepers. Try Morse code,
hidden microphones, light signals, voice messaging or maybe even
those neon light sticks they use to park 747s.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros need to do something, anything, to get their point
across _ not just to the league's best teams, but to themselves.
This signaling stuff has seen better days.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to have a signaling breakdown in game one of
this three-game set against the Braves. It was just bad
communication, according to the Astros, although skipper Larry
Dierker said his son's Little League team could do better. That's
baseball. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But one day later, there were errors that sealed the Astros'
fate in game two against a team they might face in the playoffs.
Then came Wednesday night at Turner Field, where the deepest wounds
the Astros suffered were yet again self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, what we had here was a failure to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were terrible, just terrible,'' Dierker said. ``What else
can you say?
</P>
<P>
   We missed signs; we were making errors; we threw the ball down
the middle of the plate. Mental mistakes killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Jose Lima gave up five runs in the first two innings
alone, with a barrage of three home runs in the second putting the
Astros in a huge hole.
</P>
<P>
   Lima best described what happened in the fateful second:
``Slider up? Home run. Changeup up? Boom. Behind in the count? Home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, you thought, was that. But it wasn't _ at least not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros fought back for the second night in a row, pulling
within 6-5 going into the seventh inning and looking like the
frisky, scrappy bunch who forged their division lead through the
first four months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett drew a walk, stole second and went to third on a
passed ball to open the seventh. Derek Bell followed with a walk.
This, you thought, was the Astros team the league has come to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Make something out of nothing. Be clutch. Hustle. Do things
right. Scrape out the win somehow, some way.
</P>
<P>
   But you were wrong. This time, the Astros' mental problem
against the Braves might have been certifiable in some states.
People either started hearing voices or couldn't remember what they
said only seconds earlier, depending on whose version you believed.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he heard third-base coach Mike Cubbage tell him
that a squeeze play was on as pinch hitter Matt Mieske stepped to
the plate. Later, Cubbage told Dierker he couldn't remember saying
anything that would have led Everett to believe such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Everett broke from third base, and when Mieske didn't square
for the bunt, Everett easily was tagged out by Braves catcher Eddie
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, having a pinch hitter up there, I should
have known better,'' Everett said. ``But I heard what I heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter what the Astros might be hearing, they're not
seeing things in the Central Division standings. The Reds are still
hanging around, still thinking they can win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you get in a rut you overcome it, and sometimes
you don't,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``We got in a rut in
this series. That's going to happen sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Everett: ``It didn't go well here. We know we could have
won each game against the Braves, and in our minds we should have
won them. But we made mistakes. It seems like nothing ever went in
our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Astros today is that the Reds lost a
ninth-inning nail-biter at Pittsburgh; otherwise, there would be a
virtual tie atop the division.
</P>
<P>
   It also should be good for the 'Stros that they'll be off today.
A seven-game homestand begins Friday, and those games will be
against the mediocre Pirates and Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros haven't had much of a problem against the mediocre or
bad teams all year. They'll get well over the weekend. You can bet
on it.
</P>
<P>
   But with Wednesday's loss, the Astros dropped to 2-14 against
the league's top contenders _ the Reds, Braves, Diamondbacks and
Mets _ over the past two months. The Astros likely will face one of
those teams in the first round of the playoffs, when messing up
signals or miscommunicating won't just end a forgettable series but
could finish a season.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are
located in this cradle of the South. Perhaps someone there can come
up with a name for what ails the Astros when the Atlanta Braves are
sitting in the other dugout.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A stomach-turning three days of baseball concluded for the
Astros with Wednesday's 8-5 loss at Turner Field. Thank goodness
for days off. Maybe today's time away from baseball will help them
shake their 72-hour virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were swept for the third time this season and the
first time by Atlanta since 1995. Everything that could go wrong
during the course of the three-game series did.
</P>
<P>
   There were defensive breakdowns at inopportune times, subpar
pitching performances and, of course, missed signs. Nevertheless,
victory was within reach each game _ if the Astros could have
grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were terrible,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``Just
terrible; that's all you can say. I'm not trying to belittle the
Braves, but we were terrible. Whether it was missing signs, making
errors or hanging pitches, I'm not sure we could have beaten
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the first two games of the series, the Astros needed
a big game from starter Jose Lima, and he failed to deliver. Lima
allowed six runs on nine hits (six for extra bases) in five innings
and tied a club record by serving up three home runs in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses,'' said Lima (15-7), who has dropped three of his
last five decisions. ``My job is to go out there and hold the other
team to two runs and pitch at least seven innings. I didn't do my
job. Sometimes you go out there and the stuff is not there. No
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Greg Maddux (14-6) didn't exactly have his best
stuff, either. The Astros ripped the former Cy Young Award winner
for 11 hits and five runs in 5 innings, but Maddux got the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Normally when the Astros go into a rut, all fingers point toward
the offense. Don't even think about it this time.
</P>
<P>
   In the series, the Astros combined for 29 hits and 11 runs (nine
earned) in 19 innings against Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the frustrating thing,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``If you can get to those guys, you have to find a
way to win the game. We were in every game. We had chances to win.
We came back from deficits, but things just didn't go our way.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that did go the Astros' way happened in
Pittsburgh. The Astros maintained a one-game lead over Cincinnati
in the National League Central thanks to Pittsburgh's
come-from-behind victory over the Reds on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' lead was three games when they arrived in Atlanta,
where they have lost 12 of their last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored first on Bagwell's sacrifice fly after Craig
Biggio led off the game with his 48th double. The Braves tied the
score on Brian Jordan's RBI single in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will host the All-Star festivities next season, and
the second inning looked like audition time for the
home-run-hitting contest.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez and Chipper Jones hit solo shots and Bret Boone
added a two-run blast _ his second homer in as many days. The only
other Astros pitchers to allow three home runs in an inning were
Mark Portugal at Cincinnati in 1991 and Wade Miller at Arizona this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you get with him (Lima),'' Dierker said. ``Last
year he set a club record for giving up home runs (34). When he's
not right, he's one of the best pitchers to hit against in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Andruw Jones made a habit of robbing the Astros of
extra bases in the series, but Bagwell hit a ball even the best
center fielder in the league couldn't catch. Bagwell's two-run shot
over the center-field wall pulled the Astros within two in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Down 6-4, the Astros had a golden opportunity in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett drew a one-out walk off Mike Remlinger, stole
second and went to third on an overthrow. Derek Bell walked to give
the Astros runners on the corners with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker sent Matt Mieske to bat for Daryle Ward, and Braves
manager Bobby Cox countered by sending righthander Kevin McGlinchy
to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Everett thought he heard third-base coach Mike Cubbage give him
the verbal sign for the squeeze play, but the squeeze wasn't on.
Everett was tagged out, and Mieske flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl thought he heard Cubby give the sign,'' Dierker said.
``Cubby can't remember saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said: ``He (Cubbage) said it but didn't realize it. I
should have known better. I wanted to say something, but I didn't.
It's 50-50 on those things.''

KARROS HITS FIRST GRAND SLAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Jeff Bagwell and Sammy Sosa removed their names last
season from the list of home-run hitters who never hit a grand
slam, which Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros has heard about for a
while now.
</P>
<P>
   When Karros stepped to the plate in the seventh inning Wednesday
against Montreal, he was the guy atop the list.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 202 career homers, including the first 25 this season,
none came with the bases full. His 203rd homer did, a grand slam
into the left field seats against Montreal reliever Anthony Telford
that tied the game at 6 in the Dodgers' 9-7 win at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to get it, especially in that situation,'' Karros
said. ``It was a nice win for us, being behind 6-0 in the seventh
inning and coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who downplayed the grand slam in typical fashion, didn't
stop with the homer. He added a two-run single to center in the
eighth to drive in two more runs. He finished with six RBI, tying
his career-high.
</P>
<P>
   Karros _ who has 26 homers (34 is his season best) and is on
pace for his fourth 100-RBI season _ has 14 RBI in his last four
games and is hitting .298.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a big day, didn't he?'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson. ``His first grand slam couldn't have come at a more
opportune time.''
</P>
<P>
   GM backs Hundley: Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he
supports catcher Todd Hundley, if the switch-hitter wants to hit
exclusively left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd's expressed he's thought about it and it's something I've
considered the last few weeks,'' Malone said. ``He's such a threat,
and so fluid, from the left side. Maybe it's something we want to
look at over the last month of the season or look at in spring
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley said Tuesday he was considering hitting only from the
left. He was brought to the Dodgers to provide left-handed power,
which he's done with 17 homers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's production from the right side has been
non-existent. He's 4 for 40 as a righty this season with two RBI.
He's spent much of the year in a platoon role, anyway, resting
against most lefties.
</P>
<P>
   As a righty, Hundley has a career batting average of .201. He's
hit 123 of his 141 homers as a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: As expected, after the game the Dodgers optioned lefty Jeff
Kubenka to Triple-A Albuquerque to make room for right-hander Mike
Judd, who will make his first major league start today against the
Expos. . . . Malone went to see second baseman Eric Young play
Wednesday in a rehab assignment with Class A San Bernardino. Young
went 1 for 4 on Tuesday and was 2 for 7 in two rehab starts. He's
expected to rejoin the Dodgers on Friday. . . . Karros is 25 home
runs behind Ron Cey for the all-time Dodgers lead. Karros trails
Steve Garvey by six. . . . The six-run deficit the Dodgers overcame
was their best of the season. On two other occasions, they rallied
from four runs back to win. . . . Dodgers starters entered the
night with a 2.80 ERA in their last 16 games, but Chan Ho Park left
after yielding six runs on 10 hits in 52/3 innings.

ALTERCATION WITH HOSPITAL STAFF LEAD TO FURROW ARREST IN OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD AND HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suicidal and considering murder, Buford O. ``Neal'' Furrow Jr.'s
journey through Washington's mental health system started with
self-mutilation last fall.
</P>
<P>
   His criminal record was clean until he sought treatment last
October, but ended up threatening psychiatric workers with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Court records suggest he spent as long as six weeks in mental
health facilities. Yet because mental health records are
confidential, it's unclear what treatment he received.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's run-in with authorities began at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 28,
1998, when Furrow drove to Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in Kirkland
to be admitted. He had been drinking, and psychiatric evaluator
Nina Merendino-Sarich later told police Furrow said he had been
thinking about shooting people at the Alderwood Mall in Lynnwood,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   He also told staff members he had a gun and his car, and at one
point went to his car to drink another beer.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, social worker Kirsten Brown convinced him to
hand over his car keys.
</P>
<P>
   But after she informed him that police would have to be told
about the gun, he demanded them back, following Brown as she walked
to her office.
</P>
<P>
   When hospital director Julie Callbert tried to divert Furrow by
joking about his keys, he grew angry. He pulled a black-handled
switchblade, shaking it just 18 inches from her face. Then he
pointed the knife toward Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid he was going to stab me,'' Brown, 34 told police.
``He said, `give me my (expletive) keys,''' and ... he said `I will
cut you up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Callbert then threw the keys out of the room, and Furrow went
after them. By then, another staff member had called for help.
</P>
<P>
   A King County sheriff's deputy arrived to find Furrow still
holding the knife. The deputy ordered him to drop it, but Furrow
instead pointed the weapon at him.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy, pointing his gun at Furrow, again ordered him to
drop the knife, but Furrow walked toward the officer ``in a
threatening stance,'' according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   After two more warnings, Furrow dropped the knife and was
arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before the Fairfax assault, he had purposefully cut a
finger to the bone, a wound that took six stitches to repair at
Providence Medical Center in Everett, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been having suicidal and homicidal thoughts for sometime
now,'' he told police. Earlier in the day, he said, he had cut his
left forearm six or seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow said he thought about killing his estranged wife and her
friends, then might drive to Canada and rob a bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the police to shoot me,'' he said. ``Sometimes I feel
like I could lose it and kill people. I also feel like I could kill
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His precarious mental condition was apparent to professionals in
the King County Jail psychiatric unit. Records show jail
psychologist Mike Rollero called deputies several times to urge
them to quickly file charges so he would have ``time to prepare
civil commitment papers for ... Furrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollero could not be reached for comment. Mental health workers
recommend commitment for people who are a danger to themselves or
others, said Amnon Shoenfeld, a county civil commitment
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Art Wallenstein, director of the county's Department of Adult
Detention, said he cannot comment on Furrow's mental health
treatment, but said, ``We cannot commit anyone who is not here in
the jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow posted a $15,000 bond before prosecutors filed charges
and was released from jail on Oct. 30, before any civil commitment
could take place. But his family told a bail bondsman they didn't
think it was safe for him to remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   That day he was due for a second court appearance, and his
father called the court to say his son was in Harborview Medical
Center. Three days later, on Nov. 2, his father called the court to
say Furrow remained at Harborview ``for further evaluations.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was charged with second-degree assault on Nov. 2. His
bail was raised and he was unable to post it.
</P>
<P>
   Court records suggest he may have received further mental health
treatment after his Harborview evaluation. King County Prosecutor
spokesman Dan Donohoe said Furrow was in custody after Nov. 2, but
records show he did not return to jail until Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Donohoe would not say where Furrow was held. Nor would officials
at Harborview or Western State Hospital in Steilacoom, Wash., which
handles civil commitments.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, a public defender notified the court that Furrow
would use an insanity defense, but four months later, on March 10,
Furrow withdrew that defense. His attorney, Leona Thomas, did not
respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow pleaded guilty to second-degree assault on April 28 and
on May 21 he was sentenced by King County Superior Court Judge
Harriet Cody to eight months in jail _ at the upper end of the
sentencing range.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Grayber, a jail commander, said Furrow fought with another
inmate during his 165-day stay, but it was determined that Furrow
was protecting himself from an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a behavior problem,'' said Grayber.
</P>
<P>
   He was released early because he had credit for time-served and
for good behavior, said Donohoe.
</P>
<P>
   Cody attached several standard conditions to his release: No
alcohol, no contact with the Fairfax hospital staff he threatened.
He also was ``not to cease taking prescribed medications as
directed without approval from a licensed medical professional.''

UNSUNG PITCHING TRIO HELPS M'S COMPLETE SERIES SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When 1999 began, Paul Abbott had one good knee and no
baseball contract. Tom Davey was Toronto Blue Jays property, with
no experience above Class AA. Todd Williams was employed by the
Cincinnati Reds, desperate to leave an organization he felt had
given up on him.
</P>
<P>
   The three pitchers got together Wednesday, dressed themselves in
Mariners midnight blue and beat the Chicago White Sox 11-2. A crowd
of 45,194 _ the 16th sellout in 21 games at Safeco Field _ saw the
Mariners complete a three-game series sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, Davey and Williams are three of the pitchers who will be
given extended looks over the season's last seven weeks. The
playoffs are disappearing from view, but for a team that already
has used a franchise-high 26 pitchers, auditions are on for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it two ways,'' said Davey, who threw three
scoreless innings in his best outing since being acquired in the
David Segui trade last month. ``You can worry about it and say,
`Oh, I've got to stay in there and do the job,' or you can say, `I
know I'm getting an opportunity, and if I throw the ball well, I'm
going to get innings.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had two good outings and one bad one here. They're
looking for you to be consistent, and the guys that are are the
ones that are going to get the ball. I know I'm probably more of a
long man now, but you've got to be ready for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than Abbott, who allowed two runs in
five innings to improve to 3-0. The 31-year-old right-hander went
3-1 in four September starts last year, and figured into the
rotation plans this year. Then he tore his right anterior cruciate
ligament in winter ball, and spent more than a month without a
team. The M's re-signed him to a minor league contract in
mid-January, and by June he was in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   As a starter. For one turn.
</P>
<P>
   When rookie Gil Meche was promoted, Abbott went back to the
bullpen. There he thrived, using a screwball-like change-up that
moves away from left-handed hitters to establish himself as a
dependable setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Jeff Fassero in the bullpen, Abbott is a starter
again. His role changes, but Abbott, who passed through three
organizations over four full minor league seasons from 1994-97,
said he's eager to reward the Mariners for their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the most satisfying thing,'' Abbott said. ``I
didn't get many opportunities the last few years. A lot of that had
to do with injuries, but I've got an opportunity here to show
everybody that maybe they made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said he's trying to solidify his spot for next year. He
went seven years between major league victories (1991-98), but
never questioned himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have gotten back in the first place if I
had any doubts,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Davey came on for Abbott in the sixth. Williams, a right-hander
acquired in a minor league trade last month, worked a scoreless
ninth in his second Seattle outing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners offense made the pitching conditions more
comfortable, scoring six times in the first inning off Jaime
Navarro (7-10). Two walks, a wild pitch, a stolen base, an error
and an infield single by Alex Rodriguez brought in the Mariners'
first two runs, and one batter later Edgar Martinez's first Safeco
Field homer gave the M's a 4-0 lead. Raul Ibanez added another
two-run homer to make it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has 11 hits in his last 21 at-bats since Friday, and
batted .364 during the homestand. He has been fooled by Safeco
Field before, so he wasn't sure if his opposite-field fly would
make it over the fence. The direction of the flags, a giveaway on
wind conditions at most parks, makes no difference at Safeco, he
said. Martinez said the wind provides a daily surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell exactly what the wind does out there,''
Martinez said. ``In the past, I've hit balls to right field that I
thought were hit pretty good and they didn't go out. Today I hit a
ball good, and who knows if it's going out or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez added a two-run single and a two-run homer for his
second five-RBI game in five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it feels like the team is really playing with
enthusiasm,'' Rodriguez said. ``That's what I'm most proud of.
That's what's different between this year and last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and the pitching staff. Jamie Moyer is the only member of
the rotation who did not make his M's debut in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all pitching well and they're all gaining confidence
in their position,'' pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``They've
got some experience, and each and every one of them is starting to
get sharper. We've got some nice arms down in the bullpen now, too.
It could be a lot of fun here over the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennant race or not.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MEDINAH, Ill. _ The PGA Championship may be the minor major, but
it's still no place for such a crass matter to dominate
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is golf's final Grand Slam of the 1900s. Our
focus, it would seem, should be solely on the special chunk of
glory that's up for grabs on one of America's most storied old
courses.
</P>
<P>
   So why, pray tell, are we talking about money? Must it always be
about money?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sorry. Not here, folks. Not this week. The Ryder Cup
pay-for-play squabble is a relevant topic because the Cup, with its
runneth-over profits, happens also to be a PGA of America event.
But it needs to find a different forum nonetheless. We came to
Medinah for the game, to find out who's made of what, not to haggle
about who deserves what. Last time I checked, the majors are
supposed to be about making history, not hay.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, for one, believes he's being exploited by the
system, which at present asks that he golf for his country once
every two years, gratis. He may be right, too, considering the
bountiful profits the Cup generates for the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Had Duval actually done something important enough for him to be
clearly deserving of the No. 1 ranking in the world, we might be
more patient with him, more inclined to indulge his whining. Hey,
David, go win the PGA, and then we'll chat, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods' braying on the same subject is no less grating on
the nerves. He'll never be able to count the cash he has already
banked before his 25th birthday, not to mention figure out a way
how to actually spend it. What both of these young studs should be
totally consumed by is adding to their paltry Slam count, not
augmenting their respective bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval possess one major _ Woods' Masters victory in
1997 _ between them. That's hardly a sufficient sum for Nos. 1 and
2. Duval admits his play in Slam events has been, by and large,
``miserable.'' And Tiger has taken a conspicuous oh-fer in his 10
tries since he turned Augusta National into his oyster.
</P>
<P>
   Medinah, 7,401 yards long and terrifyingly lean in places,
represents a glorious opportunity for each of them. Although the
PGA, in its 81st year, is struggling to maintain its exalted status
with the sport practically drowning in funny-money exhibitions and
World Tour events, the golfers themselves have lost none of their
respect, admiration and affection for its significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win this tournament,'' said Davis Love III, who did so
at Winged Foot in 1997, ``you've beaten the best field in golf. The
top 96 or 97 players out of the top 100 are here. So if you win,
you've beaten the best in your profession.''
</P>
<P>
   And nobody, except the champion's accountants, can tell you what
the first prize is in dollars, because nobody cares. For the
record, the winner will pocket roughly $600,000 out of a total
payout of $3 million and change. The official sum has yet to be
announced, but when it is, the number won't draw more than cursory
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, we're aware of the purse,'' says Phil Mickelson, the
second-best golfer on the tour behind Duval still trying to learn
the secret handshake of the Slam fraternity. ``(But) being a part
of such an event is what is enriching, not the financial rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why (the majors) have not moved their purses up
accordingly, percentage-wise, when you factor in the percentage we
play for on the tour compared to the percentage we play for in the
majors.''
</P>
<P>
   You suspect Mickelson, who had posted a tour victory before he
was even on the tour but stands 0-for-seven-years in the majors,
would gladly pay the PGA for a title, if such an option existed.
Ditto Duval. That's why all the whining about Ryder Cup
compensation sounds so dissonant and superfluous cast against the
backdrop of the PGA and stately Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   Just go hit your golf balls, fellas. You're boring us with the
other stuff. Included in that ``us'' _ prominently _ is the fed-up
Ryder Cup team captain, Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Ben was in a not-so-gentle mood Wednesday. Being that he's one
of the most fervent keepers of golf's flame, the money madness is
angering him. Specifically, he didn't appreciate a lot of what he
heard in a Tuesday sit-down that was intended to clear the air
between several Ryder Cuppers and officials of the PGA and PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say one thing,'' Crenshaw groused. ``I'm personally
disappointed in a couple people at that meeting. I mean that. And
they know who they are. Whether some players like it or not, there
are people who came before them that mean a hell of a lot to this
game. And it burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>

That's all I'm going to say about that.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MEDINAH, Ill. _ It has been the bad fortune of Ben Crenshaw to have
the Ryder Cup pay-for-play issue explode during his captaincy, and
he left no doubt Wednesday that the subject has gnawed at him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crenshaw directed strong words at certain players who will be on
the team he will lead against the Europeans next month at The
Country Club in Brookline, Mass. What irked him was comments made
not via the media but during Tuesday's meeting of 16 Ryder-eligible
players, himself and executives of the PGA Tour and PGA of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally disappointed in a couple people in that
meeting,'' Crenshaw said. ``I mean that. And they know who they
are. And whether some players like it or not, there are some people
who came before them that mean a hell of a lot to this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their
viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw didn't mention names. But it's clear that Tiger Woods,
David Duval and perhaps Mark O'Meara were targets of Crenshaw's
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Normally mild-mannered, Crenshaw made strong, pointed statements
during his news conference Wednesday to express his feelings about
the issue of paying American Ryder Cuppers for participation in the
biennial event. The topic remains a non-issue with Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said the purity of the Ryder Cup and representing one's
country should be enough to entice players to want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that (representing your country) isn't a reward, I don't
know what is,'' he said. ``I cherish my times in it. Every player
who's ever played Ryder Cup on both sides thanks the good Lord for
getting into something that means so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on two winning teams and two losing teams, and I've
played against some fabulous opponents, and I call them friends to
this day. We have great recollections of when we played and how we
played it and who was the best that day. I don't see how golf,
especially match play, can get any better than that. Your opponent
on the other side is giving their very best, and you're giving your
best, too. You cannot ask for a purer form of competition. That's
what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw always has been a watchdog of sorts when it comes to
golf's traditions. He's a purist to the nth degree, which is why
the flap about giving players some remuneration for playing in the
Ryder Cup hits him hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy called it an exhibition,'' Crenshaw said, ``and he
hasn't even played in one yet.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a not-so-veiled shot at Duval, who has, indeed, called
the tournament an exhibition. Duval maintains not only that the
Ryder Cup is not a tournament that he ranks with major
championships but also that some sort of monetary reward in the
form of charitable contributions should be given to the players.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said that in spite of his displeasure with some
players, he generally was glad the Tuesday meeting took place and
hopes all parties can move forward from here.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a U.S. team that clearly has a lot of bonding left
to do, including between players and their captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick of issues like this in the sports world,''
Crenshaw said. ``When you can't just show up and play for your
country, I don't know. If that's not reward enough, then my heart
bleeds for the game of golf.''

PITCHING COACH STAYING HOME TO HAVE KNEE SCOPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners are putting another pitcher on the
disabled list, only this right-hander hasn't pitched in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Stan Williams will have arthroscopic surgery to
repair torn cartilage in his left knee Friday and will miss the
road trip to Boston and Toronto. Minor league pitching coordinator
Bryan Price, who has been with the team the past two weeks as a
left-handed batting practice pitcher, will fill in.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Price, a former Mariner farmhand, is highly
regarded in the organization and is considered a future
major-league pitching coach. He's developed a rapport with
Williams, who joked after the game that he's entrusting Price with
his three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's treated me first-class,'' Price said. ``He hasn't seen me
at all as an intrusion. All the guys have gone out of their way to
make me feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, Price has worked in major league
spring training before the minor leaguers reported. That gives him
some familiarity with the veterans, and he has worked with Gil
Meche, Paul Abbott, Jose Paniagua and others who played in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Price expects his major-league stint to have a long-term benefit
to his regular job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great experience to see a lot of big league ballgames
and see what these guys do to be successful, so we can continue to
push that on our minor league pitchers,'' Price said. ``If you're
away from the big leagues too long, you can end up judging and
evaluating talent differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of pitchers like Jamie Moyer and John Halama, Price
said, will be particularly useful to illustrate. Moyer and Halama
pitch to their strengths, not hitters' weaknesses, and concentrate
not on radar-gun readings but on making the right pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is pitch execution,'' Price said.
``If you've got to throw a fastball down and away, you've got to
throw it down and away. A lot of young minor-league pitchers are
more effort-oriented and velocity-oriented, and that detracts quite
a bit from their pitch execution. And those two are great examples
of guys who go out there with so much consistency of their pitches
that they have success.''
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY HITTER: Tom Lampkin's third-inning single Wednesday put
his average more than 100 points higher than it was last season,
when he batted .231 for the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin has stayed above .300 nearly all year after an
adjustment he made this spring. Hitting coach Jesse Barfield
suggested Lampkin hold his hands in behind his head instead of out
closer to the plate. That change, and a June pep talk from former
teammate Tony Gwynn in San Diego, have Lampkin hitting well above
his pre-1999 career average of .229.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it's been a blissful year for Lampkin, the Blanchet High
grad whose two-run double won Tuesday's game. The two-year free
agent contract he signed this winter is turning out even better
than hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect it to be this great,'' Lampkin said. ``To be
able to play this close to my family has been better than I thought
it would be. This is my favorite town in the country, and I love
coming to the park every day. There's not one thing about this
experience I would change, except for the won/loss record. But it's
not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: The Mariners have issued 21 bases-loaded walks
this year, easily the highest figure in the majors. The Detroit
Tigers are second, with 15. When opponents aren't being walked,
they're batting .260 with the bases loaded. ... Center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. tied a career high Wednesday with his 20th stolen base
of the season. ... According to fans at parks across the majors,
the best player to come out of Donora, Pa., is not Stan Musial. In
balloting for baseball's All-Century Team, Griffey ranks eighth
among outfielders _ three spots ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals
Hall of Famer who shares his hometown. The top nine outfielders
will be named to the team in October. ... First-round draft choice
Ryan Christenson is off to a blistering start at Class A Everett.
The catcher had eight hits, including a homer, in his first 14
at-bats. ... Mariners manager Lou Piniella has taken note of Class
AAA left-hander Robert Ramsay, who was acquired from Boston for
outfielder Butch Huskey last month. Ramsay was 2-0 with a 1.26 ERA
in his first two starts for Tacoma, and Wednesday he limited Tuscon
to two hits in seven innings to win, 3-2. ... Outfielder Charles
Gipson, who has a separated shoulder, will start a rehab assignment
with Class AA New Haven on Friday.

PINIELLA SEES BRIGHTER DAYS ON MARINERS' HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Maybe the manager's mood mirrored the nice little win
streak his team is now riding.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella said Wednesday he can see a difference in his
Mariners. Better defense. A glut of young, live arms. Bunts and
sacrifice flies that are moving runners. There are signs that the
Mariners' moves and mindset are starting to pay off, with more
improvements to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization has some very tough decisions (in the
off-season). I don't think decisions have been made (yet). But my
feeling is, with this new stadium and with the revenues this
stadium will derive, I think this club will spend some money over
the winter and put a very competitive mix on the field next year,''
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have a sneaking suspicion. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop the presses. Please.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a very long time since anyone anywhere in the
Mariners organization has taken a stab at verbalizing anything
remotely resembling a plan for the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, ever since the Mariners were eliminated from the 1997
playoffs by Baltimore _ a dishearteningly quick exit in which the
Mariners' dependence on the long ball and inability to execute
small ball was exposed as deadly _ a monstrous cloud of uncertainty
has shrouded the team.
</P>
<P>
   Who are they? Where are they going?
</P>
<P>
   And, just as important, does Piniella have the patience and
energy to take a team drunk on power hitting and turn it into one
that can win with speed, defense, pitching, athleticism and timely
hitting?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it always seemed funny that a manager like Piniella _
who won a World Series in Cincinnati with Chris Sabo, Barry Larkin,
Eric Davis and the Nasty Boys _ could ever be maligned as a skipper
unwilling or unable to do all the little things it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Piniella said, he has been the leading advocate
for tearing down the homer-happy M's and reshaping them into a
small-ball team befitting the spacious confines of new Safeco
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do this darn thing here with pitching and
defense. It's coming along. The arms here have improved,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a really productive farm system, you have to
do what we have done _ stock up some arms, start building a
pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Piniella was simply brushing up on his salesman skills by
practicing on fans and the media. Goodness knows, Piniella needs
those skills.
</P>
<P>
   As the team works toward trying to sign Ken Griffey and Alex
Rodriguez to contract extensions, it is also Piniella's
responsibility to try and convince both that the M's are not
without direction.
</P>
<P>
   The move away from big ball; the decision to divest of Randy
Johnson; the anxious countdown to Safeco Field and the decision to
not make any big free-agent moves _ all have been a necessary part
of the club's transition, Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told them that,'' Piniella said about his talks with
Griffey and Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we were renting pitchers. We were in the
rent-a-pitcher business. And basically all you're doing is delaying
the inevitable, which is putting together a good, young pitching
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey and A-Rod are looking for a greater commitment
besides John Halama, Gil Meche and Freddy Garcia, Piniella
indicated there is still time. In fact, he said this off-season
will be a better time for the Mariners to make free-agent hires
appropriate for the new ballyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you had to move into this ballpark and take a look
into this park before you put a team together,'' Piniella said.
``You put a team together for the Kingdome and all of a sudden it
doesn't work in this situation and now you're stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Piniella, he, too, is without a contract after next
season _ a situation that has not yet made him ponder his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought of that. Not at all. I've been here
seven years and I've really enjoyed it,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this is a baseball town. Ever since I've been here,
the smallest attendance we've had is 2.2 million. And we've brought
out as much as 3.2 million. This is a baseball town. You can see
the enthusiasm here at the ballpark. You put a good product on the
field, I'll tell you what, this place here will turn into a
Baltimore or a Cleveland or a Denver overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Piniella was making a pitch to anyone else besides
Griffey and A-Rod about the plan to make that ``if'' a reality, he
was more than vaguely convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of pieces here. We're very strong up the
middle, which is the cornerstone of the team. We've got pitching
now that can pitch at the major league level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this. I know we're closer. Our level of ability
has jumped. It's improved. Since last July, we've added eight real
nice arms to this organization. We don't have position players
coming. For us to shore up that part of things, we have to spend
some money in the free-agent market. Or we'll have to trade. But
this thing here can shore up here in a big hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Piniella also knows it had better.

NORTHRIDGE REPORT BLASTS FORMER COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a bold, articulate document, 130 pages long and nearly
sordid in its accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The report detailing the summer-long internal investigation into
the Cal State Northridge football program was released Wednesday.
It paints a picture of former head coach Ron Ponciano as dishonest
with open disregard for NCAA rules and campus policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, who has maintained he is innocent of serious charges
even after he was fired on July 16, was excoriated.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most serious allegations made in the report were
Ponciano's role in falsifying travel expenses and having a lack of
control over the actions of the Quarterback Club, a booster group
that was characterized in the report as unsupervised and refusing
to answer to the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did a thorough investigation,'' said interim CSUN
President Louanne Kennedy, who made the decision to fire Ponciano
in July. ``It's unfortunate that individuals were negatively
affected, but we have a responsibility to have a rule-governed
environment in our institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, who has accepted an assistant coaching position at
McPherson College, a Division II school in Kansas, has not seen the
report but called most of its findings ``absolutely ridiculous.''
Ponciano maintains he didn't do anything to his knowledge that was
wrong or unethical. The university report did not include
Ponciano's formal rebuttal to the allegations, although it
dismissed his arguments as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who knows the Northridge situation knows that it is
an inadequate response about me,'' he said. ``Their report is
exactly what it is, their report. It doesn't mean a hill of beans
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusions, however, are based upon what Internal
Auditor Peter Dinauer and then-faculty representative Tom Shannon
felt was a mountain of evidence against Ponciano:
</P>
<P>
   _The investigative team of Dinauer and Shannon determined there
is merit to many of the 19 allegations made in an anonymous letter
received by the athletic department in May.
</P>
<P>
   _With Ponciano's knowledge, the Quarterback Club, which was
founded in 1995 but didn't exist in an organized form last season,
hasn't cooperated with CSUN in disclosing its methods of operation
and financial activities.
</P>
<P>
   _There were numerous violations and university policies flouted
regarding players, including ``improper recruitment, extra
benefits, inducements, conduct and inadequate institutional control
that were clear, serious, substantial and not isolated and not
inadvertent in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   _Ponciano tried to fire two assistant coaches whom he believed
were providing information to Dinauer and Shannon. The general
consensus is those coaches were Keith Borges and Craig Wall, who
are no longer active coaches but who are being paid by CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   _The last conclusion of the report is that Ponciano and several
other coaches lied during the course of the investigation and
didn't provide adequate information about their knowledge of NCAA
violations and university policies and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Dick Dull reacted to the report by issuing a
list of self-imposed penalties.
</P>
<P>
   They include the loss of two scholarships, from 63 to 61 over
the next two seasons, a reduction of expense-paid recruiting visits
from 25 to 20 for this season and that the department will take
``appropriate disciplinary action'' against coaches who have been
found to have violated NCAA rules or university policies, although
Kennedy noted no other coaches would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the NCAA whether to accept Dull's recommendations,
but that organization's decision won't be made until it reviews the
report itself.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ponciano's firing, offensive coordinator Rob
Phenicie was forced to resign in July.
</P>
<P>
   Because Dull's penalties aren't severe, and Shannon described
them as ``appropriate'' and ``reasonable,'' it appears the heart of
Ponciano's dismissal was what the report called ``misuse of travel
cash advances.''
</P>
<P>
   The report detailed instances of when Ponciano, as a CSUN
assistant coach in 1996, submitted suspicious receipts for
reimbursement. Kennedy believes Ponciano created $3,260 in bogus
receipts in '96, even though she wasn't sure how he used that
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not make a great deal of difference to me whether
(Ponciano) personally benefited or whether he was circumventing
university policies and rules in order to do something else with
the money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In two specific cases, Ponciano turned in receipts from which he
claimed were two different cities on different dates that were
nearly identical in markings and numbers, as if they came out of
the same receipt booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bubb, CSUN's former athletic director who hired Ponciano as
the head coach in 1998, said he never heard of these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back and talk to the people who worked with Ron,''
Bubb said, ``the comments I got from them were that Ron was great
to work with. No one ever brought to my attention ... there was a
problem with his travel reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Dull said there simply wasn't enough accounting to track
Ponciano's receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the ability of an auditor a considerable amount over
the life of this inquiry to begin to cross-reference in the case of
football receipts the numbers on the receipts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of offenses went on and on. Dinauer _ who was not
available to comment Wednesday _ and Shannon determined that of the
19 charges made against Ponciano in the anonymous letter, 15 were
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the NCAA rules violations were minor. But what
bothered Kennedy was the information she said she received about
Ponciano's attitude toward the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano was accused of cooperating with the Quarterback Club in
holding team barbecues once per week during the '98 season, even
after he was told in a letter from Bubb those meals were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barbecues continued,'' she said. ``There is independent
verification (Ponciano) said to other coaches, `This is a silly
rule, not something we're going to pay attention to.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Jamgotchian, Ponciano's Woodland Hills attorney, said he
perceives the report to be biased with no clear proof Ponciano did
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is just the university's side of what happened,''
he said. ``This report should not be viewed as some sort of fair,
impartial report. It seems as though they had already formed a
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Football practice for incoming freshmen and junior college
transfers began Wednesday. Kennedy wants the release of the report
to end another sad chapter in the history of a CSUN athletic
program that has been tarnished by controversy several times this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is over,'' she said. ``We're ready to go forward. That's
really what this is all about: This is over now.''

AT 100 YEARS, MAJESTIC MOUNT RAINIER FACES MODERN-DAY PITFALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an icy arctic island in a lush evergreen sea, a place where
you can find alpine plants more like their cousins on the Alaskan
tundra than shrubs 10 miles away on the forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's THE Mountain. On the days it's ``out,'' Mount Rainier
hovers over Seattle and the rest of Puget Sound, practically
shouting ``Pacific Northwest!''
</P>
<P>
   To Joan Geyer, who runs the Mounthaven cottages and ski lodge,
Mount Rainier is money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live and die by The Mountain,'' says Geyer, who quit her
job as the operations supervisor of a bank earlier this year to
bank instead on Rainier's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a century since this mountain of ice and fire, this
place of deep, moist forests and flowered meadows and craggy rock
outcrops, was declared the nation's fifth national park.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mount Rainier National Park celebrates its centennial
Thursday, this island of nature faces threats from outside that
could make Joan Geyer's bet a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view we enjoyed from the summit could hardly be surpassed
in sublimity and grandeur,'' naturalist John Muir wrote of his 1888
ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mount Rainier suffers from some of the worst air
pollution in the region, much of it floating in from a rapidly
growing number of tailpipes puttering around from Everett to
Tacoma. Crowds overrun the park's most popular spots. And even the
glaciers that shine on a sunny day are slowly disappearing _ the
victim, many scientists believe, of an artificially overheated
global climate.
</P>
<P>
   The image of The Mountain has graced everything from gorgeous,
multicolored oil paintings to three-tone cans of beer. On
Washington state's automobile license plates, emblazoned for all
the world to see, is The Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the days The Mountain is itself plainly visible are
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 10 years,'' said Tom Mooza, who lives in
southern King County. ``We used to be able to drive by and see
Mount Rainier every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Born of a frontier-mentality boosterism, Mount Rainier was the
first national park to allow cars inside its boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   That 1907 decision killed off the pioneer Longmire family's
tourist business inside the park, which had depended on ferrying
tourists back and forth by horses or mules.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of autos also brought on what is ending up, at
century's end, as a solitude-strangling crush of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that a quarter-century before Mount Rainier became a
national park, people from Seattle or Tacoma commonly would take a
week to reach it, and then only with a proficient guide.
</P>
<P>
   Today, so many people tramp through on remote backcountry trails
that delicate alpine plants sustain damage that will take decades
to mend. About 2.2 million visitors are expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Park planning documents for handling the crush of visitors are
starting to mention The Mountain's ``carrying capacity'' _ an idea
that would have been anathema to the park's planners and early
promoters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a ``national park'' was new to the world, an
American invention that started with Yellowstone in 1872. Eighteen
years later came Yosemite, Sequoia and General Grant (later annexed
into Kings Canyon National Park) in California.
</P>
<P>
   Just nine years later, a scant decade after Washington's
statehood, Congress declared Mount Rainier a national park. It was
a move squarely intended to promote tourism and development in
Washington state, one roundly backed by the business titans who ran
the railroads of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of emphasis in those early years, and Rainier
is a classic example of this, on providing as much access to the
park as possible,'' said Jon Jarvis, who became park superintendent
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Golf courses, ski lodges and even a railroad running to the
summit were proposed. At the time, the very American idea of
national parks was new. People looked to Europe for their
inspiration. That's why you find architecture at Rainier today that
is reminiscent of alpine Swiss ski lodges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our model. We didn't have anything to model our parks
on,'' Jarvis said. ``The whole concept of national parks was just
being formed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Northern Pacific Railroad, forerunner of at least
one major timber company, got about 450,000 acres of prime
timberland for giving up its icy, rocky land at Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Rainier is a haven for the wild Washington that
existed before those early pro-development dreams that worked so
well.
</P>
<P>
   It shelters 680 native species of plants, 54 types of mammals,
126 kinds of birds and 17 species of amphibians and reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put as much effort into the long-term ecology so
that we are achieving the other half of our mandate as well as we
have achieved the visitor-access part of our mandate,'' Jarvis
said. ``At the turn of the century, we were surrounded by hundreds
of thousands of acres of forest just like Rainier. And that's not
true any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, visitors driving out to the shuttle-bus pickup point 10
miles west of the Nisqually entrance today see acres and acres of
clear-cut mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you never, ever visit Mount Rainier, it has the
potential to have an enormous effect on you _ The Mountain is
really The Volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's literally a mountain cooking in its own juices,'' said
Dale Thompson, a former chief naturalist at the park. ``It could
erupt again tomorrow, or not for another century. There's no way of
knowing when it will happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson recalls the first time he climbed to Rainier's summit.
He reached the peak in a blizzard with almost zero visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I knew I was at 14,000 feet was that there, at
the crater rock, I could reach down and feel the little jets of
steam and gasses that issue from the crater rim,'' he recalled.
``These have melted ice caverns below the crater rim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain's last eruption was probably during the 1800s,
though late-19th-century reports of smoke swirling near the summit
might well have been large dust clouds caused by rockfall and
viewed with overly eager eyes, park officials say.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear something quite strange happened with the volcano
about 5,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been an eruption. Perhaps it was an earthquake. Or
maybe the gasses inside the mountain heated to a point where they
melted the ice and snow on top of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, at least half a square-mile of the mountain came
sliding down, a slurry of rocks from pebble-sized to minivan-sized
riding on a watery cushion of melted glacier water, picking up
ancient trees as it went.
</P>
<P>
   The muddy flow delivered 3.8 cubic miles of this material into
the lowlands, writes Ruth Kirk in her book ``Sunrise to Paradise:
The Story of Mount Rainier'' (1999, University of Washington
Press).
</P>
<P>
   People who live in Kent and Auburn and Puyallup may not know it,
but they live on Mount Rainier _ or at least, on what used to be
Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano's height dropped from about 16,000 feet above sea
level to something like its current height of 14,411.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing people can do will change the explosive nature of The
Mountain. And it's difficult to guess when it might go again. What
can be easily predicted is a continued onslaught of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, park officials plan to release a draft park
management plan. The public will be allowed to comment before it is
made final, probably in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, the park superintendent, wants to disperse visitors
more. The road system at Rainier was purposely limited after
wilderness advocates in the early part of this century complained
it was getting too easy for too many people to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps giving visitors more information about the park _ not
everyone has to go to the popular visitor center at Paradise _ will
help them spread out, Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into limiting people,'' Jarvis said.
``What I would like to do is educate people at their entry, so they
can make informed and educated decisions about where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mount Rainier's sub-alpine meadows, conifer-filled
forests, streams, waterfalls and glaciers are expected to play host
to their highest number of visitors ever.
</P>
<P>
   People will get married there and spread the ashes of their dear
departeds there, as they have done increasingly over the past
century.
</P>
<P>
   But that 100 years is a mere blip in Rainier's million-year
history. If Rainier's tenure on the Earth were a day, its status as
a park would have lasted only 8.6 seconds so far.
</P>
<P>
   On that scale, Joan Geyer wants to keep seeing people come to
Rainier at least for the next second or two. She's counting on her
Mountlake cottages, a half-mile from the park's southwestern
Nisqually entrance, to keep pulling people in.
</P>
<P>
   Any yet even Geyer knows that if too many people come, it could
profoundly change the experience of visiting The Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very fine line there,'' she said.

HINGIS HOLDS OFF RAYMOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Martina Hingis is the No. 1-ranked women's
tennis player in the world. She recently went through the biggest
slump of her career at this year's French Open and Wimbledon. Then,
she snapped out of it by winning the TIG Classic in Carlsbad last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But Hingis, and all of her drama wasn't the story Wednesday
night. Lisa Raymond, a feisty 5-foot-5 American, forced Hingis into
another drama, nearly pulling a major upset.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who was satisfied with how she played, weathered the
scare and beat Raymond 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 in the Acura Classic at
Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made me make the errors,'' Hingis said. ``She had made me
run a little bit around.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond won over the crowd throughout the one-hour, 36-minute
match, although a faction of the audience continuously yelled for
Hingis. Raymond, ranked 29th in the world, had a solid chance for
an upset until Hingis broke her to take a 5-3 lead in the final
set.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had three break points in the game. Raymond had an
advantage. In all, 12 points were played as each player had
unforced errors and winners.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond kept Hingis moving. But Raymond also was on the move.
The players used similar styles, mostly slugging out ground strokes
from the baseline. That the players mirrored each other may have
made it even more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her type of game is the same as mine,'' Hingis said. ``. . .
As the little girls, we're more speedy.''
</P>
<P>
   One key point was when Hingis broke Raymond to tie it, 1-1, in
the third set. Raymond had an advantage to go up and not getting
it, she said, was a key in the match.
</P>
<P>
   In the first set, it looked as if Hingis barely would sweat
against Raymond as she dominated in 28 minutes. But Raymond turned
it around by breaking Hingis' serve to open the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if was nervous,'' Raymond said. ``I wasn't moving
my feet well and was missing a lot of slices. I really took the
pressure off in the second set and decided just to play, then
things changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player then held serve for the remainder of the second set,
after Raymond broke. But Raymond had to withstand two of Hingis'
break points in the set's final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough playing her,'' Hingis said. ``It's hard when
she slices that backhand. You have to work for your points. She
doesn't give anything for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' close victory could add more questions to how dominant
she is. After a first-round exit at Wimbledon to Jelena Dokic,
Hingis re-claimed her top ranking last week in Carlsbad. She has
5,509 computer ranking points, 143 more than former top-ranked
Lindsay Davenport. The two lead third-ranked Steffi Graf by more
than 1,000 points, so Hingis and Davenport likely could end up in
an exclusive battle for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Hingis appeared closer to suffering another upset,
than ready to take on Davenport. She appeared frustrated at times,
dropping her racket twice in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say escape,'' Hingis said. ``You can't really
underestimate her. Maybe against another player, I wouldn't have to
work as much.''

IOWA'S STRAW POLL IS HOGWASH, HISTORY SAYS  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
Washington _ There will be more political journalists than pigs in
Ames, Iowa, this weekend for a Republican presidential straw poll
being billed as the political event of the year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many delegates are at stake: zero.
</P>
<P>
   How it will affect the presidential race: It won't, if history
is a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to win: the Iowa Republican Party, which will
extract at least $300,000 from voters and the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in this front-loaded election cycle where party
nominations will probably be decided by March, the political
establishment is giving Super Bowl-size attention to an event which
is at most an early exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful, laudable fund-raising scheme,'' said Arizona
Senator John McCain, the one Republican candidate who is not
participating. ``I respect them for conning everyone into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Iowa Republican Party has done all it can to
convince anyone who will listen that the goings-on Saturday inside
the Iowa State University basketball arena are of the utmost
importance _ while charging every Iowan who wants to vote $25 for
the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``straw poll'' is believed to derive from the act of
throwing a handful of straw in the air and seeing which way the
wind blows it. The Iowa Straw Poll may be a bit less scientific.
</P>
<P>
   Between 12,000 and 15,000 Iowa Republicans _ fewer than 1
percent of the state's registered voters _ are expected to cast
ballots. Tickets, transportation and refreshments are in most cases
being provided by the campaigns themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Party rules specify that only Iowans may cast ballots. They also
specify that voters may pay with cash, check, Mastercard or Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Republicans insist that the results are a good barometer of
election-year sensibilities, as they bask in the national spotlight
during a month normally devoted to corn harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very accurate indicator of a candidate's
organizational strength, a candidate's message and a candidate's
ability to raise money,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of
the Iowa GOP.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been a very inaccurate indicator of who will win the
party's presidential nomination, let alone the Iowa caucus _ where
actual delegates will be selected early next year.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush won the Iowa Straw Poll in 1979. But that was nine
years before he won his party's presidential nomination. Pat
Robertson prevailed in 1987. There was no outright winner in 1995 _
though Texas Senator Phil Gramm stunned the political world by
tying Kansas Senator Bob Dole. Gramm, who had spent $800,000 on the
straw poll, dropped out before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a pep rally,'' said Troy McCullough, news editor
of the Ames Journal. ``I'm not sure what it has to do with the
overall democracy of electing the president. It's not a landmark
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most candidates dare not miss out on the perceived
glory of winning, or the feared shame of losing. Pundits are
already predicting that poor finishes by former Tennessee Governor
Lamar Alexander or former Vice President Dan Quayle may doom their
beleaguered campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of McCain, who is skipping the event, the
entire Republican field will be stumping the heartland's cornfields
for most of the week. Some have been gearing toward the event for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, vowed in
June to compete and win _ prompting some to suggest his aura of
invincibility could be pierced if he stumbles. Publishing tycoon
Steve Forbes has been rolling from county to county in a pair of
luxury buses, and filling the airwaves with commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is full of politicians; presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan
was out early one morning in Des Moines where he said he spotted a
lonely figure jogging by the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Lamar!'' he said, referring to Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who has spent his few remaining campaign dollars on
Iowa television commercials this past month, appears to be pinning
his credibility on exceeding expectations in the straw poll, hoping
beyond hope that a strong finish will rejuvenate his moribund
campaign. Alexander has averaged more than a day a week in the
state for the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's political pre-eminence in the presidential election _ and
its ability to command such a successful straw poll _ is largely
the result of its first-in-the-nation caucus, scheduled for late
January or early February.
</P>
<P>
   While New Hampshire boasts the nation's first primary, the first
delegates will actually be selected at hundreds of small caucuses
in Iowa. As a result, every GOP candidate except McCain has spent
at least twice as many days campaigning in Iowa than in any other
state but his or her own.
</P>
<P>
   Such attention is the source of some envy. Many credit Iowa's
disproportionate influence for candidates' strong interest in farm
issues, and their devotion to federal subsidies to ethanol, a fuel
derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Iowans acknowledge that their state provides
little more than a rural backdrop to a media-driven campaign that
is no different, and hardly more personal, in Sioux City than in
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, they go from big TV market to big TV market. In
Iowa, they go from one-lung radio station to one-lung radio
station,'' said veteran Iowa political journalist James Flansburg.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's festivities will include huge hospitality tents paid
for by the campaigns to lure voters into their web. Alexander is
boasting baby back ribs and country star Crystal Gayle. Utah Sen.
Orrin Hatch promises an eclectic mix including basketball star Karl
Malone, the Osmond Brothers and perhaps Gladys Knight (without the
Pips). Bush is offering former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger
Staubach and San Antonio Spurs basketball star Sean Elliott, as
well as the University of Iowa's legendary football coach, Hayden
Fry.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 members of the media who have requested credentials are
gearing up for more traditional political fare.
</P>
<P>
   Can Bush live up to expectations? Will Alexander survive a
third-place finish? Who will lead among the religious right?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of IOWA12 (47086 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Flansburg offered his own advice on how to weight the various
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The straw poll is an absurdity. Mostly, it's pretense,'' he
said. ``Don't read the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Flansburg said his paper, the Des Moines Register, never used to
print the results of straw polls because the results tend to be
misleading. He said he feels personally responsible, in part, for
the advent of the Iowa Straw Poll, which he promoted heavily in the
1970s in the interest of getting a big story.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting 20 years later on the pages of the Washington Post,
he said he now feels it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry about that,'' he wrote.

DON'T MESS WITH NASCAR'S ROAD-COURSE HERITAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's never been difficult for me to defend the two road races on
the NASCAR Winston Cup schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Especially this weekend's event at Watkins Glen, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up a couple of hours east of The Glen, I've spent
any number of summer and fall weekends in the Finger Lakes Region
watching everything from open-wheel NASCAR Modifieds to six-wheel
Formula One cars to exotic Porsches and Ferraris negotiating the
track's long- and short-courses.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days when I was driving a used/abused 1964 Ford
Falcon Sprint _ lipstick red with two-foot-wide black stripes
painted across the hood, roof and trunk _ Watkins Glen was where
the drivers who were bigger than my life and the cars of someone
else's dreams fell out of the sky once or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Surely it's the same way for this generation of fans who have
been weaned on Winston Cup. That's why it ticks me off to see The
Glen and Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., annually singled
out as quick fixes for the series' chief ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, there aren't enough Winston Cup race dates available to
please everybody anymore, even the promoters at obviously deserving
facilities like Texas Motor Speedway and California Speedway. And
with new tracks either under construction or in the planning stages
in Kansas City, Chicago, Denver and metropolitan New York, the
competition for Cup dates figures to be fierce-to-cutthroat into
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Those observers who would drop the road courses from the current
34-race circuit maintain the events are by nature notoriously
single-file and boring; they present an extra expense for teams who
must build special cars; and they are depriving the fans of what
they want to see most _ oval-track paint-trading.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, not all Cup drivers and car owners view road racing
so narrowly. More important, NASCAR officials believe in diversity.
And the idea of dropping the two road-course events is not being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd make plans to be at some road courses next year,'' said
Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief operating
officer. ``There's one school of thought that the road courses add
a dimension to the Winston Cup Series. That if the Winston Cup
champion can be victorious over all the different scenarios, which
includes two road courses, that it adds credibility to the
championship. And we're somewhat a follower of that theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The other issue, Helton said, is a little less altruistic. It
has to do with making NASCAR a buck or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it relates to Sears Point, that's the only opportunity that
NASCAR has to be in the San Francisco market,'' Helton said. ``So
that road course, beyond just being a competitive issue for the
drivers, is a larger issue to NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton said he made that clear on June 27 to Bruton Smith, whose
Speedway Motorsports Inc., empire includes Sears Point. After a
weekend of complaints about the slow pace of improvements, most
notably to the Cup garage area, Helton said Smith approached him
about the possibility of moving the Sears Point date. Smith's
successful Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth and Las Vegas Motor
Speedway are flat-out begging for second Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very brief conversation leaving the driver's meeting
at Sears Point,'' Helton said. ``He said, `What do you think about
...' and that's when we reiterated the fact that the San Francisco
market area is very important to us. And we'd rather be patient in
allowing him enough time to get done what he needs to get done
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, tiny Watkins Glen doesn't pack the same demographic
wallop as San Francisco. But the scenic village at the tip of
Seneca Lake is the home of American road racing, dating to a sports
car race through the streets in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue that Watkins Glen is to NASCAR Winston Cup
what Green Bay, Wisconsin, is to the NFL,'' Helton said. ``Watkins
Glen's motorsports heritage is significant. It adds credibility to
the Winston Cup Series for NASCAR to run at Watkins Glen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know. It's where bigger-than-life drivers and dream cars
still fall out of the sky once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Indy's F1 project revs up with track's season over
The 2.61-mile road course that will play host to the inaugural U.S.
Grand Prix at Indianapolis next year has been paved, but it's not
quite ready for a snarling Formula One car.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. F1's ``Flying Circus'' is not scheduled to invade
the United States until Sept. 24, 2000. But work on a massive
project affecting all facets of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
will accelerate now that the 1999 racing season there is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its totality, we are probably 22 to 24 percent done,'' said
Kevin Forbes, IMS' director of engineering and construction. ``We
have the majority of the work to do in the next nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said a car could be driven on the road course that has
been carved into the Speedway's sprawling infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a complete lap,'' Forbes said during a briefing
for media covering NASCAR's Brickyard 400 last week. ``It would
depend on how fast that car would go. Anywhere at near speed, I
don't think we could because we don't have the safety devices in
place yet. I think by the end of October, the middle of November,
we'll be at a point where we could probably put a car pretty close
to speed on the course.''
</P>
<P>
   The road course will incorporate Turn 1 of the famed 2.5-mile
oval and the long straight in front of the covered grandstands. But
in a break with tradition, the F1 cars will run clockwise down the
front straight, exiting into the infield at a point near Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   The next big project will see the start of construction of the
combination 36 garages/suites for F1 use only in space formerly
occupied by tower terrace seating and the media center. Work
already is under way on the Pagoda control tower at the
start/finish line. And the foundation is in place for the
four-story media facility to be built north of the start/finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   Pit lane also will be reconstructed to accommodate the
requirements of Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway president Tony George, who broke tradition by bringing
NASCAR's Winston Cup Series to the track in 1994, said the pursuit
of F1 has been the most ambitious project of his near 10-year
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of people who were skeptical and I
think disappointed, if you will, that we chose to run another event
here six years ago,'' said George, referring to the Brickyard 400.
``But it's turned out to be a great event. It continues to build in
interest, and we're starting to see the same with the Formula One
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to give us three world-class events, and that's
what we were striving for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Speedway's cornerstone event, of course, remains the
Indianapolis 500. Despite the split between George's Indy Racing
League and the Championship Auto Racing Teams, the Indy 500
continues to draw approximately 400,000 fans on race day. George
said a crowd of 200,000 for the first Formula One race in the USA
since the ill-fated street event at Phoenix in 1991 is doable.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Forbes warned that the facility will not be
perfect next May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have all the paint on. We won't have all the
wall-coverings completed,'' Forbes said. ``What the fans can expect
here next May would be a facility that is nicely poised to go into
the next century.''
\Nsubheds:QUICK HITS Jarrett fast-breaking It's not an exaggeration
to say that Dale Jarrett has ``busted out the whupping stick'' on
his NASCAR Winston Cup brethren.
</P>

Richmond, Va., on May 15. Since then, the spread between first and
second has grown from 63 to a season-high 274 points in nine races.

<P>
   Jarrett's current advantage over Mark Martin is the biggest
after 20 races since Dale Earnhardt led Jarrett by 259 after the
event in Brooklyn, Mich., in 1993. More recent, Jeff Gordon was
working on a modest 82-point lead after 20 races last year. Boosted
by a record-tying 13 victories, Gordon went on to win his third Cup
championship by 364 points over Martin.

   Jarrett's] lead is three times larger than Gordon's after 20
races, even though D.J. has won ``only'' four races thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many days in the last couple of years when we
finished second, third, fourth or fifth,'' said Jarrett, driver of
the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus. ``And the
problem with that was that the guy in front of us leading the
points \RGordon\S was the guy finishing first. Even when we
finished first, he'd finish second. It's pretty frustrating from
the standpoint of trying to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now they see the races start counting down, and they
realize that their time is running out a little bit.''

escaped uninjured, while testing Tuesday at Las Vegas Motor

</P>
<P>
   Ray, a two-time winner in the Pep Boys Indy Racing League series
this season, had posted an unofficial speed of 208.97 mph before
backing his No. 2 Glidden/Menards Dallara-Aurora into the Turn 2
wall. Shortly after, he crashed his second car in Turn 2 of the
1.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed for myself, and I feel really bad for
my team,'' said Ray, who was participating in a Firestone tire

suffered a subdural hematoma, a collection of blood in the surface
of the brain, during a crash while testing at Gateway International
Raceway in Madison, Ill., last week. ``The day I start seriously
thinking about that I won't have any problems taking that step. But
it's definitely not that time for me yet.''

Raceway Park last week pushed him past Jack Sprague and into a
48-point lead with seven races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was relatively shocked to figure out that I'd gained the
point lead,'' said Biffle, driver of the No. 50 Grainger Ford F-150

HEAT IS ON MAVS IN DEALINGS WITH KEY FREE AGENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson worked overtime at his
Reunion Arena office the past two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has been staying late to finalize a one-year contract
with second-year guard Ansu Sesay, to make sure rookie Leon Smith
has smooth travel plans to and from next week's Big Man Camp in
Maui, and to keep tabs on the news concerning the Mavericks' free
agents. But also, Nelson stayed late to avoid the Texas heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 107 degrees outside, and, wouldn't you know it, our air
conditioner broke,'' Nelson said. ``You don't truly really
appreciate it until it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The same sentiment could apply toward free agents Gary Trent,
Cedric Ceballos and Samaki Walker. All three are flirting with the
idea of signing with other teams or persuading the Mavericks to
make sign-and-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks actually received good news about Trent, a power
forward who is their No. 1 off-season priority. After Trent turned
down a three-year, $11.28 million offer from Seattle over the
weekend, his options appear to be limited to the Mavericks, Los
Angles Clippers and Toronto Raptors. The Clippers recently traded
away forward Lorenzen Wright and could be in the market for a
low-post presence. The Raptors hope to re-sign veteran Charles
Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the woods with Gary yet, but certainly we
feel better about our situation,'' said Nelson, keeping daily
contact with hie father, coach and general manager Don, who is
spending the week at his home in Maui. ``We can offer Gary a ton of
playing time, a ton of touches and a ton of money a couple years
down the road. Hopefully that'll be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Walker's situation depends on Trent's decision, the
Mavericks are frantically working to make it easier to trade him.
Nelson said there are as many as seven scenarios on the table with
teams such as Orlando, Milwaukee, Minnesota and Vancouver that
covet Walker. Because he is a base-year-compensation free agent,
the Mavericks could, for example, sign Walker to a contract for $3
million and trade him, but only receive a player worth $1.5 million
in return. If the Mavericks can get involved in a three-way trade
to create themselves a trade exemption, however, they could accept
two players worth $1.5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic have offered small forwards Don MacLean or Pat Garrity
for Walker, but Nelson said the deal is ``third or fourth on our
list.'' Of course, if Trent signs elsewhere, moving Walker ceases
to be an option as he would become the Mavericks' starting power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, meanwhile, continues to yearn for a four-year deal,
but the Mavericks have offered only two years. The sides are close
on annual salary, but the difference in commitment has Ceballos
considering interest from Seattle, Sacramento, Phoenix, Atlanta and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could also sign-and-trade Cedric, but that's not our first
choice,'' Donnie Nelson said. ``Plan A is to sign Ced and Gary and
go to war next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sesay, a second-round draft pick in 1998 who broke a bone in his
right foot during his first practice, agreed to non-guaranteed
contract worth $500,000. He is working out in Philadelphia and
plans to arrive in Dallas next month.
</P>
<P>
   Two Mavericks big men hope to have their immediate futures
settled in the coming weeks. Smith is trying to land a spot on a
Continental Basketball Association team, and center Bruno Sundov
has a hearing this month in London in which he is trying to void a
contract signed with the Croatian National Team at age 13.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys' retooled offensive line
pleased Chan Gailey during the early stages of Monday night's
exhibition game against the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   With four of five starters in place, the exception being injured
right guard Everett McIver, the Cowboys survived some early
surprises from the Browns, such as blitzing on the first series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for us. We need to see those kind of things and
give everybody that sense of confidence that whatever they throw
out at us, we'll be ready to handle it,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The line, bolstered by the return of center Mark Stepnoski, gave
Aikman plenty of time to navigate in the pocket throughout the
first quarter. The Browns never sacked Aikman and rarely applied
pressure. The Cowboys allowed 34 sacks last season.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the retooling on the line included moving Flozell Adams
from right guard to left guard. After being forced into extended
work as a rookie last year after McIver's injury, Adams, at
6-foot-7, 335 pounds, is learning and maturing as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Flozell really played well,'' Gailey said. ``He had
a couple of penalties I did not like, but actually he had good
technique after the ball was snapped and was doing the things he
needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as McIver is out, the Cowboys will rely on the progress
of rookie Solomon Page, who started Monday at right guard with
mixed results, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solomon played like a rookie,'' Gailey said. ``He made some
mistakes, but he kept fighting. I thought he went out and handled
himself well, although technique- and assignment-wise was not where
it needed to be.'' Receiver signed
</P>
<P>
   With James McKnight lost for the season with a knee injury, the
Cowboys tried to fill their need for speed by signing rookie free
agent Deon Mitchell yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, out of Northern Illinois, started training camp with
the San Diego Chargers, but had since been cut. Too many flags
</P>
<P>
   Penalties continue to dog the Cowboys in the post-Barry Switzer
era, and it's beginning to frustrate Gailey. The Cowboys were
flagged 17 times for 149 yards in Monday's exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he was most upset with penalties called on the first
team and penalties in the kicking game. Although some of the
penalties came with the second and third units on the field, Gailey
said most of the calls can be eliminated simply by players keeping
their head in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's really discouraging and upsetting about the
penalties was there were quite a few pre-snap penalties,' Gailey
said. ``Those can be corrected with concentration.''
Back in the mix
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Raghib Ismail, tight end David LaFleur and
linebacker Quentin Coryatt all returned to the practice field
yesterday, with LaFleur being the closest to full speed.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur, out with a fractured right ankle, took part in drills
and made several catches.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail, who suffered a sprained left shoulder on Aug. 4, did not
take part in any live passing drills. He was limited to walking
through pass routes. He is listed as day-to-day and is expected to
be more active in drills as his shoulder heals.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, who also missed Monday's exhibition with a strained
Achilles' tendon, did dress for practice yesterday, but kept his
activity light. Making an impression
</P>
<P>
   With injuries creating opportunities for some young players in
the defensive backfield, rookie free agent Duan Hawthorne impressed
the coaching staff against the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne started at one corner in place of injured Kevin Mathis
and coaches say he outplayed Zebbie Lethridge, also competing for
playing time at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duan did pretty good in the ballgame. He got that penalty but
he wasn't in bad position,'' Gailey said. ``I am disappointed
Zebbie didn't play a little better.''

Rangers' Zimmerman apologizes to umpire 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Johnny Paul 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers reliever Jeff Zimmerman apologized to
umpire Gary Cederstrom for the 11th-inning outburst that nearly led
to the pitcher's ejection from Tuesday's game at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman telephoned Cederstrom in the umpire's room after
Tuesday's game. Zimmerman, who called his conduct
``unprofessional,'' shouted at Cederstrom after a 3-2 slider was
called a ball, giving Detroit's Karim Garcia a leadoff walk.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's outburst included a profanity, and Cederstrom headed
toward the mound before being intercepted by manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had overstepped the boundary,'' Zimmerman said. ``It
was very unprofessional of me. I shouldn't have shown him up.
There's a right way and a wrong way to show your disapproval, and
that was definitely the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky I didn't get run. I wanted to apologize out there on
the mound, but he was pretty fired up. If I would have said
anything, I would have been ejected.'' Zimmerman has flared up at
umpires at least three times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a right way and a wrong way to get your point
across,'' Oates said. ``He's lucky Gary didn't throw him out. Maybe
the next umpire won't be as lenient. They both got their point
across. We got it settled, and we move on.'' Hamstrung Rangers
right fielder Juan Gonzalez (strained left hamstring) and closer
John Wetteland (strained right hamstring) are listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who was injured in the fourth inning Tuesday and did
not play last night, missed seven games in May with a hamstring
injury. This strain does not appear to be as severe, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he relayed to me,'' trainer Danny Wheat said.
``Hopefully, this will be less serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's hamstring has been bothering him the past three
days, Oates said, but the closer insisted he could have pitched
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that are smart even though you don't
necessarily like it,'' Wetteland said.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.

<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   1. STEVE MARTIN, MAN OF LETTERS
</P>
<P>
   by RJ Smith from The New York Times Magazine
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin tells a joke. It's a painful moment. This joke
arrives so unexpectedly - and in the middle of a lunch that, while
cordial, has hardly been a picnic - that it' ``s almost
inexplicable. These days, what Martin wants is to write. The comic
who packed 20,000-seat arenas in the 1970s and who orbited more
catch phrases than Mike Myers and Chris Rock combined now considers
himself more a writer than a performer.

   2. AMID REVOLVING PRIME MINISTERS, RUSSIA'S NUKES REMAIN A
THREAT
</P>
<P>
   by Arjun Makhijani from The Progressive
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to widespread public opinion, the danger of a nuclear
confrontation between the United States and Russia has not receded.
During the NATO-Yugoslavia war, the tension between the two powers
rose to some of the highest levels since the Cuban missile crisis.

   3. THE BIG BANG MAN LEFT STANDING
</P>
<P>
   by Joseph D'Agnese from Discover Magazine
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a physicist figured out how the universe
began. Then everyone forgot about him. Free-lance writer reports on
the life of Ralph Alpher, who in 1948 wrote a Ph.D. dissertation
that gave birth to the scientific theory known as the Big Bang. He
revealed mathematically how the universe began in a superhot
explosion 14 billion years ago. But in 1948, these were loony
ideas. Hence his anonymity.

<P>
   4. THE LEGACY OF LAND MINES, CLUSTER BOMBLETS AND U-235
</P>
<P>
   by Bill Mesler from The Progressive
</P>
<P>
   They are about the size of a paper-towel holder, bright yellow
with orange lettering. A little white plastic umbrella is attached
to one end, giving it a harmless, toy-like appearance. But these
little items are far from innocuous. 5. ECLIPSES PERSIST ; PEOPLE
DO CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   by Flora Lewis
</P>
<P>
   There is the perpetual, and there is the desire, the effective
will for change. There have been eclipses since the earth and its
satellite turn around the sun. Since at least the second century
A.D. and the Greek astronomer Ptolemy, they have been predicted
but, for most of the ages, feared.

Hawaii have seen beyond previous limits of visibility to make

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: `Dick' works wonders for the Watergate-weary
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little-heralded movie ``Dick,'' a Watergate put-on, turned
up in theaters just in time to join the national celebration of the
25th anniversary of Richard Nixon's disgraced exit from the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, not exactly celebration. But newspapers and TV news,
especially cable channels with nothing better to do, used the
occasion to go back to Watergate for one last nostalgic wallow,
dredging up its images as if summoning ghosts to a seance.
</P>
<P>
   There was John Dean again, ratting out the White House sotto
voce. Nixon's defenestration of Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Bulletins
of the Saturday Night Massacre as The Trick fired the special
prosecutor and bodies started falling like dominoes in the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   And over and over, Nixon himself, in his various Old Nixon, New
Nixon, New Revised Nixon guises. Nixon not being a crook. Nixon
lying to us. Nixon being tough, being unctuous, being _ as he was
off and on throughout his career _ maudlin about himself. His
self-pitying valedictory.
</P>
<P>
   The rehash served as a reminder for some of us _ and with luck a
lesson to younger folks _ that Watergate was not just the sportive
scandal-mongering, partisan gotcha and hyper politics that later
apologists have managed to convince many was the case.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a president running a gang of political thugs and
burglars from the White House, subverting the CIA and FBI, misusing
federal power to punish domestic ``enemies,'' ordering payoffs. The
fundamental institutions of our republic were imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's lifelong psychodrama had, in the isolation of the White
House, come altogether unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick'' turns all this dark theater into welcome farce. It is
the engaging conceit of the movie that the Deep Throat source for
The Washington Post's deadly reporting was two ditzy teenage girls
who, by misadventure, had stumbled onto Watergate evidence and,
disillusioned out of a crush on Nixon after learning he actually
hates his dog, spill the beans.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hedaya's Nixon is not the evil prince of director Oliver
Stone's noir ``Nixon,'' but the actor nails a near-Nixon: Nixon's
inept stabs at pleasantry and instinctive vindictiveness, the
physical awkwardness of a man working to control himself as if he
were his own puppet, with those weird millisecond delays between
command _ wave, smile _ and movement.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters Woodward and Bernstein are played as two-thirds of
the Three Stooges, clowns who fall into fame and decide to keep
Deep Throat's identity secret not to protect the sources but
because it would be just too embarrassing to admit who they are.
And ``Dick's'' Henry Kissinger is even more a parody of himself
than the real one is.
</P>
<P>
   We dare not forget the real Waltergate, but ``Dick'' _ raunchy,
irreverent and despite itself sometimes oddly moving _ is the
send-up Watergate has always needed. Nixophiles and Nixophobes
alike will despise it, and with good reason. A Watergate played for
laughs is an exercise in profound mental health.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.

on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack

   TOMATOES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Sometimes it seems like there are as

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ We're a better people than we once

 &HT;    My version of the license plate game
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ I'm doing my best to take the back roads to Dallas
on a hot summer day that starkly reminds us that a drought, or at
least a punishing dry spell, is never a remote possibility. The
fields are turning brown, and a pickup traveling across a cow
pasture outside of Mount Enterprise kicks up a cloud of red dust.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to avoid the interstate, but I make a few side
jaunts on the way up, cutting through on state Hwy. 135 in Kilgore
to hit Interstate 20. This is not the most attractive part of this
city whose legacy lies in being at the epicenter of the East Texas
oil boom of the 1930s, though being the home of the Kilgore College
Rangerettes is a close second. The architectural motif of the
unvarying line of oil-related businesses along this five-mile
stretch of road is yellow sheet-metal circa 1970, now rusted and
often flapping in what little breeze exists. There are more than a
few grim beer joints, their parking lots respectably full of trucks
even though it's only 2 in the afternoon. It's a rough time to be
in the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   I pass an automotive shop whose name escapes me, with a phrase
that ambiguously says below the business name, ``Established a long
time ago.'' Being an automotive shop, I guess a ``long time ago''
is relative.
</P>
<P>
   Before I hear from the Kilgore chamber of commerce, let me
hasten to add that I am very fond of that little town, having spent
my first year of college there and then returning about 15 years
later to teach there for another year. Hwy. 135 is a functional
necessity, since all parts of all towns can't be picturesque. And
there are plenty of other parts of Kilgore that are lovely, like
the college, parts of downtown, the oil-derrick replicas at
Christmas, and the fine library.
</P>
<P>
   I looked in vain for my favorite oil-belt bar, Red's, though I
had no intention of stopping. It was a favorite watering hole for
me and a friend, with a fine shuffleboard table and genial
proprietors. The wife had been one of the original Kilgore College
Rangerettes, and one could still see a spark of that grace and
athletic ability in the way she sent that puck down the hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   Red's apparently isn't where I remembered it somewhere near
downtown in the midst of yellow-sheet-metal hell, but when I have
more time I'll find it.
</P>
<P>
   Onward and upward to I-20. If I had my druthers and more time,
I'd have taken old Hwy. 80 from Longview to Dallas, stopping at red
lights every 20 miles in towns like Gladewater, subject of a
wonderful song by Michelle Shocked about 12 years ago, called
``Making The Run To Gladewater.'' It's a paean to living in a dry
town, Gilmer in her case, and trying to get to a package store
before the clock hits 1 a.m. on a Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   I like the old Hwy. 80 route because I once spent four months
redesigning a string of weeklies for a company that was fool enough
to hire me as a consultant. It was a fun gig, with good pay and the
luxury of flitting in and out of these towns without having to deal
with the aftermath of my intrusions. The Mineola Monitor. The
Quitman Democrat. The Grand Saline Sun. The Van Progress. The
Edgewood Enterprise. There all little weeklies that chronicle the
lives of their communities with modest prose and blurry pictures
but a pride in the towns they covered.
</P>
<P>
   One of my minor talents is being able to recount the name of
every newspaper in nearly every town in Texas. There are probably a
few in the Panhandle that I might miss, but if this was ever a
``Jeopardy'' question I would walk away the big winner. Of course,
that and a buck will get you a cup of coffee. As I drove down the
road the other day, whenever an exit came up for another hamlet I
would test myself to see how many brain cells had died.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see: Forney: The Messenger. Terrell: The Tribune.
Mesquite: The Progess. It's my dumb version of the license plate
game.
</P>
<P>
   My last wave of nostalgia comes when I pass Big Town in
Mesquite, after getting back on Hwy. 80 to cut over to I-30 and get
to downtown Dallas. This was the primo shopping mecca when I was a
kid growing up in the mid 1970s. It wasn't strictly a mall, more a
shopping center with several halls, but it was an impressive
display of consumerism at the time, with the water tower serving as
the landmark to let us country folk know we finally had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The water tower is still there, needing a paint job, but Big
Town has seen better days. I am running out of time for side trips
and don't explore further, soon hitting rush hour traffic in the
towns that now serve merely as bedroom communities for Big D _
Garland, Rowlett, Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   I spend much of the rest of the trip trying to remember the name
of the Garland newspaper, but it never does come to me.

   EDITORIAL-CARTERS _ Not to minimize the accomplishments of the
other eight recipients of the 1999 Presidential Medals of freedom,
but it was fitting that Presdient Clinton just happened to make a
separate presentation to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. The couple from
Plaisn truly do deserve being singled out. (Geshwiler, Atlanta

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Television digs emotion. So the enduring
image of the shootings at a suburban Los Angeles Jewish center will
be that of little kids holding hands, fleeing the gunman who wanted
to shoot them down like dogs. It is an image for our strange,
dislocated times. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED WEDNESDAY.

<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ PRAGUE _ Forget American in Paris. Think
American in Prague. Or, as in the case of Paula Salguero, a

only other Spanish-speaking person in the city _ a stroke of luck.

 &HT;    Inventor: Schools need see-through lockers
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jason E. Smith has wrested an opportunity from
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the shootings at Heritage High School in
Rockdale County, the 28-year-old software marketer from Cumming
headed to Home Depot to buy some plastic glass. He cut the door out
of a locker he bought and riveted in a clear window.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his creation LockerVu, and he has a patent pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to my wife, (these school shootings) wouldn't happen if
they had clear lockers. I thought surely somebody would have
thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was hoping to fly standby to Colorado on Wednesday
evening. He assumes there will be a squadron of cameras in
Littleton to film Columbine High School students going back to
school Monday, and he hopes to get himself in front of some of them
to hawk his product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon my return, I plan to contact the administrative officials
at Heritage High School,'' Smith said. If he finds takers, he said
he'll use profits to provide scholarships for students at Columbine
and Heritage high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Borland, a Rockdale County school board member and chairman
of the safe school committee, doesn't see the need to see inside
lockers. In the Columbine shootings, the young gunmen stormed the
school with guns blazing. In the Heritage case, the shooter pulled
a gun from under his pants leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding,'' he said. ``We're not convinced
that see-through book bags and metal detectors are justified. Now
we're coming up with see-through lockers?''
</P>
<P>
   He said school officials should check lockers more frequently
but that a student bent on malice won't be deterred by a locker
with a window in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't stretch my imagination far enough to see how this
would prevent or even minimize potential problems,'' Borland said.
</P>
<P>
   School boards in Coweta and Newton counties have voted to
require see-through bags, while schools in DeKalb and Clayton
counties have established their own rules or suggested guidelines.
In Fayette County, students can bring their book bags to school but
must take them directly to their lockers, taking them out at the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to the clear and mesh book bags has been very
positive, both by the students and the parents,'' said Jennifer
Caraccillo, spokeswoman for the Newton County school district. ``As
far as the clear lockers, that's maybe a possibility for the future
but we haven't discussed it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The prototype cost Smith roughly $150. He bought a locker from a
manufacturer for $130 and cut out the front of the door with a
jigsaw. The plactic glass window, riveted in place, cost about $12.
The mirror in the back was about $5 and other materials were less
than $5.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't sure what it would cost schools to install the product,
but he figures it would be far less, since they already have
lockers in place and could buy other materials in large volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is going to be what makes it doable or not,'' said
Smith Pass, chairwoman of the school climate committee of the
Governor's Education Reform Study Commission. She is also a Coweta
County school board member and chairwoman of the board's safety
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Coweta will require clear or mesh book bags by second semester
of the coming school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just as soon get rid of lockers altogether,'' said Pass,
who said the board has talked about buying sets of books just for
the classroom to eliminate the need for lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a bad idea,'' she said of the see-through lockers.
``It's worth looking into _ literally.''

 &HT;    `Front porch' welcome in North Carolina
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACK MOUNTAIN, N.C. _ Cradled in the craggy ridges of Western
North Carolina, this easygoing mountain town _ whose apt symbol is
a rocking chair _ is like a lullaby. Make that lullabuy.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, it seems, everybody who comes here goes
shopping. Oh, there's plenty else to do: hiking nearby mountain
trails, relaxing at Lake Tomahawk, chowing down at one of the
town's many restaurants, sipping a brew and listening to music at
the Black Mountain Music Hall or the Town Pump Tavern, watching the
world go by with a cup of joe in hand at Mountain Java.
</P>
<P>
   But _ trust me _ you'll eventually give in to the urge to check
out the goods.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sultry Friday afternoon, folks shuffled in and out
of the blessed air-conditioned comfort of the 50-plus galleries and
shops that line the compact downtown. Many were in this community
they call ``the front porch of North Carolina'' to pick up kids
from the dozens of summer camps in the area.
</P>
<P>
   One such visitor was Celinda Evitt of Tampa, who had come to
pick up her 14-year-old son from Camp Rockmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some extensive window shopping last night and made my
list,'' she said, as she paid for a pair of blue glass earrings at
the Catawba Sunrise Gallery on West State Street. ``It's not enough
for someone like me to just come here and hike. I like to shop. I'm
so relieved to find there are still lovely little areas in North
Carolina. This is such a friendly place.''
</P>
<P>
   That welcoming spirit permeates the shopping experience, as most
of the business owners are on hand to assist customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all try to have things that aren't anywhere else,'' said
Rita Vermillion, whose eclectic Catawba Sunrise Gallery carries
fine crafts, including blown glass, porcelain, kaleidoscopes,
handmade jewelry, hand-painted silk scarves and paintings. She says
members of the local merchant's association, Black Mountain
Business to Business, make an effort not to duplicate each other's
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Some galleries _ such as Catawba Sunrise, Seven Sisters, Cherry
Street and the Emporium _ represent a variety of artists and
craftspeople, most of whom live and work in the region. (Seven
Sisters alone represents more than 350 artists.)
</P>
<P>
   Others are artist-owned, and in some cases artists ply their
trades in on-site studios. You're likely to meet them _ or at least
a relative:
</P>
<P>
   -- Garrou Pottery is run by Becky Garrou and features stoneware
by her husband, John, who's been making pottery for three decades,
and son Derrick, who took up the craft full time four years ago.
Ask Becky to show you the Oogles, lucky little people _ and take
one home for a buck.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another father-son operation, Black Mountain Gallery, offers
hand-turned wood bowls and vessels by the Hollifields, Marshall and
his son Eddie. Their latest effort: to make the world's largest
turned bowl (9 feet in diameter) from a local tree. Their studio is
adjacent to the showroom. Look for the piles of wood outside.
</P>
<P>
   -- Black Mountain Iron Works is owned by the husband-wife team
of Dan Howachyn and Tekla. The showroom is packed with hand-wrought
black iron treasures, including functional ceiling-hung pot
holders, wine racks and candleholders as well as sculptures that
are simply decorative. And you may catch them in their open studio.
On a recent afternoon, Tekla was working on a steel sculpture of
three stylish women on a shopping spree _ a commission for the city
of Asheville's Urban Art Trail.
</P>
<P>
   -- At The Potter's Wheel you can check out the handmade pottery
and stoneware by resident potters Andrew Stephenson and Jennifer
Vega, and if you want to try throwing a pot yourself, you can give
it a whirl for $5.
</P>
<P>
   -- Song of the Wood sells handsome hammered dulcimers and bowed
psalteries crafted by James Read Smith, who has been crafting the
stringed instruments since he was a student at nearby Warren Wilson
College in Swannanoa. Although Smith's studio is no longer on site,
his staff can show off his finely crafted musical instruments and
even play a tune or two. And you can take home Smith's original
recordings on CD or cassette.
</P>
<P>
   -- Visions of Creation Gallery features showy one-of-a-kind
pieces of gold jewelry set with semi-precious stones. It's worth a
visit not only to watch Colombian designer/sculptor Robert
Vengoechea at work but to gaze at his handiwork through glass
shadowboxes built into the walls.
</P>
<P>
   -- New Century Metalsmiths, tucked in the storefront of Mountain
Valley Family Clothing, is where you'll find Dennis Curtis at work.
Among his designs is a charm that depicts twin peaks in the
surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   One could easily spend a day or more wandering through downtown
Black Mountain. There's so much to take in: We found cubbies filled
with colorful yarn at the Naked Sheep, bags of ``happy rocks'' at
Brandon's, musical kaleidoscopes at McCosh's, colorful polymer clay
jewelry at Catawba Sunrise Gallery, individual pottery applebakers
at Garrou pottery and prints of Ann Vasilik's watercolor painting
of Black Mountain at the Gingko Tree Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   You could browse for hours at Town Hardware and General Store
with its shelves of old-time (and newfangled) toys; old-fashioned
soaps, salves and remedies; rabbits' feet; little red wagons; scrub
boards, rug beaters; oil lamps; and the usual array of tools.
</P>
<P>
   If you've shopped till you're ready to drop _ and are inspired
to do a little dabbling _ stop by ``Goodness Glazes Alive!'' behind
Mountain Java to paint a plate or pitcher. On Friday nights from 6
to 10, you can ``Paint Till You Faint'' for $8 plus the cost of the
greenware you select. Bring in pizza and CDs, and make it a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide a fun thing for the kids to do while mom and dad go
shopping,'' said manager Casey Phillips. ``And when they see how
much fun the kids have, they come back the next day to try it
themselves.''

   Though their demise is predicted, books will stick around
</P>
<P>
   By JAY MILNER
</P>
<P>
   Contributing writer
</P>
<P>
   We take books for granted these days. That is to say, many of us
do, while many of us still ignore them, leave them lying on the
shelves at the supermarket and in the libraries and bookstores
around town.
</P>
<P>
   In point of fact every now and then someone predicts the demise
of books, as we know them. When radio first captured the attention
of the masses, there were those who said books were on the way out,
that people would now get their entertainment through their ears
and imagination. No need to bother to read when you could simply
sit there with your eyes closed and hear all those good stories.
</P>
<P>
   And if you had to see the stories unfolding you could go to the
talking picture shows, which had come along too and caused some
people to put books on the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   But lo and behold, books sold more than ever. Seems radio and
talking pictures just whetted people's appetites for the details
books could supply our imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came television, which may or may not be another
story. All the data isn't in yet. But books are still selling
better than ever, with some twists of the sales approaches and
publishers' capitalistic learnings overwhelming their intellectual
persuasions, and books remain the major source of knowledge,
especially where pertinent details are concerned, despite TV's
proven capacity for numbing the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Before the invention of moveable type, ordinary people in the
so-called civilized world were so isolated they were enslaved by
ideas handed down by previous generations, dominated by those
already holding all the cards and the property, official titles and
other big sticks with which to dominate the masses.
</P>
<P>
   There was, if you remember your history, this prevailing theory
called the Divine Right of Kings, ridiculous privileges that
trickled down to all the king's kith and kin and their kith and kin
regardless of their worth. Even mentally challenged kith and kin
inherited the power to tax ordinary folks and live high off the
sweat of their brows.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary red-blooded folks who might have suspected that this
was an unreasonable system more or less kept their revolutionary
thoughts to themselves, fearing they were the only one thinking
such thoughts. Then along came the invention of printing and things
were never the same again. People were able to put their thoughts
and ideas in easily circulated form, pamphlets, etc., and spread
them across the land so others would know they weren't alone with
their crazy notions that maybe there were certain inherent rights
of individuals regardless of their parentage.
</P>
<P>
   The top dogs fought this by making laws against learning to
read, a prohibition women had to contend with much longer than men.
Gradually, however, a new era of freedom opened for the so-called
``common man''. Again it took a while longer for women to enjoy
this new freedom, if indeed they do today.
</P>
<P>
   The printed word is still the primary means of spreading serious
ideas. Radio and TV tend to solidify old ideas and goofy new ones,
rather than stimulate the growth of worthy new ones. Messages and
news transmitted by TV and radio are too fleeting to lodge securely
on brows the way printed words, books in other words, are able to
do.
</P>
<P>
   So, don't worry, book lovers, hard cover and paperback books
remain a major source of information and entertainment, for now and
the immediate future, at least.
</P>
<P>
   So, don't throw your books away just yet. You'd do better to
toss your TV out the window and renew your library card.
</P>

 &HT;    Golden Graham: From Rollergirl to cover girl, `Bowfinger' star's
moment has arrived
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heather Graham is Hollywood's reigning ``It'' girl.
</P>
<P>
   Having skated to fame two years ago as ``Boogie Nights'' '
Rollergirl, she is suddenly everywhere _ adorning several magazine
covers in recent months and scoring high-profile roles in two of
the summer's biggest comedies. Graham appeared opposite Mike Myers
in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and co-stars with
Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy in ``Bowfinger,'' which opens today.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``Bowfinger'' character, Daisy, is an aspiring film actress
fresh off the bus from Ohio who strategically sleeps her way to the
top. Graham, on the other hand, has taken a slower and more
straightlaced path to stardom, befitting her strict Catholic
upbringing as the Milwaukee, Wis.-born daughter of an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she hasn't met a few actresses like Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this one girl and every time she read for a part ...
she would ask the director, `Can I read it with you?''' Graham
said. ``And if there was a kissing scene she would kiss the guy,
and totally like tongue (him) _ and I think she got a few jobs off
of it, too. But nothing very good,'' she added, with a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   As for her comedic co-stars, Graham said Myers bounces off the
walls, but he is thoughtful, highly organized and has a serious
side. ``He's not just completely crazy. I think Steve Martin and
Eddie Murphy, they're more like the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger,'' a sophisticated comedy about a desperate
filmmaker who shoots a movie around a paranoid Hollywood action
star without the star's knowledge, was the easier of the two films,
according to Graham. ``Bowfinger'' director Frank Oz stuck close to
Martin's script, whereas ``Austin Powers'' was largely improvised.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me that was easier than `Austin Powers,' because Mike
would go on long tangents of really funny stuff,'' she said at the
Regency Hotel in Los Angeles. ``It was fun, but this was more
sticking to the material.''
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old actress, who attended high school in Southern
California, made her film debut in 1988 as the object of Corey
Haim's affection in ``License to Drive.'' Supporting roles in Gus
Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy'' and David Lynch's ``Twin Peaks''
followed, along with several flops, including Lynch's big-screen
``Twin Peaks'' prequel and the period musical ``Shout.'' The latter
starred a pre-comeback John Travolta and was Gwyneth Paltrow's
first film.
</P>
<P>
   Graham rebounded with small roles in independent hits such as
``Six Degrees of Separation'' and ``Mrs. Parker and the Vicious
Circle,'' but it wasn't until she was cast as Jon Favreau's dream
girl in 1996's ``Swingers'' that she became a hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely there was a change after `Boogie Nights,' because I
kind of went from really having to fight to get any job to getting
more respect,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's profile has since hit groovy heights with her portrayal
of sexy spy Felicity Shagwell in the ``Austin Powers'' sequel, one
of the year's biggest hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more offers, and I think maybe studios and
producers are more willing to think of hiring me because it made a
lot of money,'' she said of the film, which has grossed almost $200
million. ``And also, little kids recognize me, which is really
funny because I never really had that. I don't think a lot of kids
saw `Boogie Nights.'''
</P>
<P>
   She wore a light pink dress to the interview, with her blond
hair falling across her shoulders, and punctuated her remarks with
an ebullient laugh. But the actress stripped down to all but her
skates in ``Boogie Nights,'' a paean to the 1970s porn industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heather's doing great,'' said ``Bowfinger'' co-star Christine
Baranski. ``With her looks and her talents, why not go for it? This
is a woman who just glows. She's just so beautiful, and she's
getting the opportunities. She's very real t

   EDITORIAL-CARTERS _ Not to minimize the accomplishments of the
other eight recipients of the 1999 Presidential Medals of freedom,
but it was fitting that Presdient Clinton just happened to make a
separate presentation to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. The couple from
Plaisn truly do deserve being singled out. (Geshwiler, Atlanta

   EDITORIAL-GUNS _ So how easy is it to buy a gun? (Atlanta
Constitution). 17.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Television digs emotion. So the enduring
image of the shootings at a suburban Los Angeles Jewish center will
be that of little kids holding hands, fleeing the gunman who wanted
to shoot them down like dogs. It is an image for our strange,
dislocated times. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED WEDNESDAY.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ PRAGUE _ Forget American in Paris. Think
American in Prague. Or, as in the case of Paula Salguero, a
naturalized American in Prague. Ms. Salguero was born in Costa Rica
and grew up in the U.S. One night in Prague she came across the
only other Spanish-speaking person in the city _ a stroke of luck.
(Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED WEDNESDAY. WITH PHOTO.

   EMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ My friend, who must have way

   TRAVEL-HIKING _ GORHAM, N.H. _ In 20 yearts of backpacking I
have never hiked a more difficult section of footpath than the
Appalachian Trail across the Mahoosuc Range. For six days I toiled
solo across this hellish landscape. Boulders were so large that my
arms ached as much as my legs from crawling up these and other
obstacles. I walked over stony summits so windy that my face
burned. And there was a lonliness that often engulfed me as I
challenged this wilderness. But when I looked around, my lonliness
always faded like the mountain fog giving way to a sun-splashed
morning. In the glory of a New England fall, there may be no place
more spectacular. (Harmon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH COLOR

   TRAVEL-SMITHGALL _ HELEN, Ga. _ Welcome to Smithgall Woods-Dukes
Creek Conservation Area. Until 1994, the two-story lodge and 5,550
acres of Blue Ridge Mountian woodlands, creeks and wetlands were
the private domain of Gainesville, Ga., newspaper publisher Charles
Smithgall. The state paid $10.8 million for this treasure appraised
at $21.6 million, and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources
was given stewarship. But any resemblance to no-frills state park
cottages ends when you cross a covered bridge over the creek and
walk through the front doors of the majestic Smithgall Cottage. (

   STYLE-SCHOOL _ Designers are pushing utility clothing for

of stretch pants and skirts to choose from when they're not wearing

for shrugs, sweater sets and tops that are tiny and tight. And the
guys are trading in their oversize jeans for ones that are a little
more structured to pair with preppy looking sweaters and tops.

   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Everyone's read Sherlock Holmes, of course, but

another billboard-size gap in my learning. Summers _ especially
summers like this one, punctuated with evidence anew each week of a
society pathologically enamored of its guns _ are for busman's

Conan Doyle. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   BOOK-NOTES _ When an Atlanta reader picked up a new book by
Lawrence Sanders, she was a little surprised. After all, Sanders
died last year. It was not until she checked the fine print on the
copyright page did she discover the book was written by Vincent
Lardo. Needless to say, the reader and other Sanders fans are a
little miffed about the misleading publicity. . . . Catherine
Coulter has written 30 New York Times bestsellers, but still she
gets no respect. She will be in Atlanta next week to sign her
latest, ``The Edge.'' (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

books remain a major source of information and entertainment, for

library card. (Milner, Cox News Service) MOVED

   COXNET BOOKS 0810 -- New York was the town Willie Morris both
loved and hated, the city where he had made a name as a young man
and the city that quickly forgot him once he was shown the door at
Harper's magazine. Only when he turned south, toward home, did he
find true happiness. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art

American-Statesman) Art includes two 6-pica color photos of book

<P>
   WITH: MAN TROUBLE -- I used to think that only old people should
write memoirs. But Spike Gillespie's memoir, ``All the Wrong Men

engaging story; but it's not very clear why it's so interesting.

who's read him lately. Truth be told, I'd never read him at all,
another billboard-size gap in my learning. Summers _ especially
summers like this one, punctuated with evidence anew each week of a
society pathologically enamored of its guns _ are for busman's

   BOOK-NOTES _ When an Atlanta reader picked up a new book by
Lawrence Sanders, she was a little surprised. After all, Sanders
died last year. It was not until she checked the fine print on the
copyright page did she discover the book was written by Vincent
Lardo. Needless to say, the reader and other Sanders fans are a
little miffed about the misleading publicity. . . . Catherine
Coulter has written 30 New York Times bestsellers, but still she
gets no respect. She will be in Atlanta next week to sign her

   COXNET BOOKS 0810 -- New York was the town Willie Morris both
loved and hated, the city where he had made a name as a young man
and the city that quickly forgot him once he was shown the door at
Harper's magazine. Only when he turned south, toward home, did he
find true happiness. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art

   WITH: MAN TROUBLE -- I used to think that only old people should
write memoirs. But Spike Gillespie's memoir, ``All the Wrong Men

engaging story; but it's not very clear why it's so interesting.

   EDITORIAL-CARTERS _ Not to minimize the accomplishments of the
other eight recipients of the 1999 Presidential Medals of freedom,

 &HT;    BULLS AND BEARS HEADING FOR A Y2K SHOWDOWN
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the days growing fewer in 1999, investors soon
will have to place their bets on Y2K, the software bug that some
believe will cause massive computer disruptions Jan. 1. Will they
put their money in the mattress or the market?
</P>
<P>
   If Y2K pessimists are right, the economy soon will falter as
fear begins to roil financial markets in advance of worldwide
computer breakdowns. If the optimists are on target, stock prices
will shoot up shortly because U.S. corporations have not only
defeated the Y2K problem, but also have upgraded their computers to
become more productive in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   As we head into the final months of 1999, is it safer to bet on
a Y2K boom or bust?
</P>
<P>
   So far, the message from Wall Street has been mixed. On the one
hand, the stock market continues to show bubbly optimism, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average pushing to near-record highs. The
surging prices suggest investors believe U.S. companies will breeze
through the Year 2000 conversion and come out even stronger in the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   But while stock investors are showing thumbs up, the bond market
has been signaling serious concern about Y2K. What do bond traders
know that stock investors don't?
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting signals reflect how confused people still are
about the potential impact of the ``Y2K bug,'' a software glitch in
computers programmed to read only the last two digits of a date.
When the year rolls over to 2000, these computers will misread the
date as 1900, causing massive malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees the date confusion has the potential to shut
down many computerized systems. But because companies and
government agencies have spent so much time and money fixing the
problem, a good case can be made that Y2K will cause only minor
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   But many corporate treasurers apparently don't see that rosy
scenario. This summer, a huge number of companies have rushed to
issue new bonds. Analysts say the bond glut can be explained in
part by the desire to get borrowing done in July and August because
of fears of Y2K-related problems later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks and bonds providing such different signals about the
impact of computer problems in coming months, are there other
indicators that could help point the way on Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   Gold could be considered a measuring stick. Y2K pessimists have
long been telling people to buy gold to use for barter when chaos
hits in January. But gold prices have been severely depressed this
year, suggesting few people are hoarding the metal.
</P>
<P>
   No banks have reported ``runs'' on cash deposits, and store
shelves are weighted down with foodstuffs, batteries and blankets.
If anyone is hoarding supplies for Y2K, it isn't showing up at
Sam's Club. A July poll conducted by the Associated Press found
that only about one American in 10 believes the software problem
will lead to major disruptions after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream economists continue to be optimistic about Y2K,
predicting only minor problems. But last week, one well-respected
forecaster, Edward Yardeni, chief economist at the investment bank
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York, renewed his prediction that
the Y2K bug has a 70 percent chance of triggering a serious global
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni said computer failures could interrupt the flow of oil,
food and other commodities in the global marketplace. The possible
breakdown of the ``global just-in-time manufacturing system'' could
shut down U.S. factories he said in his updated forecast. ``I am
truly amazed by the complacency about Y2K,'' he on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five months remaining in 1999, Yardeni doesn't
have much longer to wait to find out if he will be remembered as
the smartest man on Wall Street or the guy who missed the last
great run-up of the century's strongest bull market.

 &HT;    BARAK'S MILITARY STYLE UNDER FIRE IN OFFICE
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 15 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ During his campaign, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak touted his reputation as Israel's ``Number 1 soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some Israelis are chafing at the military outlook of their
new commando-in-chief. To their surprise, Barak has kept the peace
process on hold and sidelined the country's most famous doves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, won in a landslide in the May elections. Israel's
most decorated soldier, he promised to bring unity to the divided
country and to restart the peace process with the Arabs, which
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu left in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks into the job, his standing with average Israelis is
still intact. But, he has alienated some within his own Labor Party
with the tight lid he keeps on his policies and the clique of
former army colleagues around which he centralizes power.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, he has brought new faces and a new _ possibly
risky _ approach to the six-year-old Oslo peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the picture now is Barak's Labor Party rival Shimon
Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Barak gave him an ill-defined
new ministry post. According to newspaper reports, Peres needs
office space and is ``taciturn'' at meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Peres is an idealistic peacemaker and party politician. He wrote
a book about the ``New Middle East,'' where Arabs and Jews would
learn to trust each other and work together.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is a military man and systems engineer. He talks little
about trust, but rather ``separation.'' He is skeptical of the
Peres approach, spelled out in the 1993 Oslo Accords, of exchanging
concessions with the Arabs in step-by-step confidence building
moves.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of most in the region, Barak did not immediately
resume land transfers to the Palestinians. Instead, he has sought
to restructure the next phase, the Wye River Memorandum that Israel
signed in October.
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill many Palestinians offered Barak upon his taking
office has now deteriorated and small-scale terror attacks are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Before continuing the land transfers, Barak wants a better
picture of what concessions Israel may have to make later in the
process. That demand shows the difference between the military
approach of Barak and the diplomatic approach of Oslo's creators
like Peres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel put down a down payment without knowing the final
price,'' said political scientist Shmuel(CQ) Sandler, at Tel Aviv's
Bar-Ilan University. ``Military people like to see the real price.
They like substance. Politicians are more liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who back the new prime minister say he reflects the
pragmatic approach of his mentor, slain prime minister, and fellow
general, Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Others say he differs from Rabin by defying Israel's old
political order.
</P>
<P>
   The debate crystallized two weeks ago when Barak snubbed a
leader of Israel's old political elite.
</P>
<P>
   He passed over Yael Dayan, an accomplished member of parliament
in Barak's Labor Party and the daughter of legendary general Moshe
Dayan, for one of his last minister posts. He gave the job to
another woman further down on the Labor Party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Dayan confronted Barak on the floor of the parliament and
accused him of arrogance. Referring to a famous commando raid, in
which Barak was photographed poised on the wing of a hijacked
airliner, she told him he was metaphorically still on that wing,
looking down on his party colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dayan remains hopeful that Barak's methods will not damper
public opinion about how he delivers in the job, especially in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our favorite democratic sort of behavior, but I would
be careful in defining it as something that will bring opposition
to the results. His results will be judged on their own,'' she said
in an interview with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been tougher in their criticism, often keying on his
commando background.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't listen, bears grudges and, perhaps most important
of all, we learned that there is no one who can stop this
general,'' wrote political columnist Chemi Shelev in the Israeli
daily Ma'ariv.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Nahum Barnea, in the daily Yedioth Aharanot, said
Barak fails to understand that, in politics, ``There is no squad
commander to map out the goal . . . no repeated shooting practices,
no training. You learn as you go.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that Barak will need the help of those he is now
alienating.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Peres, Barak moved aside Yossi Beilin, an Oslo
architect and a Peres prodigy. Beilin failed to get the foreign
minister post he coveted. Instead, he was made justice minister, a
job with little influence over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Another dove and Labor Party stalwart, Avraham Burg, got no
ministry post. Against Barak's wishes, he then set out on his own
and won the job as parliamentary speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barak has given key jobs to those with military and
intelligence backgrounds like his. Danny Yatom, who ran Israel's
spy agency, the Mossad, is chief of staff in the prime minister's
office. Zvi Stauber, who worked in military intelligence under
Barak, is the key foreign policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel's second highest-ranking job, defense minister, Barak
chose to do it himself. He holds that job with the prime minister's
post, as did Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Eiran, who was a senior aide to Rabin and a regional
campaign chairman for Barak, sees other resemblances between the
two men. Like Rabin, Barak eschews party formalities and cares
little about public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his life, he was a military man. Very practical. He
doesn't like the traditional political nonsense and debating
everything so openly,'' Eiran said. ``He doesn't want to waste time
on nonsense.''

 &HT;    LABASTIDA: PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANT RESISTS IMAGE AS MEXICO'S
HEIR-APPARENT
 &HT;    1000&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico _ By all counts, Francisco Labastida
should breeze into his party's nomination for Mexico's next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   He describes exquisitely detailed plans for fighting poverty and
managing the economy. A veteran administrator, he's already thrice
been a cabinet minister and is widely perceived as his party
elite's favorite son. He also counts on loyalists who vow to
deliver thousands of votes.
</P>
<P>
   But what Labastida needs most, perhaps, is someone like James
Carville, the acid-tongued American campaign consultant who put
Bill Clinton in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great reputation and prestige. I wish we could get
him,'' said Labastida, who, despite his powerful connections, has
slipped behind in some polls with less than three months to go
before Mexico's historic Nov. 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is the first for this country's Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI, the dominant political entity here.
After only two weeks of campaigning, the election is already one of
the most unusual Mexican political events in years. It's considered
a dress rehearsal for an even more competitive presidential
election in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 70 years, Labastida's party _ the PRI _ has
controlled Mexico's presidency. But the party has never held a
primary to democratically elect its nominee. The sitting president
has always hand-picked his successor in a ritual known as the
``dedazo, or ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, in response to demands for democracy within the
party, candidates have to win voters by aggressively campaigning on
the road, and in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico keeps no party registration lists, so any citizen with a
voter credential will be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is assured of triumph,'' said the soft-spoken and
sleekly gray Labastida, interviewed as his campaign bus rolled last
weekend through the humid streets of this city, the capital of
Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the campaign, many Mexicans found
Labastida's claim disingenuous. In a country where rumors of
conspiracy run deep, many felt that Labastida, 56, was the
guaranteed victor because he was a member of President Ernesto
Zedillo's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   In his own mild way, Labastida bristles at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't have an official candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An economics graduate of Mexico's National Autonomous
University, Labastida has worked in government jobs since 1968. He
was secretary of energy and state-run industries before becoming
governor of Sinaloa state from 1987 to 1993. He most recently was
Zedillo's agricultural minister and then interior secretary, a job
that put him in charge of fighting crime and smoothing political
unrest in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned two months ago to pursue the nomination. His
recently named campaign manager is Esteban Moctezuma, also resigned
from Zedillo's cabinet to direct Labastida's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these ties, Labastida has jokingly been called ``son
of the big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was taken by surprise by the first barrage of
television ads from his chief rival, Roberto Madrazo, that
exploited that perception.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's ads called on Mexicans to end the ``dedazo'' by giving
it a ``madrazo'' _ a ``punch'' in Mexican slang.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, who stepped down as governor of Tabasco state to run
for the nomination, is appealing to ``PRIistas'' who yearn for more
nationalistic, populist policies rather than Zedillo's free-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The audacious ads stunned Labastida's campaign, which denounced
them as unethical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that the country doesn't want a climate of
violence or attacks,'' Labastida said, remarking on Madrazo's
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But some polls show Madrazo's two-fisted style is yielding
results. In a poll conducted by the Mexico-based Indemerc-Lou
Harris group, PRI sympathizers preferred Madrazo over Labastida by
7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida claims other surveys show he's in first place, but he
admitted he needs to counterattack to fend off Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confront a reality,'' he told Cox Newspapers.
``People know the face of Labastida as a public functionary and
don't know what he has accomplished during his career. And now I
have to make that happen . . . I think my main defense is to speak
the truth and speak with facts about what we've done and what we
could do to achieve change in our country without tearing it
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   During his tour of Chiapas he tried to strike a balance,
admitting the Mexican government had failed to do enough for one of
the country's poorest and most socially polarized states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chiapas' poverty is a wound that hurts me as a human being,
and challenges me as a presidential aspirant,'' he said. But the
answer, he said, is not ``force,'' a reference to the government's
five-year-old conflict with Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are circulating that Labastida may approach the
politically savvy Carville for advice on sharpening his campaign,
although Labastida's managers say they haven't taken such a step
yet. Carville, who has worked on foreign campaigns before, is known
for his ability to distill candidates into strong messages for the
media.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Labastida's television ads are mostly testimonials from
people in Sinaloa praising his abilities as governor. On the
campaign trail, Labastida prefers to stick to speeches on education
and the economy rather than personally questioning his opponents'
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   And because he was a key member of Zedillo's administration, it
would be awkward for Labastida to tap into anti-free market
sentiment as deeply as Madrazo has dared.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Sergio Aguayo said Labastida is handicapped by
his unwillingness or inability to sell himself, a new concept in
politics here, and by the shock of having to wrestle with his PRI
brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very conventional,'' Aguayo said. ``He doesn't really
convince people. Maybe talking to them in person he can, but not in
groups . . . He is Mexico's Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Chiapas, however, Labastida showed that he attracts his share
of the party faithful, who sent scores of leaders to greet the
candidate from PRI-affiliated organizations, Indian villages and
unions representing workers as diverse as shoeshine boys and
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to go with Labastida. We have a policy within
our organization that everyone will comply with our decision. It's
all or nothing,'' said Luis Rey Garcia, secretary general of the
PRI-affiliated Revolutionary Federation of Workers of Chiapas,
which boasts more than 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   PRI unions and neighborhood groups have for decades provided
solid backing for the party's candidates, dispatching voters in
bloc in exchange for government largess.
</P>
<P>
   The groups' collective strength has waned, but Labastida and his
rivals will still compete for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be like this in every state,'' Labastida
said, almost embarrassed by the reception he received from PRI
groups in Chiapas. ``It's like this here because I began to visit
the state in 1971, making plans for development, supervising
projects for potable water, education and health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is going through a profound transformation,'' he
added. ``And we will have to compete vote for vote. There are no
certain results.''

 &HT;    PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF DEMOCRACY? RUSSIA'S CAMPAIGN SEASON A BAD
OMEN FOR DOMESTIC REFORMS, U.S. RELATIONS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The end of the world is near, warned some superstitious
Russians, who trusting in the country's mystical folklore saw a bad
omen in the final solar eclipse of this millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Russia survived the cosmic phenomenon; it is coping, too, with
last week's(CQ) Kremlin phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, and his inner circle of political
operatives and business tycoons produced yet another shock by
naming ex-spy Vladimir Putin as Russia's fifth prime minister in
the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former domestic security chief, also was handpicked as
the 68-year-old Yeltsin's successor in next year's presidential
elections, signaling a new phase in Russia's post-Soviet evolution
_ the open fight to succeed its only democratically elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   At work in Russia isn't some strange alignment of the stars, but
gritty, down-to-earth politics that has slowed progress on key
issues with the United States _ namely arms control and reviving
the Russian economy. The campaign season has begun, with national
parliamentary elections scheduled for December and the vote for
president to take place next summer when Yeltsin's term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Political foes called the president nuts for his latest
government overhaul. It was a record, even for Yeltsin. He fired
the previous prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, after less than
three months on the job and replaced him with a virtual unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to remain in the game as Yeltsin enters his last year
as president, the Kremlin settled on Putin, 46, the loyal head of
the country's domestic intelligence agency. For the first time,
Yeltsin expressly designated the man he wants to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt move came a week after Yeltsin rival Yuri Luzhkov,
62, the ambitious Moscow mayor and presidential aspirant, cut a
deal with Russia's regional leaders to create a new and powerful
political coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And just about every political party in Russia is attempting to
convince Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime minister and foreign
minister, to enter the fray on their team as either a parliamentary
or presidential candidate. He rose in public opinion polls last
year after declaring he had absolutely no interest in running the
country, only to be fired by Yeltsin in May.
</P>
<P>
   Never in its history has Russia had a peaceful transition of
power from one democratically elected leader to another. The
elections will be a crucial test of how firmly the country has
embraced democracy since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, the signs are not good.
</P>
<P>
   As in its communist past, Russia's political leadership is being
determined by a power elite and behind closed doors. There is no
history of a party system to groom candidates and promote them
before the public eye. The press is only nominally free, controlled
by big businessmen with their own political alliances and ready to
use their publications and television stations as propaganda tools
_ a factor that helped Yeltsin win re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing Putin as his heir on national television, Yeltsin
stressed the need for free and fair elections, but made clear his
desire to anoint the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, despite the uproar over yet another prime minister
appointment from Yeltsin, Putin is expected to easily win
confirmation from the opposition-led Duma, the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has adhered to the guidelines of the constitution in his
unpredictable switch and parliament does not want to go to war over
the Putin nomination with their own elections looming in just four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the position of prime minister has become irrelevant.
``It's simply doesn't matter anymore who is the premier of Russia.
From now on, it is all election politics,'' said Andrei
Piontkovsky, a political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   That fact does not bode well for the recovery of Russia's
economy, in crisis since the ruble crashed a year ago, nor for its
short-term relations with the United States on issues like arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russian talks will begin this month on the next steps in
reducing their substantial nuclear arsenals _ being called START
III. But the Duma has yet to ratify the 1993 Start II treaty, and
with domestic politics dominating this fall's agenda, chances of
its passage appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has staked its Russian relations on Yeltsin,
and stood by him throughout the erratic times. As a result, the
U.S.-Russia agenda has been modest lately, as the Clinton
administration, and the rest of the world, adjusts to the parade of
prime ministers since March 1998: Viktor Chernomyrdin replaced by
Sergei Kiriyenko, replaced by Primakov, replaced by Stepashin and
now by Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin's team is concerned only with self preservation and
self interest,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Moscow
Center, a think tank. ``Unfortunately they don't have a vision for
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fairness, it is not clear any of his would-be successors
does, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing exists resembling a substantive debate on the issues of
how to fix Russia's deep problems. The pack of potential candidates
is busy scrambling for political alliances and benefactors among
the business-media tycoons. Democracy, communism, socialism hardly
matter much any more to the majority of disaffected Russians,
according to opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a nation in search of a leader, someone who can bring
stability in a country buffeted by sweeping changes, some for the
better and many of them for the worse. While Russians enjoy their
personal freedoms under the fledgling democracy, most have seen
their standard of living drop in the painful transition to a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The lethargy of the country's political leaders and wild
profiteering by their business allies have created a deep apathy
among Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party remains strong among the old party faithful,
but its leader Gennady Zyuganov, defeated by Yeltsin in 1996, is
not given much a chance to succeed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Once the crusading reformer, Yeltsin's popularity ratings are in
the single digits. He is seen as a man who for the past two years
has spent more time in hospitals and seclusion than on the job; a
president who rested and allowed his friends and family to get rich
while most of Russia's 146 million people sunk deeper into debt and
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe Yeltsin already has done irreparable damage to
Russia's attempts at democracy, and his own place in history _
something that Putin and no one else can redeem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When dinosaurs writhe in their death throes they destroy
everything around them,'' the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said in a
commentary on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Russia's political factions are seeking to fill the void _
to create new political alliances like Luzhkov's, to promote a
blank slate like Putin or to turn to the 70-year-old Primakov, a
career policymaker who really doesn't seem to crave the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other political force, if we think about it,''
said Mintimer Shaimiyev, president of the semi-autonomous Tatarstan
region and leader of the All-Russia party, which merged with
Luzhkov's Fatherland movement. ``Somebody has to assume the
responsibility now.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of Russia isn't near, just the next chapter.

   Thus, Russia's political factions are seeking to fill the void _
to create new political alliances like Luzhkov's, to promote a
blank slate like Putin or to turn to the 70-year-old Primakov, a
career policymaker who really doesn't seem to crave the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other political force, if we think about it,''
said Mintimer Shaimiyev, president of the semi-autonomous Tatarstan
region and leader of the All-Russia party, which merged with
Luzhkov's Fatherland movement. ``Somebody has to assume the
responsibility now.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of Russia isn't near, just the next chapter.

   OPERA-GLIMMERGLASS-KANSAS (Cooperstown, N.Y.) _ George Brett and
the rest of the Baseball Hall of Fame hoo-ha had left town by the
time I arrived here the weekend of July 30. (The previous weekend,
between the baseball extravaganza and the Woodstock rehash up the
road in Rome, there wasn't a hotel room to be had for something
like 20 counties in central New York.)
</P>
<P>
   But Cooperstown's other big draw, Glimmerglass Opera, was doing
its part to make hotel rooms scarce even a week later. The best I
could manage was a decidedly modest Budget Host motel in Sharon
Springs, a good 25 minutes away from downtown Cooperstown. At least
the commute couldn't have been lovelier, Routes 20 and 80 winding
up hills and down dales and finally clutching the steep edges of
Otsego Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Glimmerglass Opera is based a few miles north of town, on a
patch of flat land fronting the lake. It's housed in a cluster of
grayish farmlike buildings, designed by architect Hugh Hardy to
blend with the rural setting. (``Glimmerglass,'' by the way, was
novelist James Fenimore Cooper's name for Otsego Lake in his
Leatherstocking Tales.) By SCOTT CANTRELL. 1,500 words. Story will

IN 1959, A MUSICAL GENRE TRANSCENDED EVERYTHING IT HAD BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Something extraordinary was in the air in 1959 _ something that
pushed jazz beyond the borders of excellence and showmanship and
into the realm of genius.
</P>
<P>
   In an eventful 12-month period 40 years ago, some of the most
innovative and enduring albums in the jazz canon were recorded:
Miles Davis' ``Kind of Blue,'' John Coltrane's ``Giant Steps,''
Ornette Coleman's ``The Shape of Jazz to Come,'' Dave Brubeck's
``Time Out'' and Charles Mingus' ``Mingus Ah Um.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also in 1959 that Coleman, a free-jazz pioneer, jolted
the New York jazz world with his unorthodox sounds during an
engagement at the Five Spot nightclub, the iconoclastic pianist
Thelonious Monk triumphantly led a 10-piece ensemble at the city's
prestigious Town Hall, and swing veteran Duke Ellington composed a
memorable score for the film ``Anatomy of a Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much going on, 1959 may have been the greatest jazz year
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this incredibly fertile soil at that time, and a lot
of very different foliage,'' said producer Orrin Keepnews, who
worked on recordings with such imposing artists as Bill Evans,
Cannonball Adderley, Wes Montgomery and Monk (a recording of the
Town Hall concert being among their projects together).
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent pool that one had to draw on in New York was quite
incredible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the listener's standpoint, jazz signified hipness _ a
sophistication about the world and a rejection of bourgeois values.
As a result, it appealed to young people who considered themselves
too smart for Elvis and too hip for Perry Como.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of the music of the college campus,'' said Steve
Irwin, co-producer of the Kansas City International Jazz Festival.
``Brubeck was hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was a great year. But you could also argue that in
1959 jazz reached its creative peak. Decades of growth and momentum
culminated in timeless gems but ultimately led jazz to its destiny
_ as an art music outside mainstream American musical tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Miles and nonstop 'Trane
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uncertainty of World War II, saxophonist Charlie Parker
and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie had shaken things up with bebop _ a
music of speed, exuberance and frenzied invention that effectively
deposed swing.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its revolutionary luster, bop depended upon
improvisations based on sequences of chord changes, and a
theme-solo-theme approach in performance.
</P>
<P>
   By 1959, some artists _ Davis, Coleman and Coltrane among them _
were becoming weary of bop's conventions and were beginning to
experiment with other means of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Davis picked up on the notion that scales, not chords, might
offer improvisational possibilities. This ``modal'' approach, which
allowed performers more melodic latitude, can be heard to fine
effect on ``Kind of Blue'' (Columbia), a classic and perennial
favorite that has never been out of print.
</P>
<P>
   The album, initially released on Aug. 17, 1959, continues to
sell an average of more than 250,000 to 300,000 copies annually in
the United States alone. The recording is a rarity in that it seems
to hold equal appeal for casual listeners and dedicated fans,
musicians and critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of Blue'' was a serendipitous confluence of artists and
material. Davis could hardly have had a more appropriate setting
for his yearning trumpet or more apt collaborators: tenor
saxophonist Coltrane, altoist Adderley, pianist Evans (replaced on
one track by Wynton Kelly), bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy
Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, the only member of the band still alive, said he had no
idea ``Kind of Blue'' would become a cultural touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in it when it happens, you don't really think that much
about it,'' said the 70-year-old drummer, whose latest album is
``Only for the Pure at Heart'' (Fable). ``But the music was
different, and all those guys were top-of-the-line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I want to tack onto this is, being I'm the only
one alive, it would be nice to receive a check or something.
Especially if they're selling all these records.''
</P>
<P>
   All five of the album's compositions (credited to Davis but
likely also reflecting Evans' input) have become jazz standards.
Particularly impressive are the atmospheric ``All Blues'' and the
sleek ``So What.''
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Kind of Blue'' largely explored a soundscape of
tranquility, Coltrane's ``Giant Steps'' (Rhino//Atlantic) offered
the sort of complex, advanced bebop that the saxophonist was soon
to abandon in his pursuit of modal sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giant Steps'' could be considered the ultimate bop album,
inasmuch as it takes the style as far as it could go. On the title
track, Coltrane mines the improvisational potential of each chord
as thoroughly as possible and for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He speeds through the tune with enormous, nonstop energy,
cramming notes together and virtually drowning out the rhythm
section. The effect has been described as ``sheets of sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The album, which was produced by Nesuhi Ertegun, is ``a turning
point much more in retrospect than it was at the time,'' Keepnews
said. ``It wasn't a shocking or revealing record to people who had
been paying attention to Coltrane.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, who also performed on ``Giant Steps,'' remembers Coltrane
as ``really stretching out.'' During one club date, he recalled,
the saxophonist ``played so long that a lady just jumped up and
screamed, `Somebody stop him!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond bop
</P>
<P>
   At much the same time as Coltrane was exhausting the
possibilities of bop, altoist Coleman was challenging its
assumptions _ which earned him as much enmity as it did admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's albums were greeted with the same skepticism his stint
at the Five Spot engendered. ``The Shape of Jazz to Come''
(Rhino//Atlantic) is generally considered his most artistically
successful recording.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Coleman's like-minded bandmates _ trumpeter Don
Cherry, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins _ ``Shape''
broke with bop orthodoxy while showcasing tunes that were all the
more engaging for their eccentricity. One, ``Lonely Woman,'' has
become a genuine standard.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's gift was his ability to ``improvise on the feeling or
inspiration of a piece, rather than the chord structure,''
according to Haden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy when somebody wrote something good about us,''
said the bassist, whose most recent album is ``The Art of the
Song'' (Verve). ``But when somebody wrote something bad about us,
we couldn't be bothered with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's aesthetic, Haden said, was to always play music as if
playing it for the first time, and if the critics ``didn't get it,
that was their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Kind of Blue,'' ``Giant Steps'' and ``The Shape of
Jazz to Come'' continue to exert a tremendous influence on modern
jazz, they were not the only albums of 1959 to signal a movement
toward the new.
</P>
<P>
   Brubeck's ``Time Out'' (Columbia) has come to be recognized not
only as a commercial breakthrough (its best-known tune being
altoist Paul Desmond's ``Take Five'') but also as a musical
statement of enduring sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Brubeck was hardly the only artist experimenting with offbeat
time signatures. But in his own way, the pianist was expanding the
options available to his peers.
</P>
<P>
   So was Mingus, whose ``Mingus Ah Um'' (Columbia) exemplifies the
bassist//composer's elemental understanding of the African-American
musical tradition. Although he also recorded the albums ``Blues and
Roots'' and ``Mingus Dynasty'' in 1959, neither can quite match
``Ah Um'' (which includes splendid renderings of ``Better Git It in
Your Soul,'' ``Goodbye Pork Pie Hat'' and ``Fables of Faubus'') for
compositional majesty or sheer musical genius.
</P>
<P>
   The year that was
</P>
<P>
   Of course, creativity doesn't happen in a vacuum, as Keepnews
pointed out. In 1959 the whole jazz community was in flux, with
artists exploring a range of musical languages. ``The Cannonball
Adderley Quintet in San Francisco'' was an important album in the
evolution of the commercially successful soul-jazz movement, whose
participants included pianist Horace Silver and organist Jimmy
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   While Ellington scored ``Anatomy,'' pianist John Lewis, of the
Modern Jazz Quartet, wrote music for the noir drama ``Odds Against
Tomorrow'' and performed it with the group. (Two years earlier,
Davis had scored the French noir thriller ``Elevator to the
Gallows.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 guitarist Wes Montgomery recorded his debut album,
saxophonist Sonny Rollins took the first of two sabbaticals, and
Miles Davis was assaulted by police outside a nightclub where his
sextet was playing.
</P>
<P>
   And singer Billie Holiday, saxophonist Lester Young and
clarinetist Sidney Bechet died.
</P>
<P>
   In the following decade, rock would usurp jazz as the music of
the hip, the cool, the culturally connected. And jazz itself would
go through a series of changes, as some musicians incorporated
elements of rock, while others took off for free-jazz territory.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their motives were artistic or commercial, jazz artists
found themselves marginalized. It wouldn't be until the 1980s, with
the emergence of the neobop movement _ whose proponents included
trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and pianist Marcus Roberts _ that jazz
regained some of its cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is still around, and some of its players are indeed
superlative. But as Haden noted, most of the newcomers don't seem
to have anything original to say. And as Cobb observed, there are
some things you just can't learn in music school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago,'' the drummer said, ``the music was really
happening. Then it went someplace else.''

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ George Brett and the rest of the Baseball
Hall of Fame hoo-ha had left town by the time I arrived here the
weekend of July 30. (The previous weekend, between the baseball
extravaganza and the Woodstock rehash up the road in Rome, there
wasn't a hotel room to be had for something like 20 counties in
central New York.)
</P>
<P>
   But Cooperstown's other big draw, Glimmerglass Opera, was doing
its part to make hotel rooms scarce even a week later. The best I
could manage was a decidedly modest Budget Host motel in Sharon
Springs, a good 25 minutes away from downtown Cooperstown. At least
the commute couldn't have been lovelier, Routes 20 and 80 winding
up hills and down dales and finally clutching the steep edges of
Otsego Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Glimmerglass Opera is based a few miles north of town, on a
patch of flat land fronting the lake. It's housed in a cluster of
grayish farmlike buildings, designed by architect Hugh Hardy to
blend with the rural setting. (``Glimmerglass,'' by the way, was
novelist James Fenimore Cooper's name for Otsego Lake in his
Leatherstocking Tales.)
</P>
<P>
   Glimmerglass began in 1975 as a mom-and-pop operation in the
Cooperstown High School Auditorium. But since its move to the
delightful 894-seat Alice Busch Opera Theater, which opened in
1987, the summer festival has become a mecca for unusual repertory
and offbeat stagings. Its productions are the work of important and
innovative directors and designers, and casts include some of the
finest younger singers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, its lively program has been reinforced by a
joint-production agreement with New York City Opera. So far, 10
Glimmerglass productions have been reprised at Lincoln Center's New
York State Theater, and more are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Running between July 1 and Aug. 23, this year's four-production
lineup includes a brand-new trilogy called ``Central Park,'' with
three of the hottest present-day playwrights as librettists, as
well as Claudio Monteverdi's 349-year-old ``Il ritorno d'Ulisse in
patria.'' In between fall the more commonly encountered ``Abduction
From the Seraglio'' and ``Rigoletto.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Glimmerglass productions of Handel's ``Partenope''
and Virgil Thomson's ``The Mother of Us All'' were so memorable
that they raised high hopes for this season. Alas, at least to
these eyes and ears, only one of the ``Central Park'' mini-operas
really rose to the memorable category.
</P>
<P>
   `Central Park'
</P>
<P>
   In a day when some of the best theater is to be seen on opera
stages, Glimmerglass reversed operatic tradition by spotlighting
the librettists of ``Central Park'' almost more than the composers.
Clearly there was hope that playwrights Wendy Wasserstein, A.R.
Gurney and Terrence McNally would have drawing power that virtually
no living composer could match. The trilogy was jointly
commissioned by Glimmerglass, New York City Opera and
Thirteen//WNET's ``Great Performances'' television series.
</P>
<P>
   But tongues wagged when the composer originally commissioned for
the third opera, Aaron Jay Kernis, withdrew. Even after seven
revisions of McNally's libretto for ``The Food of Love,'' Kernis
pronounced the script unworkable; Robert Beaser was hired in his
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Park'' is, indeed, set in Frederick Law Olmsted's
beloved Manhattan refuge. Designer Michael Yeargan emphasizes the
stage artifice with a space enclosed by white walls, a rollup
security door, trees rooted in burlap bags and a big TV monitor
cycling through New York scenes. Costumes, by Candice Donnelly, are
just what you'd expect in present-day Central Park. Robert Wierzel
makes lighting a telling participant.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the hopeless ``Food of Love'' _ Kernis was wise to
bow out _ director Mark Lamos has done a splendid job of animating
the characters and their dramas. Stewart Robertson (who was
considered for the artistic directorship of Lyric Opera of Kansas
City) conducts, mostly capably. But in the July 30 performance,
coordination wasn't always ideal in the opening ``Festival of
Regrets,'' and throughout the trilogy, balances sometimes seemed
haphazard; the orchestra was often too loud in the central
``Strawberry Fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wasserstein-Deborah Drattell ``Festival'' dramatizes a
Jewish New Year ritual in which participants symbolically discard
sins and regrets. Amid in-line skaters, Frisbee tossers and dog
walkers, the drama embraces a cranky Mother and daughter (Greta),
but also Greta's ex-husband, Frank, his new girlfriend, Jessica, an
intellectual teen-ager named Wesley and a pretty girl named Melina.
</P>
<P>
   The lightest-hearted of the three operas, this is an apt
curtain-raiser for the trilogy. Although there are tensions as well
as warmer ties among the dramatis personae, the libretto is full of
witty one-liners _ very much New York Jewish, a la ``Seinfeld.''
But in the end, the effect is as tender as it is whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   Drattell's score is a streetwise melange of relentless
chuggings, quasi-klezmer tunes and buildups of gleaming, tangy
chords. The vocal writing is basically accompanied recitative, with
occasional patches of more lyric expression.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Castle was a first-class yenta of a Mother, and Lauren
Flanigan dispensed her fine (if, in context, almost overpowering)
soprano on the role of Greta. Matthew DiBattista brought a bright
tenor and appealing presence to the part of Wesley. John Hancock
made a suitably imposing Frank, but with some lower-register
choking-up of his baritone. Joshua Winograde was appropriately
dignified as the (speaking) Rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   The prize of the trilogy is ``Strawberry Fields,'' a real
tear-jerker for baby boomers looking after declining parents. (Many
a tissue was seen dabbing at eyes at intermission.) Indeed, in our
cynical age, one almost resents Gurney's heading right for our
emotions and so skillfully manipulating them.
</P>
<P>
   The story revolves around an Old Lady, who on her park bench
hallucinates she's at the opera. Her Son and Daughter are keen to
have her put away _ out of sight and mind _ but a cheerful Student
figures the woman is entitled to her harmless imaginings. (In a
way, this is an opera-within-an-opera, in the manner of ``Ariadne
auf Naxos.'')
</P>
<P>
   Michael Torke's score, too, has a skillful finger on our
emotions. The tenderness of the Student toward the Old Woman is
suggested in quite lush music at the start, but the incursion of
worldly cares brings along restless, syncopated patternwork. The
heart-rending denouement _ I'll not give it away _ sends the music
into surges and soarings worthy of Puccini.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Castle had an even greater triumph as the Old Lady, with
Jeffrey Lentz as a winsome Student. John Hancock and Margaret Lloyd
turned in suitably callous performances as the Son and Daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``The Food of Love'' is that it just keeps
doing the same thing over and over again. A homeless _ and maybe
slightly deranged _ Woman keeps trying to give her baby to a
succession of callous strangers: a Pat Buchanan Republican, a man
working a cell phone, a young couple with sun reflectors working on
lunchtime tans.
</P>
<P>
   Beaser's score is as restless and rootless as the characters.
Opening with shimmering, twittering night music, it embraces a
quite luscious lullaby as well as minimalist chuggings shifting
against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Flanigan was as persuasive as possible as the Woman. Need
we go on to list the rest of the cardboard-character cast? This was
tedium itself.
</P>
<P>
   `Ulysses' et al
</P>
<P>
   ``Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria'' (``The Return of Ulysses'')
had the makings of a great operatic experience, including
imaginative sets and costumes by Johan Engels, lilting and
interactive conducting by early-music specialist Jane Glover, and
Phyllis Pancella as a commanding Penelope. Alas _ and with singers
in heavy costumes, most suggesting the 17th century _ the July 31
matinee seemed to wilt in the meteorological steambath.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather gets hot and humid, even the best singers can
have trouble singing in tune, and Pancella and company kept landing
outside pitch centers. That the tiny accompanying ensemble kept so
truly tuned was pretty amazing.
</P>
<P>
   With these qualifications, there were outstanding contributions
from Christine Abraham's bright, agile Minerva and Greg Fedderly's
clear, bold Telemaco. Marc McCrory was a rich-hued Nettuno, but his
bottom register was undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   James Maddelena, as Ulisse, sounded out of sorts _ a little
ragged, with a pronounced vibrato. Gerald Frantzen was too feeble
for even a brief appearance as Giove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Abduction From the Seraglio'' was presented in English
translation, with at least the essentials of the spoken dialogue.
John Conklin's blue, V-shaped set, with multiple doors alternating
with vaguely exotic grillework, had the added virtue of reinforcing
projection of both voices and orchestral sound. Costumes, by
Constance Hoffman, looked to be turn-of-the-20th-century. Conductor
Stewart Robertson kept the music stylish and buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   The standout in the cast was Gustav Andreassen's Osmin, with a
rich, finely focused bass-baritone. But Anna Christy's pert,
gleaming Blonde was appealing, too, and Timothy Swaim was an
adorably comic Pedrillo.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Guyer seemed a promising Constanze at the beginning, with
a fine balance of dignity and spunk. But her creamy soprano seemed
to wane as the opera went on, and there was something flabby about
her rhythm. William Burden's Belmonte was forced and charmless.
Jonathan Earl Peck was the Pasha Selim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rigoletto'' had the big and rich-toned E. Mark Delavan in the
title role, although the voice sounded more covered in the second
half. Both vocally and dramatically, Mark McCrory was an imposing
Sparafucile. But it was downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Hernandez's brassy Duke of Mantua lacked depth of tone.
Absent the essential sweetness and warmth, Christina Bouras' Gilda
was merely serviceable. The chorus was superb, but balances with _
even within _ the orchestra were pretty haphazard: Did no one go
out into the house to listen? George Manahan's baton, alternately
hurrying and dragging, too often unyielding to expressive needs,
did no one any favors.
</P>
<P>
   John Conklin is one of the most inventive set designers alive,
but this looked like an assemblage of leftover abstractions.
Costumes were by Tracy Dorman.

 &HT;    GOP COURTS WOMEN WITH TAX PLAN
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans are using their tax cut proposal to
court women voters in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   GOP congressional leaders, who are devoting their August recess
to drumming up public support for the tax plan, are scheduled to
spend the last week of the month promoting its benefits to
families, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to final congressional approval of the
package this month, the Republican National Committee released
several statements aimed at women voters.
</P>
<P>
   One said: ``All women work. All women win under the Republican
Tax Refund Plan.'' Republican women in Congress wrote President
Clinton urging him to support the bill, which he has repeatedly
promised to veto.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is highlighting provisions that raise pension
contribution limits and ease the ``marriage penalty,'' which causes
some married couples to pay more tax than if they filed as singles.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans dismiss objections by Democrats that the tax
plan offers little help for lower-income groups, where women are
concentrated, and that its passage could lead to cuts in government
programs that many women rely on.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National
Committee, acknowledges that there is no ``one-size-fits-all''
benefit for women in the tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, ``I think women in general are going to say,
'We've got to say now is the time for the tax cuts in terms of our
changing lives.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among those changes are an increase in the number of women
entrepreneurs, single women and high-earning women, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said several items in the
tax bill _ some contained in a section titled ``Enhancing Fairness
to Women'' _ that help women across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the actual tax cuts _ the marriage tax
penalty, the pension catch-up, the long-term care credit, the child
care credit and the provisions for setting aside enough spending
increases to accommodate Medicare _ I think they are the key
provisions that address issues of concern to women,'' Hutchison
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The plan lowers all tax rates by one percentage point, makes the
standard deduction for married couples double that for singles and
takes other steps to alleviate the marriage penalty. It expands
credits for child care, long-term health care and education
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also raises contribution limits to Individual
Retirement Accounts and 401(k) retirement savings plans. A pension
catch-up provision allows participants in tax-deferred retirement
plans over age 50 to increase their annual contributions from
$10,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP focus on tax benefits for women comes as the nation
heads into closely fought elections for control of the White House
and Congress. In recent years, women have leaned toward supporting
Democrats in national races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gender gap has typically favored Democrats over
Republicans, so it's very much in the Republicans' interest to
promote such issues,'' said Teresa Sullivan, a professor of
sociology and law at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   However, she cautioned that tax cuts are a poor way to target a
group as diverse as women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing taxes for married couples would benefit an equal
number of men,'' Sullivan said. ``Tax policy is a crude way to
target particular groups for help.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, many single women who head households make so
little that they are not required to pay income taxes. Therefore,
they don't benefit from the GOP tax plan, Sullivan said. Child care
subsidies would be a better benefit for women who receive the tax
credit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the tax plan being pitched that way?'' agreed Jane
Midgley, coordinator of the nonprofit Women's Budget Project, based
in Boston. The grass-roots organization teaches women how to
analyze the federal budget and government expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has some provisions that benefit women, including
pension support and help for small businesses, Midgley said. But
she described the provisions for women as ``window dressing'' for a
GOP tax package that largely serves the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department has estimated that the most affluent 10
percent of taxpayers, those with incomes above $90,000 a year,
would receive about 60 percent of the tax cuts. That figure doesn't
take into account the end of the tax relief provisions in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Most women would benefit if public resources were directed
toward universal health care coverage, preventing the privatization
of Social Security and subsidizing child care for single working
mothers, Midgley said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning Washington research group, also say the tax cut
will cost significantly more than GOP leaders claim. They said that
because taxes would rise dramatically when the tax relief
provisions are scheduled to end in 2009, Congress would feel
pressure to extend the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be deep cuts in federal spending to compensate
for lost tax revenue, center officials argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't want a tax cut, but improvements in health
care, Social Security and Medicare,'' said Midgley, citing recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole tax cut debate is framed in a skewed way. It's being
focused on should we have the tax cuts or not. What you really want
to do is determine the needs of the country and how you go about
meeting them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sharpest points of debate is the tax plan's pension
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who favors a smaller tax cut, says the GOP plan would
take away money from shoring up Social Security and Medicare.
Democrats and Republicans are keenly aware that the programs are
especially important to women, who live longer and earn less than
men. In addition, many women are part-time workers who cannot
participate in pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What women can afford to put aside more than $10,000 of their
earnings into the pension plan? They're either women whose income
is quite discretionary or women who are relatively high-salaried,''
said Iris Lav, deputy director of the Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year have pension
plans. The lower the income, the less likely a person is to be
covered by a pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   But as more women become entrepreneurs, Harrison said, they'll
benefit from the pension changes and other aspects of the tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pejorative to say women will always be at (lower income)
levels. Women who are just starting out will have substantial money
when they're 65 and cash in on their pensions. Why can't they get a
bigger return?'' Harrison argues.

HUGH GRANT AND THE MISSUS TAKE ON THE MOB

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Hugh Grant in
``Mickey Blue Eyes.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    By Ivor Davis
 &HT;    When Hugh Grant, the ever-so-polite British actor, was getting
ready to shoot his new mob comedy in the thick of New York's urban
jungle, he discovered he had a secret weapon: enter producer
Elizabeth Hurley, his glamorous partner in life and in art.
 &HT;    Grant and Hurley's ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' is their second film, a
rollicking romantic comedy with Grant playing a straightlaced
Englishman at a New York auction house who is about to marry an art
teacher played by Jeanne Tripplehorn.
 &HT;    There's a catch, however: Tripplehorn's father is a low-level
gangster (played by veteran actor James Caan) who wants Grant in
the family business.
 &HT;    The 38-year-old actor says Hurley not only wore the producer's
hat, but also played a crucial role: with her British charm and
upper-crust accent she cajoled their underworld contacts into
smoothing out those pesky union-related glitches and street-level
hassles which routinely plague the Big Apple's film crews.
 &HT;    Thanks to Hurley, the movie was completed for about $30 million,
a sum considered moderate by today's Hollywood standards.
 &HT;    ``We wanted the film to be very real and not have comedy or
Hollywood mobsters,'' Grant says. ``So my director friend Mike
Newell (``Donnie Brasco,'' 1997, and ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral,'' 1994) introduced us to guys with names like Rocco the
Butcher and Vinny Sevenheads. And gradually we got further and
further immersed in their world.''
 &HT;    Looking relaxed in blue jeans, a T-shirt and tennis shoes, Grant
recalls that he and Hurley spent a number of pivotal evenings
dining with Rocco, Vinny and the gang.
 &HT;    ``We finished up with some unbelievably heavy drinking ... They
couldn't have cared less about me, but I watched Elizabeth flirt
with them very, very successfully,'' Grant says.
 &HT;    ``She may be successful in the movies and as an Estee Lauder
model, but that's nothing compared to her skill with the guys with
the broken noses and diamond pinkie rings. She quickly had them
eating out of her hand.
 &HT;    ``At the end of the evening they'd say, `Elizabeth, you're a
princess. Anything we can do for you in New York, just say the
word.'''
 &HT;    It was an offer Hurley could not refuse. And when she ran into a
problem, she didn't hesitate to call on her newfound friends.
 &HT;    ``They opened every door for us,'' Grant says. ``There was
nowhere we couldn't film. Once we had helicopters overhead making a
terrible racket and ruining our shots. So Rocco or someone grabbed
his cellphone and called the tower at JFK Airport, and suddenly ...
no helicopters.''
 &HT;    ``Many of the mob characters showed up as extras in the movie's
big wedding scene,'' Grant says. ``They loved the script and it
tickled them to be in our picture.''
 &HT;    The ultra-suave Grant seems an unlikely casting choice for the
part of a mob suitor: in the original script, the principal
character is a neurotic Manhattan lawyer.
 &HT;    ``(The script) was funny, but it was all a bit familiar,'' Grant
says. ``However, Elizabeth and I tailored the role for me. I wrote
a lot of my own dialogue because I know how words come out of my
own mouth.''
 &HT;    Nicknamed ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' by his new mob acquaintances,
Grant's bumbling Brit becomes heavily involved with and eventually
transformed by the ``wise guys.''
 &HT;    In one of the film's funniest scenes, Caan tries to teach the
Englishman to ``fuhgedaboutit!'' and coaches him in rudimentary
Italian-American street lingo.
 &HT;    ``I was a bit intimidated by James when we first met, and in the
scene he was really getting frustrated because I couldn't deliver
the joke lines, or get the fractured pronunciations right,'' Grant
says.
 &HT;    ``Jimmy's the kind of guy who likes to do the scene once or
twice and then leave,'' he adds. ``But we spent the entire day
doing the one scene, and the frustration you see in his face is
real. Plus the fact that I get car sick and every so often we had
to pull over so I could throw up.''
 &HT;    Caan remembers the day well:
 &HT;    ``Hugh's this nervous British guy who is actually playing
himself in the movie,'' he says. ``From the first day I realized my
trick for our scenes was to try and keep Hugh Grant the actor
nervous all day long so that his character in the film would be
edgy. Hugh is such an easy mark. I had him scared out of his skin
some days.''
 &HT;    Grant snaps back with mock derision:
 &HT;    ``I loved him as Sonny Corleone in `The Godfather' (1972) _ I
was a kid when I saw it. We had to pluck Jimmy from his old
people's home so he could work with me. And all he did was insult
me, calling me `a little wimpy guy.' He gave me no respect.''
 &HT;    The film comes hard on the heels of Grant's summer hit ``Notting
Hill,'' in which he romanced Julia Roberts. While the new Mafia
comedy has been well-received in previews, Grant says he is wary
about its scheduled release so soon after the earlier film.
 &HT;    Could two Hugh Grant vehicles in three months be one Hugh Grant
too many?
 &HT;    ``I'm the world's worst career planner,'' Grant says. ``I do
nothing for a couple of years, and then I'm in two movies in the
same summer. Bloody silly. I modeled my career plans after the
London bus system. You wait for an hour and nothing comes along,
and then suddenly 20 buses show up going to the same place.''
 &HT;    Grant is hoping his and Hurley's second production will fare
better than their first, the box-office disappointment ``Extreme
Measures'' (l996). And the pair are planning ``Her Majesty's
Homey,'' a third film together as producer and star in which Grant
will play (no great stretch here) a British royal emissary caught
up in New York's hip-hop community.
 &HT;    And Grant has completed a starring role in a new and as yet
untitled Woody Allen film.
 &HT;    ``I play a sophisticated guy living in New York who is hired by
a very vulgar, nouveau riche couple from Brooklyn (played by Allen
and Tracey Ullman) to teach them about wine and art and stuff,''
Grant says.
 &HT;    ``Woody faxed me the job offer and I said `yes' right away. Then
he sent me 27 pages of script, but just my part. He told me nothing
else. He's unbelievably silent as a director. You show up, do your
scenes and you're home in time for lunch.''
 &HT;    In the wake of ``Notting Hill's'' success, Grant has been
offered a lot of money to star in other big-budget movies. And
while he may be tempted to turn them down for the sake of his art
and peace of mind, Grant says the memory of his years as a
down-and-out Londoner keeps him hungry and on his toes.
 &HT;    ``I've talked about my fantasy _ to act less and write. But it's
always very difficult to say `no,' specially when you've spent
years and years as an unemployed, penniless actor ... You tend to
hoard everything you can get.''

UNWELCOME TRUTHS SOUTH OF THE BORDER

   Commentary

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ When most Americans contemplate Mexico,
their thoughts turn to tacos, mariachis and sunny resort beaches
where the sound of waves is joined by the whir of blenders whipping
up tangy margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a dark and horrifying side to our neighbor to the south
needs to be exposed. That action was recently taken by a United
Nations human rights official invited by Mexican government
officials who thought they could control her.
</P>
<P>
   Asma Jahangir, a U.N. specialist in extrajudicial killings, made
no effort to restrain herself in criticizing Mexico after an
emotionally exhausting investigation into the massacres of more
than 60 men, women and children by the police and paramilitary
within the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she slam the political environment in which such
cold-blooded shootings occurred, she told the Mexican press that
the presidential elections next year could turn bloody unless the
government cracks down on police, military and paramilitary thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Foreign Ministry sputtered, fumed and denounced
Jahangir's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Tough.
</P>
<P>
   Jahangir was right in being as vocal as she could against a
nation where government attitudes helped foster the vicious
massacre of December 1997, in which 21 Indian women, 15 children
and nine men were shot to death and hacked to pieces during an
eight-hour rampage in the tiny Indian village of Acteal in the
troubled state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The state police, on patrol nearby, heard the shooting but never
bothered to investigate. While Mexican courts recently sentenced 20
men to prison terms of 35 years apiece for their part in the
deaths, Mexican human rights groups have denounced the
investigation. They maintain that no arrests have been made of
government officials whom the organizations accuse of being part of
a conspiracy that trained, armed and encouraged the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Jahangir also investigated a massacre in 1995 when the police in
the state of Guerrero mowed down 17 unarmed peasants crowded on a
truck that was en route to an anti-government protest. Video, taped
by the officers themselves, later proved that weapons were placed
in the hands of the dead victims to make it appear that the
peasants were armed.
</P>
<P>
   And she traveled to Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El
Paso, where more than 100 women have been killed since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The police there are stumped by the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has sought to wipe
out the police corruption and inefficiency that allowed these
massacres and serial murders. His efforts have been, not
surprisingly, ineffectual. His administration inherited a
nationwide police system that has a 60-year record of being
incredibly corrupt and violent. However, Zedillo has failed to
realize that increased training and tougher screening for police
officers alone will not curb his country's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   He must also substantially raise their wages and boost their
education to at least a high school graduate level.
</P>
<P>
   Unless all those factors are instituted, nothing that any future
administration can do will reduce Mexico's devastating criminal
violence. The police and federal agents who are paid dirt wages and
are poorly educated will be corruptible, no matter if they receive
the toughest training.
</P>
<P>
   If improvement is to come to Mexico's poorly run law enforcement
agencies, it needs more international inspectors like Jahangir.
</P>
<P>
   In her parting remarks, she said, ``I'm the rapporteur into
extrajudicial executions, not a grave-digger. If I had simply come
here to count bodies, and recommended `please don't do it again,' I
wouldn't be doing my job. I have to understand the underlying
problems and formulate my recommendations on that basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Bully for her.

DREAMERS BEWARE: ANOTHER SWEEPSTAKES ENTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. _ Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm's
widely publicized, highly visible campaign to go after all those
phony sweepstakes promoters reminds one of another attorney
general's widely publicized, highly visible campaign to rid the
world of another of life's major economic ills: Those notorious
scanners that sometimes don't give you the pennies off in a store
when something is on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Yes sir, we have been blessed with truly courageous attorneys
general in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   I remember clearly the coverage then-Attorney General Frank
Kelley received each year when he'd spend tons of our money
checking on the check-outs, a program with which life could hardly
go on without.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether you've told the U.S. Post Office to pitch
all the packets from Publisher's Clearinghouse in your place, but
they're a constant sign of hope in our household, and you have to
have hope.
</P>
<P>
   I know from the first time I see those odd-size, brightly
colored envelopes in our mailbox, my heart starts racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurry, honey,'' my wife will say throatily as I begin pulling
out the bills and junk mail. ``Get that baby open. We may have
already won.''
</P>
<P>
   But now our attorney general, who probably wanted to lighten up
an otherwise dreary Monday, said that she is going to war with the
sweepstakes wastrels and that we are victims, hostages to our own
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies do aggressive marketing, and that's fine.
It's when you target people, when you combine it with practices
that lead people to believe it's authentic when it's not,'' she
said Monday during her five-city stop across the state.
</P>
<P>
   You can call it odd, but I've told my wife the very same thing
over the past few years. ``Honey,'' I say. ``Ed McMahon is not
coming to our house despite that authentic looking sweepstakes
entry. You and I both know the odds are greater that Dick Clark
will have gray hair before that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Having scanned (oops, sorry Frank) hundreds of sweepstakes
entries over the past 20 years or so, I can see how people might be
duped, probably in a fashion very similar to those who are suing
the tobacco companies because they have been led to believe that
smoking is good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are victimized more than once, Granholm said.
``Those who are vulnerable are hit again and again and again.'' To
those people I would advise: Throw away the hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we're all victims in some fashion, just as poor Bill
Clinton is a victim of infighting among his female relatives.
Whenever I look at that Family Handyman magazine lying on the
coffee table I wonder: Did I really want to learn more about
mitering or am I truly a victim of overzealous marketers?
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I pick up my copy of Sail, read the articles about
Virgin Gorda in the Virgin Islands and dream that I too could be
there someday, I wonder if my fantasies are being formed by some
fanatical salesman.
</P>
<P>
   But I needn't worry about that anymore. Thanks to our plucky
attorney general, no more will my mailbox be filled to overflowing
with envelopes announcing ``Mr. Wirtz, you are a guaranteed winner
(if there is a direct correlation between your Social Security
number and the position of the stars in the constellation Orion on
Oct. 3, 2002).''
</P>
<P>
   Now I can devote my full attention trying to find that amorphous
line that is my local cellular phone home-and-roam zone. Perhaps
Attorney General Granholm can find it for me, before I get
victimized yet again.

NO WAY TO TREAT THE MENTALLY ILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I can't forget the night I spent on the phone
with Ralph Tortorici's father.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph was telling him horrible things about prison life, Bob
Tortorici said. They were doing terrible things to him. He didn't
belong there. He belonged in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,` I said, ``I agree with you. But there's one problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Bob Tortorici said. ``You don't know if what he's
saying is real.''
</P>
<P>
   I talked to the prison authorities anyway. Look, they told me,
Ralph was found guilty, and the court sentenced him. We're putting
him into more tightly supervised settings when it seems necessary,
but what are we supposed to do here? We run prisons. We don't run
mental hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   They were right. Ralph's father was right, too. But maybe Ralph
also was right. He thought he was. He was so certain of it, in
fact, that he decided to end what he believed he was suffering. On
Tuesday, he hanged himself in prison. This suicide is only the most
recent example of how wretchedly this society _ that's you and me
and the cold-hearted, penny-pinching politicians we elect _ treat
people with mental illness. This is our great shame as a people.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, we're a better people than we once were, but we
still have a lot to be ashamed of. If we're no longer outwardly
cruel to people of different races, we are, at best, careless to
them. We remain cruel, many of us, to people whose love lives
differ from our own. We've thrown up our hands in despair at
helping the poor. Too many of our children run wild and without
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere is our shame darker than in our treatment of those
left helpless by diseases of the mind. To save tax dollars, we
throw them out of public hospitals all across the country to sleep
in the street and freeze in the winter. And sometimes, as in the
case of Ralph Tortorici, to hurt other people as they cry out in
their agony.
</P>
<P>
   Tortorici was a paranoid schizophrenic. He believed with every
fiber of his being that the CIA had implanted a computer chip in
his penis. He came into contact many, many times with the laughable
system we have in place to deal with people like him. He got no
real help. He was left alone with his imaginary terrors.

<P>
   So, one day, he took a rifle to a lecture hall at the State
University of New York at Albany. He held a class hostage to draw
attention to his plight. He shot a young man, Jason McEnaney,
leaving him unable to father children. Then we put Tortorici in the
slammer.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the hospital where he should have been from the start,
before his illness led him to violence. Not in a secure treatment
facility where he could live out his tortured life with caring
support.
</P>
<P>
   No, we put him into one of the 70 prisons that New York state
reserves for its worst, most violent, most dangerous criminals. We
put him into a place where, according to the best estimates of this
problem, as many as one in five inmates may be as severely deluded
as Tortorici was.
</P>
<P>
   I have a friend who sat on the jury that sent Tortorici to that
prison. The charge from the judge, my friend told me _ that
detailed recitation of the law that we fine, compassionate citizens
have in place in New York, and that most other states have in place
as well _ left the jury no choice.
</P>
<P>
   So, now, Ralph Tortorici is dead by his own hand. The kid he
maimed with his bullet will live out an incomplete life, and his
line will die with him. And, all of us, we're left with this
simple, nagging question:
</P>
<P>
   Just what kind of people are we, really, that we would let this
go on and on?
</P>

TOMATO ENVY: SIZE AND SHAPE DON'T MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sometimes it seems like there are as many
different kinds of tomatoes as there are ways to use them. Big
ones, little ones, red ones, yellow ones.
</P>
<P>
   Though a big, red, juicy beefsteak tomato is perfection with
seeds, all these others varieties have their place on the table,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chefs use (different varieties) because they are always
looking for something new,'' says Anthony Battaglia, president of
California Produce in Menands, N.Y. ``They like the way the
different colors look on the plate and how the different ones
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, yellow or orange tomatoes are less acidic
than red tomatoes of a similar variety. And that's a fact that
makes red tomatoes better for canning, sauce making or other
processes where a high acid content helps preserve the finished
product.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the yellow to orange colored tomatoes are
usually sweeter, and visually more striking, which can make them
better for using fresh in salads or in dishes where they are only
briefly cooked. One exception here are the tiny grape tomatoes,
which, although red, are extraordinarily sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Plum tomatoes, also called Roma tomatoes, are especially good
for cooking because they have thicker walls in proportion to the
seeds than other varieties. That means more meat and less waste.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Huber, a chef in Norfolk, Va., advocates roasting plum
tomatoes to bring out the sugars in the fruit and help develop
their flavor. To roast them, Huber cuts each tomato in half,
lengthwise, and tosses the halves in a mixture of olive oil, white
vinegar, salt and sugar. Use just enough of the oil mixture to coat
the tomatoes. Place the halves, cut side up, in a roasting pan and
roast at 250 degrees for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When done, the tomatoes
are shriveled yet juicy and have a deeper flavor than raw tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Those medium-size tomatoes on the vine that you find in the
grocery stores are usually hydroponically grown tomatoes from
Holland, says Battaglia. And, the little-bitty pear-shaped yellow
and red ones that are so popular with chefs these days are
``teardrop'' tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the beefsteak variety that captures the attention. Big
enough so that one center slice covers a piece of bread, it's the
crown jewel of summer tomatoes no matter where you find it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they taste like summer, but nutritionists are
starting to tout tomatoes as one of the most beneficial foods on
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Harvard Medical School indicate that consumption of
tomatoes and tomato products may reduce the risk of numerous
cancers, including breast and cervical cancer, according to the
June issue of MAMM, a magazine about women and cancer. The same
studies indicated that tomato consumption may also help prevent
prostate cancer in men. Though unproven, scientists theorize that
lycopene, an antioxidant found in tomatoes, may be responsible for
the lower incidence of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tomatoes are rich in vitamins C and B, potassium,
iron and phosphorus. One medium tomato has about as much fiber as a
slice of whole-wheat bread but only about 35 calories.
</P>
<P>
   To eat tomatoes at their ripest, store them at room temperature
and use within a few days of purchase. Never refrigerate, since
cold temperatures make the meat grainy and kill the flavor of the
tomato. And, just as important, don't leave picked tomatoes to sit
in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Unripe tomatoes may be ripened by placing them in a paper bag
with an apple. Score the bag to ventilate and keep at room
temperature, advises the Epicurious Web site. Check daily and use
when ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Because tomatoes, though in season and tasting fresh now, will
be just a memory in a couple short months.

MARTIN AND MURPHY   EXCEL IN `BOWFINGER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the surface, it seems ersatz filmmaker Bobby
Bowfinger has all the ingredients needed to make it in Hollywood.
Look closer, though, and you'll find that his ponytail is a
clip-on, his designer suit was stolen off the rack, and his hot new
sci-fi action script, ``Chubby Rain,'' came to him by way of his
Iranian part-time receptionist-accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The likable new comedy, ``Bowfinger,'' is all about deception,
which isn't surprising given that it was written by Steve Martin.
The comic actor has made a career out of playing the charming
frauds he has fashioned for himself, most notably a decade ago with
the beguiling ``Roxanne.'' (He's pretty convincing, too, when
working with other writers; see David Mamet's ``The Spanish
Prisoner.'')
</P>
<P>
   Here, Martin again enlists director Frank Oz as his partner in
duplicity, and the teaming works as well as it did with ``Dirty
Rotten Scoundrels'' and ``Housesitter.'' In fact, ``Bowfinger'' is
even better because of the team's shared sensibility and because
this time Martin has a secret weapon _ an uproarious Eddie Murphy,
who delivers his funniest screen performance since ``Beverly Hills
Cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin plays Bowfinger, a career hack who sees ``Chubby Rain''
as his last chance to make it in Hollywood before he turns 50. He's
got the go-ahead on ``Chubby Rain,'' but with one huge proviso.
Bowfinger must convince Kit Ramsey (Murphy), Hollywood's hottest
action star, to top the cast. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by Ramsey's lack of enthusiasm, Bowfinger decides to
make the movie anyway, filming the scenes with Ramsey on the sly.
He calls the unrehearsed ambushes ``cinema nouveau,'' which
explains why his motley group of actors never get to rehearse with
Kit. Meanwhile, the egocentric and paranoid Ramsey begins to think
he's losing his mind as members of Bowfinger's troupe approach him,
cryptically warning of ``Chubby Rain's'' coming pod-people alien
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its Hollywood-insider premise, ``Bowfinger'' rarely
tries for cutting-edge show-biz satire, instead concentrating its
considerable energies on its characters and loopy situations. Oz
wants us to believe in Bowfinger's wacky scheme and, given Martin's
charm and manic enthusiasm, you almost do.
</P>
<P>
   The best scenes belong to Murphy, playing the psychotic,
desperately insecure movie star with a bite that has been lacking
from his work for too many years. And he's almost as funny in a
second role, Jiff, a sweet Ramsey look-alike enlisted by Bowfinger
when he can't find the real Ramsey. Using minimal makeup and some
extraordinary body language, Murphy creates an indelible character
without resorting to the flatulence humor that filled ``The Nutty
Professor'' and ``Dr. Dolittle.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling out Bowfinger's ragged team are Daisy (Heather Graham),
a farm-fresh ingenue who's game for sleeping her way to the top,
and Carol (Christine Baranski), a melodramatic Method actress
thrilled to ``work'' with a star of Ramsey's magnitude. Terrence
Stamp is also on hand as the leader of Mind Head, a
Scientology-like sect Ramsey turns to for comfort. (Happy Premise
No. 1: There are no aliens. Happy Premise No. 2: There is no giant
foot trying to squash you.)
</P>
<P>
   It's all good fun (unless you are a Scientologist), and even if
some of the goofiness falls a bit flat, you can be assured that
another big belly laugh is just around the corner. Best of all: You
don't need to be 12 to appreciate the humor. For that alone, we're
willing to give ``Bowfinger'' a summertime Oscar. &QL;

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Having cut his teeth with schlock film guru Roger
Corman, you'd think director Jonathan Kaplan would know a thing or
two about women-in-foreign-prison movies. Unfortunately, with his
dreadful new effort, ``Brokedown Palace,'' Kaplan proves that while
he's got the cliches down pat, he doesn't have the faintest idea
what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Brokedown Palace'' has more serious aspirations
than, say, ``The Big Doll House.'' And that's part of the problem.
First-time screenwriter David Arata has compiled such a complete
encyclopedia of grim prison-movie conventions (START ITALICS)The
injustice! The deplorable conditions! The unfeeling foreigners who
do the darndest things! _(END ITALICS) that audience members could
follow along with their eyes and ears closed. There's no ambiguity
here, only the unmistakable mark of hollow and repetitive
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale play two spoiled high school
graduates who decide to forgo Hawaii's standard-issue attractions
for an adventurous fling in Bangkok. Danes' Alice is the bad girl;
Beckinsale's Darlene is her cautious best friend. That's about all
we get for character development.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting a charming Australian (Daniel Lapaine), the girls
decide to follow him to Hong Kong for a weekend of fun and frolic.
They never get out of the airport, however, as Thai police find a
rather sizable stash of heroin in Alice's backpack. And as we know
from watching movies and television newsmagazine shows, Asian
authorities don't take kindly to drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   While being held, Darlene signs a confession, which she thought
was merely a transcript of her police interview. Her explanation _
``I'm just not used to being tossed into some filthy, disgusting
jail'' _ tells you all you need to know about the intelligence of
both the movie's characters and its script.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's off to prison for Tweedledum and TweedleDanes. (Alice:
``I wasn't scared at first. I've had worse haircuts.'') Their only
hope is a shady expatriate American lawyer nicknamed Yankee Hank
(Bill Pullman), whose interest in helping appears to come more from
his need for a new car than any genuine concern. But then, these
self-absorbed girls don't really deserve Clarence Darrow.
</P>
<P>
   It's all completely pointless, capped off by a sudden ending
that feels completely contrived. Audiences paying for this rubbish
might come away thinking that Thai justice need not be a bad thing
_ if it could be meted out to filmmakers. If nothing else, a
moratorium on movies about falsely imprisoned Americans (``Return
to Paradise,'' ``Red Corner'') would seem to be an idea worth
considering. &QL;

RICHNESS ELUDES `THE GAMBLER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On rare occasions, art and the life of the artist
can be cinematically interwoven with profoundly moving results.
``Amadeus,'' some of Ken Russell's composer bio-films and last
year's ``Godsand Monsters'' are among the few magnificent examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gambler'' will not be joining them.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ambitious but unerringly trite attempt to mirror Fyodor
Dostoevski's desperate efforts to write ``The Gambler'' on deadline
with the wagering and romantic fervor described in the novel. And
it's not necessarily a bad idea, seeing as how the great novelist's
story grew out of his own compulsion, and its passions genuinely
did have real-life correspondence with the beginning of
Dostoevski's troubled, debt-plagued relationship with his
stenographer, Anna Snitkina.
</P>
<P>
   But the storytellers here _ longtime Hungarian director Karoly
Makk, writers Katharine Ogden, Charles Cohen and Nick Dear _ keep
connecting scenes from the novel with the Russian's
sordid-but-creatively-vital life in the most obvious ways.
</P>
<P>
   As Dostoevski (played with dilapidated middle-age brio by the
fine Irish actor Michael Gambon) dictates his fevered drama of
self-immolation to young, sheltered and increasingly excited Anna
(Jodhi May, bright and earnest and a little too proto-feminist for
1860s St. Petersburg), her 20-year-old imagination flutters into
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, her heart soon follows suit, and it's not hard to
figure out why. Not only is Fyodor intriguingly grumpy-brilliant
and vulnerable, too (epilepsy acting here as a kind of pheromone
for her caregiving impulse), the tale he spews out is a real
corker, all about unlucky Russian nobles getting taken to the
cleaners at a posh German gambling spa.
</P>
<P>
   In the passages from the book, beautiful Polina (Polly Walker)
is in love and indebted to sleazy French pseudo-aristocrat De
Grieux (Johan Leysen). Family retainer Alexei (Dominic West) loves
Polina, but will trying to gamble her debts away win her heart or
just get him hooked on roulette?
</P>
<P>
   And when the solution to all these problems and more _ a rich,
hopefully dying grandmother, played by double-Oscar winner Luise
Rainer in her first screen appearance in more than ahalf-century _
appears in Roulettenburg just healthy enough to blow the rest of
the family's fortune, well, what properly raised Russian girl
wouldn't start breathing heavily?
</P>
<P>
   The film is neither as soapy nor sappy as the preceding
sentences may imply. But neither does it do anything like justice
to the deeply tormented and inspirational marriage that would
influence such masterworks as ``The Idiot,'' ``The Possessed'' and
``The Brothers Karamazov.''
</P>
<P>
   Through no fault of the actors, the richness of the creative
process _ which we'll acknowledge is one of the most difficult
things in human experience to portray dramatically on film _ too
often escapes Makk's staging. It's stodgy, artsy filmmaking from
another era, over-reliant on ``significant'' slow-motion and
dissolves that make cheap ironic contrasts between Dostoevski's
grubby reality and the glamorized casinos of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   This all serves to flatten what could have been, what should
have been, an eruptive tale of art, love and struggle. After all,
the real story was one of literary history's most profound. &QL;

ROCK 'N ROLL COMEDY SCRAPES BOTTOM OF BARREL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It sounds redundant, but it's true: We're at the
bottom of this summer's stupid teen comedy barrel. Yes, it's hard
to imagine that anything like an upper level of this cycle ever
existed, but ``Detroit Rock City'' is evidence that dumb,
cartoonish, vulgar comedy can be even worse when it's done poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here not only rests on director Adam Rifkin's
hyperactive but derivative music movie style (lots of low,
distorting angles, speed changes and other tricks that were really
cool back when the Beatles made ``A Hard Day's Night''). It's also
a result of choosing the wrong, wrong, wrong rock icon for its high
school lunkheads to deify: KISS.
</P>
<P>
   By no means worthy of cinematic immortality, not even as good a
choice for anarchic idolatry as the Ramones were in the much
funnier ``Rock 'n' Roll High School,'' the aggressively fake clown
act is held up here (I think sincerely, although it's often hard to
tell whether Rifkin's trying to be funny or is shamelessly
pandering to adolescent narcissism) as the true champions of rebel
rock spirit. Assaulted by bluenosed alarmists on one side and
insufferable disco creeps on the other, the film's protagonists
never lose their faith in fright makeup and spandex as the teen
spirit grail.
</P>
<P>
   Our heroes are four Ohio schoolboys, circa 1978, who've just
gotta get to the big KISS concert at Detroit's Cobo Hall. Of
course, all authority figures on Earth unite to keep the guys from
their goal.
</P>
<P>
   The worst offender is shrill Mrs. Bruce (Lin Shaye, last seen as
Cameron Diaz's sun-broiled neighbor in ``There's Something About
Mary''), a God-fearing single mother who's obviously a hypocrite
because she chain-smokes. She terrorizes her otherwise good-natured
son Jam (Sam Huntington) with her anti-KISS hysteria, going so far
as to lock him away in a prisonlike parochial school to insulate
him from devil music.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Jam's buddies come up with a brilliant plan to bust him
out. It involves a pizza topped with psilocybin mushrooms, very
much in this summer's tradition of cinematic baked goods abuse.
Soon, Jam is on the road to Motown with worrywart Lex (Giuseppe
Andrews), dim-bulb metalhead Trip (James De Bello) and their
clique's de facto leader, Hawk (Edward Furlong, wearing what
appears to be the same army jacket he had on in ``Terminator 2'').
</P>
<P>
   They think they've won tickets to the sold-out show, but when
that doesn't pan out, each boy goes off to earn scalper's rates or
otherwise sneak in. Hawk tries to win a male striptease contest
(the requisite upchuck sequence is incorporated here), hulking Trip
figures he'll just beat up some little kid and steal his ticket,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   One admirable thing that can be said of Carl Dupre's broad,
coincidence-weighted script is that at least it's not unduly
sex-obsessed. Each one of the boys inadvertently scores with a lady
_ some carnally, others emotionally _ but none of them view it as
the be-all and end-all of their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Idiotically, though, getting into the concert serves that
particular plot purpose. And when we all finally see KISS'
spontaneous, musically adventurous, aesthetically stirring
performance, well, all that's left to say to these four intrepid
young men, as we yell back at the screen, is: Hey, you asked for
it. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: EXPLORING THE LIMITS OF HUMAN SCIENTIFIC THEORY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's easy enough to downplay a recent decision by a
narrow-minded majority on the Kansas Board of Education to remove
evolution theories from the state's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the board did not do away with other scientific
theories such as the roundness of the Earth, the celestial motion
of the planets around the sun or the molecular structure of matter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a somewhat harder to dismiss an earlier decision by the
defense team in the original O.J. Simpson murder trial to exclude
from the entire jury pool anybody who had ever taken a high school
biology class.
</P>
<P>
   In such a class, a would-be juror may have studied the
hereditary substance found in all living cells: deoxyribonucleic
acid, or DNA. Prosecutors alleged that Simpson's DNA was found on
the bodies of the victims at the crime scene. Moreover, they said
they could prove it was his _ to same degree of scientific
certainty as, say, the evolutionary origin of organisms.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not possible to cast aside, at least in scientific
terms, the illogical world of ethnic supremacy that nurtures the
blind hatred that drove Buford Furrow to allegedly open fire on a
Los Angeles Jewish community center.
</P>
<P>
   Humans are complicated beings about which much still remains
unknown. But we do know that the human ``instruction book'' is made
up of around 80,000 genes, linked together by some 3 billion
separate pieces of non-functioning DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Of these genes, only about one-tenth of 1 percent differ from
person to person. Only a bit more differs with that of chimpanzees,
which, except in some parts of Kansas, are known to be more closely
related to humans than to baboons or other monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that all human beings are built from nearly
the same set of instructions and that the genetic code that
distinguishes, say, Furrow from the children he allegedly sought to
kill is, in scientific terms, exceedingly narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Genomes are the complete set of genetic instructions carried
within a single cell of an organism. Scientists are mapping the
entire human genome, a Herculean task expected to be completed by
2003. It's a project that would probably lack the blessing of the
know-nothing educational supervisors in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Collins of the National Human Genome Research
Institute notes that half of the disease genes in humans have
identifiable counterparts in the lowly worm. (Worms, whose genetic
code was finally broken last year, have about 100 million genomes
while mice, like humans, have about 3 billion, one reason why mice
are often used for lab tests.)
</P>
<P>
   When scientists sequence the entire human genome, they will be
able to better understand and treat some diseases and offer
patients one-of-a-kind, made-to-order drugs. Their success is
likely to make a few people rich and allow many others to live
longer and healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
   But their work does not bear, one way or another, on the
religious faith, or any lack of it, among the world's 6 billion
people. Nor will their widely expected scientific breakthrough do
away with the ever-growing litany of human stupidity and hatred.

FRENCHMAN NOT FALLING APART OVER BRITISH COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Even people thoroughly unconversant with golf
are aware that some crazy Frenchman threw away a chance to win some
kind of golf tournament sometime in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   That crazy Frenchman was 33-year-old Jean Van de Velde, and he
really isn't crazy. Reckless? By our standards, perhaps. Gallant?
Positively. Charming and eminently rootable? Mais oui!
</P>
<P>
   Monsieur Van de Velde is here as an invited participant in the
81st PGA Championship. He has been invited because he led the
British Open by three strokes after 71 holes. While all the
Americans whined and moaned about the horrors of Carnoustie, this
little-known Frenchman was busy taming the monster. OK, so he had a
wee bit o' trouble on the 18th. The way he looks at it, c'est la
guerre. After all, it was only a golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had won it,'' he explains, ``people would have said, `OK,
I mean, he led for 36 holes and he made all the hard work, and he
won, so that's a reward.' From losing it the way I did, maybe
people will understand that _ as I said, and I'll say it again _ at
the end of the day, it's only a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice, he'd rather have shot something better than a
triple-bogey 8 on the par-5 18th at Carnoustie. But also given a
choice, he'd again take his driver out of the bag to attack that
hole. ``I made a choice, and I'll take full responsibility for
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some have even criticized his caddie for not insisting he use a
``safe'' iron off the tee and geriatrically plod his way to a 6 or
7. ``I don't think he (i.e. the caddie) could have stepped in my
way, saying, `You're going to hit a 9-iron off the tee or a
5-iron,' because I would have felt even worse missing the fairway
with a 5-iron,'' shrugs Van De Velde.
</P>
<P>
   He had two choices in the wake of that disaster on the 18th at
Carnoustie. He could either dwell on the 72d hole, or he could
reflect on the first 71. He has never even considered adopting the
first option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens again,'' he says, ``then we'll see, we'll see
what I do. But I don't feel bad. I give 100 percent, and I walked
out of there with my head and my chin pretty straight. And that's
all I could do. Fair enough, it wasn't enough that time. But if I
ever arrive three shots ahead in the majors _ I guess if that
happened about 10 times, I might make one.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone is going to lose a major by squandering a three-shot
lead on the 72d hole, then let it be someone with a firm sense of
self and a clear grip on life. Central Casting could not have
served up someone better equipped to be known forevermore as The
Man Who Blew The British Open than Jean Van de Velde. He is a
professional golfer, but he's well aware that it's still, you know,
golf.
</P>
<P>
   So what does matter to Jean Van de Velde?
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is a big deal in my life,'' he says. ``Health is a
big deal in my life. And having people feeling good around me is a
big deal in my life. And the rest is, you know, a bonus, I would
say.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be a stretch to say he is carefree, but he is certainly
unflappable. Imagine, for example, if a typically pampered,
high-strung American tour player traveled 4,000 miles for a
European event, only to discover that his golf clubs had been left
behind. There would be tantrums registering 7.3 on the Richter.
</P>
<P>
   When Jean Van de Velde landed at O'Hare on Monday, he found out
that his clubs were still in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess someone didn't wake up early enough in Paris and
didn't put the clubs on the plane,'' he says. ``But at the same
time it was a good excuse for me to discover the city, so I took
the morning off yesterday morning and went around.''
</P>
<P>
   One fortunate thing about what happened to Jean Van de Velde is
that he is both French and a golfer. This is something like being
both American and a world-class badminton player. In other words,
he was not skewered at home the way he would have been were he
something the French deem really important, such as a cyclist or a
football (soccer) player.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in France have a good opinion of him,'' reports
Christophe Couvert, the resident golf and tennis writer for the
noted sports daily L'Equipe. ``Two million people did watch him on
that Sunday afternoon, and those 71 holes in which he was leading
were really good for French golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand where golf ranks in the French sport pecking order.
``There were journalists on my own paper who had never heard of him
before the British Open,'' points out Christophe.
</P>
<P>
   They know who he is now, and so do many millions of
international sports enthusiasts who were unaware of his existence
on this earth prior to the British Open. In his 11 years on the
European Tour, he has had one victory, at the 1993 Roma Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe believes Van de Velde may have been wounded a bit
more by the Carnoustie collapse than he is letting on. ``In his
interior, his heart,'' suggests the man from L'Equipe, ``he knows
the British Open was an incredible chance for him. He is in his own
bubble. He can't show it, but he may have been a little scarred
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Van de Velde is a phenomenal actor. He has
prepared himself to answer questions about that fateful Sunday
afternoon in Scotland in perpetuity, and he believes he can handle
it. ``It happened,'' he says, ``and it happened in front of 250
million people. . . . I've got to handle it as well as I can. So
maybe if one day I'm in a bad mood I might answer it a bit
differently. But what can I say to people who say, `You should have
done this; you should have done that'? Maybe I will answer them,
`Well, I haven't seen you on the tee of the 72d hole three shots
ahead. So if you ever get that chance, I'm going to give you a
quarter, and you give me a phone call.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Joking aside, he wants to be known as a serious player, and
that, he says, is the lesson of Carnoustie. ``I know I can contend
because I've done it once,'' he reminds us. ``So why couldn't I do
it twice?''
</P>
<P>
   And if on Sunday he leads the PGA and again loses on the 72
hole?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a game,'' says Jean Van de Velde. ``That's the part
you have to understand and remember.''
</P>

MORE OPPORTUNITIES ON MOREY'S MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ They grew up in different worlds, but in many
ways Larry Whigham and Sean Morey are very much alike.
</P>
<P>
   Whigham is from the deep south of Hattiesburg, Miss., and
attended Northeast Louisiana State, first signed by the Seattle
Seahawks as a rookie free agent in 1994, while Morey, a
seventh-round pick who is a native of Marshfield, graduated from
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they speak the same language on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Whigham, an All-Pro and highly respected around the league for
his special teams skills, gives young players like Morey the same
lecture every training camp. Some get it, but most don't. Whigham,
the Patriots' special teams captain, repeats the message during the
season just to make sure his charges understand their place and
what it takes to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   So when Whigham witnessed an exchange of fisticuffs between
Morey and third-round pick Tony George at Wednesday morning's
practice, he liked it.
</P>
<P>
   He liked that Morey sacrificed his body to throw a crack block
on George during coverage. He liked Morey's fight and spirit,
showing the same adrenaline Whigham has been noted for.
</P>
<P>
   But Whigham didn't like that Morey, a nice kid, wanted to make
sure George wasn't too mad at him. Morey and George exchanged words
after their punches, and Morey kept trying to talk to George to
give him an indication he was just trying to do his job.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Whigham stepped in front of Morey and told him to
stop apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him, `Don't worry about it. This is football. Let
him get mad, so what? I don't care if you've upset someone. He's a
big boy, he'll get over it. Don't take pity on someone just because
you went out there and did what you had to do.' I told him he was
going about it wrong. Don't apologize for playing the game hard,''
Whigham said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred after Morey had made a superb catch while
being defended by Jayson Bray.
</P>
<P>
   It's been hard not to notice Morey since his arrival at camp.
You can't help but be aware of his ability to hold onto the ball
and how he dives for balls even if they're a bit out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, the coaching staff is noticing him,'' said Whigham.
``You can't help but notice him. He plays the game hard. Like I
tell these guys, if after practice you can show up in the lunch
room and eat all of your lunch, that should show you that you
haven't given it your best that day. If you come to lunch and you
don't feel like eating and you don't feel good, that's when you
know you've given it everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about Sean is that he's a pesky son of a gun.
He doesn't give 100 percent like everyone else, he gives 110
percent. If he doesn't make it here, he's going to make it
someplace because he wants it. That's the type of attitude I
approach the game with. In most cases, you have one chance in life
to make it in this game, so if you have one chance to do something
you want to do more than anything, why wouldn't you play the game
like Morey does?''
</P>
<P>
   Morey understands hard work. His father, Dennis, gave up a
chance to be a big-time college player, joining the military
instead, and later became a fisherman. Morey is simply doing what
his father probably wanted to do but never got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bob Bancroft, the successful football coach at
Whitman-Hanson Regional High School, the elder Morey was ``one of
the best receivers I ever saw.'' And now the younger Morey appears
to be following in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   On a team which has what position coach Ivan Fears called ``the
best receiving corps I've ever coached,'' Morey is trying to break
in. Chances are, barring injury to Terry Glenn, Shawn Jefferson,
Troy Brown, Vincent Brisby, and Tony Simmons, Morey will have to
make the Patriots as a member of the special teams. He has kickoff
return ability, but he's been noticed mostly for his cover skills.
For much of camp, he's been on the first kickoff cover team, but in
Friday's exhibition opener against the Washington Redskins he'll
play on the second team and likely play most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   For a kid who grew up watching and idolizing the Patriots, it
will be an emotional night that Morey has gone over in his head
ever since he can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game of adrenaline, but I know I have to keep calm
and collected when I step on the field at Foxboro (Friday) night,''
Morey said. ``It's going to be hard not to notice what's going on,
but I have to stay focused. This is what I've dreamed of all my
life. I remember going to games there as a kid and watching certain
receivers and now I'll be on that field playing for the Patriots. I
have to contain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His family and friends will be there. It's only an exhibition
game, but it's a real, live NFL game. If he's been noticed in camp,
he knows he needs to be noticed in this game. When the coaches
review the film, Morey needs to stand out as much, if not more,
than he has the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's caught the coaches' eyes, he must make sure they
never look away. His battles with George will have to turn into
battles with Washington's special teams and he will need to make
something happen on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just tried to come in and work hard every day of camp,''
said Morey. ``This is a tough position to break into. I have to
show I can contribute in different aspects of the game for this
football team. I've tried to absorb as much information as possible
from the coaches and the veteran players. They've all been good to
me. I get along well with all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of his fight with George, which was the second such
scuffle of training camp, ``We're just trying to compete. We're all
on the same team. When things get competitive, sometimes things can
get emotional in the heat of the battle. Tony's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Morey appears to be doing a good job of transforming himself
from Ivy League star to pro football player. He was the only Brown
player ever to have his number (24) retired and the first player
from Brown to win the Asa S. Bushnell Cup as Ivy Player of the
Year. He owns five Ivy and eight Brown receiving records, last year
catching 83 passes for 1,023 yards and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll, Fears, and the veteran receivers all have
spoken highly of Morey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Steve Tasker (the former Buffalo Bills
special teams All-Pro who was also a receiver). He competes all the
time,'' said Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   He actually reminds Whigham of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Two players from different worlds who speak the same language.

   Consider a leak. If it's a plumbing leak, most of us would whine
for a plumber. Others would take it in stride and fix the leak in a
jiffy.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing applies to a roof leak, or a leak in a bathroom
caused by an overflowing shower or other source. Some would avoid
these like the plague, others would jump right in.
</P>
<P>
   So it happened that a caller rang up the handyman with this
probem: In her newly-purchased house, the inspector pointed out
that several tiled walls in the bathroom bowed in when pushed,
indicating that water had decayed the plasterboard behind the tile,
and should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The leak, from splashing shower water or from plumbing, had been
fixed, so the caller asked if she could fix the wall herself, and
if so how. And would she have to replace the tub? Good question:
Ceramic tile can be an intimidating mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Good news on two fronts, the handyman replied. Yes, you can do
it yourself, and no, you do not have to remove the tub. The only
caveat the handyman had is this: If you had to ask the question,
doing it yourself is going to be real challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But it is definitely possible, and since the caller has just
bought the house, she hardly has a choice, moneywise.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard work, just fussy. First, the demoliton: Scrape
off any loose tiles; they will readily come off that decayed
plasterboard. Set them aside for later use.
</P>
<P>
   Then rip out all that rotten plasterboard; cut off as much as is
decayed, making sure anything left is dry, sound, and intact.
Remove all nails or screws.
</P>
<P>
   If the wall cavity is wet, it must be dried out before
proceeding. Put a fan on it if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is dry, fill the cavity with fiberglass insulation,
whether the wall is exterior or interior. The insulation will not
only help the house hold heat but will also help reduce the
transmission of sound.
</P>
<P>
   Now to put up the new wall: Use WonderBoard, Durock, or other
brand-name concrete board. Yes, the half-inch-thick boards are
indeed concrete, reinforced with fiberglass rather than gravel.
</P>
<P>
   The boards are just 3 by 5 feet, which is a good size because
the board is heavy. The boards can be cut to size by scoring and
snapping, and can be nailed with roofing nails or screwed onto the
studs.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists recommend applying nylon nesh tape to joints
and filling them with compound. This is not necessary if you do not
line up the tile edges with joints in the concrete board. Be sure
to keep a 1/8-inch gap between concrete boards.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to remove the tub because the old plasterboard _
and the new concrete board _ is placed above and around the tub,
not behind it. If by chance some old plasterboard is behind the
tub, leave it alone and work the concrete board around it. If that
old plasterboard is wet, let it dry out before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   You could use Greenboard in place of the concrete board;
Greenboard is a water- resistant plasterboard, but it is not
water(itals)proof(unitals), as the concrete board is.
</P>
<P>
   Put on the tiles. Set them with thin-set mortar or tile
adhesive. Both are good, but thin-set is better in the long run.
Whatever you use, you may have to hold each tile in place for a few
minutes so it will stop sagging. Set tiles 1/8 inch apart. Wait a
day, then fill the joints with a sandless grout.
</P>
<P>
   If the water damage was caused by leaking between tub and tile,
then the new concrete board and tile may have fixed it.
</P>
<P>
   If the new wall area is extensive, you may be best off buying
new tiles; you can improve the bathroom's looks to boot.
</P>
<P>
   If it is a small area, you can reuse the old tile. Scrape off
any grout and adhesive with a utility knife and a chisel.
</P>
<P>
   See, that was not so bad, was it?

MAGGERT IN RYDER UNLESS HE FALLS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Jeff Maggert has been here before. Well, sort
of.
</P>
<P>
   The ``here'' is not Medinah Country Club, where the 81st PGA
Championship will commence this morning. The ``here'' is the
tournament-within-a-tournament, the final push for Ryder Cup
points. Excuse Maggert if he feels as though he's at Riviera or
Winged Foot, because the steady but unheralded Texan faces the same
challenge he did at those PGA Championships in 1995 and 1997,
respectively _ play well and make the team.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt as to what he plans on doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the Ryder Cup,'' said Maggert. ``I want to
be on the team. But in a lot of ways, it's out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Maggert is 10th in the US standings, so if he were
to play well at Medinah, he would most likely remain one of the
automatic picks. So in that respect, he has control of his fate.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to recent pushes to make the Ryder Cup team,
no one has controlled matters better than the 35-year-old Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   At Riviera four years ago, he was on the outside looking in,
ranked 12th, when he posted scores of 66-69-65-69 to finish third
in the event and soar into the Top 10 and earn an automatic berth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at Winged Foot in 1997, Maggert's 65 in the closing round
pushed him to third in the championship, again sealing an automatic
berth. He had entered that tournament 11th in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there is a slight twist to the scenario at Medinah _
``this year I have to worry about staying in instead of bouncing
someone out,'' he said _ there is still the pressure to play well,
for he has a slim lead over those at Nos. 11-13 (Tom Lehman, Steve
Stricker, John Huston) and if he were to falter, Maggert could find
himself waiting for Ben Crenshaw to offer one of two captain's
picks.
</P>
<P>
   Though if it came to that, Maggert feels worthy. ``I think I'd
be a good pick. I'm certain that my style of game would be good for
The Country Club. I feel good about me playing there and being able
to really help the team out.''
</P>
<P>
   But, cautions Maggert, ``I would say that Lehman is an obvious
pick before me. To me, he's a lock to make this team, regardless of
what he does this week.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the tournament-within-a-tournament doesn't include
Lehman, but it does many others. Maggert openly talks about it,
whereas some of his colleagues shy away from the topic. Worrying
about making the Ryder Cup team, for those who are close enough to
ponder such matters, can overshadow the fact that the PGA is still
a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it crosses my mind,'' said Robert Karlsson, who is
ninth on the European standings. ``But when I'm on the golf course
I can only think about my job. If I'm trying to play good to make
the Ryder Cup, I'm not going to play very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon had nothing on his mind but making the Ryder Cup team
in 1995. ``Absolutely. I knew it was my last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon entered the PGA Championship at Riviera tied for 14th in
the standings. Through 54 holes he was lingering in 21st place,
certainly out of contention. Well, not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit driver, 5-iron to 15 feet and made an eagle at the first
hole,'' said Faxon. A great start to arguably the most memorable
round of golf he has ever played. He shot a course-record 63,
rocketed into a tie for fifth place, and got into the Top 10 in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   It could take such theatrics by Maggert, who probably is the
most unheralded player in the Ryder Cup picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised, really, that I'm still in the Top 10,'' said
Maggert. ``I haven't had a Top 10 since the US Open (nearly two
months ago).'' Plus, he said, ``Tom (Lehman) had a bad break there
last Sunday (he faltered down the stretch and squandered a
four-shot lead in the Buick Open) or I could easily be 11th.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would be more like it for Maggert, whose PGA Tour career
has always been prefaced with the notation that he had one career
victory. That is, until he hit the jackpot at the World Golf
Championships Match Play event in February. With the world braced
for a Tiger Woods-David Duval showdown, Maggert earned the $1
million top prize.
</P>
<P>
   But that spotlight died quickly and Maggert has again slipped
into the shadows. The PGA of America even has a breakdown, which
shows how those outside the Top 10 could pass Maggert. All
predicated, of course, on Maggert not scoring a high finish at
Medinah. He laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't the match play champion be a nice fit in an event that
is strictly match play? Maggert laughed again. ``Yeah, and I feel
like my Ryder Cup record is pretty strong (4-3-0). If I play on the
Ryder Cup team I know I'm going to be able to help the team out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his plan this week? Play well, and aim high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're playing well enough to finish seventh or eighth,
then you probably ought to be thinking about winning.''
</P>

LINUX: FROM CURIOSITY TO INVADER OF MICROSOFT'S DOMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linus Torvalds strides to the podium, his benign gaze untroubled
by dozens of flashing camera strobes. He's late to the press
conference. He had to take his kids to see the penguins, symbols of
the software that made Torvalds famous.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds is the Godfather of Code, the man from Finland who led
the way in developing Linux, the operating system that bears his
name. With the Linux penguin logo popping up all over the Internet,
and major computer firms investing millions in Linux, Torvalds is
everybody's favorite software wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the LinuxWorld show floor, Jordan Hubbard sits at
a booth populated by CD-ROM disks, books and stuffed toys shaped
like happy devils, but not too many reporters. There are a fair
number of visitors to the show who recognize the cheerful demon
logo and what it stands for. Hubbard's company, FreeBSD Inc., has a
strong reputation among people in the know. Still, most of the
glory and glamor of LinuxWorld pass him by.
</P>
<P>
   Without bitterness, Hubbard concedes the obvious. ``We lost the
PR war.''
</P>
<P>
   You might call FreeBSD the other Linux. Like Linux, FreeBSD is
an operating system modeled after Unix, the powerful, sophisticated
system developed by AT&AMP;T Corp. in the 1970s. As the name implies,
FreeBSD can be gotten for free, by download over the Internet, just
like Linux. And as with Linux, the ``source code,'' the actual
instructions written by programmers, is available, so people can
modify the software as they see fit. Major Internet services like
Yahoo run their network on FreeBSD. So does the FAST search engine
in Waltham, the world's biggest with 200 million Web pages indexed.
</P>
<P>
   BSD stands for Berkeley System Distribution, a version of Unix
developed at the University of California at Berkeley, and based on
Unix. In 1991, some of the Berkeley developers decided to sell a
version of their product that would run on desktop computers. They
started a firm called BSDI and acquired a toll-free phone number _
1-800-ITS-UNIX. ``That really set AT&AMP;T's shorts on fire,'' says
Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T sued; development of BSD languished. In the midst of it
all, Hubbard and some others began work on a version of BSD that
would be given away, source code and all, to anybody who wanted it.
FreeBSD first appeared in late 1993, about the same time Linux was
getting off the ground. But there was no hint of legal trouble in
the Linux camp, while programmers around the world hesitated to
embrace an open-software project that might be sued out of
existence. Even after the case was settled in 1994, FreeBSD
couldn't regain the lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   There was another, subtler problem that grew out of the
worldview of the BSDers. They were hypersmart technology titans
based at one of the world's great universities. They knew they
could write code better than some ragtag band of volunteers
scattered about the planet. And so the FreeBSD people froze out
most contributions from interested outsiders. ``We were the
snobs,'' Hubbard says. ``We were the ones that didn't let just
anyone come in and hack to their hearts' content.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard insists that the result is cleaner, tighter code. He may
even be right, as if it matters. Eric Raymond, a patron saint of
the open software movement, says that the Linux development model
created a worldwide legion of users and fans. It may be a sloppy
way to build an operating system, but it guaranteed a ready market
for the finished product. By isolating itself from this community
of coders, FreeBSD gravely damaged itself. ``The BSD people had a
lot of advantages,'' Raymond said, but ``they got one thing wrong
that completely overcame all their advantages. They got their
sociology wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Future historians may forget that Torvalds wrote part of Linux.
Instead, they'll recall that he coordinated the work of an
international community of part-time programmers, transforming
their efforts into a product that, for all its residual crudity, is
a marvel of power and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hubbard says times are good for FreeBSD. The success
of Linux is attracting a steady flow of new users. Hubbard says
FreeBSD is content to be a follower, while Linux breaks the trail
for free software. ``We're letting them walk through eight feet of
snow first,'' Hubbard says. Penguins, it seems, are better at that
sort of thing than demons.

THE TRICKS OF A COMPUTER SLEUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer forensics is a relatively new and little-known branch
of computer security. Like other kinds of forensics, computer
forensics are a set of techniques for collecting and explaining
evidence _ especially evidence that might be gathered during a
criminal investigation. What makes it different is that instead of
examining fingerprints or DNA, a computer forensics specialist
focuses on data left inside a computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The inside of a computer, it turns out, is a surprisingly
difficult place from which to collect evidence. One reason is that
computers have a lot of places where evidence can hide. My desktop
machine has 128 megabytes of RAM and more than 20 gigabytes of hard
disk space, roughly the equivalent 3.5 million pages of typewritten
text. In this much space it can take a trained investigator days or
even weeks to search it effectively.
</P>
<P>
   A second issue complicating the task: It is easy to damage or
destroy evidence in the process of looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the problem of willful destruction: to keep
themselves from getting caught, many computer criminals will delete
files, modify programs, and otherwise alter a computer system after
they have broken into it. To be successful, a computer forensics
specialist needs to be able to step around this damage and still
find what he or she is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a pair of flamboyant computer security experts, Dan
Farmer and Wietse Venema, taught a one-day course on computer
forensics at IBM's Yorktown Heights' research laboratory. Called
``Murder on the Internet Express,'' the course discussed techniques
for analyzing a computer system to find telltale signs left behind
by someone using a computer. They discussed common tactics computer
criminals use to destroy evidence, and why these approaches
frequently fail. And finally, the pair previewed some new forensics
tools they plan to release Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There are three primary ways in which computer users leave
tracks in a computer systems. The first kinds of tracks are in the
log files _ records most computers keep that detail the machine's
activities. Log files are most common when you use services on the
Internet. When you call up the Internet from a home PC, a record of
your phone call is kept in a log file. Likewise, whenever you send
electronic mail or view a Web page, that information is also
recorded. If an investigator can get access to the log files, they
can be used to paint a comprehensive picture of what the person has
been doing on line.
</P>
<P>
   A second way is to look at files on the computer itself. Both
the UNIX and the Windows operating systems keep very detailed
records of when each file was created, last modified, and last
read. By examining these times for every file on the computer, an
investigator can create a very detailed picture of what a person
did.
</P>
<P>
   A third way is to bypass the computer's files entirely, and
instead just examine the hard drive. That's because information
written to the hard disk stays there until it is overwritten.
Because computer users almost never fill their hard drives all the
way, it's common to find information on the disk that was deleted
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main uses of computer forensics is figuring out what
has happened after someone has broken into a computer system. With
good tools, an analyst can determine when the break-in happened,
how the intruder obtained access, and which files were examined or
modified. Forensics tools can also be used to inspect the system to
see whether any traps were left behind. For example, the attacker
might have left a ``tripwire'' or ``timebomb'' that would
automatically wipe out the system. Alternatively, the attacker
might have created a ``back door'' so he or she could gain covert
access at a later time.
</P>
<P>
   Forensics also can be used by police to analyze computers seized
during a criminal investigation. Earlier this summer I learned that
the FBI has been using disk recovery tools such as Power Quest's
Lost and Found to assist in child pornography investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In one case they were able to see how a suspect had installed a
copy of America Online, downloaded some questionable images, and
then apparently deleted both the images and the AOL program. A few
months later, he allegedly did the same thing again _ installing
AOL, downloading images, and deleting it all again. Lost and Found
let the investigators almost literally look into the past, because
parts of the AOL program and the downloaded images were still on
the suspect's hard disk, even though they had been technically
``deleted.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs like Lost and Found and Norton Utilities, which combine
forensics with data recovery, have been available for the Windows
platform for years. The big news at IBM last week was that Farmer
and Venema are releasing a series of forensics programs for the
UNIX and Linux operating systems. Called ``The Coroner's Toolkit,''
the tools make it much easier to conduct a detailed examination of
a UNIX system. That's important, since UNIX is the dominant
operating system among Internet servers and, thanks to Linux, is
becoming more common on desktop machines as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computer forensics tools can also be used to spy on
employees and other legitimate computer users. Indeed, says Farmer,
``Spying and abuse are now easier than ever. It is pretty trivial
to find out what people using computers are up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are strong words, especially considering their source.
Three years ago Farmer and Venema released a security auditing
program called ``SATAN'' on the Internet, to the dismay of many
computer specialists. SATAN generated hostile responses because it
could be used by system administrators to secure computers and by
attackers to break into systems. It remains to be seen whether or
not The Coroner's Toolkit will generate a similar response.

 Pregnancy test accuracy hinges on a longer wait
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world, doctors would have tests to determine in the
first trimester of pregnancy the likelihood that a fetus has Down
syndrome. And they would be so accurate that there would be little
risk of missing any cases or alarming patients unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the blood and ultrasound tests available now work
fairly well, but about 5 percent of the time they indicate a
problem when there is none. These ``false positives'' often cause
patients to have more invasive testing, which can cause
miscarriage: chorionic villus sampling (at 11 to 12 weeks of
pregnancy) or amniocentesis (at 15 to 17 weeks).
</P>
<P>
   To see whether there might be a better approach, British
researchers writing in the current New England Journal of Medicine
looked at data from several other studies and concluded that by
combining blood tests from the first and second trimesters with
ultrasound testing in the first trimester, they could detect just
as many cases of Down syndrome as first or second trimester testing
alone but with far fewer false positives, or about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This method, however, is troubling to some. It would mean
waiting until the second trimester to inform patients of the
results even though possible problems might be apparent during
first-trimester testing, said Dr. Joshua A. Copel, a Yale
University obstetrician-gynecologist who co-authored an editorial
in the New England Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Withholding that information from patients would be unethical
for American doctors, he said, and would make a subsequent decision
to terminate the pregnancy more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Allergy shots may be nothing to sneeze at
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many of America's 40 million hay fever _ or allergic
rhinitis _ sufferers, over-the-counter or prescription
decongestants, antihistamines, and nasal sprays often help.
</P>
<P>
   But for those with severe allergies, these drugs often don't do
enough. Decades ago, doctors used a series of injections to treat
such patients, but in recent years this method has fallen into
disuse because the simpler medications have become so popular.
</P>
<P>
   British and Canadian researchers writing in the New England
Journal say they have new support for so-called allergy shots, at
least for grass pollen allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Even three to four years after the shots have been discontinued,
they found, protection against allergy symptoms remains. The shots,
which contain solutions made from tiny bits of grass pollen, are
usually taken about once a month for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The injections have many advantages, commented Dr. Ira Finegold,
chief of allergy at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New
York. When people are allergic to pollen, he noted, their immune
systems typically make too much of an antibody called IgE.
</P>
<P>
   When they get allergy shots, the immune system produces a
different antibody, IgG, which does not cause symptoms such as
stuffy nose or itchy eyes. After immunization, IgG antibodies
attack pollen, keeping the irksome IgE reaction at bay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, Dr. N. Franklin Adkinson Jr. of Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine added that the allergy shots, though rarely
curative, are safe and can provide ``substantial relief.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Accreditor of hospitals plans surprise visits
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 1, hospitals throughout the country for the first
time will be subject to truly unannounced, random inspections by
the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations, the group that accredits hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 80 percent of the nation's hospitals seek voluntary
accreditation, or re-accreditation, every three years from the
commission, which tells hospitals of these visits well in advance.
The commmission also traditionally has made random visits in the
interim of the three years, but has given hospitals 24 hours'
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the commission will not give advance notice of random
visits. It will also try surprise visits any time of the day or
week, not just weekdays during working hours, as is done now. The
idea behind the changes, approved last week by the board of
commissioners, is to make the accreditation process ``more
meaningful and credible.''

NEW EVIDENCE REQUIRES A RETHINKING OF ATTITUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had an experience I suspect is not that unusual.
</P>
<P>
   I visited some folks who've made very different life choices
than I have and came home feeling uneasy and upset, as if somehow
I'd made a mistake in not being more like them.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't happen to me often. Like most people, I've chosen
friends who support my philosophy of life. For the most part, we
share a political point of view, read similar publications, deplore
the same cultural excesses, and try to live by the same values. I'm
sure the reason I find these folks so admirable, engaging, amusing,
and agreeable is because . . . they're so much like me.
</P>
<P>
   Confess it. You do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   When we say someone drinks too much or cares too little, what we
mean is more or less than we do. How else are we to figure out
where we stand except by comparison? We judge a person to be
successful, or popular, or affluent. Compared to whom? Us, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to maintain the illusion that our yardstick is the best
measure of all things, we seek the reassurance of other people. We
go to church, or listen to Dr. Laura, or read the Globe for
validation. Without a comfort zone, where our virtues are mirrored
in the lives of others, we'd be constantly knocked off kilter by
the power of contrary value systems.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, when I encounter people who challenge my
beliefs, I suffer disturbing moments of vertigo. I think I know
exactly how the world works until I venture into territory where my
rules no longer seem to apply. (itals)Let's see. I know that money
can't buy happiness. How is it these folks find their expensive
possessions so fulfilling? Or: I don't believe full-time day care
is an adequate substitute for parental attention. How come these
children turned out to be so terrific? Or: Having babies out of
wedlock is always a mistake. How can this mother and child be so
happy?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   I hate it when the world refuses to conform to my
preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to notice exactly where I'm most vulnerable.
It's one thing to stop and think when reality doesn't conform to
your idea of it; it's another to have a different way of being
threaten your sense of who you are. When such an encounter leaves
you vaguely uneasy, as if something you thought was settled no
longer computes, you can either brush that feeling aside or take a
closer look at it.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy to face up to the mind games we play to keep
ourselves comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, the children of Russian immigrants, considered
themselves inferior to people who had more money than they did. As
a result, I came to feel that owning expensive things was an act of
hostility, a way to make others feel bad. I made my peace with
everyone in the world who was richer than we were by feeling sorry
for them. Up there, where the prices were so high and the genuine
pleasures so few, it seemed fitting that marriages fell apart and
kids overdosed. Like everyone else, I scan the tabloid headlines at
the grocery store, shoring up my convictions about the miseries of
the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I don't look at. When I married a doctor, I became
one of those people I had been taught to resent. I changed my
circumstance, but I didn't change my attitude. I adapted it.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, I shop at Building 19 7/8. The folks I visited
take genuine pleasure in having a sculptor design a fountain for
their garden. I rarely buy anything retail. These folks bring back
magnificent treasures from their travels around the world because
they appreciate beautiful things. I'm frugal. They spend money
lavishly, without any guilt at all. Worst of all, they're very
nice, quite kind, and at least as concerned as I am with the
well-being of those less fortunate than themselves. Considering
that I've been plagued with headaches all summer, they're probably
happier than I am.
</P>
<P>
   Aaaaaaaaggh!
</P>
<P>
   The evidence seems to indicate that the way a person spends
money has nothing to do with character, or worthiness, or
happiness. Darn it, it looks like I have to change the story I made
up in the first place. It's also not too late to change my choices,
I suppose. Am I an idiot to have deprived myself all these years
for nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I have a friend like Kathleen, who can ground me again
with just a few comforting words: ``When I feel like I haven't done
it right, I just remember that life has no finish lines.''

`BROKEDOWN PALACE' A HARROWING TALE OF PERSECUTION, IMPRISONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a film that's more than two years old (its ``working title''
back in 1997 was ``Two Girls''), has endured re-editing, a new,
more commercial soundtrack and a director who threatened to take
his name off the project, ``Brokedown Palace'' is a pretty good
movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's graced with fine performances from Claire Danes and Kate
Beckinsale (``Last Days Of Disco'') and, despite similarities to
the recent ``Return To Paradise'' and, obliquely, Alan Parker's
1978 film, ``Midnight Express,'' it stands on its own as a
harrowing tale of persecution and imprisonment in another country.
</P>
<P>
   This time around the Americans in peril are two life-long best
friends, Alice (Danes) and Darlene (Beckinsale), who decide to pull
a fast one on their folks when they sneakily switch their high
school graduation present tickets to Hawaii for a more thrilling,
11-day adventure in Thailand. The girls wind up in a seedy,
hostel-type hotel and Alice, who is much more daring and outspoken,
challenges convention by suggesting they go swimming at a 4-star
luxury hotel by passing themselves off as registered guests.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they're caught but suddenly rescued by a handsome
young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine) who proceeds to
wine and dine the pair and even seduce Darlene in the process. He
tells them that he must go to Hong Kong for the weekend and invites
them to meet him there, providing tickets for the obviously
tight-budgeted duo.
</P>
<P>
   But they're busted at the airport when officials find two kilos
of heroin in Alice's backpack and consequently are sentenced to 33
years in a Thai correctional facility. The pair plead innocence and
Alice sends a tape of their plight to an expatriot Yank named Hank
(Bill Pullman) and his lawyer wife, who take them on as clients and
also discover some huge discrepancies in the case. Ultimately Hank
comes to see that the girls are being used as examples and
scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is hastily presented so the film can devote its
running time telling a story of loyalty, friendship and courage in
the face of adversity. It's also a quest for freedom. ``Thailand
means freedom,'' says Alice at one point. But ``freedom is an
illusion'' for these two naive Americans who still believe by
virtue of birthright that they will automatically be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Danes is gutsy and daring in a role that allows her some growth
as an actor after a string of flops like ``The Mod Squad.'' It's
nice to see her stretch her muscles and she reminds us here why she
is regarded as one of the better up-and-coming young performers.
Beckinsale is equally as good in a more passive role. She manages
to make quite a lot out of what might be termed a ``sidekick''
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace'' does have some plot implausibilities but
Kaplan, who is generally known as a reliable director of
socially-conscious movies such as ``The Accused'' and ``Love
Field,'' manages to turn some hashed storylines into something
substantial and even emotionally affecting by the time the film
reaches its surprising conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Brokedown Palace. Directed by Jonathan Kaplan. Written by David
Arata. Cast: Claire Danes, Kate Beckinsale, Bill Pullman, Daniel
Lapaine. Fox 2000.

`BOWFINGER' IS ONE TERRIFIC COMEDY THAT NEVER LETS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If memory serves me correctly, an episode of the classic '50s
television series, ``Sgt. Bilko,'' had Bilko and his gang following
around a big Hollywood star with a candid camera and making a movie
starring the star without the star knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm right, then Steve Martin certainly seems to have absorbed
the spirit of his 1996 TV-to-big screen ``Sgt. Bilko'' remake,
because his new film, ``Bowfinger'' (which he also wrote), operates
on this very same premise.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever he got the idea, he's done the most with it. This
is one terrific comedy that doesn't let up for an instant, that
gets ever more delightfully absurd as it goes along, and ends up
giving Eddie Murphy one of his career-best star vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger, an Ed Wood-style, low-low-budget
Hollywood film producer-director who hangs out in a crumbling
stucco bungalow he grandly calls ``Bowfinger International
Pictures,'' and has been kicking around the business for decades
without the slightest impact.
</P>
<P>
   One day, an Arab emigrant appears on his doorstep with a dream
script called ``Chubby Rain'' _ about aliens attacking the earth in
oversized rain drops _ and he sees his chance at the big time. But
no studio will go for his producing it, unless he can attach a
major star to the property.
</P>
<P>
   And when Hollywood's biggest action star, Kit Ramsey (Murphy),
refuses to even talk to him, Bowfinger gathers up a cast and crew
and begins to secretly follow the star around, interrupting his
life with contrived scenes from ``Chubby Rain,'' and shooting his
reactions with a concealed camera.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the film's publicity paints it as a devilish satire of
Hollywood. But though it takes swipes at the stupidity of action
films, the ageism of the industry, and even the power of
Scientology in Hollywood, it's much too broad and farcical to be a
true satire. It's more ``Bilko'' than ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a total hoot. Martin and director Frank Oz (who also
collaborated on the underrated 1992 comedy, ``Housesitter'') click
with the material at once, and trust it enough not to junk up the
script with the kind of sitcom schtick and bathroom humor that seem
de rigueur in the Hollywood summer of '99. In this sense, it's a
surprisingly sophisticated comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It's also that rare comedy in which every single cast member
shines: not just Martin but Heather Graham, as the ingenue just off
the bus from Ohio and rapidly sleeping her way to the top;
Christine Baranski, as ``Chubby Rain's'' haughty Norma Desmond of a
leading lady; and Jamie Kennedy, Adam Alexi-Malle and Kohl Sudduth
as various eccentric cast and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   And especially Eddie Murphy, who plays two roles: the unknowing
star and a nerdy lookalike hired to be his double. Murphy actually
takes some big risks here: kidding his own legendary paranoia,
evoking his real-life sex scandal and allowing himself to be the
butt of Martin's extended gag. But the risk definitely pays off.
He's never been funnier or more completely likable as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Bowfinger. Directed by Frank Oz. Written by Steve Martin. Cast:
Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Jamie Kennedy, Robert
Downey Jr., Christine Baranski. Universal. 97 minutes. Rated PG-13

SOME FEAR TRADE-OFF AS EXCHANGES CONSIDER CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock markets are like cars. Millions of people rely on them in
everyday life but scant few really know how they work. Turn the
key, place the order and off you go.
</P>
<P>
   But the mechanisms behind stock trading, on conventional
exchanges and elsewhere, are in the process of radical change that
would turn an automobile on its bumpers. How safe will the new
vehicles be?
</P>
<P>
   As usual, technology and competition are behind the change.
Efficiency and convenience are the stated goals but there are more
questions: Who really benefits most, and is there a hidden risk in
Internet-speed progress?
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market are both
talking about extended trading hours in the evening, though both
exchanges have become increasingly vague about timetables. The
exchanges have also mulled the possibility of launching initial
public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   They are reacting to serious challenges to a business they have
owned for themselves. Electronic Communication Networks, or ECNs,
are cropping up left and right to take as much as 30 percent of
trading activity away from their marketplace. Worse, the exchanges
now compete against many of the same brokerages that are their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs are computer networks matching limit orders that specify
prices. If a seller posts a price that meets a buyer's posted
offer, the two are matched by computer in the blink of an eye and
the trade is executed.
</P>
<P>
   But no trades take place on a network if buyers and sellers
don't match up on price and number of shares to be traded. Stock
markets operate with middle men, specialists or market makers, who
step in when trading becomes stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of brokerages, among other parties, are banding together
to form their own ECNs that can be used to match the sizable number
of orders generated by their own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fidelity's giant brokerage business teamed up with
competitor Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and two other financial firms to
form their own network. Together, Fidelity and Schwab generate huge
trading volume that will be, at least in part, sent to their new
network.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine ECNs on the map already and you can count on more
in the future. It is an odd development in a business that just a
few years ago looked at the handful regional stock exchanges across
the country and insisted that consolidation was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers want to send trading volume to their own networks
because transactions can be cheaper and the networks themselves can
be quite profitable if they generate enough volume. The networks
also create the opportunity for around-the-clock trading, or at
least evening business hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upward of 80 percent of our (customers') trades are now done
via the Internet,'' said Robert P. Mazzarella, president of
Fidelity Brokerage Services Inc. ``People are going to look to
execute whenever they want to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. last week announced the creation of a new
After Hours Center that would offer access to evening stock trading
through on-line investment bank Wit Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Individual stock traders are only getting a taste of the network
access that has been reserved for big institutional customers.
Relative old-timer Instinet has been offering big customers access
to markets around the globe and to US stock trading after hours for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But extended trading hours and the prospect of a dozen or more
groups of electronic networks matching orders may create problems.
Chief among them: liquidity, the easy opporunity to get in or out
of stock at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of buyers and sellers at any time guarantees the
best prices and a near constant opportunity to execute trades. By
fragmenting the market into pieces and stretching hours, some
market observers worry that the normal river of buyers and sellers
will become an unsteady flow of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has formed four different
working groups to study the impact of after-hours trading. They are
expected to report next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick for us is to make sure we're honest and open about
the issues after-hours trading faces, which is mostly liquidity,''
said Rob Shenk, director of AOL's Personal Finance Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Between fragmented networks matching buy and sell orders into
the evening and the possibility of exchanges like Nasdaq opening
for late trading, the odds of big price swings for some stocks
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spreads (between offers to buy and sell) will be huge and
price movements are going to be exacerbated by the illiquid nature
of these stocks,'' said Leo Smith, who oversees US stock trading at
Putnam Investments. ``I don't want to say it's going to be a wild
west show, but it's going to be a lot more volatile than most
people will be comfortable with.''

EARTH, WIND &AMP; FIRE CELEBRATING 30TH ANNIVERSARY IN A BIG WAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire's ``Shining Star'' is on the rise again.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran funk and R&AMP;B group, whose hits include ``Shining
Star,'' ``Gratitude,'' ``That's the Way of the World'' and a
version of the Beatles' ``Got to Get You Into My Life,'' is
celebrating its 30th anniversary this year in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour A&AMP;E documentary on the group made its debut in July
and another will air on PBS later this month. Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire
also appeared Aug. 3 on NBC-TV's ``Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' and
Monday on an episode of NBC's ``Later.''
</P>

   Last month, The Sony Music Legacy label re-released four of the
group's top albums, including ``That's the Way of the World,''
``Gratitude,'' ``All 'n' All'' and the ``Best Of Earth, Wind &AMP;
Fire, Vol. 1'' _ each digitally remastered. Also available is
``MegaMix 2000,'' a seven-minute dance-club single featuring a
medley of past hits.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the group will tour North America and Europe with
soul singer Barry White.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire will wrap up the year with a New Year's Eve
performance at Islamorada, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden burst of activity for the 30-year-old group?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, I really don't know,'' said bassist Verdine
White, who was 19 when he joined the group in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it shows that the music has staying power and that
we're up for it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to reinvigorate the group's career is White's older
brother, Maurice. The elder White was the producer and mastermind
of the group, as well as vocalist and drummer. Today he serves
primarily as producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a perfect transition for him because over the
years, trying to perform and produce, that's a lot of stuff to
do,'' Verdine White said by phone from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll always be our producer, and I think he's at a strong
point right now in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Memphis and raised in Chicago, Maurice White formed
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire in 1969 while living in Los Angeles. Formerly a
member of Ramsey Lewis' quartet and session drummer for Chess
Records, White gathered together jazz musicians who were versed in
soul, funk, gospel, blues, Latin and rock.
</P>
<P>
   True to the era, Maurice White wanted the group's music to
promote love and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out here (to Los Angeles) to try to render a service
to mankind, not to be stars,'' he said at the time. ``We are
actually being used as tools by the Creator.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's first name was the Salty Peppers, but Maurice White
renamed the group Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire, a reference to his
astrological chart, which contained no water signs.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire's bold, innovative music helped change the
sound of black pop in the '70s. The breathtaking blend featured
such elements as sweeping horns paired with exotic instrumentation,
Latin-funk rhythms overlaid with gospel-style harmonies and Philip
Bailey's soaring falsetto.
</P>
<P>
   Today's core members are Bailey, Ralph Johnson and Verdine White
(Bailey has a new solo album, ``Dreams,'' on the Seattle-based
Heads Up label). The trio is accompanied by a 12-member entourage
including three horn players, three dancers, two keyboardists and a
percussionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to call it an ensemble,'' Verdine White said. ``And
the dancers really give the show a different flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's current tour, which features its greatest hits,
includes sold-out performances Wednesday and Thursday night at
Seattle's Pier 62/63. There is no opening act.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire is also working on a new album, with Maurice
White and Wyclef Jean producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know how it will sound until you finish,''
Verdine White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about it is that we are all collaborating, and
it's going to be real fun to do. The new music will complement all
the work we've already done, the huge body of work we've created.''

PREPARING YOUR BABY FOR KINDERGARTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As principals go, Miriam Kronish of the John Eliot School in
Needham, Mass. may be more sensitive than most to kindergarteners'
first day of school. Perhaps it has something to do with her years
as a kindergarten teacher, but chances are it's also because she
can remember her own first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one told me anything beforehand, except that I was going,''
she says. ``When my father left me in a big brick building, P.S. 8
in Staten Island, I was so surprised to be inside, not outside in a
garden, that I was bewildered and disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Children today are spared that degree of confusion, thanks to
spring orientations. But our kids have plenty of fears and
misconceptions nonetheless, and parents may have their share as
well. With the countdown to kindergarten well underway, some of
these issues may be surfacing now for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nocera household in Waltham, Mass., it's hard to know
whether 5-year-old Kyle's anxieties rubbed off on his mom or vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Normally an outgoing, social child, Kyle has become increasingly
clingy lately, even refusing to go with his older brother and
sister to Grandma's, only 2 miles away. He's taken to biting his
nails and announcing, ``I'm not going to kindergarten, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   All this prompted Jean, his mother, to wonder: ``Maybe he's not
ready. Maybe I'm too anxious for him to get started on this part of
his life. Why am I pushing him out of the house?'' Other times,
she's wistful: ``He's my youngest, and we've had so much time alone
together. . . . I'm definitely feeling sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Frey says he and his wife are having a harder time than
their soon-to-be-kindergartner daughter. On a scale of 1 to 10,
where 10 means you're jumping out of your skin, Frey rates himself
a 7 and Jody, his wife, a 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alicia's world is expanding, and it feels like we're losing
control,'' says the Holliston, Mass. father.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a child is anxious or not _ and even the child who isn't
today could be tomorrow, including one who has been in day care
since he was 4 months old or one who knows the school inside out
because his sister goes there _ we need to deal with our own
worries first. ``To get it out in the open helps you both,'' says
early childhood educator Mary Mindess, a professor at Lesley
College and coordinator of the New England Kindergarten Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Children are so good at sensing our stress that her rule of
thumb is to assume that if we are worried, a child is, too. The
trouble is, he may not know what, exactly, we're anxious about and
he's also incredibly self-centered, so it's likely that he'll
imagine something like this: ``Dad doesn't think I'm smart enough
for kindergarten''; ``Mom doesn't want me to go; I have to stay
home with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindess's advice is to identify your worst fear: ``He'll be the
only child who won't separate,'' for instance. Turn that into a
story for your child, she says: `` `Once there was a boy who didn't
want to go to school. The first day, he held on so tightly to his
mom's hand! He was about to cry but instead he . . . ' Now how
would you finish that story?''
</P>
<P>
   Putting it in the third person makes it safer, says Mindess, and
makes him more likely to open up. No matter what he suggests, use
it as a way to brainstorm coping skills _ ``Well, he could go back
home with his mom; what other ideas do you have?'' _ and to get him
to express his fears: `` `Now you start a story about kindergarten
and I'll finish it.' '' Using puppets or stuffed animals works,
too, and so can drawing, for children who can't express themselves
verbally.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes your only hint of anxiety is a change in behavior:
problems sleeping, bed-wetting, or renewed thumb sucking. Unless
there's some other issue, assume it's related to kindergarten,
especially during this countdown period, says developmental
psychologist Martha Bronson of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite strategy is to ask a child an open-ended question:
``What do you think will happen in kindergarten?'' What you hear
may surprise you. Children's fears are concrete: ``What if . . . I
get lost; nobody likes me; big kids are mean to me; the teacher
doesn't like me; I can't do what the teacher wants; she won't let
us play; I can't find the bathroom?''
</P>
<P>
   By far, bathroom worries are most prevalent, says early
childhood educator Nancy Balaban of Bank Street Graduate School of
Education in Manhattan. If a child doesn't bring it up, we should:
``I remember that the bathroom is right there in your classroom.
Isn't that nice?'' Worries about the bathroom are so common that
when children arrive on the first day for Anne Selman's
kindergarten at the Pierce School in Brookline, Mass., she
immediately asks them, ``Can you please take Dad down the hall and
show him the bathroom?''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what a child's worry, don't belittle it: ``Don't be a
baby''; ``You'll be fine''; ``You don't need to worry about that.''
Validate it instead, says Balaban: ``You're right, this is a big
building''; ``It is scary to ride the bus the first time.'' Then
add: ``Do you know the teacher takes kids around, so you don't have
to go anywhere by yourself?'' or, ``I called the school. Your
teacher greets the bus every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The more details we give a child, the calmer she'll be, says
Bronson, even if all we have are generic specifics: ``You'll have a
cubby with your name on it. There's snack every day.'' Be prepared
to repeat these over and over; they give a child a sense of control
and familiarity, which leads to security. ``That's what will enable
him to think to himself, `Oh, yeah, I heard about this. I can
handle this,' '' says Bronson.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests dropping details into conversations whenever you
can, even if your child isn't anxious: ``Let's go sneaker shopping
so you have new shoes for kindergarten; I know kids do lots of
running and jumping and playing in kindergarten. Remember that
great playground, just for kindergarteners?'' If a child can't
tolerate hearing it or just isn't interested, let it go, but
continue to slip in comments now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to leave her no time to emotionally prepare,''
says Bronson, an early childhood researcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the week before school, visit the playground, peer into
windows, walk to the bus stop or to school, and invite over a
future classmate. Do this even if you've been doing it all summer
long, says Selman, even for a child who is happy to go.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, avoid saying things like, ``Now you'll be in
real school''; ``You're a big boy now''; ``You'll learn your
letters and numbers, like your sister.'' These kinds of comments
create inappropriate academic pressure, says Bronson. Instead, she
says, ``Stress the social aspect of school: `You'll make so many
new friends!' `The teacher will read stories you've never heard!'
'' If you're worried she'll be bored, help her be open to new
approaches to familiar activities: ``At circle time, it'll be fun
to hear what people say about the stories the teacher reads.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a child who is not visibly concerned is probably
unconsciously preparing himself. Nancy Balaban's grandson, Eli, a
soon-to-be-kindergartener, loves to make books with her. She thinks
it's more than a coincidence that the one he wanted to make most
recently was titled ``Things I Can Do.'' He never connected it
aloud to kindergarten, and she didn't, either _ ``That would be
hitting him over the head,'' she says _ but it was certainly an aid
for him to reflect on his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you have specific questions that keep you up at night or
a nagging worry you can't shake, principal Kronish says it's OK to
call the principal before school starts and even to ask if you can
stay in the classroom the first morning. Selman works on the theory
that there's less upset when parents and children have something
concrete to deal with, so she invites parents to stay and asks the
kids to show them around.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she announces, ``It's time for us to have
kindergarten! Let's kick these parents out,'' parents and pupils
are more than ready.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
OFF THEY GO &QL; 
 &QL; 
Expect a child to regress in the weeks before kindergarten, but
also to have moments when she's more grown up, for instance, doing
buttons or tying her shoe. Be sure to reinforce them: ``What a good
job!'' ``It makes me proud to see you trying new things!'' ``That's
a very grown-up thing you did!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seek professional advice for a child who is so preoccupied or
anxious that she can't play or function normally. &QL; 
 &QL; 
If you are allowed to stay in the classroom for a while, don't just
sneak out. Always say goodbye. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Send a transitional object in his backpack or lunchbox or for his
cubby: a family photo, a note, a favorite book. &QL; 
 &QL; 
If your child says, ``I'm not going to go,'' avoid saying, ``Yes
you are,'' ``You have to,'' or ``It'll be fine.'' Instead, assume
what he said was ``I'm afraid to go'' and reflect it back to him:
``It sounds like there's something about kindergarten that you're
wondering about. Do you know what it is?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
He doesn't have to ride the bus the first day if he doesn't want
to. On the other hand, if he wants to, put him on and meet him at
school to walk to the classroom with him. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Having older siblings does not insulate a child from being anxious
any more than having been through it with another child keeps a
parent from being sad. &QL; 
 &QL;

   PARTY _ In 1992, Ross Perot led an impassioned following of
angry, disaffected voters that caused fits for the campaigns of
President Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. His independent
candidacy won almost 20 percent of the vote, the best showing for
an independent or third party presidential candidate in more than
half a century. And it sparked a debate that continues today about
whether he might have sealed Bush's defeat, even though exit polls
show that he probably drew almost equally from Democrats and
Republicans. Flash forward to 2000. Could a third party candidate
wield that kind of political clout again? 36. David Goldstein.

   VETS: As VFW members gather in Kansas City for the
organization's 100th anniversary convention, some veterans wonder
whether the larger community is indifferent to them. The last time
the VFW met in Kansas City, in 1931, the concern was that World War
I vets would be sleeping on the street during the winter. Since
then, of course, the VFW and other organizations have gained
significant benefits for those who served. But it will always be a
struggle, perhaps particularly so during this era without the draft

   OPERA-GLIMMERGLASS: George Brett and the rest of the Baseball
Hall of Fame hoo-ha had left town by the time I arrived here the
weekend of July 30. (The previous weekend, between the baseball
extravaganza and the Woodstock rehash up the road in Rome, there
wasn't a hotel room to be had for something like 20 counties in
central New York.)
</P>
<P>
   But Cooperstown's other big draw, Glimmerglass Opera, was doing
its part to make hotel rooms scarce even a week later. The best I
could manage was a decidedly modest Budget Host motel in Sharon
Springs, a good 25 minutes away from downtown Cooperstown. At least
the commute couldn't have been lovelier, Routes 20 and 80 winding
up hills and down dales and finally clutching the steep edges of
Otsego Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Glimmerglass Opera is based a few miles north of town, on a
patch of flat land fronting the lake. It's housed in a cluster of
grayish farmlike buildings, designed by architect Hugh Hardy to
blend with the rural setting. (``Glimmerglass,'' by the way, was
novelist James Fenimore Cooper's name for Otsego Lake in his
Leatherstocking Tales.) By SCOTT CANTRELL. 1,500 words.

EXCURSION ALMOST LIVES UP TO ITS ENORMOUS HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a car for jerks.
</P>
<P>
   Pass a pickup truck on the road and its driver nudges a
passenger and jerks a thumb in the direction of this lumbering
beast as it roars by.
</P>
<P>
   Pull into a Dunkin' Donuts and slide in beside a standard sedan,
and its occupants press faces to the window and jerk their eyes
upward to see who stole the daylight.
</P>
<P>
   And, better yet, drive through the heart of Edgartown on
Martha's Vineyard and heads jerk one after another, like fans doing
a cranial wave, as the Ford Excursion sweeps the street.
</P>
<P>
   This biggest-so-far of all SUVs won't even hit showrooms for
another month, won't even officially go on sale until Sept. 30, but
already public awareness of it is huge. Ford hopes to sell
50,000-60,000 of the SUV-that-is-bigger-than-the-Suburban in this
first model year and will likely have little difficulty doing so.
Already, panting buyers have placed 28,000 orders for this big rig.
</P>
<P>
   And big, it is: 226.7 inches long, just over 80 inches tall,
with a 44-gallon fuel tank (environmentalists have already labeled
it the Ford Valdez) and an optional V-10 engine, there is nothing
like it on the market right now. In various configurations _
2-wheel drive, luxury package, 4-wheel drive, 5.4- and 6.8-liter
gasoline engines and a 7.3-liter turbo diesel, its price will range
from around $35,000 to $42,000.
</P>
<P>
   When I first climbed aboard I had a sense of what Yogi Berra
called ``deja vu all over again.'' It felt so familiar, sounded so
familiar, and then it struck me: the Ford F250 Super Duty I was in
not long ago. This rig is that truck turned SUV _ albeit with a
lower profile.
</P>
<P>
   But in a week on Martha's Vineyard, it had a very high profile.
This is an island where, if you had $10 for every Ford Explorer or
Expedition with one of those quaint black-and-white MV decals stuck
to it, you could afford a summer house there. Which is why, even as
million dollar yachts bobbed in the sea off Edgartown, the
Excursion attracted all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is it,'' countless knowing souls said as they
approached the car. ``My God, it's as big as they said. Maybe
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   How big?
</P>
<P>
   So big, we packed two adults, three children and a week's worth
of vacation gear inside and no child had to sit actually touching
another on the drive to and from Wood's Hole.
</P>
<P>
   So big it dwarfed the Jeep Cherokees, Toyota 4-Runners and other
Ford SUVs we passed.
</P>
<P>
   It truly is cavernous. Seats nine people with ample leg room for
all. That is because, while it has 15 cubic feet more interior
space than the GM/Chevrolet Suburbans, that space has been given
over largely to legroom, rather than adding to the carry space
behind the third row of seats. If you want to recover the space for
hauling goods, the rear seat comes out on rollers and the second
seat does a neat double-fold that gives you a huge expanse of empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the rear entry _ two low barn doors, topped by a
glass swing-up door _ gives great vision out the back of the car.
</P>
<P>
   The inside is spartan, yet comfortable with simple appointments
and gauges on the dash (very trucklike), soft broad seats, and
nifty storage bins all over the place. I particularly like the bin
built into the fold-down back of the front center seat.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning front and rear is wonderfully powerful _ it
provoked complaints from some passengers that, even in the midst of
a sweltering heat wave, it was too cold inside the Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was smooth and surprisingly quiet, given the size of
the vehicle and its V-10 engine.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, on narrow streets, especially with cars parked along the
side, it took some care to maneuver. And you have to be aware of
its length and make wide turns accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   On bigger roads and highways, the ride was somewhat boaty _ far
more spongy than, say, the stiff, trucklike Suburban _ but rides
are a matter of choice so you can fault it for floating a bit. And
since this was a 2-wheel-drive version, it was certainly not as
stiff as will be the 4-wheel-drive models, which will sell better
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprisingly deft on the highway, surging out to pass
with a guttural roar and zipping nimbly past cars half its size,
its leaf springs front and rear keeping the ride smooth as all that
bulk went lane-to-lane.
</P>
<P>
   And it is incredibly powerful: It cruised at 75 while cranking
only 2,100 rpms and its 275-horspower, 410 lbs./ft. of torque will
pull 10,000 pounds of trailer even as the car and its load reach
8,000 pounds. Because it is so big, you have to allow extra braking
time, but the Excursion's four-wheel discs brought it to sure
stops.
</P>
<P>
   You can't test a big SUV these days without talking safety and
environment and Ford has tried to address these issues in the
Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we did get just over 12 miles per gallon in a week of mixed
driving. But Ford points out that the Excursion emits 43 percent
less smog forming emissions than permitted by law.
</P>
<P>
   To address safety _ for both its own passengers and those in
other cars _ Ford has innovated front and rear. They've added a
Blocker Beam, hooked to the front frame rails below the bumper and
attached it with L-shaped brackets that crumple in a front-end
crash. This protects not only the Excursion's occupants, but also
prevents smaller cars from sliding beneath the big Ford. They've
also made a wide, steel towbar frame standard equipment, in effect
adding a second bumper below the high rear bumper.
</P>
<P>
   GM/Chevrolet sold 150,000 Suburbans last year, virtually
comprising the entire heavy duty SUV market. Ford is now going
head-to-head and expects to sell as many as a third of its
Excursions in just two states: Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, after I'd sent the Excursion back, my lasting
impression was this: Nice car _ if you own a big spread out West.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ The low-slung running boards that make getting in and out of
this big truck easy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The storage bins pressed in various configurations all over
what in most cars is a flat dashboard top.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ford did such a nice job with bins everywhere, it's surprising
they didn't put storage pouches on the backs of the front seats.
These are great for atlases.

SPIDERS ARE GUESTS WORTH KEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I just moved into our first house, vintage
1930 with aluminum siding. We have a strange invasion of spiders.
There are no nests, no cobwebs, but they keep cropping up. Is there
something wrong? Should we get rid of them? If so, how?
</P>
<P>
   SUE OFFSIE, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. When you have spiders, it means you have bugs (no reflection
on anyone's housekeeping or anything else!). Lots of spiders, lots
of bugs. The spiders eat the bugs, so if you got rid of the
spiders, you might get more bugs. Keep the spiders. Spiders have no
nests (the web with its resident spider is his parlor/dining
room/bedroom/bathroom). Any cobweb that is dusty and dirty is
unoccupied, and you can sweep it down with impunity. In fact, you
can sweep any webs and spiders away, just to keep the place neat
and clean. The spiders will be back. I think you should live with
them. In New England, the black widow and the brown recluse _ the
so-called most dangerous of North American spiders _ are almost
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum siding on your house may be making the interior of
the house more humid than normal, and this attracts insects,
followed quickly by spiders. Also, where you previously lived may
have been tighter and more resistant to insects and arachnids (the
spiders) than your ``new'' house is.
</P>
<P>
   So, live and let live. Of course, if a spider is dangling down
over your pillow on her silken thread, then it's time to take two
paper cups, capture Charlotte, and deposit her in the basement or
elsewhere where she can find bugs and eat 'em.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a lot of holes from carpenter bees in the trim of my
house, mostly on the rake, the trim board that follows the slope of
the roof at the gable ends. I am replacing those rake boards; is
there any better wood that I can use than pine that would resist
the bees' activity?
</P>
<P>
   JUST WONDERING
</P>
<P>
   A. You could try cypress, which is not only water resistant but
may resist the carpenter bees. Trouble is, it might be impossible
to find. Carpenter bees tend to drill into wood boards, then turn a
corner inside the wood to lay their eggs. You can treat the hole
with an insecticide, then plug it with a piece of putty. That is
the only ``cure,'' and it is not a good one because the bees are
beneficial, pollinating flowers and vegetables all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, when you put up new, sound boards of pine, and keep
it well stained or primed and painted, the bees might leave it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The ceilings in my house, more than 100 years old, are
hopelessly cracked. There are so many of them that I really do not
want to live with them. Can I put up Blueboard and a skim coat of
plaster? Does the plaster have to be painted?
</P>
<P>
   JIM FRESCHETTE, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can put up Blueboard over the old ceiling, but I suggest
you have it done rather than trying to do it yourself. You have to
nail or screw the Blueboard through the plaster and wood lath, and
into the strapping; locating this strapping is best left to a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I suppose you could try it yourself if you rent a ceiling
jack, a sort of elevator that brings up each piece of Blueboard and
holds it against the ceiling until you position and secure it. You
don't have to paint the plaster for a while, until it gets dirty.
Then wash it, and paint with two thin coats of a latex ceiling
paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the adhesive power of mortar, especially on a
vertical surface? I have several pieces of slate that I want to
fasten to a frame of plywood. It will be about 2 feet wide and
several feet high, so I can hang it on the wall. The slates are 15
inches square and about an inch thick. I was thinking of a thick
bed of mortar on a steel mesh nailed to the plywood, then setting
the slate on the mortar. Would that work?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL HALEY, Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It will work as well as any mortar job, but you still run the
risk of something giving way. If you use mortar, use a thin-set
mortar, which holds better to anything, including wood. But here, I
think, is a better idea: Forget mortar and put the slate on with
long brass L-hooks, which are threaded on their long leg and plain
on their short leg. You can get them 2 or 3 inches long. Use two
L-hooks on the bottom and two on the top to hold the slate.
Position the slate, and drive a hook beside the slate, turning it
until the short leg of the ``L'' secures the face of the slate.
Repeat with the other hooks. The handyman did this with two plaster
casts of dinosaur tracks, and it worked nicely. Those casts were
more than 2 inches thick, and mighty heavy.
</P>
<P>
   With the slate in place on the frame, you can set the frame on
the wall and drive screws through the plywood into the studs. You
have to screw into studs for something this heavy. One more thing.
If you have a baseboard, you can cut it flat on top or remove the
molding to create a low shelf that you can set the bottom of the
frame on. It will make the frame more secure and make everything
easier to work on.
</P>

ROAD RAGE? TRY A LITTLE ROAD JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WHITE COLUMN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The car that cut in front of me bore a bumper sticker, ``Road
Respect . . . Tame the Rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, bumper sticker irony. Drivers who sport ``Easy Does It''
signs and try to run you off the road. People whose cars proclaim
that they ``Respect Life'' but drive as if they're auditioning for
``Mad Max IV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Respect.'' It's a fine idea, a noble effort by the
Governor's Highway Safety Bureau to curb aggressive driving and
bring some much-needed civility to local roads. Once upon a time,
Massachusetts was infamous for its crazy drivers. And, of course,
it still is notorious, but now the rest of the nation is catching
up to us. Tacked above my desk is a clip, a recent news item
datelined San Jose: ``A 68-year-old woman pleaded no contest to
charges that she flung an 88-year-old woman to the ground for
beating her to a parking space . . .''
</P>
<P>
   What have we come to?
</P>
<P>
   Here in Massachusetts, the ``Road Respect'' campaign has been up
and running for more than a year. Perhaps you've noticed it. Then
again, perhaps you haven't. I only became aware of it last week,
when that guy with the bumper sticker cut me off. Does the ``Road
Respect'' campaign need a jump start?
</P>
<P>
   Maria Farrah John of the Governor's Highway Safety Bureau says
the main objective is to increase public awareness of aggressive
driving. The bureau is using billboards and public service
announcements to call attention to the ``Road Respect'' campaign.
It's working with State Police and the Registry of Motor Vehicles
to identify drivers who are particularly dangerous. ``We've done
telephone surveys two years in a row,'' John said, ``and what we're
finding is that people are verbalizing that they feel aggressive
driving is as much of a problem as impaired driving.''
</P>
<P>
   I've been verbalizing that very thing for years and where has it
gotten me? Maybe it's time to try to curb aggressive driving with
aggressive courtesy, with Random Acts of Road Respect. A few
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   1) When someone cuts in front of you, smile and wave. Blow
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   2) If another driver does you wrong, don't get mad, don't get
even. Smile, hold up your index finger _ be careful, that's the one
next to your thumb _ and say, ``You're number one!''
</P>
<P>
   3) Follow the driver who tries to run you off the road. If you
manage to catch up, say, ``I love you, my fellow motorist. I hope
you'll live forever. I wish you'd drive more carefully. This isn't
about me. It's about you.''
</P>
<P>
   4) When you're stuck in a traffic jam, get out of your car,
shake hands with other drivers, embrace them and say, ``Peace be
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   5) Pay tolls for the cars behind you.
</P>
<P>
   6) In case of accidents, keep a supply of homemade snacks in the
car to distribute to other motorists, police, fire officials, EMT's
tow-truck drivers, etc. Have multiple copies of the recipes on
hand, in case anyone asks.
</P>
<P>
   7) Surprise toll-takers with hand-written thank-you notes and
beautifully wrapped little gifts.
</P>
<P>
   9) When you see someone driving and applying makeup, or reading,
or talking on the phone, or engaging in any one of scores of other
in-car projects, toot your horn and give them a friendly thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   10) If you see a motorist in distress stopped by the side of the
road, pull over and offer to lead him in a series of stretches and
deep-breathing exercises.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that if you try any or all of the above,
be prepared to duck.

A RARE SUMMER ABMLES ALONG, POLITICS ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LACONIA, N.H. _ The summer of 1999 will be remembered in these
parts as a time when the immediate pursuits of life trumped its
troubling abstractions. Hot, handsome days of plenty unfold like
lacquered fans, and the swarm of presidential hopefuls are
newsprint used to start barbecue grills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about politics now. It's too early,'' said Etta
Sweatt, who with her husband, Hartley, owns a farm up in Millsfield
that has been in the family since 1877. ``The campaign ought to be
two months. If you can't make up your mind in two months, forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Etta has her priorities right. To hell with the political castes
in Concord already obsessed with the primaries next February. Such
common sense is reassuring to outlanders who have been stunned by
the plumb weirdness of New Hampshire since the birth two centuries
ago of what the poet Donald Hall calls ``the nation-state of each
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   But what else? If not politics, which will descend on Etta and
Hartley Sweatt like black flies later this year, what is on the
minds of New Hampshire residents in this final summer of the
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   The Globe spent a week traveling from Massachusetts to the
Canadian border asking residents this question. The answer,
expressed in various idioms, is that people are simply attending to
the business of living. This is living you can touch, like a pair
of pliers. It embraces routine, and as Flannery O'Connor wrote,
routine is the stuff of sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women talk about the weather, the terror and joy of
running a small business, the rigors of managing a farm, the deep
pleasure of fishing with a child, the zen of tending to their
tomatoes. They talk about family in general and children in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton? Hillary? Monica, Kosovo? Abortion? Tax cuts? No.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire residents have had it with violence, real or
fabricated by Hollywood. They treasure time, rarest of all
commodities in America today, and mourn its disappearance from
their lives with something approaching panic. Exhaustion, physical
and psychic, is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   So they pause, however briefly, to enjoy the small pleasures of
life during this sweet season that Etta Sweatt calls ``a good
old-fashioned summer we haven't seen in 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just living this summer,'' said Mike Majgar, owner
of The Beggar's Pouch, a leather store in North Conway. ``They're
content, not worried about their jobs. They're trying to have
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is basking in its microscopic unemployment rate,
2.6 percent in June. There is no issue like impeachment to
confront. For most, fear is a distant specter. ``These are the best
times in memory, and I've got a pretty good memory,'' said Richard
Hicks, 73, who owns a hardware store and lumber business in
Colebrook. ``If you're not working now, it means you don't want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is grand for Bill Irwin, sales manager and the
third-generation Irwin at Irwin Marine in Laconia, one of the
largest boat dealers in the state. Expensive boats define
disposable income. When the stock market tanks, they don't move.
But Wall Street is booming, as is the market for big boats (from 28
to 38 feet). Such craft start at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is good. People have confidence in themselves now.
Free time means everything to them,'' said Irwin. ``They have the
money, so why not spend it? There is nothing major to talk about,
so they say, `Let's go boating and have some fun.' There was a
couple in yesterday with no intention of buying a boat, but their
interest snowballed and they bought one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sprees are rooted in the white-hot technology belt
in the southern part of the state, where people stare at computer
screens rather than mountains. Chris Conway, who in April bought a
small office building in Merrimack for his expanding CEJ Computer
Business Systems, wants some of this American gravy. ``The only
thing on my mind this summer is finishing this building,'' he said
in an office crawling with workmen. ``When you're self-employed,
nobody can sleep 100 percent without worrying. I need to pay for
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous consumption surrounds him and his wife, a corporate
litigator. ``Everyone is buying new trucks and cars, $40,000
SUVs,'' he said. ``That tells me everyone is confident that they're
going to be able to pay the mortgages on them. They're spending
money like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway designs work stations, servers, and networks. He looks
with delight at the great Y2K scare, which should keep him crazed,
and prosperous, well into next year. The dark side of this boom, of
course, is the pace. ``There is no time,'' he said, rueful that he
can't spend more of it with his 13-year-old son. ``It's 8 a.m. to 8
p.m.,'' he explained. ``It's the same for my wife, and she may
start working again after dinner at 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Such hours are increasingly common in New Hampshire these days.
The state confronts the same pace of life that exhausts the rest of
America. ``I need to relearn how to do nothing. I need to sit among
the trees and get away from people,'' said Ruth Kenick, an
elementary school counselor in Rollinsford. ``We're all stressed in
the middle of summer. So what will it be like around Christmas?
We're becoming a nation of A types. We're losing all of the Bs.''
</P>
<P>
   And the good times don't extend to everyone. While expensive
jetskis and power boats zigzag across Lake Winnipesaukee like water
bugs, the boom so evident in the southern tier of the state fades
north of Franconia Notch. In Berlin, the paper mill city you smell
before you see, the tension among mill workers over the future of
their jobs is palpable. In Pittsburg, hard by the Canadian border,
truckers who haul giant logs to mills say the demand for their
services is off. And a sizable chunk of the 97.4 percent who are
employed in New Hampshire earn less than $10 an hour without
benefits or a future.

   The US Army recruiting office in Laconia was empty on a recent
scorcher but for Glen Sizemore, 17, who will be a senior at Gilford
High School this fall, and three recruiters. Sizemore was talking
to them about his enlistment, which will occur after he finishes
high school. Why, one wonders, would anyone join the Army when
there are more jobs than people to fill them in this state?
</P>
<P>
   ``It solves a lot of questions I've had since eighth grade,''
explained Sizemore. ``You can make $10 an hour when you're 18, and
that looks good at the time. But later on, when you're 30 and
trying to raise a family, it doesn't work anymore. I'm not an honor
student and probably wouldn't get a scholarship to college. I'd
probably be a cook for the rest of my life and work until I'm 70. I
want better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't even think about this. It doesn't cross their
minds _ health care benefits and retirement,'' he continued. ``They
think I'm ruining my life. But my older friends say, `Get in as
soon as you can.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Joan, a 50-year-old worker at the paper mills in Berlin,
understands the urge. Together with her husband, they have more
than 60 years on the job there and can't wait to retire. ``We're
dinosaurs. These jobs won't exist in a few more years,'' she said.
``Imports are pouring in and the paper industry is going down the
tubes. I tell my son, `You get out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   David Brugnot was born and raised in the same town and somehow
loves the place. He is one of New Hampshire's eccentrics who leaven
its orthodoxy. At 45, he looks like an outlaw but runs a healthy
business he started a decade ago servicing and selling used
Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of four wives, he harbors great faith in his ability
to survive and be happy. Signs reading ``Make Your Own Path'' and
``Lose Your Dream And You Lose Your Mind'' are on his shop walls.
He has no time for what he calls ``the crybaby network.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No job has a future in corporate America today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the high cost of living that's the problem. It's the
cost of living high,'' Brugnot continued, a cigar poking out of his
mouth. ``People around here want the rainbow all the time. They're
not poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brugnot rides with his wife on weekends and plays motorcycle
Santa each Christmas. He maintains a glint in his eye. ``I'm going
to be in Roswell for New Year's,'' he said, referring to the New
Mexico town that is America's UFO epicenter. ``They're going to
pick me up.''
</P>
<P>
   No such plans for Wendy Starkweather, 48, a single mother from
Peterborough rooted firmly on planet Earth. Starkweather attended
last Sunday's lecture of the Monadnock Summer Lyceum series at the
town's Unitarian Church to hear a minister address the explosive
admixture of religion, politics, and the loss of civility in
America. She tried unsuccessfully to drag her 12-year-old son
along, because she is deeply concerned about the anger and violence
among today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, I heard tales of guns and drugs in school here,''
said Starkweather, a walking trifecta of musician, preschool
operator, and waitress. ``I've lived here 20 years and this is a
very special community, but I'm hearing about that. Youth today is
very angry and violent. The experience at Woodstock this year is a
good barometer of what's going on in our country. I think we're on
the edge of something.''
</P>
<P>
   Etta and Hartley Sweatt are consumed with another family issue:
their farm, which last year was named one of the 10 most
distinguished in the state. ``Our concern is how we protect it from
the government and pass it on to someone without them raking us
with taxes,'' said Etta, watching the cows in the barn on a
closed-circuit television monitor located inside an unused wood
stove.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweatts lose money on the 80 head of Hereford they run for
beef. The price per pound is lower than it was 20 years ago but
their costs surely are not, Etta fumed. Gathering steam, she moved
on to the decline of the American family and the loss of values
among children.
</P>
<P>
   Her monologue veered toward the end of the world until, in a
lovely non sequitur, she mentioned the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was full last night and it was simply beautiful,'' Etta
recalled. ``Everyone in this family went out to look at it. That's
our life. You don't see another house from here. Just mountains all
around.''

THE ABSURDITY OF QUESTION 6 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next year, for the first time, the national census will permit
Americans to identify themselves as members of more than one race.
Tiger Woods, the ``Cablinasian'' golf phenom, will no longer have
to choose between identifying with his Thai mother or his black
father, or among his father's white, black, and American Indian
progenitors. When he answers Question 6 on the 2000 census _ ``What
is this person's race?'' _ he can check off four separate racial
categories: white, black, American Indian, and Asian.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Question 6 doesn't provide an ``Asian'' box to check
off. Instead it lists six discrete Asian races _ races, mind you,
not nationalities: Asian, Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese,
Korean, and Vietnamese. Presumably, Woods will choose the seventh
box _ ``Other Asian'' _ and print ``Thai'' on the line underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Is this progress? Certainly it never made sense to lump (for
example) Chinese, Filipinos, and Koreans _ who do not share the
same appearance, language, history, or culture _ into a catch-all
race called ``Asian.'' But it also makes no sense to treat
Americans of Chinese, Filipino, and Korean ancestry as members of
three different races. What's next? Treating every South Pacific
island as the homeland of a different race?
</P>
<P>
   Well _ yes. Question 6 abandons the old ``Pacific Islander''
designation, replacing it with the Native Hawaiian, Guamanian, and
Samoan races. Americans who trace their ancestry back to, say,
Fiji, Tonga, or Tahiti will have to check off the box marked
``Other Pacific Islander'' then follow the instructions for the
line immediately following: ``Print race.'' Not island. Race.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 14 decades after the Emancipation Proclamation, we
Americans are less likely than ever to take race into account when
forming friendships, falling in love, rooting for athletes, or
idolizing entertainers. Meanwhile, the government, mired in
racialism, sorts us into so many races that there isn't room to
list them all on the census form.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Question 6 recognizes only a single race for whites
and a single race for blacks. Americans of Nordic, Slavic, and
Mediterranean descent may display pronounced physical differences,
but in the government's eyes, they are all white. Americans whose
ancestors came from Somalia, Zululand, and Ghana are all deemed,
simply, black. Can it really be the case that each island in the
Pacific is associated with a unique race, while the entire
continent of Africa comprises just one?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. But Question 6 has little to do with science and
a lot to do with ethnic-group politics. The better question is, why
is it in the census at all? Anything the government needs to know
about Americans' origins is covered by Question 10: ``What is this
person's ancestry or ethnic origin?'' That is the place to record
family heritage. There are no boxes to check off, no multiplicity
of ``races'' to choose from; just a question and a blank space for
the answer. Americans of Irish, German, Vietnamese, or Puerto Rican
extraction have equal freedom to label themselves as they see fit.
Tiger Woods can describe his pedigree as white, black, Indian, and
Thai. Or he can simply write ``American.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is it decreed that governments must classify their
citizens by race. We are asked about our ancestry; that is enough.
The race question serves only to divide Americans, and to
strengthen those who feed on racial division.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between ancestry and race is that one is real and
one is largely fiction. Race is a social construct, not a
biological fact. The genes of whites, blacks, and ``native
Hawaiians'' are indistinguishable. Of course there are physical
variations among populations that originated at points far apart on
the globe. But the idea that those variations are racial is a
relatively recent one.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 17th century, Francois Bernier, a French doctor,
first thought of classifying human beings by facial characteristics
and body type. On that basis, he enumerated four races: Europeans,
Far Easterners, blacks, and Lapps. (Bernier wrote that Lapps have
bear-like faces and appear ``quite frightful.'')
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus divvied
up mankind into Europeans, Asians, Africans, Americans, and a
smattering of fringe races, including dwarfs, troglodytes, and
``lazy Patagonians.'' Later still, Johann Blumenbach counted five
human races: European _ he called them ``Caucasian,'' theorizing
that they had originated in the Caucasus mountains _ Ethiopian,
Mongoloid, American, and Malay.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Boyd agreed with Johann Blumenbach: There are five
races,'' writes Dinesh D'Souza in ``The End of Racism,'' his 1995
study of race in America. ``Louis Agassiz was willing to settle for
eight. Carleton Coon maintained that there are nine. Thomas Henry
Huxley proposed 11 races, later changing his count to 19. Joseph
Birdsell insisted on 32, including `Hindus,' `Turkics,' `Tibetans,'
`Guegians,' `Neo-Hawaiians,' and `Negritos.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Today such taxonomies seem absurd. So does the view, once not
uncommon in white America, that the Irish were an inferior race. So
does the Census Bureau's former insistence on enumerating blacks
and mulattoes separately, and on subdividing mulattoes into
quadroons and octoroons. Be sure of this: Americans in the future
will look back at Question 6 in the 2000 US Census and laugh at its
absurdity.

`MESSENGER' BEARS FIRST AMENDMENT WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER: How Our Growing Hatred of the Media
Threatens Free Speech for All of Us 
By Bruce W. Sanford 
Free Press, 257 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some advocates of the First Amendment ``see a python lying dead
on the American path. It is a snake engorged and empowered with the
public's venom toward the media.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of passage that makes ``Don't Shoot The
Messenger'' an unlikely page-turner. With vivid writing and strong,
if not always solid, opinions, author and press lawyer Bruce W.
Sanford has transformed the often plodding art of media criticism
into something resembling fun.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, this description of Donna Rice, whose
dalliance with Gary Hart became the subject of a media frenzy that
Sanford criticizes: ``If peonies came to life, one could bear her
name. Lush fragrant, silky and strong, Donna Rice is as beautiful a
perennial as nature gives us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty steamy stuff for a book on the First Amendment. But
Sanford's strength is his ability to infuse his plea for unfettered
freedoms for an increasingly unpopular press with some
pulse-pounding passion. His concern is neatly conveyed by the juror
who awarded more than $100,000 to a young man who killed a child in
a schoolyard fight and then sued the local paper for portraying the
episode as a ``savage beating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we didn't much like the little'' expletive deleted, the
juror said of the plaintiff. ``But we liked the newspaper even
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Shoot The Messenger'' warns that such public antipathy
toward the media is beginning to exact a serious toll on
journalism's range of motion. Increasingly, juries are punishing
the press in the courtroom, whether by doling out
multimillion-dollar libel settlements or by exacting a $5.5 million
payment from ABC for its undercover investigation of the Food Lion
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The author quotes former Judge Abner Mikva in a warning he
issued during remarks at Georgia State University Law School:
``Watch Out! There's a backlash coming in First Amendment
Doctrine.'' And Sanford argues that if the Pentagon Papers case
occurred today, the Supreme Court might well send New York Times
and Washington Post executives off to the hoosegow.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford is a near absolutist on the subject, railing against
judicially imposed restraints on freedom of the press. Often he's
right, as when he characterizes ABC's Food Lion story as part of
the ``rich tradition'' of investigative journalism or decries the
growing number of subpoenas designed to strip journalists of their
independence by forcing them to produce tapes and notes as evidence
in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his instincts are more dubious, as in his staunch
defense of media ride-alongs during police arrests, events that
tend to be PR bonanzas with little news value. And his suggestion
that courts hire ``media consultants'' to help judges accept and
deal with cameras in the courtroom is, in fact, one heck of a
testimonial to the lens' demeaning and distorting effect on
jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you disagree with Sanford's ideas, however, you have
to admire his consistency and fervor. Less compelling are his
efforts to make sense of the journalistic malfeasance that has
generated the public backlash driving the assault on the media's
power.
</P>
<P>
   In one feverish chapter, entitled ``The Public Service
Quotient,'' Sanford attempts to tackle the blurring of news and
entertainment. (He concludes that there is ``almost nothing''
journalists ``can do about it.'') He tries to figure out why
citizens tell pollsters the news is too negative and then tune into
the bloodiest newscast they can find. (Here, he offers the
diplomatic, if unsatisfying answer that ``half of the blame falls
on the public's shoulders, half on the media's.'')
</P>
<P>
   Sanford makes the crucial point that while the journalistic
culture values the ``scoop,'' consumers are much less concerned
with which cable network beats its competitors to a story by 90
seconds than with ``depth, accuracy'' and ``fairness.'' Yet at the
end of the chapter, he can do little more than hope that the cure
for the media's ruptured credibility is to bring ``a higher level
of civility to newsgathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford may not have any particularly compelling solutions to
journalism's nastiest dilemmas. But his full-throated warning that
society should not take out its frustrations on the First Amendment
is a message worth trumpeting.

PRESS IGNORES `CLINTON FATIGUE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the public issued its final verdict on Monica-gate, the
dominant message to the media was ``no mas.'' Almost 90 percent of
the respondents to a Media Studies Center survey said they had been
oversaturated with coverage of Clinton's foibles. Nearly 60 percent
told the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press it was more
important that a president's private life remain private than it
was to elect a man of high moral caliber.
</P>
<P>
   These sentiments quickly became known as ``Clinton fatigue.'' A
majority of the American public was willing to let the White House
survive the sex scandal while hoping for a virtual news blackout on
the lives and loves of its occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, only half a year after the sordid impeachment drama ended,
has the press forgotten about ``Clinton fatigue?'' Hillary
Clinton's presumptive bid for New York Senate has not only
convulsed the media into feverish scrutiny of an election that is
15 months away, it also has resurrected tiresome old speculation
about what makes Bill Clinton behave badly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's dissection of Hillary's ``abuse excuse'' for her
husband's philandering that appeared in the new Talk magazine
provided an oasis of chatter for a political pundit class that had
been languishing in the summer doldrums. A library search turned up
more than 700 print stories devoted to the Talk interview. But that
shouldn't be equated with a public appetite for more Clinton
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of it,'' mumbles Larry Sabato, media critic and
author of ``Feeding Frenzy.'' ``This is a massive soap opera _
`Days of Our Clintons.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that a burned out citizenry wants to change the
channel. Last month, Andrew Kohut found that ``Clinton fatigue''
was still running rampant. As he reported in a New York Times op-ed
column, 40 percent of those surveyed complained there was ``too
much coverage'' of Hillary's Senate foray. A mere 7 percent thought
there was ``too little.''
</P>
<P>
   So why can't journalists turn down the volume on ``Days of Our
Clintons?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story that the press has been covering for a long
time,'' suggests Kohut. ``It's almost by force of habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Tyndall, a New York resident who monitors network news
shows, offers another suggestion: ``It's a race in the media
capital of the country (so) it's a media race.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate the media attention lavished on every
aspect of Hillary's quest _ from her apparent metamorphosis into a
Yankees fan to her explanation of her husband's sins. According to
Tyndall, the buzz generated by the Talk interview got 12 minutes of
air time on the nightly newscasts last week, making it the second
biggest story behind the worsening summer drought. Meanwhile, a
study by New York's News Research Group found that Hillary Clinton
was the lightning rod for coverage of her undeclared race with New
York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In the nearly 300 stories written
about that campaign last month in six major New York State papers,
70 percent of that ink was dedicated to Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   All this media attention has turned what is still an unofficial
senate contest into what New York News Research Group director Dirk
Smillie calls ``a virtual campaign. You have polls (the latest of
which have Giuliani and Hillary Clinton in a virtual dead heat);
you have media coverage . . .They're both talking to the press
about a campaign that doesn't exist yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to analysts, one major reason for all this
premature media focus on New York is the prevailing perception that
the 2000 presidential race is shaping up as a yawner. In the
media's constant pursuit of the most exciting political horse race,
the potentially volatile dog fight between Hillary Clinton and
Giuliani looks infinitely more interesting than a George Bush
Republican coronation or a Democratic contest between the
charismatically challenged Al Gore and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, you don't know which is going to be the bigger race,
the New York Senate race or the presidential race,'' offers
Tyndall. But it's easy to tell which one is winning the hearts of
political reporters. In the same Pew survey in which 40 percent
complained they were getting too much New York Senate coverage,
only 18 percent felt there was too much coverage of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an extraodinarily dull presidential race,'' says
Sabato. ``Bush has the most charisma, but frankly, you can tell how
our standards of charisma have declined since the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato also believes that in a strange way, `` `Clinton fatigue'
. . . is feeding coverage of Hillary Clinton's race,'' because
reporters are obsessed with exploring whether public weariness with
the president is harming her political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there is a significant public demand for news of
Hillary's foray into elective politics, Kohut says ``for the
audience of Talk magazine and the cable chat shows, yes. But for
the broader public, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the same issue, Tyndall says ``there are three
categories of people. There's the media, New Yorkers, and everyone
else.'' For those in the last category, the news business is
delivering some bad tidings. ``Clinton fatigue'' be damned.

WOODSTOCK CHARGES SPARK NET ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The posting on the Woodstock.com bulletin board was impossible
to ignore. ``Everything was great at Woodstock until the early
hours of Monday morning when my daughter got separated from her
three girlfriends,'' a father wrote. ``A clean-cut college-looking
guy with dirty blond hair pulled my daughter into a tent and raped
her. There were people around who must have heard her screams. . .
. We need help. . . . Anyone who provides info leading to his
arrest and conviction is entitled to a $10,000 reward, please.''
</P>
<P>
   The father, who goes by the on-line name Fanvan, received
hundreds of responses to his plea for justice. And a group of
concerned Netizens is taking action: In the past few days, they
launched a nonprofit organization called Fans Everywhere and
created a Web site to raise money for rewards and to gather
information about five reported sexual assaults at the concert. The
Web site, at www.fanseverywhere.org, is still under construction,
and the loosely knit group is developing a strategy to gather
information on line and feed it to the New York State Police.
Members have also drafted a letter to the artists who performed at
Woodstock '99, asking the bands to support their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The grass-roots effort, inspired by one father's cry, was
started by a northern Virginia software programmer who goes by the
on-line name of Lachtan. When he heard about the reports of sexual
assaults at the concert, which was held July 23-25 at the former
Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y., he immediately posted a
query seeking other on-line vigilantes. ``I was utterly
nauseated,'' he said in a telephone interview, asking that only his
first name, Nathan, be used in this column. ``I just got married,
and I have a teenage sister, and the idea that I have to worry
about them going to a concert surrounded by 200,000 people is
mind-numbing. I'm going to do whatever I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, 24, didn't attend the concert, but he describes himself
as a ``hard-core mosher'' who is appalled that women were violated
at a music event. Andrew Mitchell, another member of Fans
Everywhere, did attend the concert. ``What happened at Woodstock
needs to be dealt with,'' said Mitchell, 21, from his home in St.
Louis. ``People need to be educated. And those responsible need to
be caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Group members e-mailed the editors of Woodstock.com, Mitchell
said. They still haven't received a reply.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a quick look at the Woodstock.com home page makes the
concert seem as if it were a heavenly love fest rather than a
hellish scene of riots and rape. The artist interviews are perky,
and the photograph gallery is full of sunny images. You don't see
the bonfires. You don't see the destruction of the so-called
``Peace Wall.'' And you don't see someone's daughter being dragged
into a tent.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign that anything went wrong is found on the bulletin
boards: ``We need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the official site, which began gathering users long
before the concert and plans to continue doing business as a music
portal.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs on display at the New York State Police Web site
(www.troopers.state.ny.us) tell another story entirely, depicting
the rioters in action. The Associated Press and other news
organizations charge that the use of the photos is a copyright
infringement; AP staffers shot 10 of the 14 photos. The police
claim the use of the photos is covered by a law that limits
copyright protection when the material is used for ``nonprofit
education purposes.'' Meanwhile, the AP is considering further
legal action, its attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock '99 is turning out to be a test case for the Internet
in more ways than one. Fans started gathering on line months ago,
organizing ``Tent Circles'' for like-minded folks to camp together
at the site. During the event, some 400,000 viewers logged onto the
Woodstock.com site for the live netcast, making the concert the
largest live music event ever viewed over the Internet. But the
site barely acknowledges that something went terribly wrong; one
page on the site includes selective quotes from organizers and
government officials. ``I'd hate to see such a small group of
troublemakers cast such a negative vibe on what was otherwise a
terrific musical and historical event,'' says promoter John Scher,
who is quoted on the site. ``Thank God that it was contained to
damage of temporary physical structures.''
</P>
<P>
   Physical structures? What about the five rapes that were
reported? What about the father who documented his daughter's
experience on Woodstock.com? Shouldn't the site, which used the
concert to establish itself in cyberspace, help out in the search
for information?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need help,'' a father wrote. The promoters and the Web site
operators ignored that cry. But the young activists at Fans
Everywhere heard it, and they're taking action. ``The perpetrators
are going to go back to college, and they're going to talk about
it,'' said one of the organizers, who goes by the name Coco on line
and works for a nonprofit environmental organization in northern
Virginia. ``Someone is going to hear them, and someone is going to
turn them in.''

EXCURSION ALMOST LIVES UP TO ITS ENORMOUS HYPE 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a car for jerks.
</P>
<P>
   Pass a pickup truck on the road and its driver nudges a
passenger and jerks a thumb in the direction of this lumbering
beast as it roars by.
</P>
<P>
   Pull into a Dunkin' Donuts and slide in beside a standard sedan,
and its occupants press faces to the window and jerk their eyes
upward to see who stole the daylight.
</P>
<P>
   And, better yet, drive through the heart of Edgartown on
Martha's Vineyard and heads jerk one after another, like fans doing
a cranial wave, as the Ford Excursion sweeps the street.
</P>
<P>
   This biggest-so-far of all SUVs won't even hit showrooms for
another month, won't even officially go on sale until Sept. 30, but
already public awareness of it is huge. Ford hopes to sell
50,000-60,000 of the SUV-that-is-bigger-than-the-Suburban in this
first model year and will likely have little difficulty doing so.
Already, panting buyers have placed 28,000 orders for this big rig.
</P>
<P>
   And big, it is: 226.7 inches long, just over 80 inches tall,
with a 44-gallon fuel tank (environmentalists have already labeled
it the Ford Valdez) and an optional V-10 engine, there is nothing
like it on the market right now. In various configurations _
2-wheel drive, luxury package, 4-wheel drive, 5.4- and 6.8-liter
gasoline engines and a 7.3-liter turbo diesel, its price will range
from around $35,000 to $42,000.
</P>
<P>
   When I first climbed aboard I had a sense of what Yogi Berra
called ``deja vu all over again.'' It felt so familiar, sounded so
familiar, and then it struck me: the Ford F250 Super Duty I was in
not long ago. This rig is that truck turned SUV _ albeit with a
lower profile.
</P>
<P>
   But in a week on Martha's Vineyard, it had a very high profile.
This is an island where, if you had $10 for every Ford Explorer or
Expedition with one of those quaint black-and-white MV decals stuck
to it, you could afford a summer house there. Which is why, even as
million dollar yachts bobbed in the sea off Edgartown, the
Excursion attracted all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is it,'' countless knowing souls said as they
approached the car. ``My God, it's as big as they said. Maybe
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   How big?
</P>
<P>
   So big, we packed two adults, three children and a week's worth
of vacation gear inside and no child had to sit actually touching
another on the drive to and from Wood's Hole.
</P>
<P>
   So big it dwarfed the Jeep Cherokees, Toyota 4-Runners and other
Ford SUVs we passed.
</P>
<P>
   It truly is cavernous. Seats nine people with ample leg room for
all. That is because, while it has 15 cubic feet more interior
space than the GM/Chevrolet Suburbans, that space has been given
over largely to legroom, rather than adding to the carry space
behind the third row of seats. If you want to recover the space for
hauling goods, the rear seat comes out on rollers and the second
seat does a neat double-fold that gives you a huge expanse of empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the rear entry _ two low barn doors, topped by a
glass swing-up door _ gives great vision out the back of the car.
</P>
<P>
   The inside is spartan, yet comfortable with simple appointments
and gauges on the dash (very trucklike), soft broad seats, and
nifty storage bins all over the place. I particularly like the bin
built into the fold-down back of the front center seat.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning front and rear is wonderfully powerful _ it
provoked complaints from some passengers that, even in the midst of
a sweltering heat wave, it was too cold inside the Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was smooth and surprisingly quiet, given the size of
the vehicle and its V-10 engine.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, on narrow streets, especially with cars parked along the
side, it took some care to maneuver. And you have to be aware of
its length and make wide turns accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   On bigger roads and highways, the ride was somewhat boaty _ far
more spongy than, say, the stiff, trucklike Suburban _ but rides
are a matter of choice so you can fault it for floating a bit. And
since this was a 2-wheel-drive version, it was certainly not as
stiff as will be the 4-wheel-drive models, which will sell better
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprisingly deft on the highway, surging out to pass
with a guttural roar and zipping nimbly past cars half its size,
its leaf springs front and rear keeping the ride smooth as all that
bulk went lane-to-lane.
</P>
<P>
   And it is incredibly powerful: It cruised at 75 while cranking
only 2,100 rpms and its 275-horspower, 410 lbs./ft. of torque will
pull 10,000 pounds of trailer even as the car and its load reach
8,000 pounds. Because it is so big, you have to allow extra braking
time, but the Excursion's four-wheel discs brought it to sure
stops.
</P>
<P>
   You can't test a big SUV these days without talking safety and
environment and Ford has tried to address these issues in the
Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we did get just over 12 miles per gallon in a week of mixed
driving. But Ford points out that the Excursion emits 43 percent
less smog forming emissions than permitted by law.
</P>
<P>
   To address safety _ for both its own passengers and those in
other cars _ Ford has innovated front and rear. They've added a
Blocker Beam, hooked to the front frame rails below the bumper and
attached it with L-shaped brackets that crumple in a front-end
crash. This protects not only the Excursion's occupants, but also
prevents smaller cars from sliding beneath the big Ford. They've
also made a wide, steel towbar frame standard equipment, in effect
adding a second bumper below the high rear bumper.
</P>
<P>
   GM/Chevrolet sold 150,000 Suburbans last year, virtually
comprising the entire heavy duty SUV market. Ford is now going
head-to-head and expects to sell as many as a third of its
Excursions in just two states: Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, after I'd sent the Excursion back, my lasting
impression was this: Nice car _ if you own a big spread out West.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ The low-slung running boards that make getting in and out of
this big truck easy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The storage bins pressed in various configurations all over
what in most cars is a flat dashboard top.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ford did such a nice job with bins everywhere, it's surprising
they didn't put storage pouches on the backs of the front seats.
These are great for atlases.

CALIFORNIA FIRM TURNS CAMRYS INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable, a perennial ``Best Buy'' selection of auto and
consumer magazines ever since it replaced the Corona in 1983. The
best-selling car in America. Comfortable, long-lasting, holds its
value. What more could you want in a car?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 1950s and 1960s when the Chevrolet was the Camry of
today. Plenty of folks saw the USA in their Chevrolet, just as the
jingle urged.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of auto buffs, not rolling in the dough that allowed
for peppier, fancier cars _ big Chryslers and Caddys or 'Vettes or
T-Birds _ tried to turn their Chevrolets, or dad's Chevrolet, into
something, well, more exciting. The need was simple: You couldn't
cruise, or, heaven forbid, show up at the drive-in in just any old
auto.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo: fender skirts, continental kits, chopping, channeling,
cams and carbs. All done aftermarket. Much of it influenced by what
was happening in California. All done with the aim of allowing
those with lesser incomes to dabble in the world of performance and
the perception of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the Camry, the car that Chevrolet
probably wishes it made today.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of them are out there. Lots of folks _ many of them younger
folks _ drive them. And a good segment of this bunch would probably
like to trick theirs out a bit, just like dad and grandpa might
have done with their Chevys and Fords.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to California and back to Toyota: to Toyota
Racing Development of Torrance, Calif. This is a subsidiary of the
auto company that is developing a series of aftermarket performance
packages to give base model Toyotas a distinctive appearance and
boost their performance just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking juicing anything up so much that the
intergrity of the stock car is jeopardized; just that certain
something that says ``This ain't your father's or mother's Camry.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota had to see it being done not only to its own cars, but
particularly to certain Nissans and Hondas that prowl the streets
with tinted glass, lowered stances, spoilers, skirts, and
low-profile tires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wagner, sales supervisor at TRD, says Honda in particular
has proven popular with young drivers and that TRD's aim is to help
Toyota better reach the youth market.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner remembers growing up a car buff in the 1970s when he and
other gearheads drove muscle cars for which they were often the
second and third owners. Today, he says, he sees a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Now, young drivers who get into Toyotas or Hondas or Nissans are
often the first owners of those vehicles _ compliments of mom and
dad. And even those who don't get into brand new cars can lay hands
on fairly recent used cars that are far more reliable than the used
cars of yore.
</P>
<P>
   So it makes sense, Wagner says, to offer these young drivers the
chance to make what they buy just a bit sportier.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why TRD has developed its aftermarket performacne and
appearance package for the Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Take a 1999 3.0-litre V-6 Camry. That's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Give it the standard 194 horsepower with 209 lbs./ft. of torque
pulling around just over 3,000 pounds of automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Nice car, but you won't attract any attention on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let TRD take over. Quickly, you won't recognize the car.
</P>
<P>
   Add the seven-piece body enhancement kit.
</P>
<P>
   Side skirts, rear skirts, front spoiler, rear spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   Gives the car a distinct sports sedan look. Makes it look like
it's hugging the road.
</P>
<P>
   But face it, this is the stuff you see, not the stuff you feel
when you drive it.
</P>
<P>
   So let's fine tune.
</P>
<P>
   Add lowering springs that drop the car 1.25 inches, giving a
real crouch as opposed to a perceived crouch. These chrome,
silicon, high tensile strength springs will give you tighter
tracking, less lateral lean in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   But let's beef that up by adding nitrogen pressurized sport
struts by Bilstein. Cut some more body roll. Add some more
stability. Toyota says this package adds 10 miles per hour to the
base Camry's speed through a standard obstacle course.
</P>
<P>
   Now slap on 16-inch by 7-inch aluminum wheels and some V-rated
tires and all that stability gets some wide bite.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Simple as it is, it works.
</P>
<P>
   The engine hasn't been boosted, so the car won't outrun its
undergear. But what the engine has to offer, this refined version
will eat up in its entirety. Up through a tight, climbing S-curve
that tends to throw some cars off line, the Camry held its line
fine. No drop of weight to strange, disquieting places. No sense
that the car was about to break away.
</P>
<P>
   Put it on dirt and slide it around and the effect is the same.
Sure, nimble _ not Oh-My-God fast, but fun and confident in
handling. A fine way to make a good car a fun car.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay $3,000 to $4,000 for the aftermarket package,
beginning with tires and appearance parts at the low end, moving
through high-performance struts by the time you reach the top.
These are technically aftermarket parts, but Toyota dealers will
install them on any 1997-99 Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Already, word is out on this project.
</P>
<P>
   I rolled into the parking lot of a community center in a small
New Hampshire town and parked the tricked-out Camry. A young guy
came walking out, took one look at what I was sure was a car no one
would recongnize, and asked, ``Has that got the supercharger on
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, TRD is working on a supercharger that will boost horsepower
on the V-6 into the 250 range. These certainly won't be your
fathers' or mothers' Camrys.

 By CARLOS MONJE JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seen from far away, the thin, long boats look like odd
insects gliding along the surface of the Charles River. Up close,
the rowers rock and heave in cadence, dipping their oars into the
water and following the rhythms of the long tradition of the sport
of crew.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the sport drips from the walls of the boathouses
that line the river _ black-and-white photos of Ivy League
regattas, fading pennants, and plaques from long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, a new breed of rowers has rippled the river's calm
waters. These aren't men pulling for the honor of Exeter or fair
Harvard. They are rowing ``por la patria,'' or for the nation, as
part of a new Puerto Rican rowing team.
</P>
<P>
   The four-man team that represented Puerto Rico in the Central
American and Caribbean games last August and at the Head of the
Charles regatta last October started in Boston by training on the
Charles, one of the sport's legendary waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of forming the team, called ``Remo por Puerto Rico'' _
which means ``I row for Puerto Rico,'' began when the team's
captain, Juan Antonio Ruiz-Hau, discovered the sport in his first
year of business school at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a personal dream of mine to represent Puerto
Rico, and rowing offered me an opportunity to do that,'' said
Ruiz-Hau, 27, who was born and raised on the Caribbean island and
came to Boston to get his education.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ruiz-Hau recruited Jean-Paul Folch, a recent
graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who moved to
Boston from Puerto Rico when he was 12, and Guillermo Montero, a
Boston University graduate who was born in Colombia and moved to
Puerto Rico at age 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happened to be guys who could row and who were from
Puerto Rico,'' Montero said. ``Any time you're going to represent
your country as an athlete, you're doing what you love. It's a
great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling team approached Gordon Hamilton, the varsity
heavyweight crew coach at MIT, with the idea of creating a
Boston-based Puerto Rican team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like an interesting project,'' said Hamilton, who
has coached crew teams in Latin America and is interested in how
the sport is evolving there.
</P>
<P>
   Both Folch and Montero had rowed while in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right out of college I was looking for a way to keep rowing,''
Folch said.
</P>
<P>
   The team was rounded out by Juan Manuel Ruiz-Hau, Juan Antonio's
younger brother, a Massachusetts College of Arts graduate who had
never rowed before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him you've got the height, you've got the size, and we
need you,'' Juan Antonio Ruiz-Hau said.
</P>
<P>
   His brother said ``the hardest thing was working our training
schedule around our work schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   So, starting last spring, the four men would slide their rented
shell, as the boats are called, into the Charles for an hour of
practice before trudging off to full-time jobs. And as the Central
American and Caribbean Games neared, they put in extra hours after
work.
</P>
<P>
   One key step for the new team was ironing out its relationship
with Puerto Rico's official rowing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote them and told them we have a quad team that would like
to compete in the Central American Games,'' said Dr. Juan Ruiz, the
team's manager and father of Juan Antonio and Juan Manuel Ruiz-Hau.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican national team's response: the Boston-based team
would race against the national team and the winner would represent
Puerto Rico in the games.
</P>
<P>
   Remo por Puerto Rico won.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team came in second to last in a race against teams
from Cuba, El Salvador, Mexico, and Guatemala, team members said
the experience was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a true honor to represent Puerto Rico, and because it
was a goal for such a long time it was a bonding experience for the
team,'' Juan Antonio Ruiz-Hau said.
</P>
<P>
   The team also raced at the Head of the Charles last year,
placing 17th out of 58 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, members of Remo por Puerto Rico want to pass the crewing
bug to young Latinos, most of whom have never heard of the sport,
let alone been inside a shell.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the team hosted a two-week camp on rowing for a
handful of Hispanic youths from the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic assumption of the camp is to open the sport to
everybody,'' Ruiz said. ``Rowing is a very exclusive sport. If you
don't go to an upscale college or are not a member of a rowing
club, then you can't row.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp started with the basics: a swim test and a film about
rowing. But by the third day, the youths were on the Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to tip over. I kept rocking back and
forth,'' said Julian Rossello-Cornier, 14, a Puerto Rican native
living in Mattapan. ``I had to hold on to the dock.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks and one gentle collision later, the youngsters seemed
comfortable in their one-person boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part is the tiny little things like going into
your catch with your wrists straight,'' said Nigel
Rossello-Cornier, 16, Julian's brother, referring to the point when
a rower pulls back on the oars to catch the water's resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to make it fun enough for them to come
back next year,'' Montero said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Remo por Puerto Rico's future, the team is on a summer
hiatus as its members decide on their next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all got career decisions to make,'' Juan Antonio
Ruiz-Hau said.
</P>
<P>
   A run at the Olympics is not out of the question. ``They
certainly could represent Puerto Rico,'' Hamilton said.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola Enterprises executives are taking nothing for granted
as they rebuild the brand's image in Europe.
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Murphy's Law _ anything that can go wrong will go
wrong _ paints too rosy a picture of life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Henry Schimberg believes in the wake of the European
health scare that engulfed his Atlanta-based bottling company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we were working under Schimberg's Law,'' said
the 66-year-old president and chief executive of Coca-Cola
Enterprises. ``Schimberg's Law is very simple: Murphy was an
optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg, who has been in the soft drink business for more than
40 years, said the recall of all Coca-Cola products in Belgium in
June ranked as the worst professional experience of his life. Two
CCE-owned plants _ one in Belgium and the other in France _
produced the beverages that caused illnesses to nearly 250
Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is good and 10 is as bad as it gets, this is a 9.85,''
Schimberg said last week in his first in-depth interview about the
crisis. ``I don't know how you can get much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He then invoked a 19th century quotation from Friedrich
Nietzsche: ``What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Coca-Cola system is counting on that principle as it
attempts to recover from the largest and most damaging recall in
its 113-year history.
</P>
<P>
   CCE withdrew some 17 million beverage cases from the Belgian
market at a cost of $103 million. That figure doesn't include the
tens of millions of dollars in lost sales still piling up for CCE
and Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of the world's largest
soft drink bottler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have one overriding issue, and that is to regain
the confidence of the customers in every country affected by the
recall,'' Schimberg said. In addition to Belgium and France,
several other European nations imposed full or partial bans on Coke
products for about two weeks in June.
</P>
<P>
   To recover from this debacle, CCE and Coca-Cola Co. have teamed
up on a multipronged marketing and advertising strategy that
appears to be working. The goal is to contain the reverberating
effects on Coke's image and sales to the second and third quarters,
preventing any spillover beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving in the right direction at a fast speed,'' said
Philippe Lenfant, CCE's general manager in Belgium. He has been on
the front line of the crisis since June 8, when the first teenagers
reported getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Lenfant added, however, that there has not been a full recovery
yet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a July survey of European consumers by the Goldman
Sachs investment firm found a ``meaningful'' 14 percent with a
deteriorating overall perception of Coca-Cola products. In
addition, only 81 percent of Coca-Cola consumers indicated they
will definitely continue to buy company products in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In both Belgium and France, CCE and Coca-Cola Co. are tracking
consumer sentiment on a daily basis. While officials would not
reveal the specific results, they said there was significant
improvement in July.
</P>
<P>
   But accurate sales figures are still hard to come by, especially
in Belgium, because executives don't really know how to separate
out three different types of purchases:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sales related to the restocking of retail shelves and consumer
refrigerators after the recall;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sales driven by the super-promotional efforts now under way;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sales that would have been registered regardless of the other
two variables.
</P>
<P>
   Still, June's pessimism has been washed away by recent events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more fun today than six weeks ago,'' Lenfant said
during a lengthy interview with several CCE officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the recovery to be very quick,'' added Dominique
Reiniche, CCE's general manager in France.
</P>
<P>
   Executives attribute the partial turnaround to the considerable
brand strength Coca-Cola had before the health scare, as well as to
the intensity with which it has been trying to repair the
situation. An enormous amount of time, energy and money is being
spent trying to preserve Coke's leading market share _ 64 percent
in Belgium and 55 percent in France, according to Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof will be how they manage to reassure people,'' said
Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Cohen. ``It must be executed well. I
think they're doing OK so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, when the product bans were lifted in late June, the
companies concentrated their advertising and marketing efforts on
apologizing to consumers, thanking them for their previous loyalty
and telling them that Coca-Cola will work hard to regain it.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and CCE also tried to explain the limited nature of
the quality and health problems. They pointed out that the causes
of the nausea and vomiting _ defective carbon dioxide and a
fungicide that got on the outside of some cans _ did not pose a
health threat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the apology and education phases behind them, the
companies are aggressively marketing their brands in more
traditional ways, emphasizing the standard summertime themes of
pleasure and refreshment under the general umbrella, ``Your
Coca-Cola is back.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the system is involved in many more
promotions than it would have been had the health scare not
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Belgium, Coke and CCE have organized
product-sampling events outside thousands of stores every weekend
over the past several weeks. The last such events end today,
indicating that the companies feel the need to reassure consumers
is waning.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the companies are trucking in sand to stage beach parties,
and they're sponsoring about 100 other events at which Coke is
given away.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, the companies are planning to mount special
programs to bolster their image at schools, where many of the
sicknesses occurred, as well as in small shops and pubs that often
get overlooked in favor of the larger supermarkets. But the system
is no longer in a position to take anything for granted as it tries
to regain some retail shelf space lost to competitors during the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts come after trying to get a free bottle of Coke
into every Belgian household. What's more, 2,500 employee
``ambassadors'' were each dispatched with a free case of Coke to
share with friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In France, meanwhile, 5 million leaflets were distributed in
stores to complement a substantial media advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other key part of the comeback, especially for CCE, which
bottles and distributes the beverages, is on the production side.
</P>
<P>
   The company's manufacturing system is now meeting about 90
percent of existing demand because it had to go into overdrive to
restock the pipeline with beverages following the recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked our employees to work like hell,'' Lenfant said.
``We were forced to take back 17 million cases in a couple of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Since getting the green light to resume production, CCE's plants
have been operating around the clock, seven days a week. In more
normal times, they only would be operating one or two shifts a day,
five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   It will take until the third week of August to get all of Coke's
beverages in all of their different sizes and containers back on
the shelves in the appropriate numbers, Lenfant said.
</P>
<P>
   While employees have been working extremely hard, CCE executives
said, they haven't grown weary yet because of the positive momentum
that appears to be building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get Coca-Cola in the blood,'' said Norman Findley,
president of CCE's European operations. ``Those first weeks were
very difficult, the most difficult in my 23 years in the Coke
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with a turnaround under way, Findley subscribes
less to Murphy's and Schimberg's laws and more to a paraphrase of
Charles Dickens: ``This was the worst of times and the best of
times.''

<P>
   Contrary to widespread public opinion, the danger of a nuclear
confrontation between the United States and Russia has not receded.
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO-Yugoslavia war, the tension between the two
powers rose to some of the highest levels since the Cuban missile
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans: 'Don't push us toward
military action. Otherwise, there will be a European war for sure
and possibly world war,''' said Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Even former President Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who did more
than anyone else to end the Cold War, said that U.S. ambitions to
exercise global hegemony were risking ``even, perhaps, a hot war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that if we want to cause you a problem
over this, we could,'' said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Foreign
Policy Committee in the Russian State Duma, or parliament.
``Someone, we don't know who, could send up a missile from a ship
or a submarine and detonate a nuclear weapon high over the United
States. The EMP (electromagnetic pulse that destroys electronic and
computer equipment) would take away all your capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in response to the bombing, Anatoly Kvashin, chief of the
Russian General Staff, said, ``If the question `is to be or not to
be' for Russia, we must use everything we have in the armed forces,
including nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, during the NATO bombing of Iraq, Yeltsin, erratic
and in failing health, also threatened world war. Such comments
should not be dismissed as mere rhetoric or hot-headed talk. It's
no secret that Russia is going through a highly volatile period,
and its instability makes the rest of the world that much less
secure.
</P>
<P>
   There are its political upheavals and multiple prime ministers,
but Russia is also in grievous economic distress, has no practical
recourse to conventional (non-nuclear) military capability and has
a deteriorating weapons command-and-control infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has little money to maintain its equipment, to train its
forces or to replace broken and defective machinery. It cannot even
pay its armed forces personnel regularly. Mistreatment of ordinary
soldiers is so rife that people are afraid to send their sons into
the military. The suicide rate among recruits is high.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this military weakness, Yeltsin in April approved
``a blueprint for the development and use of nonstrategic nuclear
weapons,'' which would modernize some of the tactical and
short-range weapons Russia removed from its arsenal several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is a major step backward _ a severe setback for arms
control and disarmament. The gains of the hopeful first years after
the fall of the Berlin Wall, when U.S. and Russian leaders could
act in concert, are being rapidly eroded.
</P>
<P>
   There is little prospect that START II, the treaty that would
reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal from 6,000 to about 3,000 warheads,
will be ratified in the absence of new actions by the United
States. Although negotiations are set to resume, it is clear that
the Russian reliance on nuclear weapons is unlikely to change
without a U.S. move that is sensitive to Moscow's security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the Russian military, there is a widespread feeling that in
the event of a conflict with NATO, the country has no usable
military muscle other than nuclear weapons. As such, even
Gorbachev's actions to remove battlefield nuclear weapons from
their arsenal may be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the West, the talk remains aggressive. In its new
strategic doctrine announced at the April summit, NATO did not rule
out deploying tactical nuclear weapons of its own. But nuclear war
between Washington and Moscow looms as reality now, during these
times of increased political ambiguity and tension, not so much
from a deliberate command as from accidents, miscommunications or
computer foul-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Only four years ago, a communications error between the two
countries almost did lead to nuclear war. In 1995, Russian radar
detected an incoming missile fired from Norway, and this set off a
nuclear alert. The black suitcase for the initiation of a nuclear
attack reached President Yelltsin. The world was only a few minutes
away from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   The initial trajectory seemed to be that of a missile fired from
a forward-based U.S. Trident submarine. The alert was called off
when the projectile began to follow a course that turned away from
Russia. In this case, Russian radar and command systems actually
did work. What did not work properly was the U.S.-Russian
communication system.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had issued only a routine warning of a joint
U.S.-Norwegian research rocket launch, even though it was aware
that the device resembled a Trident missile.
</P>
<P>
   On the Russian side, the warning of a research mission was lost
in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all found ourselves under stress,'' Antoly Solokov, the
commander of the Russian radar forces, told The Washington Post.
``An officer on duty reported detecting a ballistic missile which
started from the Norwegian territory. What kind of missile is it?
What is its target? We were not informed.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at past crises shows that misunderstandings and false
nuclear alerts are indeed more likely to occur during times of
tension.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all the turmoil now in Russia comes the threat of the
Year 2000 _ or Y2K _ bug. By all accounts, nuclear warheads or
missiles will not go off due to malfunctions of computer chips or
software. They will require some human command. But there is
vulnerability within the communications infrastructure _ including
the messages to the satellites that detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States had a program to address Y2K's
potential nuclear command-and-control problems. They were planning
to create a computer communications center, staffed by U.S. and
Russian military personnel. But when the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
began, the project was put on hold. By now, U.S.-Russian
cooperation has improved, but work on the joint communications
center is still suspended.
</P>
<P>
   So far as Russian equipment is concerned, the most urgent need
is funding to fix the problems. There is widespread concern that
there may be electrical power and telecommunications failures. It
is difficult to be confident of the claims of Russia's nuclear
military officials that they are successfully addressing the
problems, given the mess at the top in Russia _ the lack of funds,
difficulties of organization and deteriorating infrastructure, not
to mention Yeltsin's unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   The first step the United States and Russia should take to
reduce the risk of nuclear weapons is to move them off of
hair-trigger alert. In 1994, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin
announced, with much fanfare, that they were ``de-targeting''
nuclear weapons. This is not the same as de-alerting. In fact,
detargeting barely makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Detargeting changes the coordinates in the programmed commands
of a nuclear system away from the intended target, but this can be
reversed in less than one minute by simply punching new target
coordinates into a keyboard. The small gain, de-targeting, is
entirely unequal to the task of reducing nuclear risk.
</P>
<P>
   Without bold new moves on the part of the United States, serious
nuclear dangers are likely to persist. While current U.S. law
prevents Clinton from reducing strategic nuclear forces below START
II limits of 3,000 to 3,500 strategic warheads, he can still take a
number of initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can declare that the United States will not initiate a
first strike.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can assure Moscow that NATO expansion is not aimed at
Russia and specifically not intended to bring nuclear weapons
closer to that country's borders.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can remove all the nuclear bombs that the United States has
stationed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can remove U.S. Trident submarines positioned near Russian
waters. Such forward deployment is very dangerous and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Above all, he should place nuclear weapons on de-alert status
to eliminate, as much as technically possible, the danger of
nuclear war by accident or miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to accurately predict the risks of the Y2K bug,
especially given the wobbly nature of the U.S.- Russian
relationship and the lack of funds and time to address the issue in
Russia. But the risks of a nuclear launch due to communication
failure must be eliminated _ no matter how small a threat officials
feel it might be.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should take the initiative to de-alert its
nuclear weapons before the end of the year and work with Russia to
get a reciprocal action. The specific measures taken in the coming
weeks and months should be the sort that would make it physically
impossible to rapidly launch a nuclear strike in response to
detection of an incoming missile.
</P>
<P>
   Such measures would ensure that Y2K-related problems do not
result in a mistaken nuclear launch and that the gains in nuclear
risk reduction will endure into the next century.

away from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   The initial trajectory seemed to be that of a missile fired from
a forward-based U.S. Trident submarine. The alert was called off
when the projectile began to follow a course that turned away from
Russia. In this case, Russian radar and command systems actually
did work. What did not work properly was the U.S.-Russian
communication system.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had issued only a routine warning of a joint
U.S.-Norwegian research rocket launch, even though it was aware
that the device resembled a Trident missile.
</P>
<P>
   On the Russian side, the warning of a research mission was lost
in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all found ourselves under stress,'' Antoly Solokov, the
commander of the Russian radar forces, told The Washington Post.
``An officer on duty reported detecting a ballistic missile which
started from the Norwegian territory. What kind of missile is it?
What is its target? We were not informed.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at past crises shows that misunderstandings and false
nuclear alerts are indeed more likely to occur during times of
tension.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all the turmoil now in Russia comes the threat of the
Year 2000 _ or Y2K _ bug. By all accounts, nuclear warheads or
missiles will not go off due to malfunctions of computer chips or
software. They will require some human command. But there is
vulnerability within the communications infrastructure _ including
the messages to the satellites that detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States had a program to address Y2K's
potential nuclear command-and-control problems. They were planning
to create a computer communications center, staffed by U.S. and
Russian military personnel. But when the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
began, the project was put on hold. By now, U.S.-Russian
cooperation has improved, but work on the joint communications
center is still suspended.
</P>
<P>
   So far as Russian equipment is concerned, the most urgent need
is funding to fix the problems. There is widespread concern that
there may be electrical power and telecommunications failures. It
is difficult to be confident of the claims of Russia's nuclear
military officials that they are successfully addressing the
problems, given the mess at the top in Russia _ the lack of funds,
difficulties of organization and deteriorating infrastructure, not
to mention Yeltsin's unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   The first step the United States and Russia should take to
reduce the risk of nuclear weapons is to move them off of
hair-trigger alert. In 1994, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin
announced, with much fanfare, that they were ``de-targeting''
nuclear weapons. This is not the same as de-alerting. In fact,
detargeting barely makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Detargeting changes the coordinates in the programmed commands
of a nuclear system away from the intended target, but this can be
reversed in less than one minute by simply punching new target
coordinates into a keyboard. The small gain, de-targeting, is
entirely unequal to the task of reducing nuclear risk.
</P>
<P>
   Without bold new moves on the part of the United States, serious
nuclear dangers are likely to persist. While current U.S. law
prevents Clinton from reducing strategic nuclear forces below START
II limits of 3,000 to 3,500 strategic warheads, he can still take a
number of initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can declare that the United States will not initiate a
first strike.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can assure Moscow that NATO expansion is not aimed at
Russia and specifically not intended to bring nuclear weapons
closer to that country's borders.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can remove all the nuclear bombs that the United States has
stationed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can remove U.S. Trident submarines positioned near Russian
waters. Such forward deployment is very dangerous and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Above all, he should place nuclear weapons on de-alert status
to eliminate, as much as technically possible, the danger of
nuclear war by accident or miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to accurately predict the risks of the Y2K bug,
especially given the wobbly nature of the U.S.- Russian
relationship and the lack of funds and time to address the issue in
Russia. But the risks of a nuclear launch due to communication
failure must be eliminated _ no matter how small a threat officials
feel it might be.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should take the initiative to de-alert its
nuclear weapons before the end of the year and work with Russia to
get a reciprocal action. The specific measures taken in the coming
weeks and months should be the sort that would make it physically
impossible to rapidly launch a nuclear strike in response to
detection of an incoming missile.
</P>
<P>
   Such measures would ensure that Y2K-related problems do not
result in a mistaken nuclear launch and that the gains in nuclear
risk reduction will endure into the next century.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Earlier this year the American Psychological Association
published an article in its prestigious journal, ''Psychological
Bulletin,'' that alleged that if a child is ''willing'' to have sex
with an adult, it could be a positive experience.
 &HT;    Experts denounced the study as a first step on the road toward
normalizing pedophilia.
 &HT;    The APA responded with assurances that it believed ''child
sexual abuse is seriously harmful.''
 &HT;    Why then did it publish a study arguing the opposite position?
''We publish studies not because we agree or disagree, if it can
pass our peer review process,'' said the APA's spokesman.
 &HT;    That is irresponsible and destructive. When a pedophile gets
arrested for having sex with a child, his attorney can now cite a
highly publicized study suggesting that it was harmless, on the
ground that the child was ''willing.''
 &HT;    To its credit, the APA later apologized.
 &HT;    Once again, however, the APA's ''Psychological Bulletin'' has
published an irresponsible study called ''Deconstructing the
Essential Father,'' which alleges that fathers do not ''make a
unique and essential contribution to child development.''
 &HT;    OK, dads, now you know there is no point in playing ball with
your kids, or taking the time to talk with them about morality or
politics or money. You have nothing unique to offer.
 &HT;    What nonsense.
 &HT;    Twenty years of research were simply ignored by the article's
authors, Professors Louise Silverstein and Carl Auerbach at Yeshiva
University. Children living in fatherless homes are six times as
likely as those with intact parents, to be in poverty or to commit
suicide, three times as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock,
and twice as likely to drop out of school or to be arrested for
crimes.
 &HT;    Yeshiva's scholars acknowledge that ''the presence of a father
may have some positive effects on the well-being of boys,'' but
they dismiss this research. Why? The culture's support of ''male
dominance and negative attitudes toward women may interfere with
the ability of many single mothers to establish an authoritative
parenting style with male children.'' Good grief!
 &HT;    The authors allege, ''It is difficult to differentiate the
effects of father absence from the effects of low income,'' due to
the loss of the father's income.
 &HT;    Cornell Professor Urie Bronfenbrenner, a prominent developmental
psychologist disagrees: ''Controlling for factors such as low
income, children growing up in (father absent) households are at a
greater risk for experiencing a variety of behavioral and
educational problems, including ... the so-called `teenage
syndrome' of behaviors that tend to hang together -- smoking,
drinking, early and frequent sexual experience, and in the more
extreme cases, drugs, suicide, vandalism, violence and criminal
acts.''
 &HT;    What do Silverstein and Auerbach say about such findings? ''We
do not find any empirical support that marriage enhances fathering
or that marriage civilizes men and protects children.''
 &HT;    The authors make the preposterous claim that marriage is harmful
because of ''some fathers' consumption of family resources in terms
of gambling, purchasing alcohol, cigarettes, or other nonessential
commodities.''
 &HT;    It is wacko psychology like this that gives the profession a bad
time.
 &HT;    They even assert that divorce is not all that bad for children,
citing the research of Paul Amato and Allan Booth, who wrote,
''...although children from low-conflict marriages are negatively
effected by divorce, the adjustment of children in high-conflict
marriages actually improves after divorce.''
 &HT;    That distorts the findings of Amato and Booth, who estimate that
only about 30 percent of all divorces in America are the result of
high-conflict marriages. For the 70 percent of marriages in
low-conflict situations, they say ''future generations would be
well-served if parents remained together until the children are
grown.''
 &HT;    Dr. Norman Lamm, President of Yeshiva University, was so
embarrassed by the study that though he defended the authors'
academic freedom to publish it, he said, ''I take strong exception
to many of the views expressed in the article, including those that
question the value of the traditional family unit. The concept of
the nuclear family is engrained in Jewish history, law and culture,
and it has sustained Western civilization for thousands of years.''
 &HT;    Once again the APA is hiding behind what it says was a
''rigorous peer review'' of the article, while adding that it, too,
''recognizes that the family constitutes a basic unit of society.''
 &HT;    It is time for the Yeshiva scholars to remember the commandment,
''Honor your father and your mother...so that you may live long and
that it may go well with you.'

GAS PRICES HIT RECORD TERRITORY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The American Automobile Association of Northern
California says the price of regular unleaded gasoline in San
Francisco hit an all-time high on Tuesday, rising to an average of
$1.75 per gallon, up a penny over the previous high set April 20.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry attributed the high prices to high summer
driving demand and reduced production because of problems at
several California refineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the second time this year, many consumers are paying
record-high prices at the gas pumps,'' said Paul Moreno, a
spokesman for the AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Federal Trade Commission and the state attorney general
are investigating the pricing to determine whether the higher costs
are in any way the result of anti-competitive forces.
</P>
<P>
   The prices in Northern California are the highest in the nation,
the AAA said in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA surveyed gas stations in eight Northern California
cities from July 20 to Aug. 10. The survey tracked the price of a
gallon of self-service unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   The last price spike in April _ which was especially dramatic
because it followed a period when gas prices reached a seven-year
low _ was also the result of refinery problems and a sharp increase
in the price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Chevron, Tosco and Exxon have all had production
problems, such as explosions, at their refineries in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil cost under $10 a barrel Feb. 16, when gasoline prices
bottomed out at an average of $1.18 per gallon, and demand was low.
Crude oil Tuesday was selling for $19.32 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a gallon of self-service unleaded in San
Jose was $1.66, up 6 cents in the past three weeks to tie its April
high; the price is $1.64 per gallon in Chico, up 7 cents and a
penny shy of the city's record in April of $1.65.
</P>
<P>
   A new high was set in Eureka Tuesday: $1.81, up 6 cents from
three weeks ago. In Fresno, the price is $1.60, up 14 cents from
July 20 and 2 cents below that city's record, set in April.
</P>
<P>
   In Monterey, the price for a gallon was $1.66, up a nickel and 5
cents shy of the April high. The price of gas in Oakland averaged
$1.64, up 6 cents and 8 cents below the city's high of $1.72 set in
April.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento gas cost $1.61 per gallon, up a dime over July 20
and 6 cents shy of the city's high of $1.67 in April.
</P>
<P>
   Oil production cuts by OPEC-member nations have pushed crude oil
prices higher, but other forces may put downward pressure on
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say gasoline production is improving in the state and
imports of California-grade gasoline will help offset tight
supplies. State law requires that gasoline sold in California must
be cleaner burning than that sold in other states.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola Enterprises executives are taking nothing for granted
as they rebuild the brand's image in Europe.
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Murphy's Law _ anything that can go wrong will go
wrong _ paints too rosy a picture of life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Henry Schimberg believes in the wake of the European
health scare that engulfed his Atlanta-based bottling company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we were working under Schimberg's Law,'' said
the 66-year-old president and chief executive of Coca-Cola
Enterprises. ``Schimberg's Law is very simple: Murphy was an
optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg, who has been in the soft drink business for more than
40 years, said the recall of all Coca-Cola products in Belgium in
June ranked as the worst professional experience of his life. Two
CCE-owned plants _ one in Belgium and the other in France _
produced the beverages that caused illnesses to nearly 250
Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is good and 10 is as bad as it gets, this is a 9.85,''
Schimberg said recently in his first in-depth interview about the
crisis. ``I don't know how you can get much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He then invoked a 19th century quotation from Friedrich
Nietzsche: ``What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Coca-Cola system is counting on that principle as it
attempts to recover from the largest and most damaging recall in
its 113-year history.
</P>
<P>
   CCE withdrew some 17 million beverage cases from the Belgian
market at a cost of $103 million. That figure doesn't include the
tens of millions of dollars in lost sales still piling up for CCE
and Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of the world's largest
soft drink bottler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have one overriding issue, and that is to regain
the confidence of the customers in every country affected by the
recall,'' Schimberg said. In addition to Belgium and France,
several other European nations imposed full or partial bans on Coke
products for about two weeks in June.
</P>
<P>
   To recover from this debacle, CCE and Coca-Cola Co. have teamed
up on a multipronged marketing and advertising strategy that
appears to be working. The goal is to contain the reverberating
effects on Coke's image and sales to the second and third quarters,
preventing any spillover beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving in the right direction at a fast speed,'' said
Philippe Lenfant, CCE's general manager in Belgium. He has been on
the front line of the crisis since June 8, when the first teenagers
reported getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Lenfant added, however, that there has not been a full recovery
yet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a July survey of European consumers by the Goldman
Sachs investment firm found a ``meaningful'' 14 percent with a
deteriorating overall perception of Coca-Cola products. In
addition, only 81 percent of Coca-Cola consumers indicated they
will definitely continue to buy company products in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In both Belgium and France, CCE and Coca-Cola Co. are tracking
consumer sentiment on a daily basis. While officials would not
reveal the specific results, they said there was significant
improvement in July.
</P>
<P>
   But accurate sales figures are still hard to come by, especially
in Belgium, because executives don't really know how to separate
out three different types of purchases:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sales related to the restocking of retail shelves and consumer
refrigerators after the recall;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sales driven by the super-promotional efforts now under way;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sales that would have been registered regardless of the other
two variables.
</P>
<P>
   Still, June's pessimism has been washed away by recent events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more fun today than six weeks ago,'' Lenfant said
during a recent engthy interview with several CCE officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the recovery to be very quick,'' added Dominique
Reiniche, CCE's general manager in France.
</P>
<P>
   Executives attribute the partial turnaround to the considerable
brand strength Coca-Cola had before the health scare, as well as to
the intensity with which it has been trying to repair the
situation. An enormous amount of time, energy and money is being
spent trying to preserve Coke's leading market share _ 64 percent
in Belgium and 55 percent in France, according to Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof will be how they manage to reassure people,'' said
Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Cohen. ``It must be executed well. I
think they're doing OK so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, when the product bans were lifted in late June, the
companies concentrated their advertising and marketing efforts on
apologizing to consumers, thanking them for their previous loyalty
and telling them that Coca-Cola will work hard to regain it.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and CCE also tried to explain the limited nature of
the quality and health problems. They pointed out that the causes
of the nausea and vomiting _ defective carbon dioxide and a
fungicide that got on the outside of some cans _ did not pose a
health threat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the apology and education phases behind them, the
companies are aggressively marketing their brands in more
traditional ways, emphasizing the standard summertime themes of
pleasure and refreshment under the general umbrella, ``Your
Coca-Cola is back.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the system is involved in many more
promotions than it would have been had the health scare not
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Belgium, Coke and CCE have organized
product-sampling events outside thousands of stores every weekend
over the past several weeks. The last such events end today,
indicating that the companies feel the need to reassure consumers
is waning.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the companies are trucking in sand to stage beach parties,
and they're sponsoring about 100 other events at which Coke is
given away.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, the companies are planning to mount special
programs to bolster their image at schools, where many of the
sicknesses occurred, as well as in small shops and pubs that often
get overlooked in favor of the larger supermarkets. But the system
is no longer in a position to take anything for granted as it tries
to regain some retail shelf space lost to competitors during the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts come after trying to get a free bottle of Coke
into every Belgian household. What's more, 2,500 employee
``ambassadors'' were each dispatched with a free case of Coke to
share with friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In France, meanwhile, 5 million leaflets were distributed in
stores to complement a substantial media advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other key part of the comeback, especially for CCE, which
bottles and distributes the beverages, is on the production side.
</P>
<P>
   The company's manufacturing system is now meeting about 90
percent of existing demand because it had to go into overdrive to
restock the pipeline with beverages following the recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked our employees to work like hell,'' Lenfant said.
``We were forced to take back 17 million cases in a couple of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Since getting the green light to resume production, CCE's plants
have been operating around the clock, seven days a week. In more
normal times, they only would be operating one or two shifts a day,
five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   It will take until the third week of August to get all of Coke's
beverages in all of their different sizes and containers back on
the shelves in the appropriate numbers, Lenfant said.
</P>
<P>
   While employees have been working extremely hard, CCE executives
said, they haven't grown weary yet because of the positive momentum
that appears to be building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get Coca-Cola in the blood,'' said Norman Findley,
president of CCE's European operations. ``Those first weeks were
very difficult, the most difficult in my 23 years in the Coke
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with a turnaround under way, Findley subscribes
less to Murphy's and Schimberg's laws and more to a paraphrase of
Charles Dickens: ``This was the worst of times and the best of
times.''

FED OFFICIAL CONFIDENT OF SOLID GROWTH, TAME INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of the San Francisco District of the
Federal Reserve says American productivity is on a roll and there
is little to indicated that it will not continue in the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Federal Reserve Board will decide Aug. 24 whether
to boost interest rates for the second time this summer, Robert T.
Parry, the San Francisco District president, said the quick pace of
productivity growth helps keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sustained strength in productivity growth, the economy
can enjoy faster growth, lower unemployment, growing real wages and
low inflation,'' Parry told the Commercial Real Estate Women of San
Francisco on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Parry had no comment on options for Fed policy makers when they
meet. A boost in interest rates to head off inflation could slow
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate on
overnight loans between banks by one-quarter of a percentage point
to 5 percent on June 30. Parry is not currently a voting member of
the policy-making group, but he advises members.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. worker productivity grew 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter
of last year, the fastest pace in six years, but slowed to 1.3
percent in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that the productivity pickup won't last very
long, because it might just be due to the strong business cycle
upswing we've been in,'' Parry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case, continued strong growth and low unemployment
would create pressures for inflation to increase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, some evidence exists to suggest
there will be a fundamental shift in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Parry said strong U.S. consumption spending may
indicate, ``especially to economists,'' that the public is
confident the economy will continue to expand, ``and so may some of
the strength of the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   A fundamental shift in productivity would most likely be related
to the use of computers, software and other high-tech advances, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If a faster rate of productivity growth is permanent, ``We still
have to be cautious,'' he said. It may not be fast enough to keep
inflationary pressures down in the face of rapidly expanding
demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parry added, ``These, then, are the main issues the Fed will be
concerned with in the coming months: There are risks for future
U.S. inflation, given the improved prospects abroad, given
continued rapid growth in domestic demand and given tight labor
markets. And though more rapid productivity growth tends to
mitigate these risks, we can't be certain if it will be sustained,
or if it will be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry said later that, notwithstanding recent improvements in
Asian economies that have particular export significance to
California, those nations must still make fundamental changes in
their economic systems to have any long-term rally.
</P>
<P>
   Asian nations, particularly China and Japan, need to re-evaluate
the quality of loans their institutions make, he said. ``That's a
problem and it's very significant and it will be a constraint on
their ability to provide further financing in the future.''

90210 IS PASSE FOR THE AFFLUENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The famed 90210 ZIP code of Beverly Hills is,
like, so '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the preeminent symbol of the megarich, ZIP codes in
the San Francisco Bay Area have become the dominant digits in the
prestige real estate of California.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the top 10 cities and communities with the highest
median home prices in the state are concentrated in the Bay Area,
especially around the Silicon Valley, according to second-quarter
figures released Wednesday by the California Association of
Realtors and Transamerica Intellitech, a real estate information
service.
</P>
<P>
   The median price is the midpoint, meaning half the home prices
were higher and half were lower.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton took the top spot with a median home price of $1.9
million. The only Southern California cities to make the list were
Beverly Hills and Pacific Palisades, ranking ninth and tenth
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say, it's the revenge of the nerds,'' said Leslie
Appleton-Young, chief economist with the California Association of
Realtors. ``You can't beat the tech industry. The tech industry is
not only competing with the entertainment business now, it's part
of the entertainment business.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market and technology jobs are playing a critical role
in buying habits, she said. ``There is a lot of new, young talent
moving into Silicon Valley and the communities. They are looking at
(the) high-end communities within an easy commute of where they
work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the rest of the top 10 behind Atherton were Los
Altos Hills, Hillsborough, Woodside, Monte Sereno,
Belvedere/Tiburon, Saratoga and Los Altos.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those cities and areas appeared on the list for the same
quarter of 1998, but that list included six Bay Area cities and
four in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Only two cities in last year's comparison, Hillsborough and
Atherton, had median home prices in excess of $1 million. This
year, homes in five areas, all in Northern California, passed that
mark.
</P>
<P>
   While the median price for an average California home looked
considerably more affordable in comparison to the top 10, those
numbers also were the highest on record. The median price of an
existing, single-family detached home for the second quarter this
year was $224,740, up 10.7 percent from $203,020 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, the median price hit $359,360, a 9.1 percent
increase from the second quarter of 1998. For San Francisco proper,
the price was $367,500, 14.5 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the regions of San Diego, Monterey, the Northern
California wine country, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo posted
double-digit increases in median home prices.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 California cities and communities with the largest annual
increase in their respective median home prices in the second
quarter of 1999 compared to last year were Twentynine Palms,
Woodside, Fillmore, West Hollywood, Monte Sereno,
Belvedere/Tiburon, Atherton, Pacific Grove, Albany and Aptos.
</P>
<P>
   Homes prices in Albany jumped 27.8 percent to $312,500 in the
second quarter from $244,500 last year. On the high end, Monte
Sereno in Santa Clara County rose 32.4 percent to $1.125 million
from $850,000 last year.

CELEBRITIES PAY TRIBUTE TO TEACHERS, OTHER MENTORS IN NEW BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The former first lady of New York singled out her
fourth-grade teacher at Brooklyn's P.S. 137, Mrs. Kuyler, as the
person outside the family who most strongly influenced her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my first mentor beyond my parents. She took the time
to talk to me, draw me out, and share my thoughts about what I
might do when I grew up,'' Matilda Raffa Cuomo explained. ``Every
child needs people who will reach out to them. I don't think anyone
would dispute that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 79 celebrities and politicians support Cuomo's creed.
Their brief tributes to individual mentors can be found in a new
book, ``The Person Who Changed My Life: Prominent Americans Recall
Their Mentors'' (Carol Publishing), edited by Cuomo with a foreword
by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   From Cindy Crawford and Christopher Reeve to Geraldo Rivera and
Walter Cronkite, not to mention Cuomo's husband, Mario, she has
compiled a who's who list of famous folks singing hosannas to the
men and women who inspired them. Not surprisingly, many name at
least one teacher who was instrumental in their development.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, who earlier this year celebrated her 45th wedding
anniversary with the man who was New York's governor from 1982 to
1994, now lives in Manhattan's ritzy Sutton Place South
neighborhood. She briefly taught second grade in Queens, before the
first of their five children was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a teacher by profession and I know how important a teacher
is in the lives of children,'' she said during a telephone
interview. ``We seem to have gotten away from the great respect we
have for teachers, but you can tell in these peoples' stories how
important their teachers were for them.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new cause for Cuomo. She founded the New York
State Mentoring Program in 1983, an elementary-school-based
intervention program that linked adult volunteers on a one-on-one
basis with children at risk of dropping out of school. In 1995 she
went national, establishing Mentoring USA, which has since been
folded into Help USA, the nonprofit organization headed by her
daughter, Maria Cuomo Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo will not receive any money for her first book project. She
noted that she has donated all her profits to Mentoring USA.
</P>
<P>
   She credits another daughter, Madeline, for the idea for the
book, which took more than two years to complete. Cuomo said she
interviewed roughly half of the celebrities, including Carol
Baldwin and her four actor sons: Alec, Daniel, Stephen and William.
Her staff at Help USA interviewed the remainder, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo described the men and women in ``The Person Who Changed My
Life'' as nonpartisan, crediting New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd
Whitman, a Republican, and crooner Tony Bennett for joining her on
the television show ``Good Morning America'' to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the people in the book would seem to be simpatico
with the politics her husband, a Democrat known for articulating so
eloquently: Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who is
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination; Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend of Maryland; Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice
President Al Gore; and Cuomo's son Andrew, now secretary of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, a likely candidate for U.S. Senate in New York,
is pictured with Matilda Cuomo on the book jacket. They met as
wives of governors, and this is the first book project Clinton has
lent either her name or picture to since her own best-selling book,
``It Takes a Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Clinton has the full support of New York's
former first lady as she ponders her candidacy. ``I wouldn't have
predicted she'd run, but I didn't know what was on her mind for the
culmination of her time in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that she's a very serious person. Who better than she
knows the federal issues, and that's what a senator deals with,''
Cuomo added. ``I think she'd be fabulous. I can't see anyone
denying that fact. I think she'll do a wonderful, credible job for
us.''

HIGH-TECH HITCHCOCK? DIGITAL EFFECTS WOULDN'T IMPROVE THE  MASTER'S
SUSPENSEFUL STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy birthday, Hitch, but it's just as well we can't send you
an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock, the great English American film director, was
born 100 years ago Friday in London and died on April 29, 1980, in
Los Angeles, before digital effects took over the Hollywood
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   The question today is: Would he have embraced the new
technology?
</P>
<P>
   Embraced? Well, not exactly. But he certainly would have used it
if he wished to continue making films. He was enough of a
pragmatist that he even gave in to some of producer David O.
Selznick's more ridiculous demands.
</P>
<P>
   An even more interesting question is: Would the brave new world
of computers have made his movies better?
</P>
<P>
   The answer must be no. The Hitchcock fingerprints would be
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock loved technique and technical challenges. Sometimes
that challenge itself was the germ for his movies and for ideas for
others that never got made.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with digital effects for Hitchcock would have been
that they are (set ital)too(end ital) good, and in some ways, too
easy. All the fun would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   When the digital prestidigitators can take electronic images of
President Clinton from the TV news and make many viewers believe
that he moonlighted as an actor in a movie _ as happened with
Robert Zemeckis' ``Contact'' in 1997 _ things have gone beyond
artifice. These guys can do anything and make it look real.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point for realistic computerized mastery came with
Steven Spielberg's dinosaurs in ``Jurassic Park'' in 1993. Those
mothers could (set ital)move.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The one-upsmanship continues with each blockbuster release. It
has now reached the point where spectacular effects have become
commonplace. They may cause amazement, but they are also taken for
granted. Oh, yeah, that. Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, of course, dealt in suspense, not in the kinds of
thrills provided by dinosaurs. Nor was he a realist. He loved
artifice, and he loved letting us know it was made by human hands _
his hands. His signature appearance in each of his films was not
merely whimsical. He would not have wanted to lose control by
turning it over to computer geeks who could do anything he
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that as well as being a creative person,
I am a very technical person. The actual exercise of technique is
very important to me, the practical solution of technical problems.
I have always needed to do things, never had much taste for
philosophizing about what to do,'' he said (quoted in Dan Auiler's
recent book, ``Hitchcock's Notebooks'').
</P>
<P>
   The technical challenges Hitchcock overcame are legendary. The
``one long take'' of ``Rope'' (1948). The dizzying look down the
mission stairwell in ``Vertigo'' (1958). The dense, ominous last
shot of ``The Birds'' (1963), composed of layer upon layer upon
layer of negatives. The plane crash at sea shown, without a cut,
through the cockpit window until the water crashes through it in
``Foreign Correspondent'' (1940). The list could go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Hitchcock liked to let the audience know it was
artifice. In ``Vertigo,'' when James Stewart and Kim Novak kiss on
the beachside cliffs at Monterey, the scene is set up by actual
location shots. But the kiss itself, with the surf crashing at the
exact moment of the kiss and at the climax of Bernard Herrmann's
musical score, is timed for all elements to come together.
</P>
<P>
   It was done by rear projection of the surf, a commonplace
technique. They didn't stand out there waiting, like surfers, for
the right wave. The emotional charge of the moment is the result of
ingenuity , not luck, and more thrilling because we know that it
is.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Vertigo'' shot down the stairwell, which woozily stretches
away, was the result of a shot tracking backward with a
simultaneous forward zoom. Hitchcock had let the idea for that one
percolate for years.
</P>
<P>
   He originally wanted to use that effect for fainting in
``Rebecca'' (1940) but couldn't figure out how to do it right, he
told fellow director and acolyte Francois Truffaut (in
``Hitchcock'' by Truffaut).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a movie,'' Hitchcock said on a number of occasions
and in different contexts. One of the things he meant by that was
the pleasure we get from knowing that something familiar is a
re-creation. Mount Rushmore was re-created as an obvious set in
``North by Northwest'' (1959), and so were the arm and torch of the
Statue of Liberty in ``Saboteur'' (1942).
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock would certainly embrace new technology when it suited
his purposes. The 3-D in ``Dial M for Murder'' (1954) may be the
most subtle use of the technique. He withholds any flashy effects
for such a long time that the audience almost forgets about 3-D in
the mundane apartment setting. Then, when Grace Kelly, struggling
for her life, frantically reaches over her head, her hand jerks out
over the audience, and it is stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's centennial is not the only one the nation is
honoring this year. It is also the 100th anniversary of the births
of Ernest Hemingway and Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   You don't suppose they all played together as kids, do you?
</P>
<P>
   The digital daredevils could make us believe they did.

<P>
   On the Russian space station Mir, flight engineer Sergei Avdeyev
has been in orbit since Aug. 13, 1998. He has now outlasted three
Russian prime ministers: Sergei Kiriyenko, appointed by President
Yeltsin in March 1998 and fired in August of the same year; Yevgeny
Primakov, appointed in September 1998 and fired in May 1999; and
Sergei Stepashin, appointed last May and fired on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin' new prime minister-designate _ and, if we are to
believe the president, heir apparent _ is Vladimir Putin. Will he
be welcoming Avdeyev, when the cosmonaut returns to Earth? This, as
they say, is a good question.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's seemingly impulsive decision has reminded historians
of the behavior of Czar Nicholas II in the final years of the
Russian Empire. Then too, premiers were replaced in a kaleidoscopic
manner and with no apparent logic. With a major war between the
government and Islamic secessionists brewing in Russia's south, the
similarities are indeed troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Is Yeltsin's decision to sack a loyal prime minister a coldly
calculated maneuver or, as even some of his former supporters are
saying, ``sheer madness?''
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions were first asked in March 1998, when the
president abruptly dismissed another loyalist, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
At the time, most Russian and foreign observers preferred to see
that as a rational move. Not so today. Just about everyone is sick
and tired of the political puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, amazingly and ironically, the president of Russia has
become the country's greatest destabilizing factor. Confrontation,
unpredictability and destabilization are the main ingredients of
Yeltsin's political style. Still, one might expect, so close to the
end of his final term in office, that he would modify that style
out of concern for his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   It is not happening because the president is desperate. Yeltsin
is desperate because he does not know how to impose his will on
Russia's future. Protecting his cronies and members of his family
from possible prosecution after he goes may well be on his mind,
but it is only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is casting about for a strategy that will make him
relevant during his final year. And no such strategy is available.
Therefore, his convulsive moves may be not as dangerous as they
first look. More and more, they just look ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   His designation of Putin _ virtually unknown to the people,
faceless and with no trace of charisma _ as the man who could
``lead Russia into the next century,'' is a case in point. Putin's
chances of being elected president in a free and fair election are
zero. And Yeltsin's capacity to engineer a scenario that would push
him through in some other way is not that great either.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Russian society is weak and the Russian
political establishment cowardly; even so, neither are likely to
allow Yeltsin to extend his era beyond the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's main concern has always been with power politics and
personnel reshuffles rather than policy making. His supporters in
Russia and in the West have always admired his unfailing political
instincts. It is those instincts, they say, that have saved Russia
from a return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Yeltsin's failed policies and erratic
behavior have become Russia's main problem. The country is being
saved by its amazing resilience.
</P>
<P>
   After the economic collapse in August 1998, there were
predictions of all kinds of disaster _ riots, famine, perhaps
military dictatorship. It didn't happen. Primakov was no miracle
worker but he was able to restore sanity to the political process,
and both the economy and the people responded positively to his
quiet therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is now the most popular politician in Russia. If the
elections were held today he would be chosen overwhelmingly.
Yeltsin clearly wants no part of this scenario; he is rocking the
boat. The challenge for the State Duma, or parliament, is to steer
a course to two crucial destinations _ parliamentary elections in
December and presidential elections in July.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma refuses to approve Putin's nomination, Yeltsin can
dissolve the group, throwing the political calendar into disarray.
So, no matter how disgusted they are, the Duma members will
probably say yes to Yeltsin once again. The real work of solving
the country's multiple problems will have to be done by the next
president and a new parliament.

PROSECUTOR GOES AFTER ATM BEGGARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ District Attorney Terence Hallinan is
prosecuting people for panhandling near automatic teller machines
under a law that as a city supervisor he opposed as ``not necessary
and not reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hallinan's office is using the disputed law even though a
San Francisco municipal judge earlier found that it was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the homeless on Wednesday questioned the district
attorney's use of the measure to prosecute two panhandlers who had
sworn at the police and made public scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a misuse of resources,'' said Judy Appel, a staff lawyer
with the Coalition on Homelessness. She contended the prosecutions
were ``for political purposes. I think it's directly tied into the
election season.''
</P>
<P>
   The election for mayor is this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan was unavailable for comment, but his spokesman,
Clarence Johnson, said Hallinan likely was unaware his office was
using the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that this is somehow political is absurd,'' said
Johnson, adding that he knew of no other cases brought under the
law. ``The cases were just brought on their merit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the public defender's office has said in court papers
that the complaints fail to adequately allege a crime, and a judge
has dismissed one of them on that basis. The defender's office also
is challenging the prosecutions on the ground that the law is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The law says anyone who remains within 30 feet of an ATM for
more than one minute, while another person is using the machine,
may be cited for an infraction or a misdemeanor. A conviction on
the misdemeanor charge may bring a fine of up to $500 and community
service, or six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Board of Supervisors rejected the measure, with
Hallinan one of the staunchest opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Mayor Frank Jordan put it on the ballot as Proposition J,
part of his program to clean up San Francisco's streets. Voters
approved the measure in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Municipal Judge Wallace Douglass ruled that the
law was unconstitutional because it impermissibly barred lawful
First Amendment activity within the 30-foot area.
</P>
<P>
   Although lower court rulings don't create law binding on other
courts, Deputy Public Defender Grace Lidia Suarez said prosecutors
generally do not ``blow off'' such rulings and don't prosecute
cases under laws found unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Hallinan's office used the law to charge Barry L.
Perkins, 23, who allegedly had been sitting on a milk crate and
panhandling about 10 feet from a Bank of America ATM near Union
Square, a police report said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge dismissed the charge on Tuesday, saying the complaint
failed to properly allege that Perkins had violated the law by
being in the area for more than a minute while someone was using
the ATM. The prosecution said it would file an amended complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the district attorney's office last month
charged Dominick Abram, 40, for allegedly panhandling within 10
feet of a Wells Fargo ATM and then threatening the officer who
confronted him.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan's office charged Abram with violating the ATM law,
resisting arrest and making a terrorist threat.

 WHO KNOWS BEST? -- THE EXPERTS or the PUBLIC?

publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the

Syndicate sales representatives:

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-996-0075;
fax, 310-996-0089.  By TIMOTHY NOAH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The general populace is too fickle and too easily manipulated to
decide weighty public questions _ that's what Walter Lippmann wrote
in ``Public Opinion,'' his 1922 book, when he was well on his way
to establishing himself as journalism's pre-eminent mandarin.
 &HT;    These big questions ought to be handled instead by ``a
specialized class'' of experts working closely with top government
officials, Lippmann wrote.
 &HT;    Today, such a notion of good government sounds haughty and
simplistic. But something very like Lippmann's construct was
adopted, a few years later, by an organization leading the budding
consumer movement. And this time, the approach was a great success.
 &HT;    That organization is now known as Consumers Union, publisher of
Consumer Reports magazine. Because of its dependence on scientific
experts to answer questions about, say, why one vacuum cleaner is
better than another, Consumers Union might fairly be called one of
the most elitist institutions in American life. It is also one of
the most influential.
 &HT;    But the pendulum that swings from rule by the masses to rule by
the elite never really stands still, even when it comes to
shopping.
 &HT;    Today, the primacy of Consumers Union is being challenged by a
rival whose opinions derive not from experts but from Lippmann's
dreaded public: J.D. Power &AMP; Associates. Chances are, as you've
watched TV, flipped through magazines and looked at billboards
lately, you've seen or heard the name J.D. Power &AMP; Associates.
 &HT;    One recent morning, my local newspaper (The Washington Post)
carried a three-quarter-page ad for Bell Atlantic Mobile wireless
phone service boasting of its top ranking in a J.D. Power survey.
The ad included a photograph of a tombstone-shaped crystal on a
gold-plated metal base bearing the J.D. Power logo, which enjoyed
larger and more prominent display than the logo for Bell Atlantic
Mobile (which paid for the ad).
 &HT;    ``They are to the '90s what the Good Housekeeping seal was to
the '50s,'' observes Peter Hart, a pollster. According to a 1999
Harris poll commissioned by the firm, 63 percent of American adults
have heard of J.D. Power, up from 55 percent three years ago.
 &HT;    J.D. Power is a privately held research firm just north of Los
Angeles, whose founder and chairman is J.D. (Dave) Power III, a
68-year-old man of large build and soft voice bearing the accent of
his native Worcester, Mass. His company advises companies on how to
improve ``customer satisfaction'' based on elaborate surveys,
mostly in the form of mailed questionnaires that usually have a $1
incentive tucked inside.
 &HT;    The surveys fall into two broad categories: ``proprietary''
studies, commissioned by individual companies seeking objective
information about their own customers' needs and desires; and
``syndicated'' studies that rank competing products or services
within a particular industry based on customer satisfaction.
 &HT;    The rankings are dreamed up and financed by J.D. Power, at a
cost that can be several hundred thousand dollars. Once completed,
the findings are sold, like subscriptions, to the companies that
are scrutinized.
 &HT;    Although the proprietary studies account for more than half of
J.D. Power's revenue, it is the rankings that have given the firm
its public face. The top performers receive awards _ the ubiquitous
crystal slabs _ that they use in advertisements, which is how the
public usually hears about products and services that receive J.D.
Power's imprimatur.
 &HT;    Except, as Dave Power and his fellow apostles of customer
satisfaction never tire of explaining, it isn't really J.D. Power &AMP;
Associates that is giving its thumbs up. It's the public, a group
Lippmann believed has ``neither time, nor attention, nor interest,
nor the equipment for specific judgment'' on most aspects of modern
life.
 &HT;    Which returns us to the question: Is the public a clueless
rabble or the nation's collective wisdom?
 &HT;    Put another way, it's a question of whether our purchasing
decisions should be based on the opinions of dispassionate experts,
or whether those expert opinions should be dismissed as the same
sort of ivory-tower blather that got us into the Vietnam War.
 &HT;    The debate over the wisdom of the populace vs. the wisdom of
experts is as old as civilization. It comes up in Plato's
``Republic'' and Aristotle's ``Politics.'' More recently, it lies
at the heart of the ongoing debate between the medical profession
and the New Age movement over the efficacy of herbal medicines.
 &HT;    It's one of those Big Philosophical Questions that one best
approaches tentatively, giving wide berth to experience. But it
should be more manageable when confined to the narrowly
circumscribed question, ``What stuff should I buy?''
 &HT;    I resolved to give it a try.
 &HT;    About 500 people work for J.D. Power &AMP; Associates at its Agoura
Hills, Calif., headquarters and in satellite offices around the
world _ about twice the number employed in 1993. The company
reported 1998 revenues of $74.4 million _ more than triple that
figure in 1993.
 &HT;    J.D. Power made its name producing customer-satisfaction surveys
for the automobile industry, which still accounts for most of its
business. But in recent years it has branched out into studies of
hotels, wireless phone services, home construction, hospital care,
credit cards and the newly deregulated electric utility market.
 &HT;    At the California headquarters, I ask George Owens, a J.D. Power
manager for product research, for information about the 1998 model
of the car I drive, a Ford Taurus.
 &HT;    Owens sits down to his computer terminal and punches up last
year's Initial Quality Study, which reports that the survey's 342
Taurus owners cited 148 problems per 100 vehicles. The industry
average that year was 176 problems per 100 vehicles, so the Taurus
ranked above average.
 &HT;    Now Owens taps his keyboard a few times to compare the
performance of Tauruses produced at Ford's Atlanta plant (where
mine was built) with those made at its Chicago plant. The Chicago
plant fared better, with 129 problems per 100, compared with 167
problems per 100 in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Next, Owens punches up a typical complaint a customer will make
about a car _ ``engine lacks power.'' Within the upper-midsize
segment, this complaint cropped up most often for the Honda Accord:
1.7 problems per 100. For the Taurus, it showed up as 1.5 problems
per 100. These are still both ''excellent scores,'' Owens says.
 &HT;    Even on its own terms, of course, survey research is not
infallible. J.D. Power's minimum sample size for automotive surveys
_ 250 responses per car model _ allows for a margin of error around
6 percent. Moreover, even assuming J.D. Power's surveys accurately
reflect public opinion, does that public really know what it's
talking about?
 &HT;    I am a fairly unsophisticated consumer. Ask me whether my Ford
Taurus is a good car and I'll probably say, ``Yeah, sure, seems
fine to me.'' (I drive the thing mostly on weekends.) Lippmann
would compare me to one of Plato's cave dwellers, drawing my sense
of customer satisfaction from indistinct shadows cast on the wall.
 &HT;    When J.D. Power gathers up the opinions of 342 Taurus owners, is
it getting 342 easy-to-please ignoramuses like me, or is it getting
people who are smarter about these things than I am? For sure, I
never fill out consumer questionnaires. Perhaps my impatience with
them is linked to my relative indifference to the subtle benefits
of one consumer product or service as compared with another.
 &HT;    Alternatively, it may be that the sort of people who do fill out
questionnaires _ the same folks who go through life sending their
steak back because they wanted it medium well, not medium _ skew
J.D. Power's survey not toward intelligent criticism, but toward
querulous complaint. People who care too much about being satisfied
customers don't necessarily have a tighter grip on reality than
people who care too little, like me.
 &HT;    To keep things balanced, I also visit the Yonkers headquarters
of Consumers Union, a converted warehouse that stands as a kind of
temple to practical science. Its 50 laboratories house testing
machinery, fussed over by white-coated scientists and technicians,
that is guaranteed to enchant anyone who ever owned an erector set.
 &HT;    This is consumerism on the Lippmann model _ a consumerism that
is more like the Federal Reserve Board, whose decisions cannot be
reversed by popular protest. Yet, on the consumer front, the
Lippmann school has withstood the test of time.
 &HT;    Consumers Union's founding document, a 1927 book called ``Your
Money's Worth: A Study in the Waste of the Consumer's Dollar,'' by
Stuart Chase and F.J. Schlink, grew out of a series of articles
published in The New Republic, a magazine Lippmann had helped start
a decade earlier.
 &HT;    Like The New Republic, Chase and Schlink's book embraced the
progressive-era faith in rational governance by wise leaders as an
alternative to unruly populism.
 &HT;    ``Your Money's Worth'' was a best seller. Indeed, public
response was so favorable that in 1926, it inspired Schlink to
transform a small, church-sponsored consumer's club he'd
established in White Plains into a national organization called
Consumers' Research, which hired scientists to test consumer
products and report the results in a magazine, Consumers' Research
Bulletin, that refused all advertising.
 &HT;    Today, Consumers Union employs a staff of about 480 _ roughly as
many people as are employed by J.D. Power. Consumer Reports has a
circulation of 4.5 million, and its Web site has 310,000 paid
subscribers, more than any other subscription-based Web site except
The Wall Street Journal. Revenue _ about 92 percent of which came
from the sale of Consumer Reports and other publications and
computer products _ totaled $137 million in 1998, nearly twice what
J.D. Power pulled in.
 &HT;    In terms of visibility, however, J.D. Power is gaining on
Consumers Union fast, mainly because, unlike J.D. Power, Consumer
Reports doesn't allow its ratings to be publicized by advertisers.
(In addition, Consumer Reports itself carries no advertising.)
 &HT;    The median age of a Consumer Reports reader is 52, which _ even
allowing for the fact that older people tend to be more avid
bargain-hunters _ is very old. (Subscribers to the Consumer Reports
Web site have a median age of 42, which is also comparatively old.)
 &HT;    J.D. Power's following appears to be much younger. According to
the 1999 J.D. Power-commissioned Harris poll, recognition of the
J.D. Power brand is strongest among people in their mid-30s.
 &HT;    Can Consumers Union replenish its constituency as the public
becomes increasingly inundated with the J.D. Power logo?
 &HT;    J.D. Power's method of supervising the use of that logo raises
some eyebrows within the consumer movement. Companies that trumpet
their awards must pay J.D. Power a fee (the average is $100,000)
and submit the ads in advance for approval. They must also follow
an elaborate set of guidelines governing, among other things, the
size and prominence of the J.D. Power logo. (In no instance may it
appear less than an inch in diameter.)
 &HT;    In effect, J.D. Power uses these advertisements to raise its own
profile with the public, which in turn helps J.D. Power attract
more corporate clients who buy copies of its syndicated studies,
commission it to do proprietary studies or both.
 &HT;    Because of this symbiotic relationship, J.D. Power is inhibited
in some ways that Consumers Union is not. Consider what might be
called the Secret Lemon Problem. About 10 years ago, J.D. Power
mostly stopped releasing unfavorable rankings _ at the time they
were almost all for cars _ to the public (though it continued to do
so to corporate buyers of the syndicated surveys).
 &HT;    ``What we were finding,'' says Dave Power, ``was the press,
especially the television news, would call up the day that we would
announce the study, and they'd want to know the bottom-five
makes.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, this emphasis on the bad news upset
manufacturers at the bottom of the list _ Yugo, Renault, Fiat,
Peugeot, Sterling _ all potential J.D. Power customers.
 &HT;    So J.D. Power instituted a policy in which, with few exceptions,
only above-average rankings in syndicated studies are made public,
while companies that rank below average are listed alphabetically
in press releases. Now ordinary consumers can find out what J.D.
Power likes, but they usually can't find out what it doesn't like.
 &HT;    A related criticism of J.D. Power's methods flags what might be
called the Miss Congeniality Problem. Because a J.D. Power award
brings a fee and free publicity to the firm whenever a winner takes
out an ad, there's incentive to create as many award categories as
possible.
 &HT;    But Dave Power says that segmented awards are necessary in a
segmented market like the auto industry, where the ``truckload of
awards'' won by Lexus has limited value to the public, the vast
majority of whom cannot afford the luxury car. Still, he concedes
that because J.D. Power does ``many more studies'' than it used to,
the total number of awards, and related revenues, has increased.
 &HT;    Both the missing lemon problem and the Miss Congeniality Problem
merit thoughtful attention, though a more profound consideration is
that J.D. Power's role isn't to inform the public, but to be the
public _ that is, to be an accurate mirror of opinions that the
public already holds.
 &HT;    So who has the answer: the public or the experts? It's worth
bearing in mind that in the end, good survey data and wise expert
opinion on consumer matters aren't likely to diverge all that much.
 &HT;    J.D. Power's 1999 study ranked the Infiniti I 30 the best
``entry luxury car.'' Consumer Reports, in its April automotive
issue, ranked the Infiniti I 30 the No. 1 ''upscale car'' for
reliability. J.D. Power says the 1999 Toyota Corolla is the best
compact car; Consumer Reports prefers the Acura Integra for
reliability, but ranks the Corolla, and J. D. Power's two
runners-up, the Saturn SW Wagon and the Nissan Sentra, all ``better
than average.''
 &HT;    When it comes to consumer goods and services, I'm inclined to
put my faith in the experts. No doubt part of the reason is that
the consequences of doing so aren't especially grave.
 &HT;    If the public were to yield all government decision-making power
to experts, as Lippmann proposed, the experts could wreck the
country. Returning to the example of the ``best and brightest''
policy makers who promoted U.S. troop escalation in Vietnam, even
Lippmann ended up opposing that war.
 &HT;    More recently, military experts who confidently predicted that
NATO victory in Kosovo was impossible without sending in ground
troops _ because every idiot knew you couldn't win a war just by
dropping bombs _ turned out to be spectacularly wrong.
 &HT;    But if the public were to yield consumer decision-making to
experts like the white-coated professionals at Consumers Union, and
the white-coated professionals were wrong, the consequences would
be ... that a few people would buy a vacuum cleaner that perhaps
wasn't quite as good as some other vacuum cleaner.
 &HT;    If, on the other hand, the white-coated experts tended to be
right _ and here I should note that it's easier to size up a vacuum
cleaner than it is to calculate the consequences of a government
action such as sending troops into battle _ then, obviously, it
would make sense to listen to the experts.
 &HT;    So ought we depend, J.D. Powerlike, on the collective wisdom of
the public or, Consumers Union-like, on the experts? I'm still
trying to decide. Thank goodness nobody's life hangs in the
balance.

 WHO KNOWS BEST? -- THE EXPERTS or the PUBLIC?  
 &HT;     (This article has already moved to Centerpiece clients. To
publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the
rate is not prohibitive _ from one of these New York Times
Syndicate sales representatives: 
 &HT;    (--U.S. and Canada: DEBRA WEYDERT in New Jersey at
1-732-390-4480; fax, 732-390-4697. 
 &HT;    (--Europe and Asia: KARL HORWITZ in Paris at 47-42-17-11; fax,

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-996-0075;
fax, 310-996-0089.  By TIMOTHY NOAH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The general populace is too fickle and too easily manipulated to
decide weighty public questions _ that's what Walter Lippmann wrote
in ``Public Opinion,'' his 1922 book, when he was well on his way
to establishing himself as journalism's pre-eminent mandarin.
 &HT;    These big questions ought to be handled instead by ``a
specialized class'' of experts working closely with top government
officials, Lippmann wrote.
 &HT;    Today, such a notion of good government sounds haughty and
simplistic. But something very like Lippmann's construct was
adopted, a few years later, by an organization leading the budding
consumer movement. And this time, the approach was a great success.
 &HT;    That organization is now known as Consumers Union, publisher of
Consumer Reports magazine. Because of its dependence on scientific
experts to answer questions about, say, why one vacuum cleaner is
better than another, Consumers Union might fairly be called one of
the most elitist institutions in American life. It is also one of
the most influential.
 &HT;    But the pendulum that swings from rule by the masses to rule by
the elite never really stands still, even when it comes to
shopping.
 &HT;    Today, the primacy of Consumers Union is being challenged by a
rival whose opinions derive not from experts but from Lippmann's
dreaded public: J.D. Power &AMP; Associates. Chances are, as you've
watched TV, flipped through magazines and looked at billboards
lately, you've seen or heard the name J.D. Power &AMP; Associates.
 &HT;    One recent morning, my local newspaper (The Washington Post)
carried a three-quarter-page ad for Bell Atlantic Mobile wireless
phone service boasting of its top ranking in a J.D. Power survey.
The ad included a photograph of a tombstone-shaped crystal on a
gold-plated metal base bearing the J.D. Power logo, which enjoyed
larger and more prominent display than the logo for Bell Atlantic
Mobile (which paid for the ad).
 &HT;    ``They are to the '90s what the Good Housekeeping seal was to
the '50s,'' observes Peter Hart, a pollster. According to a 1999
Harris poll commissioned by the firm, 63 percent of American adults
have heard of J.D. Power, up from 55 percent three years ago.
 &HT;    J.D. Power is a privately held research firm just north of Los
Angeles, whose founder and chairman is J.D. (Dave) Power III, a
68-year-old man of large build and soft voice bearing the accent of
his native Worcester, Mass. His company advises companies on how to
improve ``customer satisfaction'' based on elaborate surveys,
mostly in the form of mailed questionnaires that usually have a $1
incentive tucked inside.
 &HT;    The surveys fall into two broad categories: ``proprietary''
studies, commissioned by individual companies seeking objective
information about their own customers' needs and desires; and
``syndicated'' studies that rank competing products or services
within a particular industry based on customer satisfaction.
 &HT;    The rankings are dreamed up and financed by J.D. Power, at a
cost that can be several hundred thousand dollars. Once completed,
the findings are sold, like subscriptions, to the companies that
are scrutinized.
 &HT;    Although the proprietary studies account for more than half of
J.D. Power's revenue, it is the rankings that have given the firm
its public face. The top performers receive awards _ the ubiquitous
crystal slabs _ that they use in advertisements, which is how the
public usually hears about products and services that receive J.D.
Power's imprimatur.
 &HT;    Except, as Dave Power and his fellow apostles of customer
satisfaction never tire of explaining, it isn't really J.D. Power &AMP;
Associates that is giving its thumbs up. It's the public, a group
Lippmann believed has ``neither time, nor attention, nor interest,
nor the equipment for specific judgment'' on most aspects of modern
life.
 &HT;    Which returns us to the question: Is the public a clueless
rabble or the nation's collective wisdom?
 &HT;    Put another way, it's a question of whether our purchasing
decisions should be based on the opinions of dispassionate experts,
or whether those expert opinions should be dismissed as the same
sort of ivory-tower blather that got us into the Vietnam War.
 &HT;    The debate over the wisdom of the populace vs. the wisdom of
experts is as old as civilization. It comes up in Plato's
``Republic'' and Aristotle's ``Politics.'' More recently, it lies
at the heart of the ongoing debate between the medical profession
and the New Age movement over the efficacy of herbal medicines.
 &HT;    It's one of those Big Philosophical Questions that one best
approaches tentatively, giving wide berth to experience. But it
should be more manageable when confined to the narrowly
circumscribed question, ``What stuff should I buy?''
 &HT;    I resolved to give it a try.
 &HT;    About 500 people work for J.D. Power &AMP; Associates at its Agoura
Hills, Calif., headquarters and in satellite offices around the
world _ about twice the number employed in 1993. The company
reported 1998 revenues of $74.4 million _ more than triple that
figure in 1993.
 &HT;    J.D. Power made its name producing customer-satisfaction surveys
for the automobile industry, which still accounts for most of its
business. But in recent years it has branched out into studies of
hotels, wireless phone services, home construction, hospital care,
credit cards and the newly deregulated electric utility market.
 &HT;    At the California headquarters, I ask George Owens, a J.D. Power
manager for product research, for information about the 1998 model
of the car I drive, a Ford Taurus.
 &HT;    Owens sits down to his computer terminal and punches up last
year's Initial Quality Study, which reports that the survey's 342
Taurus owners cited 148 problems per 100 vehicles. The industry
average that year was 176 problems per 100 vehicles, so the Taurus
ranked above average.
 &HT;    Now Owens taps his keyboard a few times to compare the
performance of Tauruses produced at Ford's Atlanta plant (where
mine was built) with those made at its Chicago plant. The Chicago
plant fared better, with 129 problems per 100, compared with 167
problems per 100 in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Next, Owens punches up a typical complaint a customer will make
about a car _ ``engine lacks power.'' Within the upper-midsize
segment, this complaint cropped up most often for the Honda Accord:
1.7 problems per 100. For the Taurus, it showed up as 1.5 problems
per 100. These are still both ''excellent scores,'' Owens says.
 &HT;    Even on its own terms, of course, survey research is not
infallible. J.D. Power's minimum sample size for automotive surveys
_ 250 responses per car model _ allows for a margin of error around
6 percent. Moreover, even assuming J.D. Power's surveys accurately
reflect public opinion, does that public really know what it's
talking about?
 &HT;    I am a fairly unsophisticated consumer. Ask me whether my Ford
Taurus is a good car and I'll probably say, ``Yeah, sure, seems
fine to me.'' (I drive the thing mostly on weekends.) Lippmann
would compare me to one of Plato's cave dwellers, drawing my sense
of customer satisfaction from indistinct shadows cast on the wall.
 &HT;    When J.D. Power gathers up the opinions of 342 Taurus owners, is
it getting 342 easy-to-please ignoramuses like me, or is it getting
people who are smarter about these things than I am? For sure, I
never fill out consumer questionnaires. Perhaps my impatience with
them is linked to my relative indifference to the subtle benefits
of one consumer product or service as compared with another.
 &HT;    Alternatively, it may be that the sort of people who do fill out
questionnaires _ the same folks who go through life sending their
steak back because they wanted it medium well, not medium _ skew
J.D. Power's survey not toward intelligent criticism, but toward
querulous complaint. People who care too much about being satisfied
customers don't necessarily have a tighter grip on reality than
people who care too little, like me.
 &HT;    To keep things balanced, I also visit the Yonkers headquarters

SUMMER MENU IDEAS THAT DON'T REQUIRE OVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's summer, and it's too hot to cook. But you
still have to eat. With a little imagination, help from
store-purchased food items and a microwave oven, you can whip up
cool and creative inspirations with minimal effort without heating
up the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Many tasty no-cook options are feasible. You can embellish
things like macaroni salad from the deli with canned tuna and
chopped tomatoes, or deli potato salad with shrimp and dill and
cucumbers. Or you can purchase tuna or chicken salad (or make your
own in a flash) from the takeout deli of a supermarket and serve it
in a melon, papaya or tomato shell, along with a scoop of cottage
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Dips and fresh cut-up veggies and an assembly of assorted meats,
cheeses and crackers or bread slices make a great beat-the-heat
meal, too. Even an antipasto platter _ with olives, buffalo
mozzarella and tomato slices, chopped fresh basil, roasted red
peppers, a drizzle of olive oil, salami and other Italian meats,
store-bought pasta salad and slices of rustic or sourdough bread _
keep you cool in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Wraps are another good way to make a sandwich festive _ use
lavosh or some of the large flavored flour tortillas and wrap up
your favorite meats, veggies and spreads (such as pesto, cream
cheese-based and hummus) for a simple on-the-go summer meal.
</P>
<P>
   Search out places like the takeout sections of supermarkets,
gourmet shops, Trader Joe's and Costco. Improvise _ and have a
little fun. You may surprise yourself, your family and even
spur-of-the moment guests _ and they may welcome the innovative and
cool dining experiences. There are numerous possibilities that you
can toss together with minimal effort.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas, designed with summer cooks in mind, can be dashed
off in a jiffy and offer good dining alternatives to usual
fast-food fare _ and they're certainly more interesting. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TUNA AND WHITE BEANS
</P>
<P>
   Here's a cold dish that tuna fans will particularly enjoy. It
makes short work of the ``What to serve for dinner?'' dilemma. In a
medium bowl, combine a couple of 6 1/2- or 7-ounce cans of solid
white water-packed tuna, drained; a can or two of white cannellini
beans, rinsed and drained; 3 large tomatoes, chopped; chopped red
or green onions; 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil and a few tablespoons
drained capers along with a dose of fresh lemon juice and olive
oil. Add garlic pepper and salt to taste. Serve as is, stuffed in a
pita bread or atop fresh spinach leaves or assorted greens. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHICKEN-OLIVE BREAD SANDWICHES
</P>
<P>
   This is reminiscent of a sandwich served at Los Angeles'
Campanile restaurant. Pick up cooked chicken breasts at the
supermarket and shred or chop until you have about 4 cups. Then mix
with about 5 cups shredded red or green cabbage (choppped-up
iceberg lettuce will even do if you're in a bind) and some chopped
green onions. Stir in lots of pitted, cut-up Kalamata olives or
pitted ripe olives. Add some white or red wine vinegar (about 1/2
cup) and 1/3 cup olive oil and a tablespoon or two of grainy or
Dijon mustard along with garlic pepper to taste. Mix well and
spread as thick or thin as desired between olive bread slices.
Accompany with fresh tomato slices and a little potato salad. The
chicken mixture can also be served alongside tomato and cucumber
slices or with your choice of assorted fresh veggies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GOAT CHEESE AND SUN-DRIED TOMATO SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Toss mixed baby salad greens with balsamic vinaigrette, either
purchased or homemade. Divide evenly among dinner plates, then top
with a generous sprinkling of cut-up pieces of mild goat cheese,
sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and toasted pine nuts. For a more
substantial main-dish salad, add cut-up cooked chicken breast
pieces or cooked shrimp. If desired, you can substitute crumbled
feta cheese for the goat cheese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRUIT DELIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Cut up lots of assorted fresh fruits _ nectarines, peaches,
melons, bananas, pineapple and strawberries _ and combine with some
blueberries or raspberries. Toss in some fresh orange juice and mix
well. Serve in large bowls topped with a scoop of cottage cheese or
frozen yogurt or sorbet and a light supper or dinner is on.
Accompany with rolls or assorted muffins.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPEN-FACE SANDWICH TRIO
</P>
<P>
   Make open-face sandwiches with assorted toppings _ and serve
three variations for an easy lunch or dinner. For one, combine
canned salmon with mayo, lemon juice, capers and dill _ and spread
on toasted Italian or sourdough bread slices. For another, whip up
a tomato mixture (bruschetta-style) with lots of chopped fresh
tomatoes, chopped fresh basil and garlic, and a little olive oil
and red wine vinegar and present atop toasted bread slices. For the
third version, spread the toast slices with a green or black olive
tapenade, either prepared or homemade, and top with salami slices,
provolone cheese slices and roasted red pepper strips. Serve one of
each variety on a dinner plate and accompany with coleslaw or fresh
sliced fruits. Terrific! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE SAUCE IN A JIFFY
</P>
<P>
   For a versatile sauce, great to drizzle over ice cream, frozen
yogurt, fresh sliced fruits (or fruit kebabs), sorbets or cakes,
whip this up in a microwave oven. In a 2-cup glass measure, combine
1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 3 tablespoons EACH whipping
cream and orange-flavored liqueur. Heat on high power 1 to 1 1/2
minutes, or until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth when
stirred. Feel free to delete the liqueur, add a little vanilla and
increase the cream, if desired. Makes about 3/4 cup sauce. Store
any leftover sauce in the fridge and heat 18 to 20 seconds or until
of drizzling consistency. &QL;

 STEVE MARTIN, MAN of LETTERS

Syndicate sales representatives:

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Steve Martin tells a joke. It's a painful moment. This joke
arrives so unexpectedly _ and in the middle of a lunch that, while
cordial, has hardly been a picnic _ that it's almost inexplicable.
 &HT;    He is a forbidding man, a man without a molecule out of place, a
person capable of composure even when exhausted.
 &HT;    Martin got off a plane this morning from Las Vegas, where he was
advising a casino interested in creating a new sort of circus
extravaganza. And now he sits almost gloomily at the Four Seasons
in Beverly Hills, fully composed save for a repeated nervous
gesture: quick, furtive swipes of Chapstick over his lips.
 &HT;    Never mind the joke itself, something about the sex act. Let's
just note that the joke triggers an awkward silence. It's the one
time when he seems to be doing what's expected of him instead of
what he wants.
 &HT;    These days, what Martin wants is to write. The comic who packed
20,000-seat arenas in the 1970s and who orbited more catch phrases
than Mike Myers and Chris Rock combined now considers himself more
a writer than a performer.
 &HT;    ``Certainly the greatest rewards personally I've been getting
are from writing,'' he says over lunch. ``But I love _ I love _.''
 &HT;    It's as if he's reconsidering what he enjoys about being Steve
Martin in 1999.
 &HT;    ``I still like acting. I love comedy, but it's hard. Acting's
not hard, but comedy is.''
 &HT;    In the '70s, Martin was among the generation that made comedy
cool, made it youth culture instead of rice pudding for Mom and
Dad. And then he relinquished stand-up, because the audiences got
too big, and because they got too rude, interrupting his act to
shout his name. To Martin, civility matters.
 &HT;    ``I watch the MTV awards and see people doing their
introductions, or trying their little routines or jokes or things,
and the audience is just yelling constantly, and I think, I'm glad
I'm not doing that. It's insulting. Maybe it's a different
generation, maybe the performers don't think about it. But I
would.''
 &HT;    You could say he lowered the bar in 1979 with ``The Jerk,'' and
has been raising it ever since, and is now loath to start playing a
kind of how-low-can-you-go limbo with any of the miscreants du jour
such as the Farrelly Brothers or Adam Sandler.
 &HT;    Martin's new movie, ``Bowfinger,'' opening this week, is a
Hollywood satire that follows a down-on-his-luck director's attempt
to make a blockbuster without the knowledge of the film's star,
played by Eddie Murphy.
 &HT;    The movie juggles physical comedy appealing to teens with an
adult sweetness and an affection for hard-to-like characters, which
Martin has never explored so thoroughly before. It may be as good a
shot as he's going to have to establish a connection with fans of
``Big Daddy.''
 &HT;    Martin's hopes for the film are clearly high, though he sounds
not totally convinced that ``Bowfinger'' can pull it off at the box
office.
 &HT;    ``Here's a movie that I know is funny, but it's not vulgar and
it's not dirty. And right now, the focus is really intensely on
vulgarity, so it's kind of a litmus test.''
 &HT;    Martin, who turns 54 early in August, is discovering fresh ways
to be funny. He is in migration from comic performer to, well,
you'd have to dust off the antique label ``humorist,'' maybe even
``man of letters,'' to describe what he's about.
 &HT;    His bittersweet zephyr of a play, ``Picasso at the Lapin
Agile,'' first produced by the Steppenwolf Theater Company in
Chicago in 1993, marked a shift.
 &HT;    ``That was a turning point in my life,'' he says, ``and I love
it. I remember seeing it a year later and thinking, 'I am really
proud of this.' Now it might not be Tom Stoppard, but no one can
take that away from me.''
 &HT;    These days his byline can be found across the magazine rack. His
essay on playing the banjo appears in the latest issue of The
Oxford American, a Mississippi-based literary journal. His humor
articles have been published in The New Yorker and in The New York
Times Magazine, among other places. He has written for Art News,
and an essay of his will appear in a book about Eric Fischl, a
painter Martin collects and a close friend.
 &HT;    Most of his short humor writing was collected last year in the
sparkling ``Pure Drivel.'' In becoming a master of the short piece
that The New Yorker famously calls a ``casual'' and that S.J.
Perelman liked to call the ``feuilleton,'' Martin is almost
single-handedly reviving a form once far more prominent in
magazines.
 &HT;    ``I think Steve Martin, in every sense, is a serious artist,''
says The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, who like many of his
generation once paid scalper's rates to see Martin perform.
 &HT;    ``Funny is one of the hardest things to find. The precision of
the jokes has got to be perfect, or as close as you can get. It
can't ever be relaxed, even when it's seeming to be relaxed. It's
much more Flaubert than Dreiser, in terms of that attention to each
word and the timing of sentences.''
 &HT;    While Flaubert probably never strolled the boulevard with an
arrow through his head, Martin himself looks more Flaubert than
parrot on the afternoon we meet _ no tie, nice jacket, reading
glasses close at hand. It's his prose these days that puts on the
arrow and bunny ears.
 &HT;    ``I remember when I was younger, people would say something
like, 'I don't care what they think,''' Martin says. ``I'd go:
'What do you mean by that? Because I care what they think.' And
then you always hear older people say, 'I don't care what they
think,' and you think, 'Yeah, you can do that when you get older.'
And I started to understand that. You do start to not care what
they think anymore. But you have to come to that. You have to go
through a transition.''
 &HT;    In recent years, Martin has had anxious moments. An ambitious
picture he wrote, produced and starred in, ``A Simple Twist of
Fate,'' died upon release in 1994, and then the 1996 formula comedy
``Sergeant Bilko'' didn't turn out to be the payday he and the
studio wanted.
 &HT;    Martin had to be wondering about his place in Hollywood, and if
he wasn't, movies like ``Father of the Bride II,'' ``Mixed Nuts''
and ``The Out-of-Towners'' had plenty of observers wondering for
him.
 &HT;    ``Bowfinger'' may rescue Martin from that string of uninspiring
comedies. (His best performance in years came in 1998, in a shadowy
dramatic role in David Mamet's ``Spanish Prisoner.'') He knows he
needs to connect with audiences for reasons of pride and career,
but the writer in him is sick to death of the formula movies the
performer has been trapped by. Not only didn't they satisfy him,
but lately they also haven't much satisfied audiences.
 &HT;    In the past few years, Martin's personal life caught up with his
prematurely gray hair. His seven-year marriage to the actress
Victoria Tennant crumbled in 1993, and his father died two and a
half years ago. Between those markers, two agents who had each
worked for him for 20 years also passed on.
 &HT;    ``When your friends start dying, you start to rethink your own
life,'' a character says in Martin's one-act play ``The Zig Zag
Woman.'' Whatever Martin had in mind when he wrote those words,
they could easily be applied to his own circumstances.
 &HT;    ``The past six years weren't peaceful,'' Martin admits. ``I
don't want to go into it too much because it's, like, stuff you
talk to your shrink about. But I sort of changed myself,
psychologically and professionally. I looked at what I was doing
and I wasn't that fulfilled _ in the movies. In the writing world I
was very happy. In fact that kind of saved me emotionally, the fact
I had something that I could be proud of.''
 &HT;    He exhales, frowns for an instant. ``After 'Sergeant Bilko' I
just decided I had to stop this for a while. I said, 'I'm not ready
to work, not ready to sit in the trailer and wonder what I'm
doing.'''
 &HT;    After the divorce, and then after the actress Anne Heche had
blown out of his life, Martin was feeling alone and a little queasy
professionally. A phenomenal self-motivator, he taught himself how
to play banjo and more recently became a discriminating collector
of art.
 &HT;    After devouring a whole roster of self-help relationship books,
Martin devised a study plan, almost, for a new life. Brian Grazer,
co-head of Imagine Entertainment and the producer of ``Bowfinger,''
became friends with Martin in the late '80s, after they worked on
``Parenthood'' together.
 &HT;    Grazer says, ``There were times when he'd call and say, 'Let's
talk.' And then it would be like a 15-second call _ 'OK,
seeyalater!''' Grazer grew tired of Martin's social stiffness.
 &HT;    ``I finally said: 'Look Steve, if you want to be friends, which
it seems like you want to do, I can't have these 30-second calls.
They just make me very uncomfortable.' And he said, 'OK, OK, I'm
sorry.' In other words, he kind of knows what's going on, but at
the center of it he is extremely shy.''
 &HT;    But a few years ago, Grazer says, Martin called him up and said
he had found something of a new direction. He'd decided he was
going to have a certain number of dinner parties a week, with a
rotating circle of a certain number of friends, and purposefully
create a more social life for himself.
 &HT;    Since that time, in ways big and small, Martin has been trying
to enjoy himself, not an easy thing for someone who works so hard
and sweats the smallest of details. He has a salon of friends in
Los Angeles and another in New York, and has actively sought out
non-Hollywood types, including artists, writers, scientists,
musicians.
 &HT;    For instance, he loved a poem by Susan Wheeler in an issue of
The New Yorker that also featured a piece by him. He E-mailed her
out of the blue _ she envisioned, she says, the Jerk sitting at the
computer _ and today the two are good friends.
 &HT;    He started traveling more, and vowed after ``Bilko'' to take
three years off, doing nothing like work. His friends have noticed
a difference.
 &HT;    ``I think he's got more open, he's become a warmer individual
and more layered,'' says Frank Oz, who directed ``Bowfinger'' and
has known Martin since 1979. ``I think he's become more wine than
grape juice, which is a good thing.''
 &HT;    Susanna Moore, the novelist, says: ``I think it was very much a
conscious decision to be more in the world. He had to teach himself
how to do it, because I don't think by nature he was a sensualist
or a hedonist.''
 &HT;    The three-year hiatus, however, turned out to be anything but a
vacation _ he made a casual science of the short comic form. He can
quote lines of Veronica Geng, not to mention perhaps his favorite
humor writer, the great Dave Barry. He was an established author
(as far back as college he had published a book of poems), but it
wasn't until he dedicated himself to lying around that nonscreen
writing became a serious pursuit.
 &HT;    The writing Martin has done in the past few years would amount
to an estimable career for anybody else. His short essays wiggle
down odd paths, flow in Magritte rhythms that surprise the reader
probably most of all because they have already surprised the person
who wrote them.
 &HT;    Take ``Yes, in My Own Backyard,'' narrated by a Hollywood fool
convinced he has stumbled upon a birdbath made by Raphael in his
garden. Now he just needs to convince the world: ``Much has been
made of the fact that Raphael never sculpted. That may be true, but
what is less known is that he designed many avian objects that we
today take for granted, including the clothesline and the beak
polisher. A birdbath is completely within the oeuvre of the
master.''
 &HT;    There's a trace here and elsewhere in ``Pure Drivel'' of the
white-suited guy Martin once played in his stand-up act, a guy so
amused by himself he's comically oblivious to how he appears to the
rest of us.
 &HT;    ``In person he's about as zany as a CPA,'' says the writer and
artist Bruce McCall, a friend of Martin's. ``He's a very
introspective guy, solitary. All of which is a perfect mind-set for
a writer. Lots of people think a guy like this is a Hollywood
pseudo-intellectual, and think he wants credibility with the East
Coast lit crowd. That's not the Steve I know. He's a guy who's
really looking for the answers in all kinds of ways.''

DANCER SUES CLUB FOR WAGES, OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An exotic dancer sued a San Francisco strip club
on Thursday, demanding minimum wage, overtime compensation and a
budget for uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Barr of Los Angeles contends in the lawsuit that
Centerfolds in North Beach is violating state law by classifying
her as an independent contractor and charging rent for her time on
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for some widespread change,'' said Mark
Ozzello, a lawyer representing Barr, who has filed eight other
lawsuits against strip clubs in California.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court on Thursday,
seeks unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   A manager at Centerfolds declined to comment on the lawsuit and
officials at the North Hollywood company's corporate offices could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said the independent contractor arrangements are
structured like contracts with hair stylists, where the employees
pay for their work space from proceeds they earn from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the California Labor Commission in San Francisco
said that since 1995, the agency has fielded about 20 claims from
dancers, taking several cases to court to force strip clubs to give
dancers their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exotic dance industry is about the worst violator we've
ever seen'' in terms of abusing the independent contractor law,
said Labor Commission Chief Counsel Miles Locker. ``I think,
unfortunately, that the adult entertainment industry has to be
dragged kicking and screaming to comply with the labor codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Locker could not recall filing any claims against Centerfolds.
</P>
<P>
   He said state law allows only a few situations where an exotic
dancer may legally be called an independent contractor _ such as
when an X-rated film star is making a guest appearance at a club.
He said regulars at the club must be paid at least minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Barr seek to make the lawsuit a class action. If
a judge approves, Barr will represent all exotic dancers who have
worked at Centerfolds since December 1994.

 &HT;    Q: Do you think of yourself as a political dissident?
 &HT;    A: I don't want to get involved in politics. I don't care for
it. Governments focus only on the problem at hand, instead of
looking at what has caused this problem in the first place. If
ordinary people's society does not become more virtuous, any number
of problems may occur, and I cannot concern myself with this
prospect. I am only responsible to the practitioners of Falun Gong.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: But you've recently been described as one of the most
influential people in Asia. Does this new high profile help you?
 &HT;    A: I think it has done quite a bit of damage to me, personally.
Were cultivators of Falun Gong to know that I was ranked among the
influential people of the world, they would most likely laugh at
me. As cultivators, we do not seek fame and profit. My masters are
all practicing in the mountains. If they don't want to be seen,
even I couldn't find them. I ''came out'' only because they said
that I should. Otherwise I would not.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: For the past three years you've been in America. During that
time, what differences did you find between Chinese and American
culture?
 &HT;    A: The difference is quite enormous. Chinese people's mentality
is deeply influenced by their ancient cultural heritage. But
Americans are unfettered by ancient culture. In terms of human
characteristics, because Chinese people are so rational, they will
consider the substance of what they do. A Westerner will make sure
that it is done well on the surface. For instance, everyone knows
Chinese food is quite delicious. But when it comes to surface
qualities, it is not very particular. Chinese restaurants are often
very casual, and all you really need is a pair of chopsticks. But
Western cuisine, while it doesn't necessarily taste any better,
pays much closer attention to exactly which fork is to be used when
eating a certain food. Chinese people are concerned with the inner
quality of culture, whereas Westerners are concerned with the
surface qualities of culture.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Those can be loaded terms. Do you disapprove of American
culture?
 &HT;    A: Personally, I have no opposition to it. I need to have a
quiet and calm place to concentrate on the practice. So I don't
watch TV and movies often. But I know they have created
irreversible pollution to the world. And human beings can never
reverse the pollution and get back to its purest state, no matter
how hard we try.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You were supposedly living underground until very recently.
With all the Chinese immigrants in your neighborhood, didn't anyone
recognize you?
 &HT;    A: If they do not look carefully they will not recognize me. I
seldom communicate with others because of the language barrier, and
because of my personal practice, I seldom walk down the street.
Sometimes on weekends, we go to the mall. You know, sometimes I
help my wife do the grocery shopping. I love that I can get Chinese
sauces in New York.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Are you settling into life in New York? Or will you return to
China?
 &HT;    A: My wife and I have registered our own small company. We are
preparing to publish my books. But I've been thinking, if the
Chinese government would not treat their people as they do now, and
if they were willing to solve the issues through dialogue, I think
that would be good for the Chinese government and people as well.
If they want me back, I would go back. But the government is
nervous and they don't want me back. I don't want to be any trouble
to them. I can live wherever I am.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Unlike in China, however _ where you are said to have
millions of followers _ here in America very few people understand
your movement. Is Falun Gong a religion? Does it require faith?
 &HT;    A: It is a practice that can remove illnesses, keep people fit
and make one live longer. Like tai chi, it's a morning exercise.
People practicing Falun Gong are expected to follow the principles
of truthfulness, compassion and forbearance. And they must speak
truthfully, have compassion, be benevolent, be tolerant. But
whether people have other faiths or not, they can all practice
Falun Gong. We do not get involved in faiths. We respect all of
them.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Falun Gong has been described as a cult. Is that description
fair?
 &HT;    A: A cult advocates end-of-the-world theories and leads people
to do many bad things. I am only teaching people the practice for
healing and fitness. Not only that, I am teaching people to have
good moral characters. I think this is good and meaningful to
society. The Chinese government accused me of advocating a doomsday
and of saying I can delay the end of the world by 30 years. That's
really ridiculous. And very often people assume that in order to
study the Great Way of Falun they would have to live like a monk
and give up everything. Actually, all practitioners are members of
society; they do ordinary things just like anyone else.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Perhaps more specifically, cults don't tolerate dissent. Do
practitioners of Falun Gong have differing opinions? Or do they
tend to be of one mind on most things?
 &HT;    A: Normally people who do not like the principles of
truthfulness, compassion and tolerance would not be very likely to
study Falun Gong. Only the people who like these principles would
come to learn. But people come and go as they please, you know;
it's voluntary.

LONE STAR STANDOUT PUTS ON BIG SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hello, I'm the guy in the newspaper who tells you
what you missed. Wait, don't turn the page. I know you don't want
to learn just how good Lyle Lovett was Wednesday night at Universal
Ampitheatre. After all, once you find out what a good time
everybody had, you might .... Well, life is so unfair.
</P>
<P>
   But Lovett and his Large Band treated his fans to a show that
was as entertaining and expansive as his home state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lone Star State ever decides to appoint a goodwill
ambassador, Lovett would be the perfect choice. What could better
represent Texas than his wonderful deadpan humor and his
astonishing eclectic collection of songs?
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and skinny white tie, the
singer-songwriter and his stellar 15-piece band slid effortlessly
from folk to jazz to swing to country to gospel during Wednesday's
concert. Yet Lovett never strained. Even standing there ramrod
straight, he still appeared to swing, thanks in large part to an
expressive voice with a gravelly edge that sharpens his humor with
irony in a song like ``What Do You Do'' or adds ache and poignancy
to a ballad like ``North Dakota,'' on which he was joined by Lisa
Loeb. Lovett's vocal skills should not be underestimated. He is a
master of phrasing, which makes him an excellent interpreter of
either his own songs or those of others.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the gentleman, Lovett allowed his band members to showcase
their stuff, including Francine Reed, his backup singer
extraordinaire, who turned in a flamboyant ``Wild Women Don't Get
the Blues.'' Opening act and fellow Texas songwriter Robert Earl
Keen joined him on stage for two numbers. And even during the
rocking ``You Can't Resist It,'' cellist John Hagen turned in a
solo more akin to something you'd hear from the Kronos Quartet. But
in Lovett's universe, it seemed a perfectly natural part of the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett always kept the evening moving, leaving little time
between songs for patter, but when he did address the audience, he
was his usual self-effacing self, telling stories that derived
their humor from subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   After thanking all his L.A. friends for showing up, he launched
into ``That's Right (You're Not From Texas)'' with the following
line being ``but Texas wants you anyway.'' Indeed, if there weren't
a lot of real Texans at the concert, there were a lot of people who
adopted the state for the evening. And the rest were in a Texas
state of mind. One gentleman even tried to raise a Lone Star State
flag during Keen's opening set.
</P>
<P>
   Keen, whose songs have been recorded by Lovett, is one of those
little-heralded, often-overlooked Texas songwriters. His opening
set proved him an interesting performer as well as songwriter, but
he wasn't in Lovett's class.
</P>
<P>
   The fun of the evening ultimately was hearing such great Lovett
songs as the joyously whimsical ``If I had a Boat,'' ``M-O-N-E-Y,''
``Closing Time'' and, of course, the wry ``Here I Am'' _ which I
badly parodied in the opening paragraph of this review.
</P>
<P>
   And when Lovett intoned ``Please, if it's not too late, make it
a ...'' the audience gave him the punch line _ ``cheeseburger.''
They have those in Texas, don't they? &QL;

 &HT;    Down markets important test for funds
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With more than 5,000 mutual funds to pick from, how
can anyone find the right one? Never mind those ``10 hot funds to
buy now'' lists, says Forbes (Aug. 23). Look at how well a fund has
performed in bad markets as well as in good.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's honor roll of mutual funds that have ``lived
through downs as well as ups'' is topped by the Janus Fund, which
posted an average annual return of 18.5 percent _ before deductions
for loads and taxes _ between Aug. 31, 1987, and June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other top five funds are Vanguard 500 Index, 15.7 percent
average annual return; AXP New Dimension-A, 17.3 percent; Gabelli
Asset Fund, 16.1 percent; and Dreyfus Appreciation Fund, 14.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (September)
reminds investors that mutual funds aren't free. A big expense is
the cost of trading, which means that funds that engage in
excessive buying and selling of stocks also pay lots of broker
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study by Barra Inc., a financial research firm in
Berkeley, Calif., found that trading costs retard funds' returns,
and by far more than almost anyone had imagined,'' the magazine
says. It's important since the fund buyer eventually pays them.
</P>
<P>
   Barra found that funds that trade frequently have trading costs
of about 2 percent. Index funds, which do not trade as often, are
the cheapest, with trading costs of less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Worth (September), meanwhile, warns investors that the three
bears stalking the U.S. Goldilocks economy are the Federal Reserve,
China and the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is likely to raise interest rates again, China threatens
to worsen the Asian crisis by devaluing its currency, and the Y2K
computer problem could have widespread effects.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three bears is likely to be ferocious enough to
derail the economy, Worth says, ``but together they will be enough
to keep the stock market on edge for at least the remainder of
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Business Week (Aug. 16) cites Atlanta's recent day-trader
murders in a cover profile of gun makers, an industry ``under
fire.'' It is a diverse group including ``true-blue American brand
names'' such as Smith &AMP; Wesson and Colt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stock options have made lots of company bosses incredibly
rich, especially in the United States. Shareholders have gotten
richer, too. But The Economist (Aug. 13) says options have some
long-range disadvantages, such as diluting a firm's existing
equity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Atlanta-based companies make the Individual Investor
(September) 1999 list of 100 ``fastest-growing companies.'' They
are InfoCure, whose software is used by doctors to manage their
offices, and MindSpring Enterprises, an Internet service provider.

<P>
   LOMITA, Calif. -- The shooting of innocent children and adults
by white supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. is causing me a lot
of concern.
</P>
<P>
   I run a Jewish center here. It houses a day care facility, day
camp and school.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning I greet our 80 children, their parents, sometimes
grandparents, and staff. It's important to them that a rabbi, man
of the cloth, is there showing a true interest in their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions are lasting impressions. I love my students
and staff and take a personal interest in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   My center has been called and visited in recent days by local
officials, the Sheriff's Department and reporters. All want to know
what we are doing for the kids' safety.
</P>
<P>
   I am happy to state that, for one thing, we are increasing our

reductions in fees and scholarships. We will counteract the
negative publicity by making Jewish centers more available.
</P>
<P>
   The only answer to anti-Semitic acts of violence is redoubling
our efforts in teaching the joys and love for our tradition. Jewish
people are called the chosen people. I teach that we are not chosen
for victimization, but for contributing to civilization.
</P>
<P>
   No, we are not hiring security guards for the center. My kids
are of an impressionable age. The crucial sponge years, as they are
called. I don't need them to think that a Jewish school in America
needs armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I have a good staff, strong locks and iron gates. I also
place my trust in Almighty God for the ultimate protection.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish tradition commands us to place a mezuza, a hand-written
scroll proclaiming God's watchful and protective eye, on our
doorposts. All our doors have kosher mezuzas. Locks, gates, mezuzas
-- I am feeling safe.
</P>
<P>
   No, I also don't need Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
protect my center. He caused unreasonable fear when he commented on
the shooting and its ``international significance in the expansion
of terrorism against Israel and Jews all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes it sound as if we are in crisis and the Israeli army is
coming to save us.
</P>
<P>
   We are not going to install metal detectors, cement barriers and
bullet-proof windows. What we are doing is sending get-well cards
written by our campers to the recovering children in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   We are building a bigger and better school and hope Jews all
over the world are doing the same. To our sheriffs, FBI agents,
councilmen, mayor, governor and president, I thank you for your
concern. We know you are doing a great job.
</P>
<P>
   For me, overreaction would be carrying out the plan of the
nefarious Buford O'Neal Furrow when he said his actions are a
``Wake up call to America to kill Jews.''

   LOMITA, Calif. -- The shooting of innocent children and adults
by white supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. is causing me a lot
of concern.
</P>
<P>
   I run a Jewish center here. It houses a day care facility, day
camp and school.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning I greet our 80 children, their parents, sometimes
grandparents, and staff. It's important to them that a rabbi, man
of the cloth, is there showing a true interest in their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions are lasting impressions. I love my students
and staff and take a personal interest in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   My center has been called and visited in recent days by local
officials, the Sheriff's Department and reporters. All want to know
what we are doing for the kids' safety.
</P>
<P>
   I am happy to state that, for one thing, we are increasing our
efforts to attract more children to our center by offering
reductions in fees and scholarships. We will counteract the
negative publicity by making Jewish centers more available.
</P>
<P>
   The only answer to anti-Semitic acts of violence is redoubling

A DOCTOR'S APPROACH TO GUN VIOLENCE

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the gun battles continue to rage in the schools, on the
streets and in the fractious House of Representatives, something is
missing. Amid all the emotional rancor, something has gotten lost
in the controversy.
 &HT;    In a bygone era, they used to call it horse-sense. Today, in the
absence of any sense whatsoever, all that's left is the artful
dodge.
 &HT;    Throughout the debate so far, reason has been trumped by
strident hyperbole. But it need not be this way. It would be
helpful to approach the issue of gun mortality from a more clinical
perspective, taking a cue from the medical community, which deals
with death and morbidity all the time.
 &HT;    Perhaps if we saw the issue for what it really is -- a public
health calamity -- we could bring all the power and insight of
modern medicine to bear on the problem.
 &HT;    The first step in the search for a ``cure'' to the gun malady is
to identify potential causes of the problem. Then, as with any
medical condition, public health authorities could begin to test
their theories. But we can't test any theories -- or even gather
useful information Q- when special interest groups obstruct the
search for solutions.
 &HT;    At a time when additional research is urgently needed, the gun
lobby has called for the elimination of the National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), a division of the Centers
for Disease Control. The NCIPC has spearheaded much of the nation's
research on gun mortality, but the National Rifle Association
claims that the center has shown an ``almost vicious sentiment
against personal firearms ownership.''
 &HT;    Though scientists have been known to disagree with CDC findings,
in recent memory, no other organization has ever accused the CDC of
being ``vicious'' in its approach. It's a curious charge, given the
CDC's mission to save lives, but it's entirely consistent with the
NRA's desire to protect the status quo regarding gun ownership in
America.
 &HT;    While the CDC may have focused unwanted attention on gun
violence, it has also stressed a vital message: that further
research is needed to shed light on the causes of firearms
mortality.
 &HT;    In contrast, bitter rivals on both sides of the debate have
insisted that either the media or the gun lobby is to blame for the
epidemic of violence sweeping the nation.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, gun-control advocates target the firearms
industry while the NRA draws a huge bulls-eye on the foreheads of
media moguls. Apparently, neither side has considered another
option: Why not fire a few shots in both directions?
 &HT;    Of course, hitting something useful is precisely the goal of
scientific research, but it's hard to hit anything useful when your
eyes are closed. It seems safe to assume that the NRA would agree
with this notion. The Motion Picture Association of America, which
is fighting legislation to create a commission on youth violence,
needs its eyes pried open as well.
 &HT;    A good scientist would want to start his inquiry by examining
the existing body of data on gun mortality. Although we still have
much to learn about the causes of gun violence, certain trends are
already emerging from existing research. Substantial data, for
example, indicates that gun-related deaths are a major pediatric
health problem in the U.S. In fact, firearm-related injuries are
the second leading cause of death in children.
 &HT;    Every year, more than 5,000 children die as a result of gun
homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, and 20,000 more
are wounded. Accidental gun injuries account for almost 1,500
pediatric emergency room visits annually, and in 1994, nearly 200
children were killed in this manner.
 &HT;    Because of such staggering statistics, the American Academy of
Pediatrics has called for aggressive action to reduce the danger of
firearms to young people, including the removal of handguns from
households with children. The AAP has even called for a ban on the
manufacture, sale and private possession of handguns.
 &HT;    The nation's baby doctors aren't alone. In 1998, the Annals of
Internal Medicine reported that 94 percent of internists and 87
percent of surgeons believe that firearm violence is a major public
health issue. The journal also reported that a majority of doctors
surveyed support efforts to enact legislation to restrict the
possession or sale of handguns.
 &HT;    NRA president Charlton Heston probably doesn't agree. But the
NRA leader would be well advised to approach the problem as a
serious public health issue. If he really cares about the nation's
pediatric population, he'll try to think like a healthcare
provider: he'll analyze the available data and make an informed
decision that puts the interest of the patient before all other
concerns (like, for instance, the right to shoot animals).
 &HT;    If Heston could think like a doctor, he'd make the right
decision. Doctors must constantly make choices based on limited
data, since there's so little certainty in the practice of
medicine.
 &HT;    The trick is to make intelligent decisions that reduce
significant risks to the patient. And in the case of handguns, the
most conservative approach (clinically, if not politically) is to
err on the side of caution.
 &HT;    This means more than just putting safety locks on guns, but it
is telling that the NRA has resisted even this minimal treatment
for the gun malady. In 1997, when handgun manufacturers announced a
voluntary program to include trigger locks with new guns to help
reduce firearms injuries, the NRA immediately denounced the
measure. This was not exactly what one would call a ``clinical''
approach to the issue.
 &HT;    The basic problem is that the gun lobby, unlike the medical
establishment, has other priorities: reducing gun fatalities is
ultimately less important than protecting the right of gun owners
to have unfettered access to their weapons. This explains why the
NRA has fought virtually every effort to strengthen the barriers
between weapons and kids.
 &HT;    In its defense, the gun lobby consistently repeats the same
argument like a mantra: improve enforcement of existing laws and
the problem will go away. While better law enforcement is certainly
a worthwhile goal, major public health issues are rarely resolved
by narrowly focused efforts. Systemic, comprehensive solutions are
often required, especially when complex social factors are
involved.
 &HT;    Clearly, any solution that improves the odds for America's youth
-- from child safety locks to restricted access to handguns Q-will
entail some sacrifice on the part of gun owners. But it doesn't
take a brain surgeon to see that it's impossible to reduce the
risks to children without somehow reducing access to guns.
 &HT;    The question is, are gun owners up to the challenge? Are they
willing to do more than simply rely on existing laws? If they're
sincere in their desire to save lives, why not take a more
ambitious approach? Why not use all the tools at our disposal to
protect the nation's children?
 &HT;    That's how a doctor would approach the problem -- he'd do
everything possible to stack the odds in favor of the patient. One
can only hope that the gun lobby will take a similar approach.

 NEW YORK: the Amex. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is probably a two-year project for everything we want to
get implemented,'' Sodano said. ``But we have madde some pretty
significant strides in moving the institution along in a short
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $30 million worth of technology upgrades are already in
the works, Sodano said. These include a faster and vastly more
versatile electronic system to display and track pending stock
orders at specific prices and a new order-routing system for
equities and options that will drastically increase the capacity on
the options floor, Sodano said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond technology, the Amex plans to set up a service desk to
deal with its trading firms' problems, and it will soon hire a
senior-level sales executive to oversee efforts to attract more
listed companies and retain those already listed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in an aggressive bid for orders from brokers who serve
individual investors, it is permitting any retail order of less
than 2,100 shares to trade on the floor at no charge. Investors are
demanding low-cost trading, Sodano said, ``and it is tough to beat
`free.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, he said, 40 to 45 companies have listed on the
exchange, compared with about 50 new listings in all of 1998. ``And
we have a pipeline of more than a hundred companies waiting to
list,'' he said. ``If all goes well _ and they are all real good
companies _ we will have 150 new listings by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But people working with the exchange, which has wrestled with
some major scandals in its history, say management is still
struggling to bring the regulatory machinery up to speed, a problem
that must be resolved before there is any substantial surge in new
listings.
</P>
<P>
   That will further disappoint people who had expected that the
NASD would usher in a more effective pursuit of new Amex listings,
without which its trading floor cannot prosper. The continued
growth in Nasdaq's listings only adds to the apparent bitterness
that some traders have expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those skeptical of the efforts being made to improve the
core stock-trading operation is Andrew Schwarz, a specialist on the
Amex and a former member of its board of governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our equity business was broken and needed to be fixed,''
Schwarz said. ``Unfortunately, that has not been fixed yet, and the
floor was, and continues to be, unhappy about that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors establishing segments of the Amex market to match the
existing segments in the Nasdaq market, the National Market System
and the Small-Cap Market, with each Amex marketplace ready to list
any company that wants to move from the corresponding Nasdaq
lineup. The Amex could set up a market where even unlisted
``Bulletin Board'' stocks could benefit from auction trading, he
suggested, so long as any companies that proved dubious were
promptly kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to the basics of what Frank Zarb promised _
that companies on the Nasdaq would be given a choice between the
dealer market and the auction market _ that hasn't happened,''
Schwarz said. ``We still get hung up on miles of red tape and
listing standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the Amex can survive and prosper only if it
returns to its roots and once again becomes the auction market for
companies too small for the Big Board. Only then, he added, does it
make any sense to speculate about what a publicly traded Amex might
be worth _ and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does one predict the future when the environment is
changing as fast as it is?'' Schwarz asked as he questioned who
would dare buy shares in a stock exchange. ``If you look at the
last 50 years, there has been more change in the last two years
than in the previous 48.''
</P>
<P>
   While members are hoping for a successful turnaround that could
make the Amex more valuable, that might also intensify the
bickering over any profits from a spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD acquisition of the Amex was ``a bloodless coup,'' said
William Astrop of Atlanta, the owner of two Big Board seats and one
seat on the Amex. Estimating that an Amex seat might be worth as
much as $1 million in a public offering, Astrop predicted that
``there are going to be some unhappy seat owners when it dawns on
them that they are left out totally, that there is no payday, no
windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members acquainted with the terms wondered aloud whether
the right of first refusal if the NASD sells the Amex could become
a lever for disgruntled members to pry some share of the proceeds
out of the new owner of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Astrop, who gives Zarb extremely high marks for the progress
that has been made so far, nevertheless says that seat owners might
``get their dander up'' if the Amex was sold in a way that ``was
viewed as being high-handed.'' He mused, ``If we made a big enough
fuss, Zarb might toss us a bone just to keep us quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said that it was ``legally debatable'' whether the old Amex
members could claim any of the proceeds from a successful Amex sale
or stock offering. ``But practically, an unfriendly transaction
would be very, very unlikely,'' Zarb insisted. ``Who would want to
own an institution that doesn't have a wholesome, happy set of
practitioners?''

   OUTDOOR-SCULPTURE (New York) _ The outdoor sculpture season is
in full swing, with new works of all sorts punctuating New York at
sites from Lincoln Center to Pier 34 downtown to Coffey Park in Red
Hook, Brooklyn. Some are pieces of beauty and originality. But what
makes a tour of this year's exhibitions interesting is not so much
the level of artistic quality, which is not, on the whole,
overwhelmingly high, but the wonderful variety of relationships
produced between art and the urban environment. By Ken Johnson.

   NY-STAR-PARTY (New York) _ It's 8 p.m. and we're driving down
Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to a little-advertised nocturnal
gathering on the old runways of a decommissioned airport. While a
get-together in such an odd location might suggest some kind of
outlaw party, our rendezvous promises to be slightly less rowdy _
and totally cosmic. Almost every month for the last 17 years, the
Amateur Astronomers Association of New York has held a ``star
party'' at Floyd Bennett Field, one of the city's darkest corners.

 &HT;    Great casting, a brilliant premise, but ...
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something about Steve Martin movies. They never seem to
be as profoundly funny as Albert Brooks films. Never as well-acted
as Woody Allen comedies. Never, ever as ably slapstick as Buster
Keaton silents.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin's work can stick with you. Such as his no-rhythm
dance in 1979's ``The Jerk.'' His ``toora-loora-looral'' solo in
1992's ``Housesitter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new movie, ``Bowfinger,'' Martin has come up with an
absolutely beautiful premise for a movie and landed a top-notch
co-star in Eddie Murphy. Martin, who wrote the film, plays Bobby
Bowfinger, a hapless, two-bit Hollywood producer with a stinky
script about aliens invading Earth and a gem of a way to get it
filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit Ramsey (Murphy).
</P>
<P>
   With cameras rolling, Bowfinger simply throws his cast
(including Heather Graham and Christine Baranski) at Ramsey as the
actor tries to go about his real life. They chase his limousine
outside the star's home. They stalk him in a dark parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the time, it's a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy keeps the laughter rolling as ubercelebrity Ramsey. He's
forever outwardly sneering about the success of others _ he dubs
one peer ``Arnold Schwarzencracker'' _ while being so inwardly
paranoid that he's wigging out. And Murphy scores again in a second
role, playing a nerdy Ramsey look-alike whom Bowfinger finds to
fill in some scenes, including a fairly hilarious dash through
flying traffic on a Los Angeles interstate.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the kind of movie that, when the reel's done, adds
up to not much more than a few solid laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Martin does take potshots at L.A.'s fascination with costly
self-help gurus and orchestrates a series of politically incorrect
jokes about illegal immigrant labor. But ``Bowfinger'' never takes
on Hollywood with the real zing of ``Wag the Dog'' or the cutting
inside dope of ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   It's really just inside fluff _ with maybe one personal, icy
slam. Watch what Heather Graham's character does. And remember that
Martin used to date actress Anne Heche. That is, before she met
Ellen DeGeneres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham. Directed
by Frank Oz. Rated PG-13 for sex-related material and language. 1
hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Martin and Murphy team up for a few good laughs.

 &HT;    Kiss nostalgic `Detroit Rock City' goodbye
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1978, Robert Zemeckis (``Contact,'' ``Forrest Gump'') made
his directorial debut with a nifty little comedy called ``I Wanna
Hold Your Hand.'' Chronicling the misadventures of four
teeny-boppers from New Jersey determined to crash the Beatles' 1964
appearance on ``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' it was an affectionate and
often amusing tribute to a milestone event in pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years later, Adam Rifkin, whose credits include a
Charlie Sheen fiasco (is that redundant?) called ``The Chase,'' has
delivered ``Detroit Rock City.'' Set in 1978, it chronicles the
misadventures of four high-school misfits _ Jam (Sam Huntington),
Hawk (Edward Furlong), Trip (James De Bello) and Lex (Giuseppe
Andrews) _ determined to crash a Kiss concert in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   They had tickets, but Jam's fanatical mother _ who heads a group
called Mothers Against the Music of Kiss _ torched them. She also
locks Jam up in a boarding school, but his pals, with the help of a
hallucinogen-laced pizza, spring him. The four then head for
Detroit, where they each get to act out some rather far-fetched
adolescent fantasies of sex (losing your virginity in a
confessional booth) and heroism (foiling a convenience store
holdup).
</P>
<P>
   There are a few nostalgic touches that work. For example, Jam's
mother's LP collection includes the Carpenters and the soundtrack
to ``Dr. Zhivago.'' Plus, the movie vaguely evokes the kind of
teen-fan obsession that has nurtured the careers of acts from David
Cassidy to Nirvana. But, overall, ``Detroit Rock City'' doesn't ...
rock, that is. Rather it relies on lame put-downs of disco-loving
blue-collar Italians or of randy middle-aged women who inexplicably
want to see Furlong take it all off at a strip club.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss itself is played by the original group members (with lots
of quick cuts to disguise the passing years). They seem to be good
sports.
</P>
<P>
   And former Playboy Playmate Shannon Tweed, now wed to Kiss' Gene
Simmons, has a small role as a gorgeous older woman who, for
reasons never quite made clear, pays Furlong to have sex with her.
But as for the promos comparing this drivel to ``Rock 'n' Roll High
School'' or ``Dazed and Confused,'' let's just say, in your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit
</P>
<P>
   Rock City''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward
</P>
<P>
   Furlong and Sam Huntington. Directed by Adam Rifkin. Rated R for
nudity, language, drug use and sexual situations. 1 hour,

</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Kiss
</P>
<P>
   it off.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino and Jill
Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   C+
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Jeff Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's marred by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road''
arrives in theaters with a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation
of Alfred Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,''
hot-wired to a national nervous system that's already jolted by
heavily armed teenage
</P>
<P>
   commandos and Midwestern spree shooters. (SM) 1 hour, 57
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest moneymaker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM) 1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace'' PG-13 (violent content, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes,
</P>
<P>
   Kate Beckinsale and Bill Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers prison drama. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale
sweat it out in a Thai maximum-security pit after being duped into
dope smuggling. Unbearably high-minded, the movie doesn't even have
the B-movie juice of an old babes-behind-bars melodrama. (SM) 1
hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' R (brief nudity, sexuality, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Furlong
</P>
<P>
   and Sam Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss it off. This lame rip-off of Robert Zemeckis' ``I Wanna
Hold Your Hand'' chronicles the misadventures of four die-hard KISS
fans as they try to crash their idols' concert. Set in 1978, the
film has a few amusing nostalgic touches, but mostly it's a sorry
collection of adolescent fantasies that look almost quaint compared
to what else is going on in teen movies this summer. (ERG) 1 hour,
30 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick'' PG-13 (profanity, drug content,

</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams play teen girls who
unwittingly bring down Richard Nixon's White House in this mix of
``Clueless'' and ``Forrest Gump.'' Too bad the movie's target
audience won't get most of the Watergate jokes, and that the
movie's first half has a dangerously uncertain tone. (SM)1 hour, 30

   Starring Kirsten Dunst,
</P>
<P>
   Denise Richards, Kirstie Alley
</P>
<P>
   and Ellen Barkin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cheerfully mean-spirited spoof of beauty pageants.
Remember 1975's ``Smile''? Except for a switch from cheerleading to
beauty pageants, the plot here is much the same as the 1993 cable
flick ``The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas
Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.'' ``Gorgeous'' stoops to obvious sight
gags and even broader performances than in ``Mom.'' (SM) 1 hour, 37
minutes. B-

<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM)44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM)2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. Somebody's got to
turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and disguised as an
A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is an over-directed,
overwritten and ultimately underwhelming whodunit B-grade thriller.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM) 1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' R (profanity, violent creature attacks,
</P>
<P>
   gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Pullman,
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes watchable, underpopulated ``Jaws'' retread
about a giant crocodile, the croc attacks are predictable and
rudimentary. This is the sort of movie in which no one but bit
players get their heads bitten off. Pity. The scares aren't scary,
the laughs aren't funny, and poor Bridget Fonda has to keep falling
off moving vehicles directly into the path of the monster croc,
like some 1940s hapless heroine. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. C-

<P>
   ``Muppets From Space'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring The Great Gonzo,
</P>
<P>
   Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   Beam us up, Gonzo. The Great Gonzo goes searching for his roots
and discovers he may have extraterrestrial family ties. It's the
same Muppet mania that's always worked _ a mix of vaudeville
shtick, kid-friendly slapstick and hilarious movie in-jokes to
tickle their parents. A perfect choice for families who may not be
quite ready to test ``South Park'' waters, but appreciate a blend
of sweetness and wit. (ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' PG-13 (comic action violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess! Ben
Stiller and Janeane Garofalo headline a ragmuffin team of superhero
wannabes. But the movie is mostly like its hapless heroes _ kind of
clumsy and good intentioned but with none of the knack it takes to
save the day, or itself. (SM) 2 hours, 1 minute. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.

   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains

<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG) 2 hours, 10 minutes. B+

<P>
   and Jennifer Tilly.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Anderson, Jennifer Tilly and Lori Petty star in this
big ensemble comedy-drama about a group of gay and straight friends
in Los Angeles, falling in and out of love. The repartee and
observations are often sharp and witty, but midway through the
movie loses its center and its focus. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-

<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Franka Potente
</P>
<P>
   and Moritz Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this
adrenalin-fueled German flick is the big-screen love child of every
video game and MTV quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
Franka Potente plays the flame-haired woman who has 20 minutes to
run through Berlin in search of 100,000 marks, or lose her lover.
In German with English subtitles. (SM)1 hour, 21 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger,
</P>
<P>
   Longer &AMP; Uncut'' R (profanity, gross-out humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   It offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and also funniest) bit of celluloid to
ever make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty
cultural artifact that captures the here and now of American media
obsessions, circa 1999. It should be put inside a time capsule.
(SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C+

<P>
   ``Tarzan'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' PG-13 (action violence,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith,
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer, this tale of 1800s agent
James West, based on the old TV show, is a bizarre mix of
overproduced camp, sloppy pacing and tepid scripting. Will Smith
and Kevin Kline have zero sparks of buddy chemistry. ``Wild Wild
West'' is anything but wild. It's a washout. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska) 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps,
</P>
<P>
   Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship is what sets this movie apart from the usual genre
pigeonholing of African-American cliches and becomes something much
more universal. It's a male-bonding flick that transcends issues of
race. (SM)1 hour, 46 minutes. B

 &HT;    Conquering a rugged range in New Hampshire
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORHAM, N.H. _ A string of rugged peaks that sprawl across the
New Hampshire-Maine border, the Mahoosuc Range is a bejeweled
landscape of crags, sparkling lakes and forests where moose roam
free.
</P>
<P>
   In my 20 years of backpacking I have covered more than 5,000
miles of trail from the rolling Georgia Blue Ridge to the jagged
Rockies of Colorado, from the snowy Cascade crest of Washington to
the rainy pinnacles of Great Britain's Lake District, and I have
never hiked a more difficult section of footpath than the
Appalachian Trail across the Mahoosuc Range.
</P>
<P>
   For six days I toiled solo across this hellish landscape.
Boulders were so large that my arms ached as much as my legs from
crawling up and over these obstacles. I walked over stony summits
so windy that my face burned. And there was a loneliness that often
engulfed me as I challenged this wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But when I looked around, my loneliness always faded like the
mountain fog giving way to a sun-splashed morning. In the glory of
a New England fall, there may be no place more spectacular. Maples
and birches mantled in red, gold and yellow, a tide of intense
colors rising to summits that are crowned with the black-green of
spruce and fir trees and the gray-blue of sheer rock.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the foliage at its dazzling peak by late September
or early October, the air is crisp, with nights frequently in the
30s, cold enough to make a sleeping bag interesting and displace
memories of another hot Georgia summer.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds are long gone after Labor Day. During my hike last
fall through the Mahoosucs I saw only nine hikers during my three
days on the range, fewer than you would see on the Appalachian
Trail in North Georgia during the same time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Being solitary in these boreal woods offers its own rewards. Two
special nights I sat in my camp with only the sound of the wind
rustling the newly fallen leaves and my own deep breaths of the
crisp air, while twinkling stars peeked down through the canopy of
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruggedness of the Mahoosucs, the range can be
explored in short day hikes to ponds and peaks, allowing hikers to
carry small packs and sleep in town. Most hikers take four or five
days to cover the 31 miles of Appalachian Trail, which swings north
from near Gorham and across into Maine, camping at one of five
lean-to shelters and campsites along the way.
</P>
<P>
   At the crossroads of U.S. 2 and N.H. 16, Gorham is a good base
for any hiking adventure in this part of New England. Long a
popular stopover for AT through-hikers (people hiking the entire
2,100-mile path from Georgia to Maine), Gorham has much to offer
those out for shorter trips. From standard motels to cozy
bed-and-breakfast inns, there are a number of accommodations in the
Gorham area.
</P>
<P>
   To the south of town stand the legendary White Mountains, a
range crisscrossed with paths. Only 10 miles away is Pinkham Notch
Visitors Center, the Appalachian Mountain Club's famous lodge that
is used by thousands of people each year to start their climb up
Mount Washington. Along the crests of the Whites, the AMC operates
nine huts, back country refuges that offer bunks and hot meals.
</P>
<P>
   Gorham is a lovely old railroad town of 3,100 residents. Perched
along the Androscoggin River, Gorham is filled with old Victorian
homes, quaint shops and a good variety of restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   One of those old houses, a brightly painted three-story gem on
the town's Main Street, is now the Libby House Bed &AMP; Breakfast, as
well as the home of Paul and Maggie Kuliga and their little girl,
Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of old New England homes, the stable of this rambling
old place is connected to the house. The Kuligas have turned this
regional architectural nuance into a hikers' hostel dubbed ``The
Barn.'' To get the flavor of the trail as well as chat with some
through-hikers, I spend my first night in the hostel for $10.50
(the rate is now $15). Upstairs there is a row of single beds,
downstairs a small kitchen and TV room with rumpled and worn
couches.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Paul and Maggie drove me up into Maine where the
AT crosses a back road near the village of Andover. For this
shuttle service, the Kuligas charged the cheap fare of $18.
</P>
<P>
   Ever ambitious in my adventures, I decided to hike across a
series of lesser known but equally rugged Maine peaks before I
reached the Mahoosucs. In six days I covered 42 miles.
</P>
<P>
   During the ice age, these summits, as well as the adjacent
Mahoosucs, which are actually not quite as high as Georgia's Blue
Ridge, were scoured by glaciers, carving cliffs and deep passes
known in these parts as notches. When the ice retreated about
10,000 years ago, the rubble of the glaciers was deposited across a
landscape that is now thick with forest.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is an impediment to foot travel, as hikers must step
frequently over rocks and gnarly tree roots. At many places, I had
to use my arms to scramble up and down ledges and boulders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sculpture of the ice also left behind majestic beauty.
So much open rock means numerous spellbinding vistas, while places
gouged by glaciers are now placid ponds. The rocky forest floor is
carpeted with rich green moss and ferns, a wondrous contrast to the
bright red berries of ash trees and the surrounding fall foliage.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on that first afternoon, the path descended so
steeply into Sawyer Notch that the trail lost 1,400 feet in
elevation in a mere three-quarters of a mile. It is so precipitous
that trail maintainers have drilled iron bars into the rocks to
provide hand- and footholds. By contrast, the steepest grade on the
AT in Georgia is up Blood Mountain, a stretch that gains 1,300 feet
in 2.4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer Notch was one of the few places I have ever hiked where I
sweated as much going downhill as I did walking up. Yet this was
not the most difficult part of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   That came four days later, when I scrambled through Mahoosuc
Notch, a narrow pass that is nothing but a milelong pile of
boulders. It took me two hours to negotiate this devilish terrain,
often crawling on my hands and knees under the car-size rocks. The
same afternoon I was retaught another lesson of New England's
mountains: In autumn, the weather can quickly turn nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of Mahoosuc Notch, where I perspired in a T-shirt and
shorts, I had to climb over the twin peaks of Goose Eye Mountain.
Between North Peak (3,680 feet) and East Peak (3,794 feet) the path
strings along a milelong open saddle of alpine tundra. It's all
rock, bogs and dense stands of brushy krummholz, dwarf spruce and
fir trees that cling to life in these harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I reached the crest, the temperature had dropped to
near freezing. Blowing a fine mist, the wind gusted to perhaps 40
mph. My pack turning into a sail, the gale literally blew me off my
feet five times. Fighting the wind up the last set of ledges of
East Peak, clinging to every crevice with all my strength, was one
of the most physically demanding things I've ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Upon struggling to this wind-blasted summit, questioning my
sanity for being on this massive rock, the mountains told me why I
was there. Almost like magic, the clouds lifted and displayed
sun-splashed country awash in fall color. Under a deep blue sky,
the vista stretched for some 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That night I slept fitfully in my sleeping bag. An icy wind blew
into the open end of the three-sided Carlo Col Shelter. I was
scratched and bruised, but satisfied that I had survived the
mountain's might.
</P>
<P>
   The next day my trek ended in Gorham, on a blustery afternoon of
falling leaves and nippy frost. I stayed in one of the Libby House
Bed &AMP; Breakfast's antique-furnished rooms in the main house for $50
(the price range is now $65-$80), enjoying a long soak in the tub.
Later I enjoyed a plate of eggplant parmigiana with a glass of red
wine at Salidino's Italian Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Like most backpackers, I love trekking not just for the Spartan
glory of nature or the physical challenge, but also for sharpening
my appetite for the comforts of civilization. The Mahoosucs and
Gorham are a good place to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Both Boston and Portland, Maine, airports are
served by direct flights from Atlanta. Typically, fares into Boston
are cheaper than Portland, but Gorham is a four-hour car drive from
Boston, while it's only about two hours from Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Flights into Boston offer the option of riding the Concord
Trailways bus direct from Logan Airport. Round-trip fare to Gorham
is $59.55. I took this pleasant five-hour ride through the heart of
scenic New Hampshire and thoroughly enjoyed it. For Concord
Trailways schedules and fares call 1-800-639-8080, or visit the Web
at www.concordtrailways.com

<P>
   The Appalachian Trail and cancer. The two have carved an odd,
twisting path though the life of Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff
writer John Harmon since he suffered his first symptoms while
hiking the AT in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, the paper's correspondent for the southern Appalachians,
rallied and was a major contributor to the paper's ``An Appalachian
Adventure'' series the next year. ``Sort of my Tour de France,'' he
calls it.
</P>
<P>
   After his AT hike last fall across the Mahoosuc Range,
chronicled in today's story, Harmon's cancer returned. This year,
he has endured radiation and chemotherapy, and is recovering from
recent brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am on the mend,'' says Harmon, 44, ``and thoughts of being
back on the Appalachian Trail again this fall are pulling on my
mind. This is the 20th anniversary of my hiking the entire
(2,100-plus-mile) trail, so my goal is to get back out there for a
few days. Maybe several.''

 &HT;    `Brokedown' a prisoner of cliches
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When best pals Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate
Beckinsale) panic over a single cockroach crawling through their
Bangkok hotel room, you just know that ``Brokedown Palace'' is
heading toward a scene with a whole lot of bugs. It's that kind of
movie _ so predictable that you keep waiting for the next
inevitable moment.
</P>
<P>
   Will that hunky blond Australian dude (Daniel Lapaine) whom they
meet on their vacation prove too good to be true? Will jealousy
blossom between the friends? Will Thai police discover a couple of
kilos of heroin in their luggage? Will the girls wind up locked
away for an outrageous number of years in a nasty-stinky Third
World jail?
</P>
<P>
   Yep, yep, yep and yep. As you tick off plot points, you may
start to wonder what audience the filmmakers thought they were
serving. What untapped demographic is out there aching to watch
talented young actresses choke down rotting soup and sweat in a
maximum-security pit? Unbearably high-minded, the movie doesn't
even have the B-movie juice of an old babes-behind-bars melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   The flick's main spark comes from Bill Pullman, redeeming his
comatose performance in ``Lake Placid.'' He plays ``Yankee Hank,''
an ambulance-chasing lawyer who takes on the girls' case, for a
price. (His ingratiating, oily performance is a reminder of what a
good sleazeball he makes, as in ``The Last Seduction.'') Lou
Diamond Phillips also has some nice scenes as a sardonic U.S. drug
agent very well-versed in Bangkok's shadier political alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jonathan Kaplan, with ``The Accused'' and ``Love
Field'' on his resume, continues his streak of unbalanced movies
distinguished by their lead actresses' performances. Brit
Beckinsale makes a convincing American and turns in strong work.
But the showier role goes to Danes, as the hothead of the pair.
David Arata's script makes a big deal over the question of Alice's
innocence _ did she or didn't she know about the drugs in her bag?
But when the girls are facing four decades of jail time, that seems
a trivial point of debate to hang a movie on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes, Kate Beckinsale and Bill Pullman. Rated
PG-13 for brief strong language, drug-related material and some
violent content. 1 hour, 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A by-the-numbers prison drama.

SUICIDE RENEWS DEBATE ABOUT MENTALLY ILL CRIMINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ralph Tortorici's death behind bars is prompting
a re-examination of an old debate: Should New York state allow a
verdict of guilty but mentally ill?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many states, New York does not allow juries to find a
defendant both criminally culpable and insane. Consequently, the
jury that convicted the indisputably deranged man of taking a class
at the State University of New York at Albany hostage and shooting
a student had but three choices.
</P>
<P>
   The jury could have found that Tortorici did not commit the acts
alleged in the indictment _ an absurdity, since there were dozens
of witnesses. It could have found him not guilty because of his
mental illness _ a difficult option since the jury was not informed
that if it rendered that verdict Tortorici would go to a mental
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the panel could take what experts and observers say is the
relatively easy out: Convict Tortorici and let somebody else worry
about his mental condition.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it chose the third option, as juries do in the
vast majority of cases: Out of roughly 100,000 criminal cases heard
in New York courts annually, roughly 50 defendants are found not
guilty because of mental disease or defect. On Tuesday morning,
Tortorici hanged himself in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest weakness of the insanity defense is
public perception,'' said William Mcintyre, a psychologist who
examined Tortorici. ``Most people think it is used way too much and
people are getting off. But the reality is it is used in a
minuscule number of cases and is successful in only about one of
four cases in which it is used. In this area, I can think of one in
the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mcintyre said the defense tends to be used in few cases for two
main reasons: first, it is rarely successful; second, when it is
successful, the patient typically ends up in a secure mental
institution for a longer period than they would have been
incarcerated if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good bet, even when you win, '' Mcintyre said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Tortorici's less-than-surprising suicide on Tuesday
_ he had attempted to kill himself at least once before _ some
officials are re-considering New York's laws, and pondering whether
the state should join several others that allow a verdict of guilty
but mentally ill. Under one proposal, a defendant convicted under
that theory would be confined to a mental institution until
regaining his or her sanity, and then would be punished for the
crime with a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent idea if _ if _ they are going to commit the
resources to treating them while they are incarcerated,'' said Dr.
Thomas J. Qaultere, a Schenectady psychologist who treated
Tortorici.
</P>
<P>
   Qualtere said there was no question that Tortorici committed the
crimes with which he was charged, and no question that he was
severely disturbed. Undisputed evidence showed that Tortorici, who
suffered from a penile deformity, was convinced that government
conspirators had implanted a mind-controlling microchip in his sex
organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't have been in there shooting if he didn't want the
governor and president of the university to come and get the
microchip out of his penis,'' Qualtere said. ``Once he committed
the crime, we are still obligated to treat the ongoing, painful
delusion and thought disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ``guilty but mentally ill'' option is legislatively,
and philosophically, problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes the whole notion of what it means to be guilty,''
said Vincent M. Bonventre, a professor of law at the Albany Law
School. ``To say that someone is guilty is to say they are
criminally culpable, that they are blameworthy, that they are at
fault, that they are evil. To say that somebody has done something
evil and is criminally culpable but insane and didn't know what he
was doing, doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several efforts over the years to alter New
York's laws on the insanity defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Long Island, has for years promoted
changing New York law to allow a guilty but mentally ill verdict.
It has passed the Republican-controlled Senate six times, but has
never cleared the Democratic Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a choice now, either the guy is acquitted by reason
on insanity, and receives no prison time, or he goes to a
correctional facility,'' said Edward DeCosmo, spokesman for the
senator. ``There's nothing in between. In the Tortorici case, it is
entirely possible that he would have received better psychiatric
care than he received. An individual receiving the alternate
verdict would receive much better psychiatric care than is now
possible.''

AUTHOR REVEALS THE OFTEN ODD DOINGS IN CALIFORNIA'S COMPUTER
WONDERLAND (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an insider's look at the highly charged and often insane
world of Silicon Valley, check out Po Bronson's first nonfiction
book.
</P>
<P>
   The title tells us right away what Bronson's gonzo journalistic
eye can expose: It's ``The Nudist on the Late Shift: And Other True
Tales of Silicon Valley'' (Random House, 248 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   A drab area in the middle of California, Silicon Valley is not
much more than a collection of nondescript 1-story industrial
buildings and insanely expensive small apartments and houses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is home to some of the most powerful minds in the world.
The products born there have profoundly changed technology and
business, and the money generated by the industry is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   It became the leader of the 21st century years before the end of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Its unorthodox creation method, which combines commerce with
lifestyle, may well be the model that business must follow to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson, a fiction writer blessed by Tom Wolfe, has been a
journalist for the likes of ``The Wall Street Journal, New York
Times Magazine'' and ``Wired.'' In true gonzo style, he leads
readers through story after story, intertwining individual careers
and the life cycle of companies, and somehow uncovering universal
truths that make the world a little clearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In LA, everybody has a screenplay,'' Bronson writes. ``In
Silicon Valley, everyone has a business idea. And they're always
`this close' to a $20 million payday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronson often changes the names of people or companies. But we
can presume his accounts as factual: Nobody could make this stuff
up.
</P>
<P>
   Take the vignette that led to the title of the book. A source
told Bronson about a nudist programmer, but she wasn't sure of the
details or the name. Bronson sent out several e-mail messages with
variations of the spelling of the name. One day, he received a
message back: ``Looking for me?'' with a phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson called, and after some dancing around, asked the
question: Is it true? The programmer responded that it was, then
explained. He worked from 4 p.m. until 2 or 3 in the morning. After
10 p.m., he typically took off his clothes. Nobody in the eccentric
programming community batted an eye. The programmer was happy until
he misread a clock and stripped too early, running into a union
employee, who complained.
</P>
<P>
   The programmer was nearly fired, but the fiasco blew over
because he was too valuable to be let go. His explanation: ``Work
today has to be half work, half play. We spend our whole lives at
the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronson puts it another way: ``Every generation that came before
us had to make a choice in life between pursuing a steady career
and pursuing wild adventures. In Silicon Valley, that trade-off has
been recircuited. By injecting mind-boggling amounts of risk into
the once stodgy domain of gray-suited business, young people `no
longer have to choose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Will this wild ride at Silicon Valley continue? Bronson thinks
so.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital funds once took on around 10 start-up ventures
at a time for around $50,000. Now, they are averaging five to seven
deals with $500,000, Bronson writes. And the start-ups have to
project being a leader in their market, with more than $1 billion
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the ideas to fund those ventures are abundant, Bronson
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this industry is driven by ideas, the fundamentals have
never been better,'' he writes. ``The next five years will be the
Valley's greatest boom of innovation to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The roller coaster continues, and Bronson puts us in a seat at
the front of the first car.

   ``Thinking Like An Entrepreneur: How to Make Intelligent
Business Decisions That Will Lead to Success in Building and
Growing Your Own Company''
</P>
<P>
   By Peter I. Hupalo
</P>
<P>
   HCM Publishing, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   This book goes beyond the typical listing of what-to-do tips for
entrepreneurial success. Instead, it discusses how to think to
become successful. But it is more than just a psychological
analysis of whether you have what it takes. The author offers
mathematical calculations to determine the proper road. Chapters
include discussions on cash flow vs. earnings, expectation values
and the time value of money.

Day Trading Phenomenon''
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas DeMark and Thomas DeMark Jr.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw Hill, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   Thomas DeMark has 28 years in the investment business, and has
had the likes of George Soros, IBM and Union Carbide as clients for
hedge funds and mutual funds. His son and namesake is a trader for
a large hedge fund. Together, they take on the complex subject of
day trading with an options spin. The elder DeMark says that
complaints about the complexity of his two previous books have been
addressed in this one. But he also acknowledges that tackling new
approaches to market analysis ``is just plain difficult.''

</P>
<P>
   We all start out with about 3 pounds of gray matter. What we do
with it is up to us, business consultant Stephen Eiffert writes in
his book on creativity. Cross-training your brain helps make you
aware of the way you think and helps you form new thinking
patterns, he writes. The book provides several exercises to help
get those creative juices flowing.

   They are about the size of a paper-towel holder, bright yellow
with orange lettering. A little white plastic umbrella is attached

little items are far from innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   They are bomblets from cluster bombs _ NATO's deadliest
anti-personnel weapon _ left behind by the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   During the war against Yugoslavia which generated so much
rhetoric about precision-guided smart bombs, the cluster bomb was
the ultimate ``dumb bomb.'' Many of them fail to ignite on impact;
like land mines, the unexploded bomblets that break off a cluster
bomb can continue to kill for years, posing a particular threat to
active, curious children.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-month air war, the signed peace agreement
thankfully may have ended the fighting, but it could take years to
clean up the dangerous environmental debris left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo landscape is littered with remnants of anti-tank
shells made of depleted uranium and other unexploded ordinance.
Dangerous chemical and oil spills may already have contaminated the
Danube, which flows through Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova.
Even Italian fisherman have been pulling larger unexploded bombs
out of their nets in the Adriatic Sea, where NATO aircraft dropped
unused payloads en route back to their Aviano, Italy base.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are now trying to assess the hazards and
come up with a plan of action. On June 16, the U.N. Environment
Program and the U.N. Committee on Human Settlement convened a
special meeting of international environmental groups, including
Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and the Green Cross. A special
Balkans Task Force also was established under the leadership of
Pekka Haavisto, the former Finnish environment minister.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the CBU-87, the cluster bomb most commonly
dropped by U.S. aircraft, disperses its 202 submunitions over an
area larger than a football field. While the manufacturer claims
that these bomblets have a dud rate of between 2 percent and 5
percent, a report by Human Rights Watch stated that up to 23
percent of the weapons fail to explode on impact in testing. In
essence, the duds become above-ground land mines, able to detonate
at the slightest touch, even after extended periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon revealed that U.S.
forces alone dropped 1,100 cluster bombs on Yugoslavia. That means
about 11,000 live bomblets remain, in addition to an unknown number
dropped by British aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, the Associated Press reported that the first allied
fatalities in Kosovo _ two soldiers killed by an explosion at a
schoolhouse in Negrovce, a village 20 miles from Pristina _ were
victims of a NATO cluster bomb, not a Serb booby trap, as
originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. F-15E and F-16 fighter bombers began using cluster bombs in
Kosovo on April 6. Their intended targets were airfields and large
troop concentrations, but civilians also were hit.
</P>
<P>
   By now, if the U.S. Air Force would deploy special unmanned
planes _ drones called the Hunter and the Predator _ equipped with
synthetic aperture radar, designed for rooting out minefields but
also able to find cluster bombs, scores of fatalities could be
prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be providing pretty detailed maps of where the stuff was
dropped,'' said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Bill Dowdy, ``but it's
not our job to clean up all this ordnance.'' He said the cleanup of
unexploded ordnance is now the responsibility of the RONCO
Consulting Corp., based in Washington and Berkeley, Calif., which
has signed a $1.6 million contract with the State Department to
de-mine Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial use of anti-tank ammunition made from depleted
uranium may pose even more serious dangers. Depleted uranium, or
U-235, is the radioactive and toxic byproduct left behind when
uranium is enriched for use as nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   When the uranium shell hits an armored target, up to 70 percent
of the material burns, leaving behind particles of airborne uranium
that can be inhaled. Individuals who go near the impact area soon
after the explosion can inhale the dust, which can cause kidney,
skin and respiratory damage, as well as lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has confirmed the use of depleted uranium in Kosovo by the
Air Force's A-10 Warthog, which can fire about 3,900 rounds of 30mm
depleted-uranium ammunition every minute. Despite Pentagon claims
that the weapons are relatively safe, gulf war veterans' groups
have said that they fear the material is responsible for many of
the strange symptoms that are a part of Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, in a June 18
editorial in the Manchester Guardian, warned of the dangers of
depleted uranium in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev called for an international prohibition of ``weapons
whose use may have particularly dangerous, long-term environmental
and medical consequences.'' He is also calling for international
protocols that would forbid the use of depleted-uranium weapons, as
well as deliberate air strikes against nuclear power stations and
some chemical and petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Bill Mesler, a Washington, D.C.-based journalist, writes
frequently on arms-control issues for The Progressive, The Nation
and other publications. Mesler has conducted extensive
investigative research on the health and environmental effects of
depleted-uranium weapons.) &LR;

like land mines, the unexploded bomblets that break off a cluster
bomb can continue to kill for years, posing a particular threat to
active, curious children.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-month air war, the signed peace agreement
thankfully may have ended the fighting, but it could take years to
clean up the dangerous environmental debris left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo landscape is littered with remnants of anti-tank
shells made of depleted uranium and other unexploded ordinance.
Dangerous chemical and oil spills may already have contaminated the
Danube, which flows through Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova.
Even Italian fisherman have been pulling larger unexploded bombs
out of their nets in the Adriatic Sea, where NATO aircraft dropped
unused payloads en route back to their Aviano, Italy base.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are now trying to assess the hazards and
come up with a plan of action. On June 16, the U.N. Environment
Program and the U.N. Committee on Human Settlement convened a
special meeting of international environmental groups, including
Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and the Green Cross. A special
Balkans Task Force also was established under the leadership of
Pekka Haavisto, the former Finnish environment minister.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the CBU-87, the cluster bomb most commonly
dropped by U.S. aircraft, disperses its 202 submunitions over an
area larger than a football field. While the manufacturer claims
that these bomblets have a dud rate of between 2 percent and 5
percent, a report by Human Rights Watch stated that up to 23
percent of the weapons fail to explode on impact in testing. In
essence, the duds become above-ground land mines, able to detonate
at the slightest touch, even after extended periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon revealed that U.S.
forces alone dropped 1,100 cluster bombs on Yugoslavia. That means
about 11,000 live bomblets remain, in addition to an unknown number
dropped by British aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, the Associated Press reported that the first allied
fatalities in Kosovo _ two soldiers killed by an explosion at a
schoolhouse in Negrovce, a village 20 miles from Pristina _ were
victims of a NATO cluster bomb, not a Serb booby trap, as
originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. F-15E and F-16 fighter bombers began using cluster bombs in
Kosovo on April 6. Their intended targets were airfields and large
troop concentrations, but civilians also were hit.
</P>
<P>
   By now, if the U.S. Air Force would deploy special unmanned
planes _ drones called the Hunter and the Predator _ equipped with
synthetic aperture radar, designed for rooting out minefields but
also able to find cluster bombs, scores of fatalities could be
prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be providing pretty detailed maps of where the stuff was
dropped,'' said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Bill Dowdy, ``but it's
not our job to clean up all this ordnance.'' He said the cleanup of
unexploded ordnance is now the responsibility of the RONCO
Consulting Corp., based in Washington and Berkeley, Calif., which
has signed a $1.6 million contract with the State Department to
de-mine Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial use of anti-tank ammunition made from depleted
uranium may pose even more serious dangers. Depleted uranium, or
U-235, is the radioactive and toxic byproduct left behind when
uranium is enriched for use as nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   When the uranium shell hits an armored target, up to 70 percent
of the material burns, leaving behind particles of airborne uranium
that can be inhaled. Individuals who go near the impact area soon
after the explosion can inhale the dust, which can cause kidney,
skin and respiratory damage, as well as lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has confirmed the use of depleted uranium in Kosovo by the
Air Force's A-10 Warthog, which can fire about 3,900 rounds of 30mm
depleted-uranium ammunition every minute. Despite Pentagon claims
that the weapons are relatively safe, gulf war veterans' groups
have said that they fear the material is responsible for many of
the strange symptoms that are a part of Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, in a June 18
editorial in the Manchester Guardian, warned of the dangers of
depleted uranium in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev called for an international prohibition of ``weapons
whose use may have particularly dangerous, long-term environmental
and medical consequences.'' He is also calling for international
protocols that would forbid the use of depleted-uranium weapons, as
well as deliberate air strikes against nuclear power stations and
some chemical and petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Bill Mesler, a Washington, D.C.-based journalist, writes
frequently on arms-control issues for The Progressive, The Nation
and other publications. Mesler has conducted extensive
investigative research on the health and environmental effects of
depleted-uranium weapons.) &LR;

   KIM RICHEY/``GLIMMER'' (Mercury)
</P>
<P>
   Country chanteuse Richey didn't need a proclamation from Music
City's elders to discover her edgy country-pop was persona non
grata in Nashville. After two highly regarded but commercially flat
solo albums, Richey simply split for the greener pastures of her
hometown of Bellingham, Wash. Predictably, her enjoyable new disc
turns its back almost entirely on torch 'n' twang, instead aiming
for the ethereal, self-confident adult-contemporary stance of Sarah
McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   Working with producer Hugh Padgham (Sting, XTC, Bowie) and a
ragtag ensemble of avant-pop session cats like Sting guitarist
Dominick Miller, Richey retains a few country-esque touches such as
tasteful mandolin and accordion, but she's squarely switched to a
free-floating pop approach on such melodic, strings-laden standouts
as ``Hello Old Friend,'' first single ``Come Around,'' ``Didn't I''
and ``If You Don't Mind.'' Richey is so good, we don't even miss
the pedal steel. 3 stars
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   RUTH CAMERON/``FIRST SONGS'' (Emarcy)!off!
</P>
<P>
   Jazz fans know Cameron for inspiring and co-producing husband
Charlie Haden's work, and here the influential bassist gets a
chance to return the favor on his wife's debut recording. The
highlight is Cameron's caressed reading of ``First Song,'' Haden's
beautiful standard that now contains lyrics supplied by Abbey
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's involvement is no mere coincidence. Cameron's honest,
precise singing owes a debt to Lincoln as well as Shirley Horn.
Unfortunately, the album's program is as spare as its trio
arrangements. (Cameron is backed by Haden on bass, pianist Chris
Dawson and Haden's Quartet West collaborator Larance Marable on
drums.) Its seven songs span a mere 26 minutes, making this
midprice release a bit too little of a pretty good thing. 2 1/2
stars
</P>

<P>
   BARRY WHITE/``STAYING POWER'' (Private Music) &QL; 
White's soundtracks for seduction are designed to ensure that every
date's a sure thing thanks to the Love Man's trademark growl and
bedroom manner. Not this time. Problem is, White doesn't have such
a sure ear for material anymore, and he certainly doesn't have the
silky funk-tinged arrangements. The overlong romps on ``Staying
Power'' aren't as cleverly conceived as those great '70s records
with the 40-piece Love Unlimited Orchestra (``Can't Get Enough of
Your Love, Babe'' and ``What Am I Gonna Do With You'').
</P>
<P>
   While the standout ``I Get Off on You'' comes close, filler such
as ``The Longer We Make Love'' (done here as a duet twice _ with
Chaka Khan and Lisa Stansfield) and tepid covers of War's ``Low
Rider'' and Sly Stone's ``Thank You for Talkin' to Me, Africa,''
are a long way from satisfying. In the end, ``Staying Power''
doesn't have much. 2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANTON SCHWARTZ/``WHEN MUSIC CALLS'' (AntonJazz)!off!
</P>
<P>
   What's more impressive: the studiously precise yet relaxed
playing of this young Bay Area tenor saxophonist? Or the graceful
retro-classic feel of his compositions and arrangements? This debut
disc consists of eight new songs by Schwartz (as well as numbers by
Sonny Rollins and Rodgers and Hart) that evince a formidable grasp
of everything from easygoing cocktail swing (``Poketown'') and
sinuously seductive Brazilian-tinged jazz (``Denouement'') to the
gently frothing, congo-laden Afro-Cuban ``Tidepool.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz has learned his lessons well from straight-ahead
players like John Coltrane, Stanley Turrentine and Joshua Redman,
but there's no tint of academic formalism here. Like piano man Paul
Nagel, Schwartz communicates notes and ideas with thoughtful,
unflappable insistence.
</P>
<P>
   The supple rhythm section of John Shifflett (bass) and Jason
Lewis (drums) fits the quartet like a comfortable pair of loafers,
while Josh Jones' conga playing weaves intricate, unobtrusive
textures. More, please. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Reed Johnson! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VARIOUS/``CHICAGO: THE BLUES TODAY!'' (Vanguard)!off!
</P>
<P>
   One of the all-time greatest blues series ever, ``Chicago: The
Blues Today!'' was first issued in 1966 as three individual volumes
featuring fiery work from South Side greats Junior Wells, James
Cotton, Otis Spann and more. What made the anthology so startling
three decades ago was the ``today'' part of the title. Back then,
blues wasn't as well understood or appreciated outside the inner
city, and these albums not only helped open the door for wider
exposure, but clearly illustrated that the music was thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Now available in an excellently annotated and produced
three-disc package, ``Chicago: The Blues Today!'' is still among
the best introductions to the swaggering, honking blues of the
Windy City. All tracks are superlative, especially tough little
gems from guitar great Otis Rush, whose ``I Can't Quit You, Baby''
was lifted note-for-note by Led Zeppelin for their million-selling
debut. Other artists, including Wells, harp master Big Walter
Horton and always-inventive pianist Spann (an unsung hero of the
genre) play some of the best music of their careers here. A
wonderful release. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE SIX/``LES DOUBLE SIX'' (RCA Victor)!off!
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's a short list, but there may not have ever been a
better vocal ensemble than the 1960s French vocalese group the
Double Six. (And, yes, we are familiar with Lambert, Hendricks &AMP;
Ross.) This splendid reissue compiles 20 of the group's
interpretations of jazz instrumental classics, complete with leader
Mimi Perrin's witty French lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble _ composed of two sopranos, a contralto, a tenor, a
baritone and a bass _ takes big band sounds and makes them into a
thing of lyrical beauty. The six voices are often doubletracked
(hence the group's name); the rare exception comes on Perrin's
beautiful solo interpretation of John Coltrane's haunting
``Naima.'' C'est magnifique. 4 stars &QL;

No. 1 New York Times best seller ``Bill and Hillary: The
Marriage,'' by Christopher Anderson _ is available for oneshot
purchase from The New York Times Syndicate. For purchase
information, contact sales executive Debra Weydert by phone, (732)

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was an adulterer and a liar, they were saying. And worse: a
fool. In the face of rumors that he had been unfaithful to his
wife, the charismatic young Democratic front-runner with the
Kennedy smile angrily denied the gossip, and to prove he was
innocent dared the press to shadow his every move.
 &HT;    The Miami Herald did just that, and in a matter of days reported
that a young woman other than the candidate's wife had spent the
weekend at his home. Confronted with photographs of himself and a
young blonde named Donna Rice cavorting aboard the aptly named
yacht Monkey Business, Gary Hart announced on May 7, 1987, that he
was withdrawing from the race for the presidency.
 &HT;    It was no small irony that with Hart out of the picture, more
pressure was put on Bill Clinton to run _ despite the fact that, in
the words of one Clinton advisor, ``Bill made Hart look like Billy
Graham.''
 &HT;    To further compound the irony, Hillary, backed by Dick Morris,
was pushing hardest for Bill to fulfill his dream and run for the
presidency. Hillary had been clearly energized by the prospect of
Bill's becoming the youngest president in history _ younger even
than his idol JFK.
 &HT;    Only 10 days after Hart's withdrawal, Bill sought advice from
another source: his childhood friend and lover Dolly Kyle Browning.
 &HT;    During yet another tryst, this time at the Hyatt Hotel at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Dolly broached the subject of her own
sexual addiction _ and Bill's _ for the first time.
 &HT;    ``At first Billy denied it,'' she recalled. ``He just didn't see
how a person could be `addicted' to sex. But then when I asked why
he felt compelled to have sex, if sometimes he wanted to get away
from his partner right after having sex, if his extramarital sex
was affecting his sex life with `The Warden,' if sex was in any way
jeopardizing his career _ then he understood.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, it was that last question concerning the
impact on his career that Bill found most intriguing. When he told
Dolly that he was being pressured to run for president, she
cautioned him that a run against Republican Vice-President George
Bush could be ``suicide.'' She added, ``There's entirely too much
trash in your recent past.''
 &HT;    ``Like what?'' he answered without hesitating.
 &HT;    ``Bill, please,'' she said. ``Be serious. Look where you are
right now ... Get real.''
 &HT;    According to Dick Morris, the political demise of Gary Hart had
filled Bill with ``a tremendous terror.'' That spring and early
summer, Clinton contacted a number of friends and political
contacts throughout the country and casually brought up sex as a
campaign issue. What was the American public willing to tolerate?
Was adultery, if proven, an insurmountable obstacle to getting
elected?
 &HT;    At one point, he even grilled Arkansas Gazette editor John
Robert Starr _ the man who popularized the term ``Slick Willie'' _
on the ``Gary Hart Factor.''
 &HT;    ``Well, you haven't done anything like that, have you?'' Starr
asked Bill.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have.''
 &HT;    Starr was stunned. ``You mean,'' he said, ``since you've been
married to Hillary?''
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' Bill replied. ``Do you want to know about it?''
 &HT;    ``It,'' Starr thought. ``Do you want to know about it? And I,''
he recalled, ``to my eternal regret, said no.''
 &HT;    Betsey Wright wasn't hopeful about Bill's chances for surviving
a presidential run in 1988. She conducted an investigation of her
own, ferreting out the names of the women Bill was alleged to have
been involved with.
 &HT;    Once she had assembled a dossier on Bill's rumored affairs,
Wright sat him down in her living room. Before they went over each
name, she begged him to tell her the whole truth _ ``I've got to
know the truth, Bill'' _ about his relationship with each woman.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen women on the list, including
Gennifer Flowers, Dolly Kyle Browning, Juanita Broaddrick, Susan
McDougal, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Deborah Mathis and former
Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen. He did not tell Wright about
the countless one-night stands or the hookers.
 &HT;    They then ran down the list a second time, to determine which of
the women he had had affairs with might talk to the press.
 &HT;    When it was over, Wright concluded that he should not run _ if
for no other reason than to spare his wife and daughter.
 &HT;    Convincing Bill was one thing. But when Hillary discovered
Betsey Wright had talked her husband out of running that year, she
accused the governor's chief of staff of overstepping her bounds.
Hillary pressed her for details, but Wright would only say that
Bill had in fact been ``seeing'' other women _ lots of other women.
 &HT;    ``Hillary,'' she said, ``he admitted it.''
 &HT;    But what Wright did not know was that five years earlier Hillary
had hired private investigator Ivan Duda to trail her husband. Back
then, on the eve of Bill's 1982 comeback election as governor, Duda
had come up with a list of eight women he had been sneaking away to
meet at all hours of the day and night. Of the eight, she accepted
the fact that Bill was probably sleeping with Dolly Kyle Browning
and Gennifer Flowers.
 &HT;    Wright could not have anticipated Hillary's response. Rather
than expressing anger at her husband, she looked at Wright and
asked, ``Who is going to find out? These women are all trash.
Nobody is going to believe them.''
 &HT;    But Wright stood her ground, insisting that the risk was too
great in the wake of the Gary Hart Monkey Business scandal.
 &HT;    ``Now is not the time,'' Wright said. ``The climate is all
wrong. Bush is too strong. Bill has got to wait until next time
...''
 &HT;    On July 15, the ballroom at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel was
filled with reporters, camera crews, and political supporters
waiting to hear Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton announce his
candidacy for president.
 &HT;    Instead Bill walked to the podium and, with Hillary at his side
fighting back tears, dropped a bombshell.
 &HT;    ``I need some family time, I need some personal time,'' he
explained. ``Politicians are people too. I think sometimes we
forget it, but they really are. The only thing I or any other
candidate has to offer in running for president is what's inside.
That's what sets people on fire and gets their confidence and their
votes, whether they live in Wisconsin or Montana or New York. That
part of my life needs renewal.
 &HT;    ``The other, even more important reason for my decision is the
certain impact that this campaign would have had on our daughter
... I've seen a lot of kids grow up under these pressures and a
long, long time ago I made a promise to myself that if I was ever
lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was an adulterer and a liar, they were saying. And worse: a
fool. In the face of rumors that he had been unfaithful to his
wife, the charismatic young Democratic front-runner with the
Kennedy smile angrily denied the gossip, and to prove he was
innocent dared the press to shadow his every move.
 &HT;    The Miami Herald did just that, and in a matter of days reported
that a young woman other than the candidate's wife had spent the
weekend at his home. Confronted with photographs of himself and a
young blonde named Donna Rice cavorting aboard the aptly named
yacht Monkey Business, Gary Hart announced on May 7, 1987, that he
was withdrawing from the race for the presidency.
 &HT;    It was no small irony that with Hart out of the picture, more
pressure was put on Bill Clinton to run _ despite the fact that, in
the words of one Clinton advisor, ``Bill made Hart look like Billy
Graham.''
 &HT;    To further compound the irony, Hillary, backed by Dick Morris,
was pushing hardest for Bill to fulfill his dream and run for the
presidency. Hillary had been clearly energized by the prospect of
Bill's becoming the youngest president in history _ younger even
than his idol JFK.
 &HT;    Only 10 days after Hart's withdrawal, Bill sought advice from
another source: his childhood friend and lover Dolly Kyle Browning.
 &HT;    During yet another tryst, this time at the Hyatt Hotel at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Dolly broached the subject of her own
sexual addiction _ and Bill's _ for the first time.
 &HT;    ``At first Billy denied it,'' she recalled. ``He just didn't see

CHELSEA'S ROCKY ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE; BILL'S CONFESSION  
 &HT;

No. 1 New York Times best seller ``Bill and Hillary: The
Marriage,'' by Christopher Anderson _ is available for oneshot
purchase from The New York Times Syndicate. For purchase
information, contact sales executive Debra Weydert by phone, (732)

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was an adulterer and a liar, they were saying. And worse: a
fool. In the face of rumors that he had been unfaithful to his
wife, the charismatic young Democratic front-runner with the
Kennedy smile angrily denied the gossip, and to prove he was
innocent dared the press to shadow his every move.
 &HT;    The Miami Herald did just that, and in a matter of days reported
that a young woman other than the candidate's wife had spent the
weekend at his home. Confronted with photographs of himself and a
young blonde named Donna Rice cavorting aboard the aptly named
yacht Monkey Business, Gary Hart announced on May 7, 1987, that he
was withdrawing from the race for the presidency.
 &HT;    It was no small irony that with Hart out of the picture, more
pressure was put on Bill Clinton to run _ despite the fact that, in
the words of one Clinton advisor, ``Bill made Hart look like Billy
Graham.''
 &HT;    To further compound the irony, Hillary, backed by Dick Morris,
was pushing hardest for Bill to fulfill his dream and run for the
presidency. Hillary had been clearly energized by the prospect of
Bill's becoming the youngest president in history _ younger even
than his idol JFK.
 &HT;    Only 10 days after Hart's withdrawal, Bill sought advice from
another source: his childhood friend and lover Dolly Kyle Browning.
 &HT;    During yet another tryst, this time at the Hyatt Hotel at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Dolly broached the subject of her own
sexual addiction _ and Bill's _ for the first time.
 &HT;    ``At first Billy denied it,'' she recalled. ``He just didn't see
how a person could be `addicted' to sex. But then when I asked why
he felt compelled to have sex, if sometimes he wanted to get away
from his partner right after having sex, if his extramarital sex
was affecting his sex life with `The Warden,' if sex was in any way
jeopardizing his career _ then he understood.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, it was that last question concerning the
impact on his career that Bill found most intriguing. When he told
Dolly that he was being pressured to run for president, she
cautioned him that a run against Republican Vice-President George
Bush could be ``suicide.'' She added, ``There's entirely too much
trash in your recent past.''
 &HT;    ``Like what?'' he answered without hesitating.
 &HT;    ``Bill, please,'' she said. ``Be serious. Look where you are
right now ... Get real.''
 &HT;    According to Dick Morris, the political demise of Gary Hart had
filled Bill with ``a tremendous terror.'' That spring and early
summer, Clinton contacted a number of friends and political
contacts throughout the country and casually brought up sex as a
campaign issue. What was the American public willing to tolerate?
Was adultery, if proven, an insurmountable obstacle to getting
elected?
 &HT;    At one point, he even grilled Arkansas Gazette editor John
Robert Starr _ the man who popularized the term ``Slick Willie'' _
on the ``Gary Hart Factor.''
 &HT;    ``Well, you haven't done anything like that, have you?'' Starr
asked Bill.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have.''
 &HT;    Starr was stunned. ``You mean,'' he said, ``since you've been
married to Hillary?''
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' Bill replied. ``Do you want to know about it?''
 &HT;    ``It,'' Starr thought. ``Do you want to know about it? And I,''
he recalled, ``to my eternal regret, said no.''
 &HT;    Betsey Wright wasn't hopeful about Bill's chances for surviving
a presidential run in 1988. She conducted an investigation of her
own, ferreting out the names of the women Bill was alleged to have
been involved with.
 &HT;    Once she had assembled a dossier on Bill's rumored affairs,
Wright sat him down in her living room. Before they went over each
name, she begged him to tell her the whole truth _ ``I've got to
know the truth, Bill'' _ about his relationship with each woman.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen women on the list, including
Gennifer Flowers, Dolly Kyle Browning, Juanita Broaddrick, Susan
McDougal, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Deborah Mathis and former
Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen. He did not tell Wright about
the countless one-night stands or the hookers.
 &HT;    They then ran down the list a second time, to determine which of
the women he had had affairs with might talk to the press.
 &HT;    When it was over, Wright concluded that he should not run _ if
for no other reason than to spare his wife and daughter.
 &HT;    Convincing Bill was one thing. But when Hillary discovered
Betsey Wright had talked her husband out of running that year, she
accused the governor's chief of staff of overstepping her bounds.
Hillary pressed her for details, but Wright would only say that
Bill had in fact been ``seeing'' other women _ lots of other women.
 &HT;    ``Hillary,'' she said, ``he admitted it.''
 &HT;    But what Wright did not know was that five years earlier Hillary
had hired private investigator Ivan Duda to trail her husband. Back
then, on the eve of Bill's 1982 comeback election as governor, Duda
had come up with a list of eight women he had been sneaking away to
meet at all hours of the day and night. Of the eight, she accepted
the fact that Bill was probably sleeping with Dolly Kyle Browning
and Gennifer Flowers.
 &HT;    Wright could not have anticipated Hillary's response. Rather
than expressing anger at her husband, she looked at Wright and
asked, ``Who is going to find out? These women are all trash.
Nobody is going to believe them.''
 &HT;    But Wright stood her ground, insisting that the risk was too
great in the wake of the Gary Hart Monkey Business scandal.
 &HT;    ``Now is not the time,'' Wright said. ``The climate is all
wrong. Bush is too strong. Bill has got to wait until next time
...''
 &HT;    On July 15, the ballroom at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel was
filled with reporters, camera crews, and political supporters
waiting to hear Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton announce his
candidacy for president.
 &HT;    Instead Bill walked to the podium and, with Hillary at his side
fighting back tears, dropped a bombshell.
 &HT;    ``I need some family time, I need some personal time,'' he
explained. ``Politicians are people too. I think sometimes we
forget it, but they really are. The only thing I or any other
candidate has to offer in running for president is what's inside.
That's what sets people on fire and gets their confidence and their
votes, whether they live in Wisconsin or Montana or New York. That
part of my life needs renewal.
 &HT;    ``The other, even more important reason for my decision is the
certain impact that this campaign would have had on our daughter
... I've seen a lot of kids grow up under these pressures and a
long, long time ago I made a promise to myself that if I was ever
lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

`BLAIR WITCH' A FITTING BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MASTER OF SUSPENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's fitting that the biggest hit of 1999, the year that happens
to be the centenary of Alfred Hitchcock's birth, is ``The Blair
Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock would've loved it. Not just because ``Blair Witch'' is
such a smash _ although Hitch is said to have told the young Steven
Spielberg that he admired ``Jaws'' so much because it sent the
price of Hitchcock's MCA stock spiraling. (MCA was the parent
company of Universal, the company that made and released ``Jaws.)''
Hitchcock also loved delivering a noisy shock to the nervous
systems of complacent moviegoers. As he once said, ``I am out to
give the public good, healthy mental shake-ups. Civilization has
become so screening and sheltering that we cannot experience
sufficient thrills at first hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the first suspense movie to catch the public's attention
in the way that ``Blair Witch'' has was 1960's ``Psycho,'' the film
for which Hitchcock is still best known. ``Psycho'' did for showers
what ``The Blair Witch Project'' has done for long walks in the
woods. (And what ``Jaws'' once did for leisurely dips in the
ocean.) That is, it hijacked our perspective on a part of our lives
that was routine to the point of being totally mundane, and it
forever lent a chill to it. This is something Hitchcock achieved on
a regular basis, more so than any other filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   This re-examination of the everyday is more than likely an
aspect you can find in your favorite Hitchcock films. In
``Strangers on a Train,'' a cigarette lighter that links someone to
a murder becomes the object of desire during a terrifically
competitive tennis match, an element that turns the tension up a
notch. In ``Vertigo,'' the most perverse movie about obsessive love
ever made by a major director, the ringing of the bell in a tower
is transformed into a motif that means doom (there's also the
fetishistic component of fear of heights).
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's masterful exploitation of James Stewart is an
example of how he could seize an object (i.e., Stewart) that
audiences thought they'd locked in their feelings about, and
forever change those feelings. In ``Vertigo,'' this lanky,
desensualized American icon is turned into a fearful and almost
demented man _ his long fingers outstretched and grasping for a
love he'll never really have. In ``Rear Window,'' he takes the
audience's affection for Stewart and constructs a vicious game of
cat-and-mouse around it by sticking Stewart in a wheelchair and
making him immobile and helpless, a victim. He used this technique
often. In ``The Birds,'' a gathering of his avian stars is a
spectacle tinged with menace. In ``North by Northwest,'' the thing
that's so much a part of your consciousness that you never give it
a second thought is Mount Rushmore. Who but Hitchcock would've
brought fear into a tableau that involves stories-high sculptures
depicting benignly gazing avatars of liberty?
</P>
<P>
   The best directors have an instinctive understanding of the
psychology of film. Time and again, when you watch their work, the
question you find yourself muttering afterward is, ``How did they
even think of that kind of scene?'' (Generally, during the movie,
you're so involved, the question never occurs to you.) Hitchcock
was the most successful director to consistently have such an
effect on audiences. The string of movies he put together during
the 1950s alone _ ``Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Dial M for
Murder, Vertigo, North by Northwest'' _ attained a commercial and
artistic prominence that no other director could match. Mentioning
merely these films neglects an important portion of his career,
which included ``Notorious, The 39 Steps, Rebecca, Suspicion, The
Lady Vanishes'' and ``Foreign Correspondent'' before the '50s, and
``Psycho'' and ``The Birds'' after.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a cheerful delight in scaring audiences and making
that expectation part of the marketing of his work. Hitchcock also
made himself a part of the marketing and loved the selling of his
movies, so he would've found the witty merchandising of ``Witch''
particularly delicious. By the 1960s, with his TV show and mystery
magazine, he made himself a brand name. Like most brand names, he'd
also petrified into an institution, subjecting audiences, and
himself, to a creative drought that included ``Marnie'' and ``Torn
Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``Hitchcock's Notebooks,'' author Dan Auiler writes
about Hitchcock's frustrations over ``Torn Curtain'': the
director's waiting out (Paul) Newman's detailed (script) notes and
lengthy time the actor required to get into character,'' and the
betrayal by Hitchcock's longtime collaborator Bernard Herrmann.
Hitchcock wanted from Herrmann something besides the heavy-handed
rumbling he was seemingly locked into. According to Auiler,
``Herrmann allegedly promised a more youth-oriented score,
something modern and jazzy. Hitchcock arrived for the film's
scoring to hear a score that was ... dark, heavy and bombastic _ in
short, the complete opposite of what Universal and Hitchcock had
hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitchcock's Notebooks'' offers inspiration. Aulier writes that
during this '60s period when the director was at a low point,
Hitchcock recognized that he needed to vivify himself. So the
Master of Suspense planned to make a movie that was to be called
``Kaleidoscope,'' using handheld cameras and unknown actors on the
streets of New York, a gambit that would have placed him ahead of
the ``Zeitgeist'' filmmaking of ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde'' and other
groundbreaking work. But the studio refused to give him permission
to make ``Kaleidoscope,'' forcing him into the big-budget corpse
``Topaz.'' (Some of the ``Kaleidoscope'' material was used in
1972's ``Frenzy.)'' By the end of his career, Hitchcock realized
that new blood was, literally, to be found in the kind of
filmmaking used by the creators of ``The Blair Witch Project.''
He's much closer to their impish cleverness than we might have
thought _ and, conversely, they're not nearly as original as many
might have us believe. After all, Hitchcock wanted to make
``Kaleidoscope'' before they were born.

 &HT;    Black Mountain offer `Front porch' welcome in N.C.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACK MOUNTAIN, N.C. _ Cradled in the craggy ridges of Western
North Carolina, this easygoing mountain town _ whose apt symbol is
a rocking chair _ is like a lullaby. Make that lullabuy.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, it seems, everybody who comes here goes
shopping. Oh, there's plenty else to do: hiking nearby mountain
trails, relaxing at Lake Tomahawk, chowing down at one of the
town's many restaurants, sipping a brew and listening to music at
the Black Mountain Music Hall or the Town Pump Tavern, watching the
world go by with a cup of joe in hand at Mountain Java.
</P>
<P>
   But _ trust me _ you'll eventually give in to the urge to check
out the goods.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sultry Friday afternoon, folks shuffled in and out
of the blessed air-conditioned comfort of the 50-plus galleries and
shops that line the compact downtown. Many were in this community
they call ``the front porch of North Carolina'' to pick up kids
from the dozens of summer camps in the area.
</P>
<P>
   One such visitor was Celinda Evitt of Tampa, who had come to
pick up her 14-year-old son from Camp Rockmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some extensive window shopping last night and made my
list,'' she said, as she paid for a pair of blue glass earrings at
the Catawba Sunrise Gallery on West State Street. ``It's not enough
for someone like me to just come here and hike. I like to shop. I'm
so relieved to find there are still lovely little areas in North
Carolina. This is such a friendly place.''
</P>
<P>
   That welcoming spirit permeates the shopping experience, as most
of the business owners are on hand to assist customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all try to have things that aren't anywhere else,'' said
Rita Vermillion, whose eclectic Catawba Sunrise Gallery carries
fine crafts, including blown glass, porcelain, kaleidoscopes,
handmade jewelry, hand-painted silk scarves and paintings. She says
members of the local merchant's association, Black Mountain
Business to Business, make an effort not to duplicate each other's
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Some galleries _ such as Catawba Sunrise, Seven Sisters, Cherry
Street and the Emporium _ represent a variety of artists and
craftspeople, most of whom live and work in the region. (Seven
Sisters alone represents more than 350 artists.)
</P>
<P>
   Others are artist-owned, and in some cases artists ply their
trades in on-site studios. You're likely to meet them _ or at least
a relative:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garrou Pottery is run by Becky Garrou and features stoneware
by her husband, John, who's been making pottery for three decades,
and son Derrick, who took up the craft full time four years ago.
Ask Becky to show you the Oogles, lucky little people _ and take
one home for a buck.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another father-son operation, Black Mountain Gallery, offers
hand-turned wood bowls and vessels by the Hollifields, Marshall and
his son Eddie. Their latest effort: to make the world's largest
turned bowl (9 feet in diameter) from a local tree. Their studio is
adjacent to the showroom. Look for the piles of wood outside.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Black Mountain Iron Works is owned by the husband-wife team of
Dan Howachyn and Tekla. The showroom is packed with hand-wrought
black iron treasures, including functional ceiling-hung pot
holders, wine racks and candleholders as well as sculptures that
are simply decorative. And you may catch them in their open studio.
On a recent afternoon, Tekla was working on a steel sculpture of
three stylish women on a shopping spree _ a commission for the city
of Asheville's Urban Art Trail.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At The Potter's Wheel you can check out the handmade pottery
and stoneware by resident potters Andrew Stephenson and Jennifer
Vega, and if you want to try throwing a pot yourself, you can give
it a whirl for $5.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Song of the Wood sells handsome hammered dulcimers and bowed
psalteries crafted by James Read Smith, who has been crafting the
stringed instruments since he was a student at nearby Warren Wilson
College in Swannanoa. Although Smith's studio is no longer on site,
his staff can show off his finely crafted musical instruments and
even play a tune or two. And you can take home Smith's original
recordings on CD or cassette.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visions of Creation Gallery features showy one-of-a-kind
pieces of gold jewelry set with semi-precious stones. It's worth a
visit not only to watch Colombian designer/sculptor Robert
Vengoechea at work but to gaze at his handiwork through glass
shadowboxes built into the walls.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New Century Metalsmiths, tucked in the storefront of Mountain
Valley Family Clothing, is where you'll find Dennis Curtis at work.
Among his designs is a charm that depicts twin peaks in the
surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   One could easily spend a day or more wandering through downtown
Black Mountain. There's so much to take in: We found cubbies filled
with colorful yarn at the Naked Sheep, bags of ``happy rocks'' at
Brandon's, musical kaleidoscopes at McCosh's, colorful polymer clay
jewelry at Catawba Sunrise Gallery, individual pottery applebakers
at Garrou pottery and prints of Ann Vasilik's watercolor painting
of Black Mountain at the Gingko Tree Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   You could browse for hours at Town Hardware and General Store
with its shelves of old-time (and newfangled) toys; old-fashioned
soaps, salves and remedies; rabbits' feet; little red wagons; scrub
boards, rug beaters; oil lamps; and the usual array of tools.
</P>
<P>
   If you've shopped till you're ready to drop _ and are inspired
to do a little dabbling _ stop by ``Goodness Glazes Alive!'' behind
Mountain Java to paint a plate or pitcher. On Friday nights from 6
to 10, you can ``Paint Till You Faint'' for $8 plus the cost of the
greenware you select. Bring in pizza and CDs, and make it a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide a fun thing for the kids to do while mom and dad go
shopping,'' said manager Casey Phillips. ``And when they see how
much fun the kids have, they come back the next day to try it
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take I-85 north to Greenville, S.C., then follow U.S. 25 north
to I-26 and north to I-40. Then, take I-40 east to Exit 64 and
follow N.C. 9 north for about a mile into downtown Black Mountain.
About a four-hour drive.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Red Rocker Inn: Yes, there really is a red rocker at this
inn. Actually, there are several, along with swings and gliders.
This 17-room inn run by the Lindberg family _ Margie and Carl and
sons Derrick and Brian _ is known not only for its country-cozy
comforts but for its family-style dining. Folks gather for
home-cooking by Derrick Lindberg and sinful desserts by his wife,
Elizabeth. On a recent evening, entree choices included pork
tenderloin, pot roast, chicken with asparagus and hollandaise and
fried trout _ along with cream of broccoli soup, green salad with
fresh strawberries, almonds and poppyseed dressing and sides of
potatoes au gratin, baby carrots and green beans with almonds.
Before dinner Derrick welcomed us all, described the evening's
repast and said a blessing. The feast is $16.95 (dessert extra), by
reservation only. Rooms are $85-$145. 136 N. Dougherty St.
1-888-669-5991 or www.redrockerinn.com.
</P>

Orleans-themed French Quarter Restaurant (porch and patio dining as
well as indoors, 203 E. State St., 828-669-1989). We also grabbed

WHY SING THAT TIRED, OLD SONG?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish I were not obliged to comment again on the land of
cotton.
</P>
<P>
   It's time that old debates about it should be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Time to put away, put away all the flap about that song of
Dixieland.
</P>
<P>
   But how can we, when people of such prominence and power as the
Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court go to conferences of judges
and lawyers and lead singalongs of the peppy, nostalgic tune
celebrating the good old days in the land of honeysuckle and human
bondage?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his honor Chief Justice William Rehnquist did that at the
conference of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Hot Springs,
Va. I don't know if he consulted with Associate Justice Clarence
Thomas before he did it or not. I suspect that he didn't need to,
because he probably felt he knew how Thomas would stand on that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is more likely that Rehnquist never gave the
matter a moment's reflection. He attends that conference every
year. And they always sing ``Dixie'' there. Those lawyers who don't
like it stopped going. It's their prerogative to avoid the event,
just it is Rehnquist's to raise his voice and count the beat while
vowing ``... in Dixieland, I'll take my stand to live and die for
Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it never occurred to the chief justice that anyone might
take offense at the song. After all, there were very few
African-American delegates to the conference. And because they are
lawyers, he would expect that handful of lawyers to be
sophisticated enough to put the song in proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But tht is not as easily done as said for most
African-Americans, regardless of their level of education and
sophistication. Many African-American professionals who have
attended gatherings of social and philanthropic clubs where
``Dixie'' is sung can tell you that the song seems endless while he
or she struggles with what to do _ sing along and sound stupid, lip
sync the lyrics and look stupid, or just stand tight-lipped and
rigid and feel stupid.
</P>
<P>
   That predicament is made worse by the fact that, on a
superficial level, ``Dixie'' is a very arresting song, whether sung
in an upbeat and rousing manner or plaintively as in the movie
``Lords of Discipline''. It evokes feelings and images of a golden
time of plenitude and tranquility, of southern pride, hospitality
and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many African-Americans would be tempted to sing along if they
did not know the dark side of those ``hooray, hooray'' lyrics _ the
undergirding of brutal exploitation and unspeakable degradation and
cruelty to which their ancestors were subjected to support that way
of life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chief Justice Rehnquist knows that history. But he
may believe that the country has progressed so far along the road
of racial equality and reconciliation that everyone should be able
to accept ``Dixie'' as nothing more than a catchy musical
anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps... Still, it is difficult to believe the someone who has
advanced to the exalted rank of chief justice of the Supreme Court
could be so naive.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the National Bar Association, the 18,000-member black
lawyers association, informing Rehnquist that it doesn't cotton to
the ``Dixie'' part of his musical repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   At their recent conference in Philadelphia, the black lawyers
called upon the chief justice to ``refrain from such offensive
behavior in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Rehnquist has not responded to their plea.
Probably, in his view, it is beneath him to do so. He meant no
offense, and the matter is too trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the NBA got his attention with that two-by-four
between the eyebrows. And it's probably a safe bet that Rehnquist
won't be leading the ``Dixie'' sing-along next summer.
</P>
<P>
   It is well, though, that the NBA members didn't ask Rehnquist to
apologize for singing and conducting ``Dixie,'' because if they
demand that, the black lawyers will probably be whistling it.

   Pokemon Snap, Nintendo for Nintendo 64, $54.99, all ages
</P>
<P>
   Like we didn't see this coming. After a supersuccessful run on
Nintendo's GameBoy system, the kiddie cartoon invades the Nintendo
64 _ with some pretty darn cool results.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda echoing ``Out of Africa'' and Duran Duran's ``Hungry Like
the Wolf'' video, players go on a guided safari through seven
Pokemon island environments.
</P>
<P>
   The object: Photograph the animals that roam and run around the
island. You're doing this, apparently, to impress Professor Oak,
who will later critique your photos. The better the shot, the
higher your points.
</P>
<P>
   It gets a little tricky: Some animals refuse to be shot and
high-tail it away as if they've been messing around with Harrison
Ford and you're the paparazzi. In these cases, you must get them to
pose or perform special tasks to calm 'em down.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are much like the Mario 64 games: bright, colorful,
harmless and fun. Scoring the Pokemon name was a huge coup for
Nintendo, and the company could have spat out a lame action game
and still made a bundle. Fortunately, this is a different kind of
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we're just gonna do a whole column on Pokemon, so I won't
have to deal with it ever, ever again.
</P>
<P>
   The official site is Pokemon.com. It features cartoons, games,
comics, trading cards and instructions on how to do the Pokemon
rap. Don't laugh; it's kinda neat.
</P>
<P>
   The site also houses coveted info on the Pokemon League Summer
Training Tour, a Pokemon GameBoy competition. Check out the site
for more details.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? Plenty. Aside from the two GameBoy Pokemon titles
(Red and Blue versions, both $30) and the accompanying strategy
guide ($13), we've got the new Pokemon Pinball title for GameBoy
Color ($35), multicolored Pokemon Talking Watches (Trendmaster,
$25) and four new $15 Pokemon cartoon vids from Pioneer. All this
stuff is available at any area Babbage's, or through
www.thegamestop.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you have absolutely no idea what Pokemon is all
about, you can take a crash course in it at
http://destroyerx.cjb.net/. Here, you'll find relatively
easy-to-understand breakdowns and explanations of the cartoon and
games. Let us know when you figure the stuff out. We're still
scratching our heads.

 &HT;    `Mickey' a film Grant couldn't refuse
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hugh Grant traipses through the lavish rooms of a
Midtown hotel's presidential suite, looking most unpresidential.
The floppy-haired star of ``Notting Hill'' and now ``Mickey Blue
Eyes'' walks in wearing a blue T-shirt and off-white jeans. He
settles onto a yawning sofa and marks the soft-jazz Muzak oozing
out of an entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think housekeeping does that?'' he asks rhetorically.
``When you walk into your hotel, they think it's nice to have the
worst radio channel playing softly.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a typical Grant comment: observant, humorous, subtly laced
with acid. While he's perfected his onscreen persona as a genteel,
bumbling target for public humiliation, in person he has the
watchful quality of someone very much in control. While his pearly
whites smile, those famous pale blue eyes size you up, assessing
the tone of the room.
</P>
<P>
   It's this sang-froid that steered him through that 1995 Divine
Brown sex incident. Remember, on ``The Tonight Show,'' when he
delivered a public apology reeking with his patented boyish charm?
He expertly manipulated his reel-world image to exonerate himself
from a real-life oops.
</P>
<P>
   It's that sort of self-image awareness that goes into his work
with Simian Films, the production company he and multi-hyphenated
girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley (model-actress-producer) run. ``Mickey
Blue Eyes,'' which opened Friday, is their second film together,
after the medical thriller ``Extreme Measures,'' which, as Grant
admits, ``absolutely no one went to see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey'' is a comedy about a British auctioneer who belatedly
discovers that his fiancee's family is in the mob. James Caan plays
his prospective father-in-law. ``He was quite a mythical figure for
me, because I worshipped `The Godfather,''' Grant says. ``We sent
him the script, and being a man of extraordinary good taste, he
immediately accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took more than a star of the famous Francis Ford
Coppola flick to give ``Mickey'' its authentic, mean-streets
flavor. First of all, it was shot in Manhattan, a rare event when
most movies save costs by filming in lookalike cities such as
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the extras always look like Canadians,'' Grant says.
``There's nothing wrong with Canadians, but when you're doing a mob
film, it's all about texture. We were obsessed with getting that
texture right. That's why we shot in New York and why we spent so
much time chatting up the mob.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant's ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' director Mike Newell had
made a few organized-crime connections while doing ``Donnie
Brasco.'' He hooked Grant up with one Rocco the Butcher, who
introduced the star and his producer girlfriend to ``a lot of
interesting people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they loved the script, and I think they quite liked
me,'' he says. ``But they worshipped Elizabeth. She was a real ace
in the hole. She was very good at sitting on their knees and
flirting with them and comparing jewelry.'' (Hurley and the tough
guys she chatted with tended to wear about the same number of
accessories, Grant says.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides correcting any mob-related mistakes in the script, the
guys pulled strings to make the shoot easy. ``Anywhere we wanted to
shoot, we could shoot,'' Grant says, still with a trace of awe.
``We had no Teamster problems whatsoever. You can't often say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were afraid of producer Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very forceful and enthusiastic and opinionated,'' he
says, maintaining a perfectly straight face as he launches into one
of his bits of dry humor. ``Plus she has the ability to inspire
fear. Everyone's scared of her, I think because there's always that
latent threat of physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's possibly why the mob respected her so much, because
they're sort of in the same business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' was filmed back-to-back with ``Notting
Hill,'' making for ``the most exhausting year of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for working with ``Hill'' co-star Julia Roberts, he says:
``You don't know what to expect, because you read all this (trash)
about her in the papers. She is surprisingly nice and sort of
silly, really. She doesn't take herself very seriously, and she's
not one of those deep, dark methody kind of actors. She's very good
at just messing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and for the record, he swears he never once giggled while
Roberts delivered her ``I'm just a girl standing in front of a
guy'' speech. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, there was no giggling. It was very intense.''
</P>

`POISON' IS A BLEAK, SOBERING VISION OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who among us has not been waiting for the next great Public
Enemy CD?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Poison Goin' On ...,'' their first release for
Atomic Pop, is it _ an angry blast at the forces that Chuck D and
company see as dragging African-Americans down, a bracing return to
form and a statement of purpose that they are still a vital part of
the national hip-hop community.
</P>
<P>
   The title is, of course, a takeoff on Sly Stone's classic 1971
album, ``There's a Riot Going On,'' and in a way, so is the music.
Both ``Riot'' and ``Poison'' are inky, despairing records that
present a world where options slip away, where the skies darken and
the wind turns colder.
</P>
<P>
   Both records offer no easy answers, and that is their strength.
On their previous great CDs, 1990's ``Fear of a Black Planet''
(easily one of the decade's best) and '91's ``Apocalypse 91 ... The
Enemy Strikes Black,'' the group looked at harsh realities but also
brought a large measure of hope that a new day would dawn. There
was no doubting the positivity behind ``Brothers Gonna Work It
Out'' or the thrilling rap/metal fusion of ``Bring the Noise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poison,'' however, is bleak. It's a vision of African-American
communities _ and the hip-hop community _ perhaps going under from
both inside and outside forces. Chief among them are hip-hoppers
who have betrayed real messages for the money, record companies
that don't really care about the music, and so on. Hip-hop, they
say in ``Crayola,'' has become clogged with ``spray-on hits.''
</P>
<P>
   This CD has the potential for becoming repetitive, but it never
is, because of the band's attack, the fierce intelligence of the
lyrics and the great use of samples.
</P>
<P>
   The CD begins with ``Dark Side of the Wall: 2000,'' a smart
aural collage, and immediately takes off. The beats almost always
perfectly fit the attack, and the mix of old-school funk/R&AMP;B and
hip-hop is frequently hard and tough, and sometimes magnificent:
One of the CD's strongest songs is ``Here I Go,'' a statement of
purpose that fuses soul horns, funk and turntable scratches, over
which Chuck D spits out his anger at record-company payola.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few weak moments, but in general ``Poison'' is
exactly the sort of record PE needed to make to carve itself out a
niche in the here-today-gone-tomorrow world of hip-hop. By
rejecting the sort of repetitive, empty stuff that's so in vogue,
and coming back so hard and confident, they have set themselves up,
again, as standard-bearers. They sound ageless, instead of aged.
Their vision of the coming century as a battleground is as jolting
and sobering as it is believable.

TINA'S TALK LIVES UP TO ITS NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's tempting to be snide when reviewing the overly hyped first
issue of Talk, the hot new general-interest title headed by Tina
Brown, former editor of The New Yorker and Vanity Fair. And who are
we not to give in to temptation, at least for a few paragraphs?
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which debuted early last week, is at first glance
a slick reproduction of every other general-interest entertainment
mag, from Esquire to Entertainment Weekly to Rolling Stone:
pictures of celebs posing provocatively, interspersed with striking
advertisements featuring beautiful women posing waifishly. There
are ``trend'' stories to tell you what's hot and what's not _
there's even a list of unexplained cool things called ``The Hit
List.'' (An idea that may have seemed original when ``Spy'' did it
more than a decade ago, or even when ``Wired'' debuted its
``Wired/Tired'' list not long afterward.) For those looking for
Beltway credibility, it has a smattering of same-ol' same ol', New
Republic-style political journal stories, such as Tucker Carlson's
take on George W. (Carlson, in fact, is a longtime contributor to
polit-journal The Weekly Standard.) In keeping with Brown's Vanity
Fair/New Yorker m.o., there are also several crime-focused news
features (a recounting of the tourists who were killed by rebels in
Uganda) as well as Brown's penchant for stories with appeal across
the pond, such as Gerald Posner's take on Mohammed Al Fayed's claim
of a conspiratorial cover-up in the death of Princess Diana and his
son, Dodi.
</P>
<P>
   At first pass, then, the unoriginality of Talk makes you wonder
what all the hype is about. Even the style in which many of the
stories are written leaves the mag open to parody. Writers like to
say that a source ``told me'' or ``tells me on the phone,'' as if
we'd assume otherwise. And one would think a magazine called Talk
would concern itself with the mouth, if it decided to obsess on a
body part. But it seems the writers in the first issue concentrated
on the eyes instead. Witness:
</P>
<P>
   ``... his eyes are so blue and so fierce they seem wired into a
power source of their own.'' (Page 64)
</P>
<P>
   ``his eyes get beady'' and ``his eyes narrow'' (Page 106)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's eyes suddenly fill with tears.'' (Page 107)
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a small-boned woman ... with ... shiny eyes.'' (Page
114)
</P>
<P>
   ``Her eyes are bright ...'' (Page 118)
</P>
<P>
   ``... his eyes glistening with tears.'' (Page 130)
</P>
<P>
   ``... her blue-green eyes blaze with an intensity that recalls
punk rock and a mixture of adolescent fury and joy. In her films,
Angelina) Jolie's eyes can convey a longing sadness alongside the
anger. In life, they most often read bemused and unwavering.''
(Page 143)
</P>
<P>
   ``... she is soft-spoken, gracious, and sad around the eyes.''
(Page 152)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, regarding Hillary Clinton, a source says, ``Look at her
eyes. I think she has been deeply, deeply hurt.'' (Page 168)
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we didn't just give in to temptation, we indulged.
Snarkiness aside, Talk may have plenty of bugs to work out but, as
will all Tina Brown products, it succeeds in a magazine's primary
goal: It reads well. For the most part, the stories are timely and
compelling, written with insight, perspective and flair. Carlson's
take on Bush is sympathetic but exposes plenty of his flaws. Former
Texas Monthly writer Mimi Swartz _ full disclosure: This reporter
used to work for Swartz's husband _ gives us a clear-eyed look at
Lorna Wendt, the wife of a former CEO who has become a cult figure
to rich women seeking more money in divorce settlements. And Eddie
Dean, the young writer most often pointed to as an example of
Talk's willingness to find new voices, pens a graphic, gloriously
nuanced take on the trailer park called Paradise. This doesn't even
consider the buzz surrounding the interview with Hillary Clinton,
in which she says she forgives her husband his trespasses.
</P>
<P>
   All first-effort publications contain flaws, and Talk is no
different. (The largest to us, of course, is the absurd take on the
killing of the women of Juarez, written by Charles Bowden. He
dismisses the police's theory that the killings are ``the work of a
band of bus drivers working for an incarcerated killer.'' The
Star-Telegram this week ran a three-part series that detailed just
how likely this scenario is.) But as much as some media-watchers
want Tina Brown to fail _ journalism rule: A competitor's success
is never acknowledged _ the first issue of Talk is, forgive us,
worth talking about.

EVEN ONE DEGREE OF SEPARATION IS TOO MUCH FOR SOME PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 5-year-old daughter, Maddison, starts kindergarten next week.
I've recently taken up praying twice a day. These are not unrelated
developments.
</P>
<P>
   My fears are no longer assuaged by a nighttime theological
checkup. No more, ``Please forgive me, I'm a sinner, yada yada,
man, I'm sleepy, Lord, we'll talk more tomorrow.'' I need serious
bucking up. We're talking three-hour exploratory surgery on the
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Didn't you read the first paragraph? MY SWEET ANGEL OF
PURITY AND UNASSAILABLE, EXALTED, PROMETHEAN WONDERFULNESS _ we're
talking ``Daddy's little pumpkin,'' here _ is beginning school
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Some people _ like my wife and my friends and most of my
relatives and the occasional stranger to whom I scream ``She's too
YOUNG to go!'' _ think I'm overreacting. They say that 5-year-olds
have been attending kindergarten for many years. They tell me that
most of them survive this rite of passage. They tell me the things
I'm threatening to do to anyone who so much as bumps into my
daughter are quite illegal. They call me ``overprotective.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I remember how cruel kids can be, how frightening
school can be. My first day of first grade, the teacher wouldn't
let me ask to go to the bathroom, because she'd told us all to work
on our assignment quietly. So, as my grandmother later explained it
to school officials, ``He decided to tinkle right there in his
britches.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddison is smarter than I am, so her talking her way into the
bathroom isn't so much a concern. No, my greatest fears center on
two things:
</P>
<P>
   1) How mean kids can be.
</P>
<P>
   2) How much I'm going to lose standing within my circle of guy
friends by bawling like I'm in the last 10 minutes of ``The Blair
Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   I figure the first problem is easily handled by persuading the
school to let me read aloud, over the public-address system, a few
helpful tips/warnings concerning my daughter. These would include,
but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>
   Do not push my daughter, or I will track you down and push you
back.
</P>
<P>
   Do not make fun of my daughter's clothing, hairstyle or speech
patterns, or I will track down your parents at work and mock them,
and they will take away your PlayStation privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Do not take something that is hers and claim that it is yours _
in fact, don't touch her stuff, period, or I will show up at your
house and offer your parents $1,000 cash for all your favorite
toys, laughing maniacally the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   Be her friend, or I will spread rumors that you're still hooked
on preschool fare like ``Barney'' and ``Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice when she gets her hair cut. She likes that.
</P>
<P>
   As for how I'm going to get through Day 1 without crying like
Lucy after Ricky tells her she can't be in the show ... you've got
me. I cried when she ``graduated'' from day care. I wept like a kid
denied his Pokemon playing cards when we took pictures of her on
the balance beam during her Saturday-morning gymnastics class. Hey,
I wailed like a starving goat when I first saw her school supplies
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, what's wrong with you, silly?'' she asked me after
handing me the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, baby'' I said courageously before blurting out,
``but ... your first Elmer's glue!''
</P>
<P>
   She ran off yelling something to Mommy about how Daddy ``was
being rah-rah Scooby-Doo crazy,'' but that's beside the point. The
point is this: Do you think I should take a vacation this week and
stand in the hallway between her classes, or should I just pray she
never grows up? Which one seems less outer-limits nutbar?

LOUISE BROWN AND HER HISTORY-MAKING FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ How is Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby, doing
these days? _ E.L.P., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Brown turned 21 on July 25, a few weeks after her
younger sister and fellow test-tube baby, Natalie, gave birth to a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Brown's 1978 birth was the first resulting from in vitro
fertilization (IVF), a procedure credited with 300,000 births since
then.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns may have another history-maker in the family. Natalie
Brown's newborn daughter, Casey, was conceived naturally, and hers
may be the first such birth from an IVF mother.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Brown works at a day-care center in Bristol, England.
``I'm proud of being the first baby, but I don't know if I could go
through what Mum did. I hate hospitals,'' she told the ``Sunday
Telegraph.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ I'm a big fan of the actor who plays Elliot on ``Just
Shoot Me'' and used to play Gloria's husband on ``Hope &AMP; Gloria.''
Where can I write to him? _ J.S., Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to actor Enrico Colantoni or anyone else on the
series in care of ``Just Shoot Me,'' 4024 Radford Ave., Suite 280,
Studio City, CA 91604.
</P>
<P>
   Colantoni, a 36-year-old native of Toronto, graduated from the
Yale school of drama in 1993. A year later, he appeared on episodes
of ``Law &AMP; Order'' and ``NYPD Blue'' and joined the cast of ``Hope
&AMP; Gloria.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor has lost 50 pounds since auditioning for ``Just Shoot
Me,'' and in 1997 he married the Los Angeles nutritionist who
helped him change his diet. Nancy Snyder and Colantoni wed in
January 1997 and have a son, Quintin, who turned 2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Is Joel Murray on the sitcom ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' related
to Bill Murray? _ A.T.J., Bedford, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Joel is the youngest of nine siblings in a family that
includes three other performers: Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray
and former actor John Murray.
</P>
<P>

WHO'S TO BLAME FOR THE MOVIE-RATINGS MESS? WE ARE ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Valenti is a busy guy these days. In the past few weeks,
the president of the Motion Picture of Association of America has
appeared on the ``Today'' show and in the pages of ``Variety'' and
``Entertainment Weekly,'' debating the movie ratings system. If
``debate'' is an accurate word for what Valenti has been doing,
which hasn't always involved the most polite language _ his
favorite term for critics of the system is ``whiners.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why Valenti is sensitive about this.
After all, the ratings system _ the G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17s that
have been with us, with variations, since 1968 _ is his baby. And
at its inception, it was a good thing; as movies became more
naturalistic and ``mature,'' it allowed for more freedom of content
than older, more censorious systems. On the MPAA's Web site
(www.mpaa.org), Valenti explains that the system was never meant
for filmmakers or critics _ it was meant as a guideline to parents.
</P>
<P>
   But although Valenti has cited poll results saying that as many
as 76 percent of parents with children younger than 13 find the
ratings useful, his intractability in the latest battle over
ratings is a little disturbing. He acknowledges that the system is
fallible, but he appears stubborn in declining to acknowledge just
how flawed it has become, especially in this envelope-pushing
summer at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S GET ARBITRARY
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of two of this summer's movies, the little-seen
R-rated drama ``This Is My Father'' and the hit PG-13 comedy
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' shows just how arbitrary
the system can be. Aidan Quinn, the star and co-producer of Father,
says he was upset by the movie's rating, especially because the
film had gone over well with teen audiences. The MPAA's official
explanation for the R rating is ``for a scene of sexuality and
brief language''; Quinn says that the filmmakers were also told
that a hanging scene led to the R (the hanging is similar to a
scene in ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which received a G in 1973).
``Father'' is still a far gentler movie than the raucous Austin
Powers sequel, ``rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo and crude humor,''
although the latter might better be described as gross humor _ at
one point, a character drinks what he believes is coffee, except
that it's really the result of a bodily function.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings system has more flaws than arbitrariness, and the
MPAA isn't the only entity to blame for the chinks in its armor.
The most recent ratings firestorm centered on Stanley Kubrick's
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a movie in which an orgy scene was digitally
altered in order for the film to receive an R instead of an NC-17.
U.S. critics decried the alteration, but aimed their invective at
the ratings board. Perhaps they were too enamored of Kubrick, long
a filmmaker of integrity, to note that he compromised himself,
although to be fair he was contractually bound to deliver an R
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it made much difference _ the digital ``bodies''
obscuring sexual activity during the orgy scene only serve to make
an already silly-looking sequence look sillier. Even with the
alterations, the movie still should have been NC-17, as should the
recent ``Summer of Sam, American Pie'' and ``South Park.'' In each
of these cases, the filmmakers trimmed their movies, sometimes only
by a couple of snips, to get the R's because some multiplexes won't
show NC-17 movies and many newspapers (not including the
Star-Telegram) _ won't advertise them. But although the filmmakers
kvetch that they don't have a choice on ratings for
envelope-pushing films, they do _ if they're interested in artistic
integrity over commercialism, they can release their movies at
NC-17. An ``Entertainment Weekly'' reader was pretty much on the
mark when he complained that ``South Park's'' subtitle _ ``Bigger,
Longer &AMP; Uncut'' _ was hypocritical, because the filmmakers did cut
their movie to get an R.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS LOOK AWAY
</P>
<P>
   But then, there's hypocrisy on the part of the theaters and
newspapers that won't make a distinction between NC-17 films that
have some artistic merit _ a term that could loosely be applied to
all the films above _ and ones that are of purely prurient
interest. There's a big difference between ``Summer of Sam,'' a
messy but serious and ambitious movie with loads of sex and
violence, and a Shannon Tweed thriller on Cinemax After Dark, which
only has titillation in mind.
</P>
<P>
   When Valenti cites poll findings on parental satisfaction, he
doesn't mention whether the polls cover all parents, or only the
ones who use the ratings system. There's ample evidence that plenty
of parents don't bother with the system, from the parents who bring
preschoolers to movies as unnerving and/or violent as ``The Blair
Witch Project, The Haunting, South Park, Summer of Sam, Scream'' or
``Alien Resurrection'' _ all films at which colleagues or I have
spotted very young children _ to the middle-school classes I spoke
to in the spring, in which only one student out of about 100
lamented that his parents don't let him see R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   For responsible parents, though, it must be astonishing to find
out that the PG-13 ``Austin Powers'' includes a nude scene with a
truly disgusting character with a profane name or that semen _ once
taboo in all but hard-core pornographic films _ has a supporting
role in ``American Pie'' and ``There's Something About Mary.'' If
the ratings system told the parents all they needed to know, they
wouldn't have to rely on the ``content lines'' most newspapers
include with their reviews (including the Star-Telegram, which
tries to be as explicit as possible), or on features such as
``Screen Test,'' the Jane Horwitz column. The Internet also has a
plethora of family-guiding sites, the best of which is probably
Screen It! (www.screenit.com), which breaks down potentially
offensive elements in movies while still offering an informed
viewpoint about the films.
</P>
<P>
   The MPAA site also has a search function that allows you to type
in a movie's name to find out its rating and the association's
explanation for the rating. The site also includes Valenti's essay
about the system, a far better defense of it than the reactions
he's been giving lately on the air and in print. In theory, the
system works; in practice, like most things that work in theory,
it's hamstrung by human nature. Valenti needs to acknowledge more
of its flaws, but then filmmakers, critics, theater owners,
newspaper advertisers and even moviegoers need to acknowledge that
they're also to blame for the system's weaknesses.

PRAYERS FOR `CATFISH' HUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They are asking for prayers, if you have any to
spare. Prayers, and a miracle. Considering what Jim ``Catfish''
Hunter and his family face, that seems like so little to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is in critical condition in a North Carolina hospital,
attached to a ventilator. He had just seen off a visitor to his
farm in Hertford, N.C., Sunday when he tripped walking back into
his house. He cracked his head on the concrete steps, leaving
bruises on his brain, and that's not the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   The arms and hands don't work anymore, or Hunter might have
broken his fall. Too soon, the rest of his muscles will fail him.
Less than 20 years after he threw the final pitch of a Hall-of-Fame
career with the Oakland A's and New York Yankees, Hunter is in the
death grip of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If you think strapping a convicted killer to an electric chair
is cruel and unusual punishment, then check out what ALS does to
the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ALS is a neurological vampire that systematically paralyzes the
muscles. The mind remains intact, trapped inside an increasingly
useless shell of a body. Some 30,000 Americans have the disease
that Gehrig made famous six decades ago. There is still no cure in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a bad break,'' Hunter said shortly after
doctors delivered his death sentence. ``You look at the things
you've done in your lifetime and you know you couldn't have done it
without God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe He's telling me I should've done things better than I
did. But you never know. Maybe He'll let me know later, when I'm
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   What should Hunter have done better? What could he have done
better? Four pitchers this century won 200 games before their 31st
birthday: Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson and Hunter.
Hunter wound up with 224 victories and five World Series rings. He
pitched a perfect game. He strung together five consecutive
20-victory seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Old teammates insist Hunter is an even better person than he was
a pitcher. Reggie Jackson calls Hunter ``the most respected player
and person I've been around in the game,'' and there are 2,000
residents of Hertford who will vouch for the man's character.
Hunter was born there, grew up there and never left there in
spirit. To them, he is Jimmy, not Catfish.
</P>
<P>
   One of the locals died earlier this year of a heart attack at
age 48. Hunter, who had enough health problems of his own by then,
was the first to step up and say, ``We need to help his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Hunter always has been at his best in a pinch. The
Oakland dynasty wouldn't have ruled from 1972-74 without Hunter
rising to occasion after occasion. He won Game 2 of the '72 World
Series against the Cincinnati Reds as a starter and Game 7 as a
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   With the A's facing elimination in '73 against the Mets, Hunter
out-dueled Tom Seaver in Game 6. Hunter won one game and saved
another in '74 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hunter wore out his right arm, he had shown the
Yankees how to be champions. Hunter was 9-6 in the post-season,
with the last of those victories coming in Game 6 of the '78 World
Series. That gave the Yankees their second consecutive
championship. Hunter challenged hitters, never fearing the
consequences. He didn't make excuses. He remained just as down-home
as the day he left the farm as a teen-ager. When Hunter was in high
school, he and his brother went on a rabbit-hunting expedition. The
brother tripped and accidentally shot Hunter in the right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My folks worried I would get hurt playing football,'' Hunter
mused later. ``So, instead, my brother shot my toe off
accidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   His manner was so charming and disarming, teammates couldn't
help but smile even as Hunter zinged them. Like the time Jackson
homered twice in one game in '78, prompting fans to shower the
Yankee Stadium field with hundreds of the new ``Reggie'' candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you unwrap one,'' Hunter said, ``it tells you how good it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland owner Charlie Finley wanted to give Hunter a $5,000
bonus after the perfect game in '68. Hunter wouldn't take the money
until Finley agreed to give catcher Jim Pagliaroni a bonus, too.
When it came time to enter the Hall of Fame in '87, Hunter thanked
his brothers and sisters for shaping him as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They taught me how to throw strikes,'' Hunter said during his
induction speech. ``Thanks to them I gave up 379 home runs in the
big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   If Catfish Hunter had had his way, he'd have spent the rest of
his life in a quiet retirement with his wife and high school
sweetheart, Helen. He wanted to be just another farmer, raising
cotton and peanuts and corn and beans. He wanted to hunt and fish
and roam the countryside with his dogs. He wanted to spend golden
year after golden year watching what happens to his children and
spoiling the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Life has a way of thumbing its nose at plans. Since the
diagnosis in November, Hunter has made uncharacteristic public
appearances in hopes of raise ALS research money. An appearance for
a Yankees exhibition game in Tampa left hardly a dry eye in Legends
Field. Said Hunter: ``I'm like (former Yankees pitcher Ron) Guidry.
I'm a farmer now that doesn't do too much hard labor.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to rise early in the mornings, leaving his wife in bed.
Now he has to wait for Helen to dress him. She feeds him. She gives
him the insulin shots he has needed since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish Hunter likes to joke that he can tell when his wife is
mad at him: ``She twists the needle the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends have established the Jim ``Catfish'' Foundation, and
there is a toll-free line (877-HELP-ALS). Hunter has auctioned off
his 1974 Cy Young Award, his World Series rings, his six All-Star
rings and assorted other memorabilia. He wanted to see to his
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish Hunter was a pitcher, one of the best who ever lived,
but it didn't define him. He tells people he's more proud of the
fact that when his playing days ended, he settled in to become a
farmer. A farmer learns to deal with uncertainty, to cope with the
fact that so many things are out of his hands. Maybe the weather
will cooperate, and maybe it won't. Maybe it will be a bountiful
harvest, and maybe it won't.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer works and sweats and hopes and prays. If you have any
prayers to spare, Jim Hunter and his family would appreciate it if
you send them their way. The miracle business can't have gone
bankrupt. There are so many needy customers.

THE LURE OF STARGAZING DESPITE BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARGARET MITTELBACH and MICHAEL CREWDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's 8 p.m. and we're driving down Flatbush Avenue in
Brooklyn to a little-advertised nocturnal gathering on the old
runways of a decommissioned airport.
</P>
<P>
   While a get-together in such an odd location might suggest some
kind of outlaw party, our rendezvous promises to be slightly less
rowdy _ and totally cosmic.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every month for the last 17 years, the Amateur
Astronomers Association of New York has held a ``star party'' at
Floyd Bennett Field, one of the city's darkest corners. Lugging
high-powered telescopes, the amateur astronomers and their guests
(everyone is invited) gather to observe such stellar phenomena as
the Orion Nebula, asteroids and the atmospheric conditions around
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the only things that have stopped the star
parties have been winter snowstorms, summer mosquitoes and cloudy
skies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this city is not well known for its stargazing. Its
skies are light-polluted, tall buildings block off views of the
firmament, and spending time in poorly lighted, unpopulated areas
is not considered the smart thing to do. The closest most New
Yorkers get to seeing stars is the map of the zodiac on the ceiling
of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 400 members of the city's 72-year-old Amateur
Astronomers Association do the best they can to meet the universe
head on.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Floyd Bennett Field, club members regularly hold star
parties in Carl Schurz Park on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, at
Great Kills Park on the southeastern shore of Staten Island and on
special occasions at the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, where New
Yorkers have patiently lined up behind telescopes waiting for views
of everything from the mountains of the Moon to Comet
Shoemaker-Levy colliding with Jupiter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Saturday night, the club will be host to an astral shindig at
Great Kills, hoping to spot a few shooting stars on the last night
of the annual Perseid meteor shower. Since most club members can't
travel to truly dark-sky locations on the average weekend, they
settle for these, the darkest skies they can find.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live in the city, you can be blinded to the stars by
all the lights, which is sad because the sky is spectacularly
beautiful,'' said Lynn Darsh, the association's president. ``When
you go to places like Floyd Bennett Field where there are very few
lights, you're still in the city, but you can see the stars and get
a whole new perspective on the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   When you add telescopes into the mix, Ms. Darsh said, you can
see even more _ the history of the universe, galaxies being born,
the fact that Earth is turning and that its inhabitants are flying
through space. ``It's really one of the only sciences where you can
actually look at the great specimens, the original specimens.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Bennett Field, a 1,200-acre open space, is at the very
southern end of Flatbush Avenue, just before the Marine Parkway
Bridge goes over Rockaway Inlet. Once an airfield and now part of
the federally managed Gateway National Recreation Area, the
pancake-flat, thicketed field is still bisected by aging blacktop
runways.
</P>
<P>
   Although we've been given directions, the star party is not easy
to find. Heading north along a former taxiway, we pass an old
control tower and several abandoned hangars. After about a mile, we
reach a deserted runway lined with sumac trees and bayberry bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a section of the tarmac designated the Remote
Control Flying Field, where people fly model airplanes during the
day, we come to a bend where we find the amateur astronomers
setting up, their telescopes aimed at the darkening sky.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Kunhardt, a science teacher at Midwood High School and
the long-time host of the Floyd Bennett Field star parties, greets
us heartily. Swatting away mosquitoes, he hands us each a rolled-up
map of the night sky. Unfurling them, we search for
familiar-sounding stars. Instead we find the Dumbbell Nebula, a
2.7-magnitude star named Unuk and a constellation called Norma.
It's not even completely dark yet, and we already feel as if we've
failed Astronomy 101.
</P>
<P>
   As night falls over the airfield, Kunhardt proceeds to give us a
basic sky orientation. The first thing beginning stargazers need to
know is that the sky changes all night and every night. For
example, if you're looking for Orion's belt in summer, you're not
going to find it: it's below the horizon at this time of year.
Beginners should look for big, well-known stars of the season and
orient themselves from there. Rather than hunt for constellations,
look for basic geometric shapes.
</P>
<P>
   On our maps, Kunhardt shows us the Summer Triangle _ Vega, Deneb
and Altair _ three very bright stars that form a triangle high in
the sky. As it gets darker, they're among the first stars to wink
into view, and, as we crane our necks heavenward, we feel as if
we're beginning to get our sky bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Kunhardt points out some more emerging stars. ``The Big Dipper's
beginning to peek through,'' he says. ``See the three stars making
up the handle? And on the right side of the bucket, those two stars
are pointer stars, and they point right toward Polaris, the North
Star. They have great names _ Dubhe and Merak.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dark, we begin to overhear celestial small talk.
</P>
<P>
   '`I think the ancients must have had a lot of imagination to see
all those things in the stars,'' one party guest says.
</P>
<P>
   Another says, ``The North American Indians looked at the Big
Dipper and thought they saw a bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another volunteers, ``I look at it, and I see Daniel Boone's
hat.''
</P>
<P>
   As the party conversation heats up, we start to mix and mingle.
</P>
<P>
   We sidle up to Stephen Lieber, who has an impressive
Newtonian-style telescope that he designed and made himself. It
looks like a cross between a rocket launcher and a box kite, and
has a 12-inch primary mirror, which, from a distance of 20 feet,
seems big enough to shave in.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber, who works as a tool salesman, has been grinding a new
mirror for his telescope since 1992. (The old one, which was ground
by an optician, turned out to be astigmatic.) ``You want to see the
Earth turning?'' he asks. He focuses his massive scope on a small
star. Looking through the eyepiece, we see the star quickly moving
across the sky and out of our field of vision. But it's not the
star that's moving, he points out; we are, spinning around the
Earth's axis at a rate of 800 miles per hour. Suddenly we feel a
bit queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've shown people quasars out here,'' says Lieber, who has
re-aimed his scope to view the Moon, which is so bright through his
lens that we feel as if we're about to be blinded. ``A quasar is an
object that has died billions of years ago. But it's so far away
that it took billions of years for that light to get here. So
you're actually seeing the universe at an earlier stage of
evolution. You can't see a living dinosaur anymore, but you can see
something that was alive when life was first forming on this
planet. That is what I call a `wow moment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amateur astronomers have a strange relationship with light.
Starlight, of course, is what they crave. Artificial lights are the
enemy, and they will go almost anywhere to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   At Floyd Bennett Field, the only sign of big-city lights is the
tiny, toy-size figures of the World Trade Center and the Empire
State Building twinkling on the horizon. The airfield itself is
almost entirely devoid of electric lighting, and since it's flat
and free of buildings, Floyd Bennett offers stargazers a
360-degree, panoramic view of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Still, summer viewing is tough here. The salt marshes
surrounding Floyd Bennett Field are breeding grounds for a vicious
species of mosquito that usually scares off even the most diehard
stargazers in July and August. And we cannot describe what we are
seeing as glimmering diamonds strewn across a velvet sky. Summer
humidity and the city's heavy pollution make the sky hazy. Thanks
to the glare of the nearly full moon, dozens of stars usually
visible to the naked eye are now washed out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is where the telescopes come in. Steven Calvaruso
of Brooklyn, a heating and air-conditioning technician, has brought
his $1,000 Schmidt-Cassegrain computerized telescope with a
brand-new $400 eyepiece. To orient his telescope's computer, which
allows him to punch in a celestial object's coordinates and have
the scope turn automatically toward it, he first has to find two
stars on his own and lock in their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The first one he picks is Deneb of the Summer Triangle, a star
that, though 53,000 times as bright as the Sun, is fortunately
1,600 light-years away. ``It's a supergiant,'' he tells us. Through
his telescope it looks like a burning blue ball.
</P>
<P>
   The second star he picks is Albireo, the bill of the swan in the
constellation Cygnus, a dim speck to the naked eye and seemingly
unworthy of attention. Magnified 90 times, however, Albireo
magically separates into two: one a bright gold star and the other
brilliant blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double star, but it only has one name,'' Calvaruso
says, ``because it was named before there were telescopes and
before people knew there were really two stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvaruso has a huge tome with him, ``The Night Sky Observer's
Guide,'' and the authors, George Kepple and Glen Sanner, rank
stellar phenomena on a one- to five-star basis as if they were
reviewing restaurants. Calvaruso relishes picking out top-ranked
objects and offering them to star-party guests like hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   He decides to show us M13, which amateur astronomers consider
one of the most exciting objects in the night sky. It's a
``globular cluster'' located at declination plus-36 degrees, 27
seconds (sky ``latitude''), and right ascension 16 hours, 41
minutes (sky ``longitude'') in the constellation Hercules, which
happens to be right over our heads tonight. Through his telescope,
M13 appears as a faint snowball of light. It is actually a group of
300,000 dead and dying stars that formed early in the history of
our galaxy, before Earth even existed. We think we're having a wow
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the M in M13 is for Charles Messier, a French
comet hunter of the late 18th century, who put together a list of
all the ``fuzzy'' objects in the sky that were not comets but
easily visible to the small telescope he was using on his Paris
rooftop. His list of about 100 objects _ from far-off galaxies to
star clusters _ has become a catalog of some of the most popular
deep-space objects that amateur astronomers hunt for.
</P>
<P>
   We look at another Messier object, the M57 Ring Nebula in the
constellation Lyra. Through the telescope, it looks like a hazy
frosted doughnut. It is, in fact, a cloud of gas and matter thrown
off by a dying star more than 2,000 light-years away. Impressive.
But like Messier, Calvaruso admits he has a yen for urban comet
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   When Comet Hale-Bopp passed over the city two years ago, he held
an ``unofficial event'' at Floyd Bennett. ``I woke up at 2 in the
morning _ no one wanted to come with me _ and lugged all my
equipment over here, and found a nice little spot at about 3 a.m. I
spent two hours tracking the comet. It had an abnormally shaped
tail that arced out and a greenish hue. It was a beautiful sight.
Finally, I got chased away by the cops. It turned out I was
standing in the middle of a helicopter landing field.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing this story, we lie down on the cracked blacktop of
the old runway, which is still warm from the heat of the day. From
this vantage point, we marvel at the entire panorama of the night
sky and listen to the crickets chirping in the surrounding brush.
The Summer Triangle shines brightly overhead. As the party winds
down toward 11 p.m., we eavesdrop on the lingering conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the club chat about how nice it would be to live in
the country, far away from city lights, and joke about petitioning
to start an urban ``dark skies'' movement. While the rest of the
city fears a large blackout in the heat of the summer, amateur
astronomers, in their hearts, long for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the blackout in the '70s,'' Kunhardt says, ``I remember
looking up at the sky and saying, this is incredible.'' He recalls
being able to make out the Milky Way. ``Since then,'' he says,
``I've always thought I'd send a letter to the mayor and ask him if
he didn't mind having the lights turned out for just one night so
that everybody could see the night sky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``I don't think he'd go for it.''

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Psychopaths, like small children, have an endearing
way of blurting out embarrassing truths that no one else dare
utter. Toward the long-awaited end of ``Voices in the Dark,'' the
thrill-free thriller by John Pielmeier that opened Thursday night
at the Longacre Theater, the play's resident homicidal maniac
weighs in with a most astute critical judgment as he considers the
gore around him: ``Oh, what a mess!'' Bless him. Someone had to say
it.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, ``Voices in the Dark,'' which stars a very
valiant Judith Ivey as an imperiled radio talk show host, has
managed to throw in elements from just about every shivery
woman-in-jeopardy plot of the last six or seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   It has evoked, to its detriment, everything from old-fashioned
telephone-centered shockers like ``Sorry, Wrong Number'' and
``Midnight Lace'' to carnage-in-the-woods movies like ``Friday the
13th.'' There has even been nervous violin music (by Robert
Waldman) a la Bernard Herrmann's score for ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to come is the sequence in which Ms. Ivey's character
quaintly tries to defang her predator by summoning his alternate
personality, just as those good doctors did with Joanne Woodward in
``The Three Faces of Eve.'' But this psycho isn't buying. ``You
want to integrate me?'' he asks. ``Well, I'm going to disintegrate
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he is right on target. Integration, whether of plot
ends or of humor and suspense, just isn't going to happen in this
play. It's like the overcooked veal stew that is prepared onstage
and which may or may not include some extra meat from the
eviscerated body in the Jacuzzi. Nobody, maniacs excepted, swallows
it.
</P>
<P>
   Pielmeier is best known for ``Agnes of God,'' the
nun-meets-shrink psychodrama that was a popular success on Broadway
and later made into a movie. It was a show that mixed tabloid
prurience (dead baby found in demented nun's wastebasket!) with
highbrow arguments on religion versus psychology, so that audiences
could have their sensationalism without feeling like vultures.
</P>
<P>
   In cold print, ``Agnes'' doesn't remotely hold together as
either mystery or theological debate, but onstage its holes were
partly concealed by the powerhouse presences of Elizabeth Ashley,
Geraldine Page and Amanda Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Voices,'' which is directed by Christopher Ashley,
Pielmeier has come up with an even more brazen blend of
gruesomeness and intellectual posturing that makes disparaging
moral comment on the same lurid elements it exploits. (As in
``Agnes,'' a history of child molestation figures prominently.)
</P>
<P>
   The dramatist is again blessed with a first-rate actress. But
even the smart and resourceful Ms. Ivey can't overcome the
humiliation of having to make like Jamie Lee Curtis in her scream
queen period, brandishing a butcher knife while sobbing in terror.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ivey plays Lil, the therapy-dispensing host of the call-in
radio show ``Last Resort.'' Described by her agent as ``commercial,
compassionate, movingly primal,'' she has saved 79 lives on the
air. Now she wants to heal her own marriage and to that end goes to
an isolated cabin (designed by David Gallo and Lauren Helpern) in
the Adirondacks to rendezvous with her straying husband.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that a blizzard starts soon after she
arrives, along with thunder, lightning and a power failure. Then
there's that wacko anonymous caller who keeps saying he really
wants to hurt a certain unidentified woman.
</P>
<P>
   The husband never shows, but an assortment of rustic creeps do:
the childlike goon, Owen (Raphael Sbarge); the lecherous, uncouth
handyman, Blue (John Ahlin), and the testy, disgruntled Egan (Zach
Grenier), who may or may not be the police detective he claims to
be. As Lil's agent, Hack (Peter Bartlett), who drops by just long
enough to sprinkle that ever popular acid gay wit, notes, ``Oh God,
I'm in `Deliverance 2.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such lines suggest that ``Voices,'' like Wes Craven's far more
entertaining ``Scream,'' wants to mock the formulaic hand that
shapes it. But Ashley and his creditable cast never settle on a
consistent and forceful style, and the evening's wit and suspense
are equally limp.
</P>
<P>
   The banter comes from an assembly kit. (``This is important
television.'' ``Talk about oxymorons.'') The scenes in which Ms.
Ivey stumbles through the dark in panic suggest nothing more
disturbing than that she is trying to revive the lost art of slam
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ivey goes as far as anyone could in milking some semblance
of a character from her role. In the early scenes in particular,
she plays amusingly with the vocal tones and rhythms of a woman who
makes her living from pop psychology and talking to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   But no one outside a downtown camp fest can be expected to carry
off moments like the one in which Lil says to someone who has just
stumbled onto the evening's first corpse: ``He's not all in there.
Some of him is inside the stew.''
</P>
<P>
   Pielmeier sticks in some talk about the primal instincts of
violence versus civilized problem-solving. And he takes time to
sneer at a rube who doesn't know the difference between Stephen
King and Stephen Hawking and at sleaze-show television hosts like
Jerry Springer and Sally Jessy Raphael. He is on shaky ground. &QL;

<P>
   You would like to wander under trees, next to a lazy canal, but
you can't get to Paris this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours from Manhattan, the Delaware Canal in
Pennsylvania offers visitors this kind of respite from the 20th
century. You can walk or cycle from hamlet to hamlet, eat at a
200-year-old inn and sleep with the porch door open, all the time
next to water. ``It's a good place to go when you need to go far,
but don't have much time,'' said Elizabeth Kieronski, an oboist
from New Jersey who makes frequent visits to the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Canal was originally a towpath canal, with
mule-drawn barges and towns centered on the canal trade. Now a
Pennsylvania State Park and National Heritage Trail, it runs by
beautiful small towns, fields of corn or flowers, covered bridges
and worthwhile restaurants. In its most serene part, the canal is
completely isolated from roads, a slower world on a smaller scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Canal began its life in 1832 with barges carrying
coal from Easton, Pa., to its outlet in Bristol, N.J. Supplies
traveled from there to Trenton, Philadelphia and New York. The pace
was slow, only as fast as a mule could go. The day began with a
barge man blowing on a conch shell. Sometimes fights broke out over
right of way. Whole families tended barges together, with small
children sometimes tied to the edges so they wouldn't fall off.
</P>
<P>
   Barges picked up hams, fruits and flour as well as coal along
the 60-mile stretch, which even now looks like a world of its own.
As a commercial venue, the canal had its heyday for about 20 years
after 1832; then railroads superseded it. Yet the canal trade was
active until 1932. Families kept walking their mules down the dirt
path, with barges that looked like floating pioneer cabins.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Canal is the only remaining canal in the United
States that can still hold water for its entire length, said Susan
Taylor, executive director of Friends of the Delaware Canal. Some
sections are out of water because of repair projects, a situation
that should be corrected in the next year. My favorite section,
between Upper Black Eddy and Erwinna, Pa., currently has its water
and is expected to remain that way.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycles with wide tires are a good choice for the Delaware
Canal, but not absolutely necessary. Average bikes, old clunkers
and 10-speeds will do. You can bring your own or rent them in
Frenchtown, N.J. To me, the canal is an off-road biking paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Other cyclists might disagree. There are significant tree roots,
rocks and rough holes. But it works as long as you keep one eye on
the path, and its rough character also means you won't be run down
by speed cyclists. Walking is also an excellent way to see the
canal. You can travel at the right pace to let the canal work its
modest spell _ enfolded by trees, drawn on by the water.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On our last trip, my husband and I spent our first night at the
Bridgeton House at Upper Black Eddy, a small hamlet near the canal.
The Bridgeton sits on the Delaware River at the foot of the bridge
over to Milford, N.J., once a ferry landing. Built in 1836 as a
private residence, the Bridgeton had other lives as a bakery,
general store and ferry stop.
</P>
<P>
   Our room in the back came with a porch, good for watching the
river and the mild lights of Milford. The next morning, a short
bike ride brought us to the canal. Its water was tranquil,
reflecting the greens of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Go left at the canal and you will be traveling south to
Uhlerstown for about 40 minutes of cycling, past fields and under
leaning trees. We saw a new vegetable garden, the backyard of some
fancy chickens, a '57 Chevy in a garage and an old quarry. Small
frame houses sit perched next to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Uhlerstown, once a busy boat-building town improbably named
Mexico, is now so small there's not even a post office or store in
sight. What is left are engaging old houses where lockkeepers may
have lived, a tavern or a hotel. Uhlerstown has a beautiful red
covered bridge, the only remaining one across the canal. If you are
on the path, you'll ride under it; or, take a small detour and go
through it.
</P>
<P>
   At Uhlerstown we took a side trip to Frenchtown, N.J., about
five minutes by bike or a 10-minute walk from Uhlerstown. Passing
by handsome river basin farms, you can glimpse an iris farm on the
left. At the Frenchtown Bridge, the quietly magnetic Delaware River
opens up to the north and south.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchtown has gained a new face in the last 10 years. New
businesses cater to the browsing trade in antiques and crafts, but
Frenchtown still has its handsome old town buildings and a
normal-looking laundromat and pizzeria. The Frenchtown Inn once
housed the novelist Nathaniel West for a brief but important period
of his life in the 1930s, when he finished his masterwork, ``Miss
Lonelyhearts.''
</P>
<P>
   James Agee, author of ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' lived on
Second Street in Frenchtown for a spell during the 1930s as well.
Agee and West had friends like the writer Josephine Herbst down the
river in Erwinna. To find what attracted these leftist artists to
Frenchtown, you will have to squint past its new incarnation as a
weekend spot and think of a solitary river town in the Depression.
The stoic lines of the old buildings are still there, as well as
the river, and across the river, the stone houses and moody fields
of Bucks County.
</P>
<P>
   At the Frenchtown Cafe, a lively place with a short counter and
booths, we found another happy time warp: a classic roasted turkey
sandwich, real iced tea and homemade pie _ the kind of meal you
would find on the road in the 1950's. We sat at the counter while
waitresses walked hot sweet potato pies to the dessert case.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, the Bridge Cafe has eclectic soups and salads
and a view of the river. It was Ken Miller, its owner, who first
told me about the Delaware Canal towpath. ``You can get lost in
time there,'' he said. ``I'm not even sure how far it goes,'' he
added a little dreamily, as if it might go on for infinity.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the Frenchtown Bridge and turned north back up the
canal to Upper Black Eddy. In the case of the canal, reversing your
direction can be worthwhile _ you can see it from another angle. We
stopped off at the Homestead, the last old general store left on
the canal. A large barn still stands here where mules once rested.
I had heard from Ms. Taylor that Dalmatians and coal were sold
there. It's true. While we were there, a truck that proclaimed
``Coal That Satisfies'' rolled into the parking lot with its driver
and two Dalmatians in the front.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That night we drove 14 dark miles to Lambertville on the New
Jersey side to eat at Manon, a Provencal-inspired bistro in a small
house. Fragrant bouillabaisse and pesto ravioli met us there. Then
we returned to our porch at Bridgeton House to look at the river at
night.
</P>
<P>
   For our last day, we planned to explore a longer stretch of the
canal and spend an evening at the Evermay-on-the-Delaware inn. By
this time the canal seemed so mesmerizing that we thought about
finding a house on the water and some sort of work a town or two
up, just for the pleasure of commuting by canal.
</P>
<P>
   Between Frenchtown and Erwinna the canal is its most serene,
with a lazy life of bending trees, swallows, and kingfishers. Old
houses sit close to it. Small children digging holes in their yard
waved to us.
</P>
<P>
   The canal crosses Erwinna at Headquarters Road. A short side
trip here brings you past Erwinna's center (the post office) and
into old-style Bucks County, with stone farmhouses, handsome
fields, austere frame farmhouses and covered bridges. For a sample,
follow Headquarters Road until it turns into Geigel Hill Road and
continue to the covered bridge. Herbst lived on a farm out here in
the 1930s _ in splendid isolation by her account.
</P>
<P>
   At the civilized Evermay, we adjusted our demeanor from canal
rat to Victorian parlor guest. This inn was once a vacation spot
for the Barrymores and James Michener. It now takes its pleasures
seriously, with jackets at dinner. The chef, William Finnegan,
invents one six-course menu each weekend, which might include
roasted moulard breast, peppered tuna or a chestnut souffle. After
dinner we walked the canal at night to see how its spell was doing.
Night simplified the landscape _ a slice of water, broadening sky,
straight to the moon. You'd like to just keep going. It's true, you
can get lost out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many a heart was broken along the canal,'' said one Flora
Henry, a lockkeeper many years ago, and it's not hard to see why.

statement, part of an attempt by Eichmann to portray himself as a
man driven by a visceral sense of duty rather than hatred, appears
on page six of 127 pages of handwritten reflections that Die Welt
said it found at the Center for Research on Nazi Crimes in the
southern German town of Ludwigsburg. By Roger Cohen.

   THE IRON GIANT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Eli Marienthal, Harry Connick Jr., Jennifer
Aniston, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, Christopher
McDonald &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brad Bird &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   It fell from the sky one night and eats automobiles, stanchions
at electric power stations and anything else made of metal. Beyond
that, no one in the seaside town of Rockwell, Maine, knows the
nature or origin of the 50-foot iron robot that landed in their
midst.
</P>
<P>
   This being 1957, the year of Sputnik and a dicey time in the
cold war, suspicions turn to the Red Menace. The government sends
Kent Mansley (McDonald), a devious, overbearing commie-buster, to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The only person willing to look at the situation rationally is a
smart, gritty little boy named Hogarth (Eli Marienthal), who seeks
out the robot in the forest. After a fearful encounter or two,
Hogarth determines that whatever the creature is up to, he has a
peaceful disposition.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no warming up to him in Rockwell. Hogarth's only
ally is Dean (Mr. Connick), a sculptor who runs a junkyard that
provides material for his pieces (and a couple of squares a day for
the robot).
</P>
<P>
   Dean tries to pass off the iron man as an outdoor installation
piece. Mansley responds predictably: nuke it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE When attacked, the iron man effectively returns fire,
which leads to a pitched tank batle. Then there is the matter of
the nuclear warhead. But it's all in the zowie cartoon spirit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A few mild epithets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 A little too intense for the very young. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8 Some parents may disagree, but the film isn't too
formidable for many children this age. The giant is likable, as is
Hogarth. Mansley is nasty and gives Hogarth a bad time, but he's
also something of a clown and never too realistically threatening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-12 Loosely based on a story by the poet Ted Hughes,
Bird's film is an accomplished work of animation that has a winning
character in Hogarth and valuable things to say about xenophobia,
armed reaction to anything threatening, remaining true to oneself
and searching out the reality of a situation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Many older children, and adults, will enjoy this
film. &QL;

<P>
   Directed by Andrew Fleming &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 90 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At last we get the whole truth about Watergate: the identity of
Deep Throat, the shadowy source who delivered the breakthrough
goods on Richard Nixon (Hedaya), the infamous 18{-minute gap in the
presidential tape, all of it.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds crazy, but late one night two teen-agers who live at
the Watergate, Arlene (Ms. Williams) and Betsy (Ms. Dunst), are
mailing a letter to Arlene's idol, the pop star Bobby Sherman, when
they run smack into G. Gordon Liddy (Shearer), who is monitoring
the break-in in progress at that very moment.
</P>
<P>
   From here on the story gets complicated. But word gets to Nixon
that the girls could know more than is good for everybody so he
offers them jobs as official walkers of the presidential dog, a big
hound that Nixon, who hates dogs, confuses with a pooch he owned 20
years earlier and calls Checkers.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the girls really dig Nixon, who stays
attentive and even entertains Arlene's entreaties to end the
Vietnam War. Soon he and everybody from the White House guards to
the Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev are getting blasted on Betsy's
Hello Dolly cookies, which have been spiked unbeknownst to her by
her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene actually develops a mad crush on Nixon and leaves him an
18{-minute declaration of love on the tape recorder she and Betsy
find in a desk drawer in the Oval Office. But then the girls
overhear other stuff on the tape about breaking in and covering up,
Nixon's real sentiments about the war and, worst of all,
uncomplimentary remarks about Checkers. Right then the wheels of
revelation start to turn. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Betsy, fully clothed, makes out on a bed with a boy she
mistakes for the son of the presidential aide Bob Haldeman (Foley),
whose house she and Arlene are themselves burglarizing in search of
more incriminating tapes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY As was made clear during the Nixon years and no less
so here, strong profanity frequently emanates from the White
House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10 Not a good idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-12 The language is gamey, but the girls are fun and so
is Nixon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP There should be no problem for younger
teen-agers. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kinka Usher &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 100 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Endeavoring to protect Champion City, several delusional souls
pretend they're comic book superheroes on call to answer
emergencies. Since superheroes need specialties, one of them (Macy)
has adopted a shovel as his weapon of choice, another (Azaria)
throws forks and spoons and a third, called the Furious (Stiller),
gets mad at people.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the metropolis already has a superhero,
Captain Amazing (Kinnear), who routs evildoers with a traditional
multifaceted attack and dresses in a sleek outfit studded with
product logos. It is in these commercial interests that Amazing
gets himself and his city into a terrible fix.
</P>
<P>
   With endorsements slumping, the captain decides he needs a major
bad boy on the loose to inflate the need for superheroics. On his
recommendation, the authorities release the ``cured'' madman
Casanova Frankenstein (Rush), who immediately fills the bill by
devising doomsday machines, throwing wild parties and, in a bit of
a backfire, capturing Captain Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the superschleps recruit a woman (Ms. Garofalo) who
wields a bowling ball with a skull inside, take on a spiritual guru
(Studi) and enlist a munitions specialist (Waits), who, in a nice
touch, makes only nonlethal weapons (a blame thrower, for example).
Maybe Frankenstein will kill himself laughing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Superheroes and their rivals live to mix it up, but
here it's strictly buffoonery, and remember that the weapons aren't
meant to hurt anybody. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A fair amount and strong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 9 Clearly the film isn't for very young children. As
for older ones in this group, the profanity is bothersome. Also the
pace is often surprisingly slow for an action romp, making for a
very long 100-minute movie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 Their kind of thing, to be sure, and relatively
harmless. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Older teen-agers will find the whole thing
silly. &QL;

`BOWFINGER': A GENUINE FAKE IN A WORLD OF MAKE-BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a special breed of Hollywood operator to hang a poster
for his promotional film about the Yugo (``The Practical and
Affordable Car of the 80s'') on the office wall. Along with a
``Learn How to Act'' brochure in which he offers to give lessons
for what is surely an inflated fee.
</P>
<P>
   The title character in the hilarious, good-hearted ``Bowfinger''
is a tireless schemer who, like Zero Mostel in ``The Producers,''
is part of a great show-biz tradition: being ruthless, delusional
and hellbent on turning lemons into lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where the semblance of power counts for almost as
much as the real thing, he knows how to talk the talk. When he
describes meeting someone famous, he casually adds: ``By the way,
he knew who I was. Big fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Frank Oz, and every bit as winning as his ``In and
Out'' and ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' ``Bowfinger'' is a coup for
Steve Martin, who wrote the screenplay with obvious affection for
all that he lampoons here.
</P>
<P>
   Starring with the equally irresistible Eddie Murphy, who is
razor sharp in his dual role, Martin offers a knowing guide to
making movies while accentuating the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get a crew, and I want the best damn crew we can
afford!'' declares Bobby Bowfinger, just before he and his pals are
seen chasing illegal immigrants at the Mexican border.
``Bowfinger'' is the kind of sly comedy in which these workers have
to be taught how to clap a slate before the camera rolls but are
discreetly reading Cahiers du Cinema before the process is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that Tom Cruise had no idea he was in that
vampire movie until two years later?'' Bobby asks, by way of
justifying the outrageous scheme that he cooks up here. It seems
that an associate of Bobby's, ``a damn good writer, as well as
accountant and part-time receptionist'' (Adam Alexi-Malle), has
come up with an idea about space aliens hiding in drops of water.
And that ``Chubby Rain,'' as the project is called, can't be made
without a big action star.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Ramsey ( Murphy) would be perfect. But he is much more
interested in spiritual pursuits with the well-heeled religious
cult presided over by Terence Stamp, as a steely-eyed sage. He has
given Kit these rules to live by: ``There are no aliens,'' ``There
is no giant foot trying to squash me,'' and ``I feel like I might
ignite, but probably I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bowfinger plan for sneaking Kit Ramsey into the movie is
funny enough in its own right. But it also plays to our suspicions
that, even allowing for the inherent illusion that is filmmaking,
so much of what turns up on the screen is fake.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby can be seen exploiting false appearances with a ragtag
crew (``the most promising group of young professionals I've ever
worked with!'') that provides much of the background fun.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Baranski sweeps through the film as the drama queen
who can't help noticing that something is wrong with this picture.
``It's just so (italics)traditional(end italics) to actually meet
the person one's working with,'' she sighs about Kit.
</P>
<P>
   But Kit, the kind of guy who might just shoot the drum set in
his living room in a fit of pique, plays awfully hard to get. (Like
Leonardo di Caprio in ``Celebrity,'' Murphy has his self-satirizing
Big Star impersonation down pat.) So it's a great stroke of luck
when Jiff (also Murphy) appears, looking a lot like Kit except for
Jiff's glasses, braces and goofy grin.
</P>
<P>
   Jiff is roped into a cast that also includes Daisy (deliciously
played by Heather Graham), the suitcase-toting ingenue who showed
up at the Bowfinger office asking, ``Is this where I go to be a
star?'' Daisy may not have the greatest sense of direction, but she
knows one good old-fashioned route to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' is smoothly directed and acted with glee, showing
off the quick-witted comic spirit that is enjoying a welcome
resurgence late this summer. (``Dick,'' the diabolically bubbly
Watergate satire, and ``The Muse,'' forthcoming from Albert Brooks,
are in much the same literate vein.)
</P>
<P>
   But what makes it work, beyond a landslide of wily gags that
would do a Mad magazine satire proud, is the rueful experience that
colors its humor. Martin doesn't flaunt this, but it shapes his
screenplay effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   An exchange about a vintage car with Robert Downey Jr., who
appears too briefly in the role of a powerful producer, says
everything about the man in barely a moment. And when Daisy sweetly
exclaims, ``Who cares if when I hit my sexual peak you'll be 70?,''
Bowfinger is prompted to make a rapturous comparison with Bogart
and Bacall, until Daisy sums up the prospects for their romance in
a single word:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The outdoor sculpture season is in full swing, with
new works of all sorts punctuating New York at sites from Lincoln
Center to Pier 34 downtown to Coffey Park in the Red Hook section
of Brooklyn. Some are pieces of beauty and originality. But what
makes a tour of this year's exhibitions interesting is not so much
the level of artistic quality, which is not, on the whole,
overwhelmingly high, but the wonderful variety of relationships
produced between art and the urban environment.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a couple of opposites. On a small, concrete traffic
island across the street from the Flatiron Building in Manhattan
stands a taxi-cab-yellow plastic box, a work not of geometric
abstraction but of interactive art by John Berg. Go inside, assume
a certain position, and you find that while the Flatiron Building
disappears behind an angled panel, you behold diverging, infinite
vistas down Broadway on one side and Fifth Avenue on the other.
This is a sculpture not for looking at but for looking from, for
focusing one's visual awareness in the midst of metropolitan chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Within walking distance of Berg's sculpture looms an enormous
wall work that is nothing if not to be looked at. Designed by the
team of Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel, ``Metronome'' rises some
10 stories above the new Virgin Records store at 1 Union Square
South in the East Village. In this $3 million extravaganza,
brickwork ripples in concentric waves from a gilded sunburst under
a colossal bronze hand; a giant rock plummets through space as a
67-foot-long conical bronze pendulum swings to the right. The
sculpture emits light, steam and sound and tracks the phases of the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   For all its post-modernist allegorical pretension, ``Metronome''
competes for spectacular theatricality with the signs of Times
Square. Yet like Berg's humble viewing booth, it enlivens our
experience of the city. Another work enhanced by its site is at
Rockefeller Center, where sculptures by the American early
Modernist Paul Manship are on display. Manship (1885-1966) created
the great golden Prometheus that is a symbol of the center, and his
combination of archaic classicism and modern formalism reflects the
spirit of heroic utopianism that animates many of the center's
other murals and carvings. Set into the tropical greenery of the
Channel Gardens between Fifth Avenue and the skating rink,
Manship's ambitious bronzes, including a two-part, bigger-than-life
Diana and Acteon, cast a mythic spell.
</P>
<P>
   A low point is hit, on the other hand, by an exhibition of
Modernist abstractions at Lincoln Center. Borrowed from the
collection of the Empire State Plaza, the state government office
complex in Albany, works by Ellsworth Kelly, Clement Meadmore,
Isamu Noguchi, George Sugarman and others have been plunked down
around a rectangular reflecting pool. The bland abstraction of the
sculpture and the sterility of the surrounding architecture combine
to depressingly anonymous effect, mitigated only by the liveliness
of a set of figurelike welded assemblages by David Smith and by
``Geometric Mouse,'' Claes Oldenburg's witty Pop conflation of
Minimalism and Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the works at Lincoln Center, one is reminded that it was
in reaction to the increasing emptiness of 1960s-style formalism
that sculptors of the late '60s and '70s started trying to develop
more meaningful relations between sculpture and its context. Around
the city, three artists have created works in that environmentally
conscious tradition.
</P>
<P>
   At Pier 34, or more accurately, in the space between the twin
piers, Ron Baron has orchestrated a subtly poetic installation. To
old mossy pilings that jut up from the water, Baron has attached
many colorful Nova Scotia lobster buoys singly or in stacks. Called
``Birds,'' and conceived as a homage to Constantin Brancusi, the
installation forms a triangular flock pointing out into the Hudson
River, creating a focus for meditation on one of the fundamental
natural facts of Manhattan's island existence.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidewalk plaza at Central Park's southeast entrance,
Andrea Zittel also plays on relations between culture and nature.
She has imbedded in the plaza what appear to be two massive rock
formations. Made of painted concrete, these simulated rocks invite
people to climb up and survey the surrounding space. They also
comment on the artifice that went into the making of the apparently
all-natural Central Park and, by extension, allude to the
artificiality of 20th-century life in general.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Central Park Pond, Ms. Zittel has launched a set
of ``Deserted Islands,'' white plastic rock-shaped floats, each
with a single padded seat. Designed as vehicles for meditative
isolation, they satirize the commodification of spiritual
narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   In another leafy, pleasant place, Coffey Park in Red Hook, Maria
Elena Gonzalez has produced ``Magic Carpet/Home,'' an interactive
sculpture that comments not on its physical but on its social
environment. The work is a broad, undulating platform of plywood
covered with a rubberized asphalt playground material. On this
surface the artist has neatly painted in white a floor plan the
size of a typical apartment in Red Hook East Housing, a nearby
complex. The wavy platform invites kinetic viewers to run and jump
while the more cerebral contemplate socioeconomic realities far
different from those that surround Manhattan's Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   There is a paradox about the installations of Baron, Ms. Zittel
and Ms. Gonzalez. Though sited for broad audience exposure,
significant aspects of their projects can be appreciated only by
people steeped in Modern and contemporary art: the knowing
relationship of Ms. Gonzalez's platform to the Minimalist
floorworks of Carl Andre, for example, or Ms. Zittel's wry critique
of consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Ginzel and Jones' ``Metronome,'' these three
installations are visually withholding to the point that many
viewers will not recognize them as artworks. This problem of
identification and interpretation does not arise for most outdoor
group shows, which tend to be easily recognizable as museum or
gallery exhibitions that just happen to be outdoors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Of all the works in outdoor sculpture shows in New York, there
is one, ``Internalized'' by Ellen Lesperance and Carl Scholz, that
would be wonderful to see in some spot more conspicuously public
than in an exhibition at Socrates Sculpture Park in the Long Island
City section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The work presents to a casual glance the quintessential New York
sight of an abandoned car: a beat-up, flat-tired '70s-era
Oldsmobile station wagon marooned on a desolate expanse of sunbaked
rubble. But draw close and peer in through the car windows, and you
will discover something amazing: an interior transformed into
miniature rooms with hardwood floors, white-enameled wainscoting, a
chandelier and a stainless-steel sink. In the contrast between the
ugly outside and the magical inside, there is a metaphor that might
apply to the city of New York itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Socrates Sculpture Park is worth a visit not only for the
Lesperance-Scholz car. A funky, raggedy place on the East River, it
is entertainingly loaded with permanent works by Mark di Suvero,
John Ahearn, Jene Highstein and others, as well as with works in a
temporary exhibition, including a huge wheel made of found-wood
fragments by Sylvia Benitez, fanciful, wriggly ``Unmirrors'' cast
in aluminum by Vallessa Monk, and a flock of sheep made of bricks
by Chris Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   Four group exhibitions in Brooklyn also offer synergy between
art and place. Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park, on the river between
the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, the area known as Dumbo, has a
grassy field and a view of the East River and Manhattan so
breathtakingly expansive that it is hard to tear yourself away to
look at the ``Intervistas'' outdoor sculpture show.
</P>
<P>
   Selected by Lorraine Walsh, one of the 16 participating artists,
the works in this friendly if uneven exhibition include Spoonbill &AMP;
Sugartown's ``Street-Corner Assemblage,'' a life-size re-creation
of a city street corner, complete with a concrete sidewalk section,
a light pole, a yellow-plastic magazine dispensing box and posted
flyers; Robert Winkler's quartet of serpentine wooden pyramids, and
a length of chain-link fence rolled up into a neat Minimalist
cylinder by Charles Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, the quiet, shady
courtyards of the Pratt Institute campus have been populated by
more than 25 works, many by familiar, well-established names like
Ursula von Rydingsvard, Grace Knowlton, Louise Bourgeois, Tom
Otterness, Mel Edwards and Dennis Oppenheim. One of the show's most
striking works is by Alissa Neglia, a younger sculptor, who has
welded hundreds of large, rusty washers into a kind of vast lacy
screen held up by massive wooden posts: shimmering opticality meets
industrial-strength materialism.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University, unfortunately,
the relationship between art and space is less than gratifying. The
six-artist show includes, most notably, Karl Jensen's set of bright
yellow or blue plywood bumping cars paying homage to Mondrian, and
Robert Hickman's giant slingshot loaded to fire a chair on skis
toward Manhattan. These and other works must struggle to survive
the grim geometry and continuing construction of the dark,
oppressive courtyard in which they're installed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the commons of the sleek, ultramodern Metrotech
Center in downtown Brooklyn, there is a show with a title that
could apply to the work of almost any sculptor working in public
space these days: ``Beyond the Monument.'' The show presents works
by four young artists, including Chakaia Booker, whose undulating,
perforated wall of tire treads emphasizes form and process over
symbolism, and a conceptual installation by Valeska Soares, who
attached to trees copper collars bearing a multilingual assortment
of book titles that include the word ``garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Works by Do-Ho Suh and Tony Matelli have particular resonance in
the context. In Suh's piece, a large, empty, simulated-marble
pedestal of the sort that would have supported an equestrian statue
a hundred years ago is held aloft by a regiment of foot-high
ordinary people cast in bronze. With the witty succinctness of an
op-ed page cartoon, Suh's work comments on our loss of heroes and
the triumph of the kind of faceless bureaucracy on which a place
like Metrotech is founded.
</P>
<P>
   Matelli contributes a realistic, life-size representation of a
seeing-eye dog. In a gallery, this piece would not look remarkable,
but positioned as it is on a sidewalk away from the center of the
courtyard, the dog seems abandoned and poignantly metaphorical. It
might be the lost soul of the corporate empire that rises all
around.

HUGHES TAPPED STRAIGHT INTO THE TEEN PSYCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a regular writer for ``National Lampoon'' magazine during the
late '70s, John Hughes proved he had a knack for clever wordplay.
As a screenwriter on films such as ``National Lampoon's Class
Reunion, National Lampoon's Vacation'' and ``Mr. Mom'' in the early
'80s, he demonstrated a flair for physical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until he bowed in as a director on the 1984 high
school romp ``Sixteen Candles'' that Hughes discovered his true
calling, as a filmmaker whose creative pipeline tapped directly
into the teen psyche. It's no wonder his name has been batted about
lately as a critical influence on the current influx of
teen-oriented entertainment, from the shores of ``Dawson's Creek''
to the crust of ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' indelible fingerprints are on almost all things teen
today, because he was one of the first guys in Hollywood to take
the adolescent-angst crowd seriously. Would Joss Whedon have
created ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's'' empowered beauty
queen-turned-creature of the night stalker if Molly Ringwald hadn't
first faced the nightmares of geek crushes and visiting
grandparents in ``Sixteen Candles?''
</P>
<P>
   Where would ``She's All That's'' freak-turned-chic Rachel Leigh
Cook be if Ally Sheedy's makeover in 1985's ``The Breakfast Club''
hadn't showed her how it was done? Or how about Ethan Embry's
lovesick loser in ``Can't Hardly Wait'' without 1986's ``Pretty in
Pink'' stalker Jon Cryer? Hughes masterminded every Hollywood
clique cliche, from Anthony Michael Hall's put-upon dork to James
Spader's acid-tongued bully.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason Hughes is so often imitated, albeit weakly in
most cases, is his keen talent for getting inside the minds of
young people without simultaneously insulting them. Hughes made
stars of most of the teen players he came into contact with,
although not all of them survived instant success.
</P>
<P>
   He became associated with a stable of young actors in his early
films, snidely dubbed the Brat Pack by entertainment writers at the
time. Ringwald, Hall, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Robert Downey
Jr., Alan Ruck, John and Joan Cusack and Matthew Broderick all got
their starts with Hughes, and most have said that his approach of
dealing with them as equals was key in making those teen pictures
ring true with their target audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such an incredible time of growth and change,'' Hall
recalled while touring to support a later film. ``John Hughes was
my best friend and mentor. He even wrote `Sixteen Candles' with me
in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall starred in three of Hughes' films, as the painfully nerdy
``Farmer Ted'' mooning over Ringwald in ``Candles;'' as the bookish
Bryan, stuck in weekend detention with four other stereotypes in
``Breakfast Club;'' and as Gary, the high school outcast who helps
create a woman with his pal's computer in ``Weird Science'' (1985).
But like many young Hollywood upstarts, Hall fell victim to battles
with alcohol and drugs _ sadly, a common pattern among Hughes'
early discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the players were crippled by their teen-star images, but
even though 1986's ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' haunted most of the
early part of Broderick's career, the star of Disney's ``Inspector
Gadget'' has nothing but praise for Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still think of me as Ferris. When they see me on the
street, they say, `Hey, Ferris,' '' Broderick has said. ``But it's
John Hughes who is Ferris. It's his creation totally. He's an
original when he directs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked him very much. We kind of caught on to each other,''
Broderick said. ``All this stuff that's just me alone talking to
the camera was shot mostly toward the end, and by that time he
could suggest something and I understood him perfectly and he
understood me, and we could just make things up. We had a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But with teen comedies skewing more and more toward sexual
crudity, Hughes' PG approach of kids paying to see stolen panties
in ``Sixteen Candles'' or even bombshell Kelly LeBrock's
computer-generated Mary Poppins created by two lecherous nerds in
``Weird Science'' seems awfully tame by comparison with the erotic
pastry antics of ``American Pie'' or the sexual missteps of the gay
teen hero of ``Edge of Seventeen.''
</P>
<P>
   But both films seem to be after more of a Hughesian flavor than
an outright homage. ``Seventeen'' director David Moreton said he
used the Hughes films as starting points and then retold them from
a gay perspective. Which is interesting, because despite Hughes'
fascination with geeks and outcasts, ``coming out'' was a topic he
never touched.
</P>
<P>
   But this necessary modernization is merely a reflection of how
young people have changed. After all, in the age of young moms
giving birth at the prom and the massacre at Columbine High,
students have more to deal with than cool clothes and cliques.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Hughes moved on to the slapstick silliness of
``Home Alone,'' and then consistently retooled that formula of
mirthful mayhem for umpteen more films. Kids today are a tougher
nut to crack, and it takes a lot more than locking them in a
``Breakfast Club''-like library to bring their problems to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   It's just nice to know that for a brief time there, those
problems seemed to make sense. .MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit the

PACIFIC VACATION PEACEFUL, PERFECT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, Aug. 19.)  
(yn) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've watched the sun set at Monterey Beach as an otter floated
nearby, slapping abalone shells against a rock for his evening
meal.
</P>
<P>
   We've canoed through a swarm of jellyfish, translucent tentacles
waving against the dark, cool waters of the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   We've fed grizzlies, who waved a sharp-clawed paw at us and
rolled on their backs like teddy bears as we drove along the game
farm path.
</P>
<P>
   And we've been sneezed on by buffalo, who pressed their large
black snouts against the car windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the playing stuff more than the looking stuff,'' said
my 8-year-old, about halfway through our wild west adventure,
growing bored with the long minutes I would spend transfixed by the
beauty of the Pacific coastline.
</P>
<P>
   But what a spectacular coast it is.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in the East, my 36 years have been spent
traveling and living among the Atlantic states ... New York,
Florida, Georgia. The farthest west I ventured was West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   On my first trip to northern California I was smitten. Then I
decided, largely from pictures and the TV series ``Northern
Exposure,'' that Seattle was my dream city, sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   So this summer, my son in tow, we set off to explore the great
Northwest Territory.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the first part of the week with my best friend, who
lives with her husband and two young sons a few blocks from
Monterey Beach. People drive from all over just to watch the sun
settle against the giant, craggy rocks and cypress trees. Deer live
in the cemetery and golf course there, and signs warn you away from
protective does guarding their young.
</P>
<P>
   We visited the old Point Pinos Lighthouse, flashing its beacon
nightly since 1855. Its most famous resident was the late socialite
Emily Fish, one of the first women lighthouse keepers. She kept a
duster by the front door to clean the shoes of visiting boys and
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Adam loved walking through the yuppified fishing village at
night, peering in the windows of movie producers and Silicon Valley
software developers. Every inch of lawn space was adorned with
perfect grass, cultivated flowers and trimmed trees holding
hummingbird feeders and wind chimes.
</P>
<P>
   We flew to Seattle for the next leg of our journey, taking a
shuttle out onto the peninsula to Port Angeles, a breathtakingly
picturesque town tucked between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the
Olympic Mountains. My mother-in-law moved here a year ago for her
own cross-country adventure, so we were able to settle in to her
guest room as home base.
</P>
<P>
   From the picture window that stretches across her living room,
you can watch the ferry take tourists back and forth to Victoria,
B.C., less than 17 miles away as the seagull flies. The first
morning, off a winding seaside bike path, we picked enough
blackberries for a deep-dish pie. Turn away from the strait and you
see Mt. Olympus's snow-covered peak.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon we visited the Olympic Game Farm in Sequim, the
next town over. I can't imagine that loaves of day-old bread thrown
out car windows by giggling children is the best diet for llamas,
peacocks and grizzly bears, but both sides seemed to really enjoy
the interaction. As we entered the buffalo field, two huge beasts
sidled up to our tiny Toyota compact, peering in the windows with
their unblinking eyes as if escaped from Jurassic Park.
</P>
<P>
   The day before our flight home to Atlanta, we watched ``Wallace
&AMP; Gromit'' tapes on TV and Adam caught up in his travel journal.
While eating a plum, he discovered his loose tooth was finally
letting go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam, you lost your 8th tooth in Port Angeles,'' said his
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Where better? I thought. Where better.

`BROKEDOWN PALACE': NO POOL AND NO ROOM SERVICE, AMONG OTHER
THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Brokedown Palace,'' Claire Danes embodies an
all-too-believable, contemporary version of ``The Ugly American.''
Her character, Alice Marano, is a spoiled, selfish recent high
school graduate who takes a defiant pride in being impulsive,
dishonest and uncommitted to anything beyond her own instant
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   When she and her best friend, Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale),
decide to go on a short overseas vacation after graduation, Alice
persuades Darlene to lie to her family and say they are visiting
Hawaii when they are really going to Bangkok, a destination
Darlene's family would have vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Thailand, Alice throws herself around with a reckless
curiosity along with an air of outrageous entitlement that, we
learn, has always characterized her behavior. And with just a few
subtle adjustments of her mannerisms, Ms. Danes skillfully
metamorphoses from the beautiful, refined, introspective teen-ager
of ``My So-Called Life'' and other good-girl roles into a rude,
insufferable pain in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangkok, Alice, disgusted with the roach-infested guest house
in which they've been staying, convinces Darlene that they can pass
themselves off as guests in a luxury hotel long enough to steal a
swim in the pool. When a waiter asks them to sign the bill for
their drinks, Alice invents a room number, but the ruse is quickly
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they are about to be thrown out of the hotel, a charming
young Australian who calls himself Nick Parks (Daniel LaPaine) and
claims to be in the computer software business comes to their
rescue and signs their bill. As he squires the pair around Bangkok,
both girls quickly fall under his spell and begin competing for his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   When Darlene announces that Nick has invited them to Hong Kong
for the weekend, Alice, jealous of her friend but reluctant to
admit it, balks, then changes her mind. Just as they are about to
board the plane, the police arrest the two for possessing six kilos
of heroin that have been planted on them.
</P>
<P>
   As their nightmare in a filthy Thai women's prison, nicknamed
the Brokedown Palace, begins, Alice for the first time finds
herself in a position that she can't manipulate, no matter how many
tantrums she throws.
</P>
<P>
   Although the basic premise of the movie is similar to that of
the better, more complex ``Return to Paradise,'' which was set in
Malaysia, ``Brokedown Palace,'' which tells the story of Alice's
redemption from brattiness to something verging on martyrdom, rides
on the steady emotional current of Ms. Danes' fine performance.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in the Philippines (the movie's portrayal of a corrupt
Thai justice system made Thailand off limits as a location), the
movie conveys a pungent sense of cultural dislocation, especially
after the friends have landed in a dank prison where they are
forced to sleep crowded beside the other prisoners on bamboo mats.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film focuses on Alice's and Darlene's efforts to get
a new trial, and ultimately a royal pardon, after they have been
convicted of drug smuggling and sentenced to 30-year prison terms.
As a last resort they turn for help to Hank Greene (Bill Pullman),
a disreputable money-grubbing American expatriate lawyer familiar
with the Thai justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The movie portrays that system as rotten from the top (Lou
Diamond Phillips plays Roy Knox, a sinister high-ranking Thai
diplomat) down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace,'' directed by Jonathan Kaplan from a
screenplay by David Arata, is good enough so that you wish it were
better. Because the character of Darlene never comes into focus,
the central theme of a close friendship put to the ultimate test
isn't as compelling as it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie offers plenty of indications of the harshness
of prison life, it shies from showing the worst horrors. The
crucial early scenes of the pair being wooed and manipulated by the
rakish Australian who, for reasons that aren't clarified until the
end, set them up for the bust are unnecessarily vague and muddled.
</P>
<P>
   But at the very least, ``Brokedown Palace'' offers a disturbing
reminder that being a willfully ignorant ugly American abroad with
an attitude could be a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>

`DETROIT ROCK CITY': KISS MEMBERS' SALUTE TO THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(dal) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently there are no bigger Kiss fans than the band members
themselves, who are helpfully involved in a feature-length
valentine to their enduring greatness. ``Detroit Rock City'' is a
film in which teen-age Kiss worshipers prove that they will do
anything, preferably anything nasty, to see the band they love. The
idea might have promise if it had even a trace of self-mockery, but
no such luck. Sample hagiographic dialogue: ``You know, in 1973
Kiss was opening for Blue Oyster Cult. One year later, Blue Oyster
Cult was opening for Kiss!''
</P>
<P>
   The story is cloned like Dolly from assorted coming-of-age films
in which teen-age boys are a) horny, b) rebellious and c) changed
by some shared experience of great symbolic meaning. According to
Carl V. Dupre's screenplay, the four main characters' desire to see
Kiss play a 1978 concert at Detroit's Cobo Hall has just that type
of resonance. So Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip (James De Bello),
Hawk (Edward Furlong) and Jam (Sam Huntington) give up slacking
just long enough to make a pilgrimage from Cleveland. Will they be
able to score coveted Kiss tickets? That's the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The four fans demonstrate that old Kiss spirit by stealing a car
from one of their mothers, smoking dope and then stopping to beat
up a group of disco fans just for the fun of it. ``Just because
she's a female gynecologist doesn't mean she's a lesbian,'' one boy
remarks about the crusading, Kiss-hating Christian mother (Lin
Shaye) whose car it was, illustrating the film's enlightened views
of both women and religion. (A sex scene in a lecherous priest's
confessional does this almost as well.)
</P>
<P>
   There are also a nun (Colleen Williams) called Sister Gonorrhea,
a scene involving a cheerleader on a toilet and an aging-Playmate
come-on from Shannon Tweed at a male strip club filled with
obnoxious predatory women. The high point of that last sequence is
the sight of Furlong's Hawk vomiting prodigiously into a pitcher.
Not since the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles came to town has New
Line shown such class.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the worst films in recent years already to his
credit (``The Dark Backward,'' the 1991 movie in which Judd Nelson
grew a third arm between his shoulder blades), the director Adam
Rifkin aims for two with this weary promotional comedy. The cast,
which also includes Natasha Lyonne as a disco bimbo, never has much
chance to shine. And the main attraction is kept all too
understandably under wraps. Though Kiss members get prominent
acting credits (and the band's Gene Simmons is a producer), they're
in the film for only a couple of heavily edited minutes onstage.
They don't dare appear in close-up or without the war paint.

`HEAD ON': TROUBLES OF A GAY GREEK SON IN AUSTRALIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at and of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Head On,'' an overheated domestic drama about the frustrations
of a closeted gay Greek-Australian who lives with his straitlaced
immigrant family, strains so desperately for a tragic kitchen-sink
realism that in several crucial scenes the movie loses its grip and
escalates into strident melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   The themes that the film explores are certainly worth serious
scrutiny. The struggle of a Greek family to adapt to a foreign
culture while holding on to its Old World traditions and a gay
son's difficulties in coming out to a father who abhors
homosexuality are compelling subjects that deserve re-evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But as she did in her short movie ``Only the Brave,'' Ana
Kokkinos, who is making her feature debut with ``Head On,'' does
not know when to say when. The further she pushes her characters to
the brink, the more they seem like figures in a shrill, dated soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head On'' has a partial saving grace in the magnetic central
performance of Alex Dimitriades as the troubled son, Ari. Ari, who
is financially dependent on his parents, shares close quarters with
a proud family who immigrated to Australia when he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   The film's more vibrant scenes show this robust clan and their
Greek-Australian friends dining, dancing, making music and
partying.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitriades' Ari radiates a fiery intensity and bravado, and his
sheer charisma almost carries him through scenes that would make a
less committed actor look foolish. Those scenes include Ari's
anonymous sexual encounters with men in doorways and alleys.
</P>
<P>
   These couplings, as well as a more serious lovemaking session
with a friend who also turns out to be gay and closeted, are staged
as tormented wrestling matches left over from some 1950s nightmare
about gay culture.
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, Ari and a friend who is a drag queen are
arrested on their way to a bar and taken to police headquarters,
where they are brutally harassed. The scene, which could have been
devastating, collapses under the melodramatic tonnage it is forced
to bear.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's nastiest moment, Ari, while driving with friends
through an Asian neighborhood, impulsively hurls ethnic abuse out
the car window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head On'' seems hopelessly divided against itself. On one hand
it glamorizes Ari as a heroic sexual rebel. On the other it
portrays him as a lazy, violent, self-hating bigot headed for
imminent self-destruction. The images don't jibe.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   `HEAD ON' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New
Films series. Above are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on April 7. The film opens
Friday in Manhattan.

 &HT;    PRESIDENCY TAKES ITS TOLL, BUT CLINTON MAY RESIST ITS STRESSES
 &HT;    1060&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will be 53 years old on Thursday
_ or maybe 89, depending on how you figure it.
</P>
<P>
   According to a popular method for calculating one's ``real
age,'' the president has experienced in the last year alone enough
major stressful events to shorten his life expectancy by 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the four years that being a U.S. president already
statistically reduces a life span, and Clinton is about 89 in
``real age.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Clinton does not look 89, and some aging experts
suspect that the ``comeback kid,'' as he likes to call himself, has
an unusual resiliency that somehow allows him to sidestep the
wearing effects of stress and overwork.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of photographs taken in the past few weeks with
those shot when Clinton had just taken office in 1993 suggest a man
who has conceded very little to time.
</P>
<P>
   But looks can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't judge the effects of aging by appearance,'' warned
Paul T. Costa, chief of the National Institute on Aging's
Laboratory on Personality and Cognition in Baltimore. And even if
there were a link between the mechanisms of aging and physical
appearance, judging from photographs is even less reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good hairdo, a nice smile, losing some weight and being
photographed out in the Rose Garden on a happy occasion yesterday
might make him look better than he looked in '92,'' Costa added.
</P>
<P>
   What matters is what's happening inside a person's body, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts studying differences in the way people respond to time
have concluded that living conditions are more important than
genetic differences, typically accounting for 70 percent of how
fast we ``age.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the effects that so-called ``stress hormones''
have on the human machine have intrigued researchers.
</P>
<P>
   These substances are released by the adrenal cortex, a pair of
small glands perched on top of the kidneys, in response to stress.
Ordinarily, they jump-start various physical and metabolic
processes that prepare an animal or human being for a ``fight or
flight'' situation. Blood pressure goes up, sugar floods the
circulatory system, and heart rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences also cause a lot of wear and tear on the body,
and over time start to take a toll on such functions as memory,
immune response and the ability to deal with damaging free radical
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, Clinton would appear to have waded
through a sea of stress hormones.
</P>
<P>
   But what's important is not the event that causes the stress,
but the way an individual perceives the event. There, the 30
percent effect of genetics may play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people with an average personality would react to certain
stressors _ situations where there's a lot at stake and the outcome
is uncertain _ and perceive them as a threat,'' Costa said. ``Blood
pressure might go up and heart rate might go up in response to
stress hormones. But other people might perceive an event as a
challenge: 'Oh boy, here's my chance.' ``
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Peter Bourne, an Atlanta researcher, studied men
under what appeared to be extreme stress in the Vietnam War and
wrote a book entitled, ``Men, Stress and Vietnam.'' Bourne found
that Army Special Forces troops and medics who routinely faced
severe life-threatening conditions appeared to be remarkably
stress-free, both in their behavior and the level of secreted
stress hormones measured in urine samples.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response to the stress of being president may be
similar, said Costa.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Roizen, a doctor at the University of Chicago school of
medicine, has identified nearly 200 lifestyle factors _ ranging
from whether you floss regularly to whether you have an active sex
life _ that have a statistical bearing on how long people live. He
described them in his book, ``Real Age: Are You as Young as You Can
Be?''
</P>
<P>
   Roizen, who says he and a team of fellow researchers reviewed
more than 25,000 medical studies for the book, and his Web site
(http://www.realage.com), identified a handful of devastating
personal experiences that can knock decades off one's statistical
life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   These include being the defendant in a targetable lawsuit,
losing a loved one, having one's job jeopardized, having a marriage
fail, and being forced to move to a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the state of the president's marriage, which he has
acknowledged suffered because of disclosures of his relationship
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, the president has
experienced up to three of these major stressors in the last year:
his impeachment, the Paula Jones lawsuit and marriage failure.
</P>
<P>
   Roizen's list does not include presiding over a war or being the
target of a prolonged investigation by an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But statistically, experiencing three of these seismic personal
events in a single year can take 32 years off one's life
expectancy, Roizen said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the close support of good friends or active
involvement in a religious community or a social group can offset
the stress of such experiences by up to 30 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's happening inside, to his arteries or his
immune system,'' Roizen said, ``but I have been amazed at how he
has handled all of these things. It may be that someone like
President Clinton, who's had a consuming interest in politics most
of his life can get stress relief from high public opinion ratings
in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Roizen said he compared the life expectancies of former
presidents at the time they took office with their ultimate
longevity, and the results showed that being president cost them an
average of four years of life.
</P>
<P>
   He did not include Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley or
Kennedy, the four assassinated presidents, but did include the
unfortunate William Henry Harrison, who died of pneumonia only
about a month after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   The stress of the nation's highest office has made itself
apparent in some recent presidents, especially Presidents Lyndon
Johnson and Richard Nixon, who appeared to have aged dramatically
during their terms in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But with the support of Americans who kept his job approval
ratings above 60 percent through most of his impeachment ordeal,
Clinton may not have felt his own pain.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is able to shrug off stress, he may be like the
ancestors of a population of opossums that scurry around the salt
marshes and sand dunes of Georgia's Sapelo Island.
</P>
<P>
   Sapelo opossums live to be much older than their mainland
cousins, says Steven Austad, a University of Idaho zoologist.
Austad was studying opossums in South America when he became
interested in their relatively short life spans _ about two years,
on average.
</P>
<P>
   He decided that opossums don't live long because they are the
subject of heavy predation by other animals, such as foxes and
wildcats. This does not mean that their average life span is
shorter because some are killed by predators; opossums in captivity
live only about 24 to 30 months, Austad said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he reasoned that if an opossum faces a high probability
of being killed by a predator, nature is not going to invest a lot
in causing it to have a long life. Put another way, the chances
that an individual with a special ability to withstand the daily
wear and tear of being an opossum will pass that trait on to its
descendants are greatly reduced by the likelihood of its being
something else's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Austad studied Sapelo opossums because they are not attacked by
predators.
</P>
<P>
   For the 4,600 years since Sapelo separated from the mainland,
opossums on the island have faced virtually no predation. In those
years, the creatures have gradually evolved longer life spans.
</P>
<P>
   If a Sapelo opossum and a mainland opossum are raised side by
side in adjacent pens, the mainland animal will likely die of old
age at about 2 years old, but his Sapelo cousin will likely live to
be 3 years old, Austad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same thing will happen to human beings,'' he said.
``In a thousand years or so, our aging processes will have slowed
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mean longer lives, not as a result of victory over
infectious disease or better and cleaner water supplies, but
because nature will see a safer human environment as a good
investment in longer life.

 &HT;    Trip to Baker Street an enjoyable holiday for lovers of mystery
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The face was not so much Basil Rathbone's as William Gillette's,
angular with a lantern jaw and deep-set eyes framing a hawk's bill
nose, and the famous deerstalker cap and meerschaum pipe belonged
to a period that passed with the Edwardians. In his Inverness cape,
his razor-thin figure cut through the fog of a gas-lit London as
cleanly as his analytic mind dissected the evidence of a crime. His
fellow lodger at 221B Baker Street, a certain Dr. Watson, leaned
more to the corpulent side and was a bit of a bungler, but a true
and valiant friend. Together, they became two of popular fiction's
natural complements, the penetrating intelligence of the one
playing off the plodding earnestness of the
</P>
<P>
   other.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's read Sherlock Holmes, of course, but who's read him
lately? Truth be told, I'd never read him at all, another
billboard-size gap in my learning. Summers _ especially summers
like this one, punctuated with evidence anew each week of a society
pathologically enamored of its guns _ are for busman's holidays.
With the family away, high on a mountaintop in North Carolina, my
unlikely escape was to a paperback volume of Arthur Conan Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, I was surprised to learn, had nothing much in mind when
he created the most famous fictional detective in the language. At
the time, he was a not very successful physician who had been
jotting down ideas for a story about a violin collector named
Sherrinford Holmes and his friend Ormand Sacker. Sherrinford became
Sherlock and Sacker became Dr. Watson. It worked so well that Doyle
soon found he couldn't separate himself from his creation. He
thought himself a serious writer with higher ambitions, and
complained that his Holmes stories ``take my mind away from better
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever those might have been, his trifling tales take our
minds away from the cares and obligations of a more troubled time.
If that's escape reading, give us more of it. And one of the
delights of escaping to Doyle is discovering that he was a better
writer than we ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Master of detection by deduction
</P>
<P>
   Mention Doyle's name and we think of a spectral hound on the
Baskerville moors. Or of Rathbone feasting on cold pheasant in his
drawing room and puzzling together the pieces of a crime by
noticing the extent of wear on a patch of clothing. Rathbone will
always be the cinematic Holmes, but the original, played by William
Gillette, took Doyle's breath away, so true was the likeness in his
mind's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Symons, in ``Conan Doyle: Portrait of an Artist,'' tells
us it was the Strand magazine's publishing of six stories in
1890-91 that made Sherlock Holmes, master of detection by
deduction, a legend. On both sides of the Atlantic, Sherlock Holmes
clubs sprouted. The Strand asked for six more and Doyle reluctantly
obliged. But success soon reached a point where Doyle tried to kill
his man off. Determined to move on to higher things, he had him
cast over the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland, locked in struggle
with the nefarious Professor Moriarty. A Holmes story was never
brought to a more marrow-chilling end. Within days 20,000 readers
wore black arm bands and veils; marching readers carried signs
proclaiming, ``Let's Bring Holmes Back.''
</P>
<P>
   Which Doyle did eight years later in ``The Hound of the
Baskervilles,'' his best-known story and one dated before Holmes'
fatal accident. And then, in ``The Adventure of the Empty House,''
Doyle brought him back to life. If you don't know how he did so, I
leave it to you to find out (``It was not a pleasant business,
Watson.'').
</P>
<P>
   Not having read Holmes, or not enough to speak of, I knew little
about him. It was rather a shock to learn the man had a drug
problem. Athletes and rock stars are one thing, but this was
Sherlock Holmes, pillar of probity. In the quiet of his study he
applied the needle for what he called brain work. Cocaine was sold
over the counter in turn-of-the-century England, and although the
medical establishment counseled caution, Dr. Watson implored his
friend to cease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Watson the perfect bumbling foil
</P>
<P>
   More surprising still was realizing that the enjoyment in
Doyle's stories is not in their denouements _ they are, if
anything, naively simple _ but in the characters: Holmes the
blue-nosed, omniscient amateur and Watson his bungling Boswell. If
there is a mop bucket around, depend on Watson to stick his foot in
it, as the mystery writer Loren Estleman writes in his splendid
introduction to the two-volume Bantam edition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Holmes would be as lost without Watson as Travis McGee would
be without Meyer or Hercule Poirot without Capt. Hastings. Not only
was Watson the filter between the reader and Holmes' cold-eyed
reasoning, he was the comic foil necessary for its display. The
crimson thread of murder is unraveled with a dilettante's leisure _
is a drop of mortal blood spilled anywhere in a Holmes story? _ and
once wrongs are righted, Holmes and his clumsy but indispensable
collaborator are hailing a hansom cab in the night. They have no
sooner hailed one than we are in repose. Such have been the rewards
of a good mystery ever since.

 &HT;    McNally's back _ and some are crying foul
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Atlanta reader Linda Berg heard there was a new Lawrence
Sanders novel being published, she was surprised _ especially since
the author died last year. But at the bookstore there were huge
stacks of ``McNally's Dilemma'' (Putnam, $24.95) with the author's
name in large type on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   She checked the copyright page, though, where it's noted in very
small print that the estate of Lawrence Sanders had commissioned
Vincent Lardo to write the book. The late author of seven Archy
McNally crime novels had nothing to do with this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This made me angry because I feel that the estate is
capitalizing on the Sanders name to sell books,'' Berg says.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, the Sanders estate does want to continue publishing
the McNally books, explains Putnam publicity director Marilyn
Ducksworth, but she insists no deception was intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did clearly state that the book was written by Vincent
Lardo.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly perhaps, but not nearly prominently enough. Nowhere on
the jacket is Vincent Lardo's name mentioned, and unsuspecting
readers such as Berg would have to have keen eyesight to read the
small print.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing illegal about this practice. In fact,
publishers have been issuing new works under dead authors' names
for years. Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, who died in 1986,
continues to mysteriously spew out books from the grave, and
ghost-written V.C. Andrews novels are still published 13 years
after the author's death.
</P>
<P>
   Other publishers are more upfront about capitalizing on dead
authors' reputations. When Ian Fleming died, his estate hired John
Gardner to continue the legacy of James Bond. But with these 007
novels, Gardner's name was prominently displayed on the cover _
unlike the Putnam edition of ``McNally's Dilemma.'' And that
omission is what annoys Berg and other readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the jacket had said something like `based on the characters
created by Lawrence Sanders' or `based on the works of Lawrence
Sanders' or `based on the notes of Lawrence Sanders,' it would be
different,'' Berg says. ``I do not think this marketing is being
fair to readers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reader's companion: Not many popular novelists find it
necessary to publish a study guide to their work, but Diana
Gabaldon is an exception. With 3 million copies of her
``Outlander'' time-travel series in print, the former Arizona
scientist has become a publishing phenomenon. She gets 400,000 hits
a day on her Web site (www.cco.caltech.edu
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)gatti/gabaldon/gabaldon.html) and hundreds of letters
each week from readers waiting for the next book about Claire
Randall, a World War II nurse who is reunited in the 18th century
with her Scottish lover, Jamie Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth book in the series is in the works, Gabaldon says;
meanwhile, she has published ``The Outlandish Companion: In Which
Much Is Revealed Regarding Claire and Jamie Fraser, Their Lives and
Times, Antecedents, Adventures, Companions and Progeny, With
Learned Commentary (and Many Footnotes) by Their Humble Creator''
(Delacorte Press, $24.95). The 577-page book offers a
behind-the-scenes look at the novels as well as a wealth of trivia.
It even includes a horoscope chart for the main characters, along
with their favorite recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the news: Mississippi author Jill Conner Browne's humorous
book ``The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love'' (Crown, $12
paperback), has generated the kind of cult following that made
Rebecca Wells' ``Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' a best seller.
Since publication in March, Browne's collection of wit and wisdom
about outlandish Southern belles has sold 60,000 copies. ...
Nashville nurse Jeanne Ray, mother of novelist Anne Patchett (``The
Magician's Assistant''), recently signed a six-figure deal with
Harmony Books for her first novel, ``Romeo and Julie.'' Shortly
thereafter, Barbra Streisand bought the movie rights. Ray's story,
a twist on Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' is about an elderly
couple from two rival families in Boston who fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Troublesome writers: When authors go on book tours, their
publishers usually arrange for an escort to greet them in each city
and handle the transportation from bookstores to media outlets to
hotels. Apparently not all authors are pleasant traveling
companions. Calvin Trillin, in an essay for the September issue of
Brill's Content magazine, recalls the days when escorts would give
a Golden Dartboard Award for the most difficult author. ``Martha
Stewart won only once,'' Trillin says. ``Jeffrey Archer won only
once. Although there was once talk of giving the late Lewis
Grizzard a lifetime achievement award, nobody else actually won
more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to the authors, however, Trillin says book tours can
bring out the worst in the most mild-mannered scribe. Arriving at
bookstores that have no copies of the author's book is particularly
annoying, he says, as is appearing on a television show with a
fellow author who has sold 3 million copies of a book titled ``How
to Take Out Your Appendix and Find the Real You.''

 &HT;    Longtime political writer Elizabeth Drew explores the assault on
a political system
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the August heat of 1997, U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.)
presided over a series of hearings examining the seamy underbelly
of the nation's campaign fund-raising system and the desperate
measures both political parties took to raise money during the 1996
presidential election. Perched in the front row of a 40-foot-long
government-issue media table that summer was Elizabeth Drew, noted
chronicler of Washington's slippery ways.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the hearings _ billed as the biggest thing since
Watergate _ began to fizzle and the field of once-crammed tables in
the Hart Office Building emptied out, Drew faithfully attended the
daily sessions. She assiduously recorded what was happening onstage
as well as off.
</P>
<P>
   And it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Drew brings those hearings to life in ``The Corruption of
American Politics: What Went Wrong and Why.'' The former New Yorker
correspondent and author of 11 books (``Whatever It Takes: The Real
Struggle for Political Power in America,'' ``On the Edge: The
Clinton Presidency'') uses the hearings to describe the debasement
of American politics since Watergate. The result is an insightful
and compelling story about the changing culture in Washington. Few
handle the pen as well as Drew; even fewer can read the political
tea leaves as adroitly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Washington has come a long way since that bungled
burglary at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the
Watergate 27 years ago. Unfortunately, Drew writes, it has moved in
the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   Money, not statesmanship, is the driving force in today's
Washington. Money, not public policy, is what politicians appear to
be concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of money dominates Washington as never before,''
Drew writes. ``Money now rivals or even exceeds power as the
pre-eminent goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington of President Nixon's era was far more innocent
than the Washington that tried to remove President Clinton from
office last winter. Partisanship and zealotry have become a way of
life. The political boundaries that were once so respected by the
parties have evaporated, giving way to an ``anything goes''
culture, Drew writes.
</P>
<P>
   The loser, in Drew's opinion, is clearly the American people,
whose faith in Washington is at a ``dangerously low level.''
</P>
<P>
   The thirst for money has affected and perverted almost every
aspect of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects the issues raised and their outcome; it has changed
employment patterns in Washington; it has transformed politics and
it has subverted values,'' Drew writes. ``It has led good people to
do things that are morally questionable, if not reprehensible. It
has cut a deep gash, if not inflicted a mortal wound, in the
concept of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   But Drew does more than deliver an assault on the system. She
meticulously describes how this has happened and offers suggestions
about what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   One political consultant seemed to sum it up pretty well when he
told Drew, ``We've always had lunkheads, and we had exotica _ but
they were talented. They used to have ideas. Now you have a whole
set of politicians whose guiding idea is `Where's my pollster?'''
</P>
<P>
   Drew quotes an array of heavyweight Republicans and Democrats in
Washington, evenhandedly pointing out that this is a bipartisan
problem. Looking beyond her blistering analysis of the money game,
Drew takes her readers on a tour of Capitol Hill, accurately and
artfully showing how campaign finance reform was shot down by
special interest groups and the leaders of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Drew describes in graphic detail how the proverbial political
sausage is made. And it's not a pretty sight. She describes how the
Gingrich School of Government ushered in a decidedly more partisan
way of doing business, a sort of ``my way or else'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fair amount of the cultural change in the Congress in recent
years can be attributed to Newt Gingrich,'' Drew writes. ``When
Gingrich was a backbencher, he thought nothing of taking on, very
combatively, not only the opposition leaders, but his own as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best part of Drew's book is her hopeful conclusion
that the only way there will be change is if voters seek it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is to mobilize behind an alternative,'' she
concludes, ``get out there and vote and persuade others to vote.''

   ATLANTA _ Not to minimize the accomplishments of the other eight
Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients honored this week, but it
was fitting that President Clinton just happened to make a separate
presentation in Atlanta to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. Why? Because
the man and the woman from Plains deserve to be singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a happy coincidence. Clinton was scheduled to be here
Monday anyway to address the American Bar Association convention.
So it worked out nicely to confer the medals on the former
president and his first lady at the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   It has become something of a cliche to refer to Carter as the
greatest ex-president in the nation's history, a tribute to
countless good works he has done since he was defeated for
re-election nearly two decades ago. But Clinton, in his remarks,
noted thoughtfully that the ``greatest ex-president'' label does
Carter an injustice because everything he has done since leaving
the White House is an extension of priorities that characterized
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Did we say countless good works? In his medal citation, Clinton
attached some impressive numbers to Carter's record of service to
humanity: The 115 countries Carter has visited either on missions
to promote peace and human rights or to combat disease and hunger.
The more than 20 foreign elections he has monitored to nurture
nascent democracies. The millions of Africans spared the scourges
of river blindness and Guinea worm disease thanks to the work of
his center. The dozens of political prisoners released because of
his personal intervention. The list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter, too, has earned the admiration of the nation for
carrying through on causes that were dear to her even before her
years in the White House and the Georgia Governor's Mansion,
especially her work to improve treatment of mental illnesses and to
make child immunizations widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Carter acknowledged Monday that he and Rosalynn left the White
House somewhat deflated after his election defeat in 1980, but they
managed to build new lives full of pleasure, adventure and
challenge. That should be an instructive example for a youngish
ex-president-to-be who is concerned about his own place in history.

`CHASING MONARCHS': HOW TRACKING BUTTERFLIES CAN BECOME A
MARATHON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The annual migration of monarch butterflies from their summer
breeding grounds in the northern United States and Canada to their
winter retreats in Mexico and southern California is one of
nature's more remarkable phenomena: each year these fragile black
and orange creatures brave high winds, killing cold snaps and the
deadly threat of pesticides to fly as much as 2,500 miles south. By
gliding on thermal air currents and flapping their small wings,
these ``brightly fluttering bits of life,'' as Rachel Carson once
called them, cross mountain ranges, highways, deserts and the
habitations of millions of people to reach their temperate winter
roosts. Fueled by flower nectar, they average a daunting 40 to 100
miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Chasing Monarchs,'' the naturalist Robert
Michael Pyle chronicles his efforts to follow the monarchs on their
winter migration by tracking them on the ground in a battered old
Honda Civic. The book makes an incongruous companion piece to his
1995 book, ``Where Bigfoot Walks,'' which chronicled his pursuit of
a creature that seems like the very antithesis of the butterfly:
the big, clumping and probably mythological beast known as Bigfoot.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Chasing Monarchs'' has its longueurs _ windy,
repetitious descriptions of vegetation and geologic formations that
are of little interest to the lay reader and personal reminiscences
that feel perfunctory and flat _ the author's evident passion for
and understanding of butterflies invest his narrative with energy
and interest. By far the most absorbing portions of this book deal
with Pyle's interaction with the monarchs (tagging and tracking
them and watching them feed and navigate) and his musings on their
history and their habits.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what Pyle has to say will be familiar to even the most
casual butterfly aficionado: that the species' host plant is the
milkweed and that the bitterness of milkweed milk makes monarch
larvae and adults unpalatable to most birds. He also tells us,
however, that a few species of birds have learned how to consume
monarchs by picking out the tasty, nutritious bits and leaving the
rest behind.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle observes that monarchs have one of the least ceremonial,
most abrupt courtships of any butterfly species: ``males mate as
often as they are able, 10 and sometimes 20 times,'' he writes, and
``females have even, rarely, been known to burst from too many
spermatophores.'' The creatures have brains the size of poppy seeds
but see remarkably well through compound eyes: their field of
vision is much broader than that of humans, taking in over 300
degrees of the world around them, and their color vision appears to
be wider, too.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ability of monarchs to travel such long distances, it
seems to depend largely on their adaptive ability to glide:
According to the scholar David Gibo of Toronto, monarchs can glide
for more than a thousand hours on a 140-milligram reserve of fat
but for only 44 hours if they cruise and flap.
</P>
<P>
   Just how do such tiny creatures navigate such vast distances in
their yearly travels? Pyle cites recent research showing that
monarchs have a ``refined sun compass'' that enables them to ``not
only orient toward the sun but also compensate for time by shifting
their direction relative to the changing azimuth of the sun as it
appears to cross the sky.'' In addition, he suggests, they often
use rivers and canyons as flight corridors and may even be able to
key their flight plans to the earth's magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle's own plan to follow the monarchs' travels turns out to be
a laborious, almost comical project. His strategy is to follow a
single butterfly as far as he can, note its flight path and head
off in that direction until he finds another monarch, and can
reorient himself and continue on. This modus operandi, of course,
not only entails endless detours due to bad roads, no roads and
impassable stretches of terrain, but also means days of waiting and
wandering during which no monarchs can be found. Eventually,
however, it leads Pyle from Washington state, through Idaho, Utah
and Arizona to the Mexican border. For some inexplicable reason,
Pyle chooses not to follow the butterflies down to their wintering
grounds in Michoacan but instead settles for describing a previous
visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
   His monarch sightings along the way, Pyle argues, undermine the
popular belief that ``all the monarchs west of the Rockies' crest
migrate to California, only those east of the Rockies go to Mexico,
and the two don't mix.'' ``The myth may very well be true on the
whole,'' he writes. ``Maybe most western monarchs flow to and from
the west coast. But not all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pyle wants to believe ``that there was a little more of
something like freedom'' built into a monarch's system ``than the
rigid lines drawn on migration maps seem to allow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing so refined as freedom the way we think of it, when we
imagine ourselves able to will where we go and what we do,'' he
adds. ``Nothing as derived as `decision.' But the freedom,
nonetheless, to respond to the vagaries and gifts of the days with
every adaptive tool and option that kindly evolution has
provided.''

`SWEETWATER': PLAYED WOODSTOCK? ANYBODY REMEMBER?

   Say what you will about Oliver Stone's film ``The Doors.'' Val
Kilmer, playing the Doors' lead singer and lizard-king sex symbol,
got inside Jim Morrison's head and, equally important, his body. So
every scene made it gloriously clear just what was so great about
being young in the 1960s: the self-satisfied innocence, the gleeful
flirtation with danger, the joy of shocking the easily shocked.
</P>
<P>
   When most young actors are sent to wardrobe for a film set in
the '60s, they come out looking like children playing dress up.
Sadly this is the case in ``Sweetwater: A True Rock Story,'' VH1's
first original film for television, which has its premiere Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Doing films about rock is a great idea on VH1's part: subjects
in the near future include the life of Rick Nelson and a fictional
Paul McCartney visit to John Lennon _ but so far, not so good.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of this true story is very crisis-of-the-week. And
no one in ``Sweetwater'' comes remotely close to convincing viewers
that when the '60s and Woodstock and the social revolution came
down, they were really there. Oddly, that includes Michelle
Phillips, who was. (For the classic-rock-impaired: She was
one-fourth of the Mamas and the Papas, before whom there was no
California dreaming.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetwater'' is about the band of the same name, which
apparently ended up being the opening act at Woodstock. I don't
remember them, but there were a lot of great bands around at the
time. The film opens in the '90s, with Cami Carlson (Kelli
Williams, best known as the sensitive lawyer Lindsay on ABC's
series ``The Practice''), fresh from drug rehab, learning that she
may still have her job at MIX, a music television station, but that
she isn't going to get the primo assignments anymore. She's stuck
with a ``Where are they now?'' documentary about a forgotten '60s
group: Sweetwater. Glumly she starts her research by visiting one
of the band's original members, Alex (Frederic Forrest), and the
flashbacks begin.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1967 _ didn't everything? _ in Los Angeles when Alex
(now played by Kurt Max Runte) and his bandmate Fred (Robert
Moloney) met Nansi Nevins (Amy Jo Johnson of WB's ``Felicity''),
who could really sing. ``She's better than Slick or Joplin, and you
know it,'' Alex says to Fred, who just wishes she were at least out
of high school. By the time she is, they've acquired four more band
members, the group is called Sweetwater, and they're playing at
Griffith Park while happy, stoned flower children sway in the
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   They're discovered by an agent, who proclaims, ``You guys sound
like no one else out there, and this whole different-race thing is
like a publicist's dream, man.'' (Some of the band members are
black.) Sweetwater is soon opening for all the big acts. Alex and
Nansi have a romance. Alex drops her, but they're all still
friends. Janis Joplin (Erin Wright) makes an appearance, but so
does Red Skelton (Ken Roberts), when the band performs on his
television show. Even Nansi's mean mother (Nancy Warren) is proud
of them now. Then Nansi is in a horrible automobile accident and
goes into a coma. When she comes out of it, she has vocal cord
damage and her life goes swiftly downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Nansi does turn up again in the 90's, in the person of Ms.
Phillips, and it's good to know that in real life there's something
of a happy ending. But as drama the story feels stale and
predictable. Adam Ant makes an appearance, too, as the band's
British manager.

`MARCELLO': LATIN LOVER? NO? HOW ABOUT LOVER OF LIFE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When I was young, life seemed long and endless to me,'' the
elderly man says.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Marcello Mastroianni, and his life ended on Dec. 19,
1996, at the age of 72.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a fine and loving memorial that preserves his
charm, his intellect and his splendid body of work. Titled
``Marcello Mastroianni: I Remember,'' this three-hour-and-20-minute
documentary is the work of Anna Maria Tato, the actor's companion
in the final 22 years of his restless, accomplished life.
</P>
<P>
   Part travelogue, part biography, part philosophical rumination
on cinema and the actor's art, this long and loving film renders a
splendid portrait of a man who entered his profession as a child,
honed his craft on the stage and made more than 170 films, among
them such enduring works as Fellini's ``Dolce Vita'' and ``8{,''
Ettore Scola's ``Special Day,'' De Sica's ``Marriage, Italian
Style'' and Nikita Mikhalkov's ``Dark Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   His last, Manoel de Oliviera's ``Voyage to the Beginning of the
World,'' provides ``Marcello'' with its framework.
</P>
<P>
   While making that film, the actor is seen traveling through
Portugal by car or floating leisurely aboard a boat on a river that
is almost a metaphor for life. There and at other locations, the
man who once intended to become an architect reveals an
irrepressibly comic outlook as he reminisces about his career,
recalls the great directors he worked with, disclaims the title
Latin Lover (``a crazy, stupid idea''), tells funny stories about
his family, heaps scorn on television, distances himself from
Method acting (``Why all this suffering and torment?''), discusses
cities and travel and floats some of his unrealized dream projects
(playing an elderly Tarzan).
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcello'' is filled with clips from the actor's movies,
including some hilariously awful ones (``only saints and heroes
never make mistakes''), and from his stage appearances, as well as
newsreel film and video.
</P>
<P>
   Though the documentary refers only fleetingly to some of his
romantic liaisons and his daughter by Catherine Deneuve, it is
never less than a thoroughgoing rendering of Mastroianni's career
and his attitude toward life.
</P>
<P>
   It differs from many documentaries in one important respect.
Unlike films where the camera seems intrusive, where the subjects
seem all too conscious of the filmmakers' presence, here is a
documentary whose subject's natural home is before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   At ease, addressing the lens in an unself-conscious manner,
Mastroianni is the ideal model for a portrait on film, a man who
never lost the best of his childish qualities or his love of
adventure and who was neither afraid to grow old nor too vain to
portray the elderly. But he didn't feel old, he says, because he
never stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like people,'' he says. ``I love life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcello'' whets the appetite to see the remarkable actor's
great films once more. This rich, funny documentary heightens the
realization of how the art of the cinema is impoverished by his
loss.
</P>

 &HT;    MOON LAKE ELECTRIC ASSOCIATION SENTENCED IN EAGLE DEATHS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Utah electric cooperative will pay $100,000 in
penalties for failing to protect eagles and hawks from
electrocution by its power lines at Rangely, Colo., the Justice
Department announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea agreement, Moon Lake Electric Association also will
serve three years' federal probation and retrofit its utility lines
with insulators to prevent future electrocutions.
</P>
<P>
   Large birds, including hawks, eagles and owls, often light on
power poles to hunt or roost. The birds can be electrocuted if
their wing tips brush against unprotected electric lines.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department statement said the case marks the first
time a U.S. district court has allowed a criminal prosecution of a
utility under either of two federal laws, the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   The government had charged that from 1995 to 1997, a total of 17
hawks and eagles were electrocuted after landing on company
electric lines serving an oil field in Rangely.
</P>
<P>
   Moon Lake originally asked that the charges be dismissed,
arguing that the laws were meant to prohibit only illegal hunting
activity, not the ``relatively passive conduct of a company whose
equipment may occasionally electrocute a protected bird,'' the
Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock ruled in January that the
laws could be used to prosecute the company, which in April pleaded
guilty to three violations of each act.
</P>
<P>
   Moon Lake spokesman Russell Cowan said the cooperative ``has and
will continue to cooperate with federal and state agencies, so that
the nation's wildlife populations can coexist with our
responsibilities to supply our consumers with dependable electric
power.''

 &HT;    Buy the bullet: Gun purchase way too easy
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    (This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How easy is it to buy a gun?
</P>
<P>
   As we go from shooting spree to shooting spree in this year of
America under the gun, I've written a lot lately about how it's too
easy. The law places few barriers between a buyer and a weapon, and
it does even less to ensure that he or she knows how to use it
safely and responsibly, I figured.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure I was right, I decided to go out and see how things
work in the marketplace of firepower.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague suggested I try a store in Smyrna called Adventure
Outdoors Inc., ``because that's where the cops buy their guns.''
Their Yellow Pages ad claims ``over 3,000 guns in stock.'' Surely
they had one for me.
</P>
<P>
   The store was busy when I got there. Customers were browsing
past row after row of shotguns and rifles and bending over glass
cases full of handguns. I studied the names: Colt, Walther, Tec 9,
Bersa, Glock ... on and on.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while before a salesman had time to help me. ``I don't
know much about guns,'' I began. ``I want something that's reliable
and simple to use. All these workplace shootings have me worried.
And there are some people at my job who I just don't trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must work for the Post Office,'' he said, laughing.
``That's a joke we tell around here.'' Then he turned serious. ``I
know how you feel. I've had a lot of customers come in and say
they've decided to buy a gun for the same reason.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed me a revolver, a Taurus .357-caliber Magnum. The car
name was appropriate; he sounded like a car salesman trying to
close the deal, explaining the gun had a lifetime warranty and
required little maintenance. And, best of all, it was easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the time comes when you have to use it,'' he said, ``you
don't want to have to think about a lot of things. With this you
can just reach into your desk, pull it out, point and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)Just point and shoot,(END ITAL) like a camera. Only
this one really can steal your soul. He pulled the trigger a few
times, then handed it to me in an obvious invitation to do the
same. The gun had an unexpected heft to it. The click of the hammer
with each trigger pull was resounding, even without bullets. I felt
no sense of power, only dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about being able to get off a lot of shots
quickly,'' I said. ``Wouldn't your automatics over there be better
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns commonly called automatics are really semi-automatics,
firing just one bullet with each trigger pull, he explained. Guns
that are fully automatic fire continuously as long as the trigger
is pulled and held, but they are illegal for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gun is just a tool,'' he said. ``It depends on the job you
want to do. The advantage of the automatic over the revolver is
that you can fire more shots before you have to reload.'' I thought
of the mass shooting survivors who spoke of the eerie silence that
came when the shooter, after exhausting ammunition in his cache of
arms, paused to reload.
</P>
<P>
   I settled on the Taurus. I filled out some paperwork, including
a form that asked if I had a criminal record or had ever been
committed to a mental institution. I could have lied on that form,
but the real test would be the instant background check using the
state's computer files of criminals and others restricted from gun
possession. If I passed that, I could walk out of the store with
any weapon I could afford. I passed.
</P>
<P>
   Total shopping time: about an hour, most of it waiting for a
salesman and explaining to him what I wanted. Total cost for gun,
ammo and $5 fee for background check: $322.12.
</P>
<P>
   So I walked out of the store with my ``tool.'' And no one but me
had any idea what job I planned to do with it.

RENO CALLS FOR U.S. LICENSING OF GUNS IN WAKE OF RECENT SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Accusing Congress of pandering to the National
Rifle Association, Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday urged
the lawmakers to pass tougher gun laws and called for the national
licensing of all firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been four months, since the tragedy in Littleton, Colo.,
... and yet we have not been able to pass gun-safety measures that
even most gun owners support,'' she said at her weekly news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In April, two well-armed students killed 12 classmates and one
teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton and then committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Reno urged Congress to ignore the NRA, the country's most
powerful gun lobby with 2.8 million members, and start passing laws
that polls show are supported by the majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Congress is listening too much to the gun lobby and
not enough to the American people,''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in July found that 79 percent of those surveyed
supported mandatory registration of all firearms, up from 60
percent in 1980. A Pew Research survey that same month reported
that 65 percent of those polled believe gun control is more
important than the right to bear arms, up from 57 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go out to America, the people are saying, ``Why can't
you all do something?'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Clinton administration will push Congress to
include stricter gun laws in a pending juvenile justice bill, which
is expected to be voted on in September.
</P>
<P>
   The measures sought by the administration include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring a three-day waiting period for the purchase of a
gun;
</P>
<P>
   _ Extending the Brady Law, which requires background checks on
prospective gun buyers, to gun shows;
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting gun buyers to one gun purchase a month;
</P>
<P>
   _ Barring violent juveniles from purchasing a gun after they
turn 21 years old;
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring trigger-locks on guns;
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning the importation of all large capacity ammunition
clips, which are used only in assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also said Congress should begin developing a national
system for the licensing of guns and gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is common sense, pure common sense, to ensure that guns are
only in the hands of those who know how to safely and lawfully use
them and have the capacity and the willingness to do so,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno gave no details on how a licensing system would work or who
would administer such a program.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., plans to introduce legislation
next month that would create a system of universal registration
under which prospective gun owners would be required to pass a
safety test and get a license to buy an assault weapon or a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal law, prospective gun buyers are only
required to pass a background check that shows whether they are
felons, stalkers or drug users.
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice Department officials, 95 percent of all
background checks are completed within two hours, allowing the vast
majority of prospective gun buyers to purchase their weapons on the
same day they submit to the background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Since being enacted in 1993, the Brady law has stopped more than
400,000 gun sales, according to Justice Department statistics.
However, the law does not apply to gun shows where used firearms
are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has agreed to extend the law to gun shows, but the
House is still debating the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the shootings at a Jewish community center and the
killing of a postal worker in Los Angeles this week were another
sign that America was developing a ``culture of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford O. Furrow Jr., 37, has been charged with the attempted
murder of five people, including three boys, who were shot and
wounded at the Jewish center, and with the murder of the postal
carrier nearby.

ANTIQUES: DRAGONFLIES SHIMMERING AS JEWELRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dragonfly is a compelling insect. It has 5,000
species, and people, particularly children, have been crazy about
it for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dragonfly lands on something for only a second and then
goes away,'' said Annamarie Sandecki, director of the archives of
Tiffany &AMP; Co., whose designers have often been inspired by the
insect. ``It never sits still. When it alights, it's for a moment,
a heart-stopping second of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sandecki is curator of ``An American Design Legacy:
Highlights from the Tiffany &AMP; Company Archives,'' an exhibition of
70 of the 750 objects in the company's permanent collection,
including some dragonfly designs. The show, which runs through
Sept. 11, is at Tiffany's Fifth Avenue store in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several stunning pieces of jewelry that are not
based on dragonfly designs, including Diana Vreeland's signature
``trophee clip'' of 1941, the show features an Audubon tea set,
circa 1875; a ``Comanche trophy'' silver horse sculpture
commissioned in the 1870s by August Belmont, a father of American
thoroughbred racing, and a Persian-style demitasse set festooned
with real freshwater pearls.
</P>
<P>
   The dragonfly's first starring role was in eighth-century Japan.
According to the Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, which covers the
nation's culture, the dragonfly was believed in mythology to be the
spirit of the rice plant and a harbinger of rich harvests. It was a
symbol of the power of the Yamato court in the eighth century and
was mentioned in later poems set to music.
</P>
<P>
   As a design motif, it appears on Japanese lacquerware, metalwork
and porcelain and in colored woodcuts. And it is one of the insects
most beloved by Japanese children.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany design director John Loring said of the dragonfly, ``The
Japanese think it brings good tidings.''
</P>
<P>
   The dragonfly came to Western art much later, probably in the
1860s, when Japonisme became a craze after trade with Japan opened
up. It was used by English designer Christopher Dresser and his
friends in the Esthetic Movement in the 1860s and 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English and Americans saw the magic of these symbols and
adopted them,'' said Denis Gallion of the Manhattan gallery
Historical Design. He is selling a sterling silver Japonisme
creamer and sugar bowl, with a dragonfly motif, designed by
Dominick &AMP; Haff of New York City in 1881.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sugar bowl portrays a kingfisher swooping over the water
in pursuit of a fish,'' Gallion said. ``The fish is preoccupied
with catching the dragonfly. It represents the life cycle of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Nouveau expert Amy Ogata said, ``In America, the dragonfly
has no particular emblematic meaning.'' It became ubiquitous in the
1890s, she said, ``because it perfectly captured the ephemeral
nature of Art Nouveau.'' She continued, ``The ephemeral quality is
well suited to the turn of the century _ life is short, so one must
be as brilliant and beautiful as one can in the time one has.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry designers were particularly inspired by the dragonfly.
``They like to interpret the translucency of its wings and body,''
Ms. Sandecki said. ``The dragonfly does not appear solid, so a
jeweler can do all kinds of stones.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jewelry in America: 1600-1900'' (Antique Collectors Club,
1995), Martha Gandy Fales wrote: ``The dragonfly was considered
especially beautiful for jewelry. Its long posterior extremity,
outstretched wings and solid body give it particularly valuable
properties for the setting of precious stones.''
</P>
<P>
   In Christie's sale on April 14, titled ``Magnificent Jewels,''
an enamel, diamond and emerald dragonfly brooch by an unnamed
jeweler sold for $18,400; it had been expected to bring $12,000 to
$15,000. The piece had wings ``en tremblant,'' or with springs that
let the wings flutter. The wings were in royal blue and emerald
green plique a jour enamel, a technique that resembles stained
glass and allows light to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   But the dragonflies in the Tiffany exhibition are even more
stunning. One is a brooch with trembling wings of diamonds and
sapphires. It was designed about 1890 by a little-known Tiffany
artist, G. Paulding Farnham. Though he was only in his 20s at the
time, he had already won a special medal for his jewelry at the
Paris Exposition of 1889. Farnham's work will be examined for the
first time in ``Tiffany Jewels,'' by John Loring, to be published
in November by Harry N. Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farnham's dragonfly is designed to be worn at night, in
candlelight,'' Ms. Sandecki said. ``It's a real show stopper, and
it was meant to draw attention to the wearer and itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Its effect is completely different from that of another piece in
the show: a dragonfly created by Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933),
the son of the company's founder. Tiffany began painting at age 12
and was a successful artist long before he invented Tiffany favrile
glass and designed splendid interiors like that of the Veterans
Hall at the 7th Regiment Armory on Park Avenue and 66th Street in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the summer of 1865 at his father's house in
Irvington-on-Hudson, sketching flowers and drawing from nature. He
was also an avid photographer, trying, like Eadweard Muybridge, to
capture the movements of birds and animals in motion. His goal was
to translate his knowlege of nature into organic works of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tiffany dragonfly in the show is like a watercolor sketch
compared to Farnham's oil masterpiece,'' Ms. Sandecki said. ``It's
smaller, much more subtle, and it's meant to be worn during the
day. In some ways, you would have to be much more fashion-forward
to wear it. It speaks more to an intellectual esthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece is very similar to a circa 1904 hair ornament in last
summer's show ``Louis Comfort Tiffany at the Metropolitan Museum.''
That piece depicted two dragonflies with truly gossamer wings
alighting on two dandelion puff balls. Their tails are covered with
blue opals, their heads with pink opals and demantoid garnets. The
wings are metal filigree made with an alloy or iridium and
platinum. The dandelion puffs are fading, and the seeds are about
to blow away.
</P>
<P>
   Dragonflies also appealed to Tiffany's French rival, Rene
Lalique. Several pieces of Lalique jewelry will be seen at the Met
as part of ``Only the Best: Masterpieces of the Calouste Gulbenkian
Museum, Lisbon,'' which opens on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was founded by Gulbenkian, an Armenian from Istanbul
who amassed a fortune in oil _ his nickname was Five Percent _ and
assembled a first-rate collection of pictures and objets d'art. He
was close to Lalique for 50 years and commissioned several pieces
of jewelry that are part of the show, along with his detailed
original drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The love affair with the dragonfly never ends.

`BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE': A COMIC RHAPSODY TO ROMANTIC LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be more delicious than chocolate? Why sex, of course,
preferably combined with dreamy romantic love. And in Anne
Wheeler's giddy, occasionally dopey but extremely good-hearted
comedy ``Better Than Chocolate,'' that combination comes in more
flavors than Baskin-Robbins ice cream, with an array of mechanical
accessories thrown in to provide extra pleasure for everyone, even
those without partners.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't so deliriously frisky, the movie, which follows
the erotic adventures of a group of Canadian women and one young
man in a bohemian town in British Columbia, might have had the
haranguing tone of a tract preaching sexual tolerance and
diversity. But the movie gushes with so much romantic optimism and
good humor that it has the effervescence of an engaging musical
comedy in which girl meets girl, girl loses girl and girl gets girl
back, multiplied by three.
</P>
<P>
   The main character, Maggie (Karyn Dwyer), is an attractive
19-year-old college dropout who holds jobs as a clerk in a women's
bookstore and a dancer in a lesbian bar that is the movie's social
center. Early in the movie, Maggie falls in love at first sight
with Kim (Christina Cox), a sleek, penniless street artist and body
painter who is drifting around the West Coast in her van.
</P>
<P>
   Having met her true love, Kim decides to stay with Maggie for a
while in her subleased apartment. No sooner has she settled in than
Maggie's mother, Lila (Wendy Crewson), telephones from back East to
announce she's getting divorced and coming for a visit along with
Maggie's teen-age brother, Paul (Kevin Mundy). Since Maggie hasn't
told her mother she's gay this presents problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Judy (Peter Outerbridge), a gentle, transgendered
lesbian nightclub singer, pines for Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald),
the bookstore's shy, owlish owner. In one of several cabaret songs
that punctuate the film, Judy delivers an anthem in which she
proclaims that she is not a drag queen and makes a forceful
distinction between people like her and gay men who dress up as
women.
</P>
<P>
   Once Lila and Paul arrive, Maggie tries absurdly to conceal the
truth about her relationship with Kim. Her adamant refusal to come
out to her mother seriously threatens her new relationship. Lila,
who functions as the movie's likable but clueless square, finds her
own sexual salvation in a box of sex toys she discovers under her
daughter's bed. Meanwhile, Paul is pursued by Maggie's bisexual
coworker, Carla (Marya Delver).
</P>
<P>
   If now and then ``Better Than Chocolate'' tries to generate some
serious drama, its heart just isn't in it. In one subplot the life
of the bookstore is threatened when a shipment of lesbian erotica
is impounded at the Canadian border. But instead of grappling with
the issue of censorship, the movie jokes about how ``Little Red
Riding Hood'' is one of the books in the shipment. Late in the
movie a band of gay-bashing skinheads appears out of nowhere to
stir up trouble. But the movie's one scene of real violence is over
almost before it begins.
</P>
<P>
   For all the real problems faced by its characters, ``Better Than
Chocolate'' is finally a comic rhapsody to romantic love, the
possibility of happily ever after within an all-accepting
subculture. For everyone there's a someone, it insists. And once
you have found her, never let her go.

`THE BIG BRASS RING': SEEKING ABSOLUTION ALONG WITH SINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the estimable players snared in ``The Big Brass Ring,'' a
viewer might be reasonably confident that at least one of them
would have a clue as to what is going on, but if so the secret
remains safe. Whatever William Hurt, Nigel Hawthorne and Miranda
Richardson have deduced, they keep close to their attractive
chests.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as I was able to draw some sort of sense from the two
hours of murky atmospherics laid on by Sunday's Showtime
production, Hurt, playing Blake Pellarin, a candidate for governor
of Missouri, is actually running against his brother. No, that's
not right. The thing is he may in fact  &UR; be &LR;  his brother, whose name
is either Billy or Raymond Romero. The memory of Vietnam hangs
heavily over them; anyhow, I think it's Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing this and other shadowy business is Hawthorne, a
former presidential candidate given to gnomic utterances and the
power to look into men's hearts. He knows all about the Pellarin
and Romero clan, which is a lot more than anybody else in this
confused tale can claim.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Richardson, she drifts through her role as Hurt's
wife, helping to plot his campaign and endeavoring to seem
hard-boiled while marinated in vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Other presences include a fetching journalist who does her work
while modeling sexy designer garb, inspects Hurt as he attends to
his needs at a urinal and joins him in bed in pursuit of inside
information.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a security man who hangs around looking unpleasant
and there are glimpses of pornographic photographs and gay revels
on board a steamboat where extras romp in strange costumes
pretending to be having a naughty time. Everybody seems to be
baring secrets as well as flesh, and some reciprocal blackmailing
is in the works. If you have trouble following the plot, it's the
plot's fault.
</P>
<P>
   It pains me to relate that Orson Welles is credited with having
had a hand in the portentous and preposterous script. Maybe he was
kidding. The dialogue seems to emerge from people deep in their
cups: ``You are seeking absolution from some great sin,'' says the
journalist to the candidate, but then she'll say anything.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the characters are all supposed to be trapped in their
private nightmares. ``You'll never get away with this,'' one of
them threatens another. Let's hope not.

SPOTLIGHTING THE ALBUM OF THE WEEK

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAFE TACUBA: Reves/Yosoy (Warner Brothers/WEA Latina).
</P>
<P>
   The fourth album by Cafe Tacuba, a band from the suburbs of
Mexico City, has one disk of instrumentals and one disk of songs
with vocals. ``Yosoy,'' the vocal disk, uses elegant, sequential
structures, and dares to treat rock as art. ``Reves'' slows down
and takes more liberties, going after the trance effect.
</P>
<P>
   The early reviews of the album have compared it unfavorably to
the band's past work. But give it a chance: it's still better than
almost all other rock these days, suggesting a fresh start for an
exhausted discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The band doesn't look for comfort in rock's imposing
conventions; like the lyrics of the songs, which are daydream
travelogues, the music sounds as if it can go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Tacuba uses acoustic guitars and pianos for a restful, Neil
Young-like ballad, then whomps out a pop tune with a metronomic
beat in which no instrument sounds like what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Both records _ ``Yosoy'' being easier to get close to, ``Reves''
a fascinatingly chilly record of repetitive pieces, some built on
snippets of mysterious field recordings, one piece a clarinet
quartet and two others played by the Kronos Quartet _ are full of
intimate happenings, layerings of texture and strikingly warm mixes
by the producer Gustavo Santaolalla.
</P>
<P>
   The band's singer, Ruben Albarran, yelps with a serrated catch
in his throat but isn't afraid to sing prettily, in a close-miked
version of the Mexican distraught-ballad style.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican instruments like the guitarron and the jarana pop up
here and there, but with the exception of a ballad on ``Reves'' and
a spaced-out ranchera on ``Yosoy,'' the traditional elements are
planted deeply inside these songs rather than worn as signs of
authenticity. And for that reason, among many others, the record
will last.

   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, is probably the most visible representative of feminism in
the United States. She's always in the hot seat _ called upon to
account for everything from feminists' ``coziness'' with the
Clinton administration to the perception that feminists are a bunch
of man-bashing radicals.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Ireland has been through a lot of changes. She
writes in her autobiography, ``What Women Want'' (Dutton 1996),
about her seven-year career as an airline stewardess, as well as,
years later, breaking the ``glass ceiling'' by becoming one of the
first women to make partner in a corporate law firm.
</P>
<P>
   We met for a couple of hours in her corner office at NOW's
national headquarters in Washington, D.C.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUTH CONNIFF: You tell a story in your book about a bomb threat
while you were working as an airline stewardess. The pilot asked
you to stay on the plane to cook him a steak.
</P>
<P>
   PATRICIA IRELAND: Right, everyone else got off, while the plane
was about to be exploded at any moment, as far as we could tell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You decided to turn off the grill and get off the plane too,
and to tell the pilot to cook his own steak. Was that a turning
point for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. There were those little progressions. I don't think
anything radicalized me as much as being a stewardess. It was what
made those blinders fall from my eyes. ... Why in the world was I
standing in an airplane that might be blown up at any minute while
this guy was sitting in the crew lounge safe and waiting for his
steak? Get serious!
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of moments like that. That one just struck
me particularly because it was so outrageous. Because planes WERE
being blown up. It wasn't like it was a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   I came up in school when all of these movements were out there:
the free-speech movement, the civil-rights movement, the
women's-rights movement. The anti-war movement was very big when I
was in college. And I was an armchair supporter. I thought, ``Yeah,
that's great, I agree with that.'' But I was never active at all.
It really wasn't until something touched me personally that I
recognized you have to learn to fight back. And if you have a
movement, you're more likely to have success.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get from stewardess to corporate lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because (at the airline) I discovered the disparity in the
benefits that the women got vs. what the men got _ it had been
totally illegal for years. And yet nobody among us had known our
rights. I didn't even have to file a lawsuit. I just had to go to
the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Just as now, women who are being pushed off public assistance
don't know that they still should and can get food stamps and child
care. Years ago we didn't know it was illegal for the company to
have this benefit package that covered men's families but not
women's. And nobody challenged it.
</P>
<P>
   So when I figured out how many years the company had gotten away
with that _ how much money women and their families had been ripped
off for the corporate bottom line _ I just figured I wanted to go
to law school and know more about how to enforce those rights.
</P>
<P>
   All through law school I took courses I thought I'd use _ law
and the poor, civil rights and the law, women's rights and the law,
social policy and the law. I got my lowest grades in corporate law.
I never took securities law. And I really thought I was going to do
international law work, and especially international human-rights
work.
</P>
<P>
   Then I discovered that to get to do international law I would
have to move to Washington or go out to L.A. I really loved Miami,
so that was private international law _ private business
transactions. I looked at all my friends who were going into Legal
Services or becoming public defenders, and I just figured I would
be very frustrated by doing that. Also I found, much to my
surprise, that in representing a lot of these corporations that
needed affirmative-action plans, I could go in as their lawyer, and
they knew I was on their side, and without a big fight I could get
them to do things I could not possibly have gotten them to do as a
plaintiffs' counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You and other feminists have been accused of not wreaking
havoc or taking shots at President Clinton. Barbara Ehrenreich
wrote an op-ed in The New York Times accusing you of being too cozy
with him. And I went to a press conference at the Democratic
Convention where Gloria Steinem and other prominent feminists said,
``We've got to vote for him because he's the only one who can undo
the welfare legislation he just signed.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. But we were never part of that. And we never endorsed
him. I was arrested in front of his White House protesting the
welfare repeal. And one of the things I was peeved at Barbara about
was for saying I had gone to the Democratic Convention and danced
the macarena. I never went inside the Democratic Convention. I went
there to see if we could get some demonstrations going on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I went to Chicago because we had meetings with
Clinton administration officials who were trying to negotiate on
what they could do to settle us down about welfare. They wanted to
meet with us and hear from people we had gathered together about
the tie between domestic violence and poverty. They were in the
process of writing the rules on welfare: Could you get a temporary
exemption for women in poverty because of horrendous violence in
their lives? How did you deal with women who were stalked or
attacked in the workplace and therefore couldn't keep a job?
</P>
<P>
   We didn't endorse Clinton, we took him on full force over the
poverty issue and over lesbians and gays in the military, and yet
because we go in the door and negotiate about these issues,
suddenly we're ``in his camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't NOW pull its punches when it came to the sexual
accusations against Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Go back and look at the web and some of the transcripts.
I have called him everything on television. I've said we weren't
defending him, that his actions were indefensible. You know, I've
been very hard-edged about what he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we better off with Clinton than we would have been with
Bush or Dole?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. And at the same time, I really think Clinton has got a
very serious problem. Clinton is beyond what even the worst of the
culture of men usually behave like. When I was a stewardess, the ad
campaigns were ``We really move our tails for you'' and ``Fly me.''
I saw some of the worst of the worst of guys when they were away
from their families and thought they could do anything they wanted.
And when I first heard this story, I could not imagine even the
most outrageous pilot or passenger I knew dropping trousers and
asking for a blow job. What is that about?
</P>
<P>
   So I think he's got a serious problem. And that's why, again,
we're so focused on trying to get more candidates we can trust into
the political pipeline. I think I've been pretty hard on Clinton.
But it isn't what some of the reporters wanted to hear or see. I
think what they wanted was to say, ``Oh, the feminists are
defending Clinton.'' And, true, the real news would be if all the
feminists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You caused some problems for Janet Reno when she arrived in
Washington by revealing that you played softball with her.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, yes _ I really thought that was most amusing. I was
trying to put forward a different image from the one that got
across. Of course, every softball team I know and every soccer team
_ I wouldn't say they're all lesbian, but ... that was an amusing
little sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Reno play softball a lot? Are you still playing against
her?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. We played when we were both much younger, in a women's
law league _ all women lawyers. It was great. It was one of those
things for some of us who missed Title IX, and didn't get to play
sports in high school and college. The first time I could look out
there and go, ``Hmmm, they're not covered in right field, that's
where this ball is going,'' and I was able to hit it where I wanted
to _ that felt like a real accomplishment! Especially for someone
who had no sports skills growing up. It's just a fun thing. And
Reno was a heck of a player. I mean, she was scary.
</P>
<P>
   I remember I was playing first base when she was batting, and
when she was running the bases you definitely did not want to make
the mistake of being on the baseline. She was just an aggressive,
physical player. And I admired that, at the same time as it scared
me. When I met her, I just thought: Wow, who is this tall, strong,
aggressive player? Turned out to be Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about how Monica Lewinsky ended up? Was she
exploited or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think she's very young. I think you don't show your thong
bikini underwear to your employer without giving a signal of some
sort that you'd welcome a sexual advance. And I don't think anybody
tried to coerce her into anything, except Ken Starr and his merry
band of men.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time I fear that she will live to regret this,
although she seems temporarily to be riding high. Part of what
happens with any young woman who comes to see her only value as her
sexual appeal and her conventional attractiveness, who is so
obsessed with her body being too large, and trying to fill that
insecurity with attention from men, is that the ageism of the
culture catches up to her.
</P>
<P>
   You are only sexually attractive, conventionally, for a very
brief period in an otherwise long life. And if you don't have
something else about yourself that you value _ forget about whether
the rest of the world values it, but just start with yourself _ you
don't have anything to fall back on. When the next boss or series
of bosses are looking at the younger and younger women, what is she
going to have to feel good about herself? What does she value in
herself? And what does she have to offer of value that she's going
to present to the world? I worry about that. In that sense, I think
she has made some really big mistakes that are going to catch up to
her.

EPILEPSY DRUG MAY BE HELPFUL IN TREATING BINGE EATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DORIS CHANDLER   
 Gainesville (Fla.) Sun  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ A drug used to control epileptic seizures
has helped control, and in some cases stop, binge eating in
patients participating in a University of Florida study.
</P>
<P>
   The small pilot study involved 13 women over a course of seven
months to two years who were suffering from binge-eating disorders
and other psychological disorders such as manic depression,
clinical depression and obsessive-compulsive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   People with binge-eating disorder lack the control to stop
eating large amounts of food. Unlike in bulimia nervosa, there is
no purging by vomiting or taking laxatives in binge-eating
disorder. But the high intake of calories can lead to obesity and
other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Binge eating is probably the most common eating disorder,
according to the National Institutes of Health. While most binge
eaters are overweight, some are of normal weight. Women sufferers
outnumber men 3-to-2.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the University of Florida study were reported
Monday at the World Psychiatric Association conference in Hamburg,
Germany, by principal investigator Dr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant
professor of psychiatry in the university's College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, topiramate helped stop binge eating in four
patients and cut the number of episodes each month by more than 50
percent for another five. One participant had more than a 25
percent decrease in average monthly binge episodes, while two
initially had a decrease of 50 percent but had their binge
frequency edge upward again over time. One participant showed
little or no improvement. Eight patients continued on the
medication through the full two years. One dropped out because of
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Topiramate, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
epilepsy in 1996, is not a panacea for obesity, but it may be
another option for treating binge eating, said Dr. Toby Goldsmith,
a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the UF College of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's side effects can range from a slight tingling in the
fingers and toes to the more significant word-finding cognitive
difficulties and an elevated risk of kidney stones, Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapira headed the research project while on the faculty of the
University of Cincinnati, before coming to the University of
Florida. While the study offers solid results, more research is
needed, said Goldsmith, also a former staffer at the University of
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for the results of a double-blind placebo study
at the University of Cincinnati. The doctors don't know who is
getting topiramate. Hopefully, it will be completed before the end
of the year,'' Goldsmith said.

   BBN-DODGERBLUES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have one of the
highest payrolls in baseball, and one of the worst records. L.A.,
which spent so much money in the offseason that many thought an NL
West title was a lock, are in last place in their division, 14
games under .500 and 13 games out of first. Pitching ace Kevin
Brown, signed for more than $100 million, has been inconsistent,
pitching brilliantly at times and getting bombed at other times.
Slugger Raul Mondesi has fumed about being moved around in the
batting order. A look at what when wrong in L.A. as the Braves head
west for a weekend series at Dodger Stadium. (Stinson, Atlanta

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In the spring of 1998 two Florida filmmakers,
Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick, trained three unknown New York
actors to shoot film and videotape. They told the actors to go to
Seneca Creek State Park in Maryland for several days with this
rough idea: to scare themselves as much as possible and improvise a
movie about searching for a monstrous woman called the Blair Witch.
They gave the actors plenty of food and two hand-held 16-mm
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to look like a documentary because we had no
money,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   That has certainly changed.
</P>
<P>
   The two filmmakers and their partners are sharing in the profits
of a box office bonanza, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' that has
startled Hollywood because it broke every possible rule. It had no
stars, a tiny budget of $30,000 and an oddball story about three
filmmakers who disappeared and left behind only their film.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has also startled the world of independent film
because top executives at Miramax, Fine Line and other established
companies either walked out in the middle of the movie's first
screening at the Sundance Film Festival or rejected it out of hand
as uncommercial.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Block, a partner at Artisan Entertainment, a smaller
independent company, saw the film at its first midnight screening
at Sundance and pounced on it.
</P>
<P>
   And to the amazement of Block and his partners at Artisan, Amir
Malin and Mark Curcio, ``The Blair Witch Project'' is nothing less
than a phenomenon among moviegoers in the 18- to 30-year-old range.
By this weekend its box office receipts will pass $100 million.
Artisan expects that it could reach as much as $140 million, and
the company is already planning a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the expected huge sales from the the video, to be
released on Halloween. (Abroad the film has so far opened only in
France, where its box office revenue has been surprisingly modest.)
The two filmmakers, and the three producers in Orlando, Fla., who
were financially struggling last year, are expected to divide about
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts what has made the film so successful is the
Internet. Its Web site, www.blairwitch.com, blurred the line
between reality and fiction. It displays ``police reports'' and
newsreel-style interviews that make the movie seem real.
</P>
<P>
   Heated discussions have broken out on the Internet about whether
the movie is fiction or a documentary. The reaction to the Web site
has been powerful; there have been nearly 80 million ``hits'' on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a young Internet audience out there that hasn't been
tapped,'' said Block, a former talent agent. ``This movie converges
with that audience. They've embraced it. All the kids have seen it
on the Internet. In some ways it's the first Internet movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin, who was one of the owners of October Films, said he hoped
``Blair Witch 2'' could be released as early as next summer. No one
is quite sure what it will be about, but there is every possibility
that more ``lost'' film will be found from the three main actors,
Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This taps into a niche the way `Easy Rider' tapped into a
niche in the 1960s,'' Malin said. ``It taps into an audience that's
been weaned on television and the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin spoke over the telephone while on vacation in southern
Tuscany. He can afford it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to escape `Blair Witch' hysteria,'' he said happily.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After four years at Harvard, Darren Aronofsky returned home to
Coney Island not entirely sure what to do with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a year hanging out with my friends; most of them were
either stockbrokers or drug dealers,'' he said. ``Both weren't a
good influence.''
</P>
<P>
   So Aronofsky, who is now 30, decided to enroll at the American
Film Institute to study directing. It took several years after
graduating to scrape together $20,000 from friends to make his
first feature. He did not seek money from his relatives. ``I didn't
want to bankrupt my family any more after college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The feature, ``Pi,'' was a strange and mesmerizing film about a
man encumbered by severe headaches who immerses himself in Jewish
mysticism, numerological theory and the stock market. Aronofsky won
the director's award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival for the
movie, which was named one of the top 10 films of 1998 by several
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Pi'' could have guaranteed a Hollywood career
for Aronofsky. But he is now completing another offbeat drama,
although on a much larger scale. The movie, ``Requiem for a
Dream,'' based on a novel by Hubert Selby Jr., is what Aronofsky
called a psychological horror film dealing with various addictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In show business, entertainment is the first rule, and I
totally want to entertain people and make films that are exciting
to watch,'' Aronofsky said. ``But there's no reason you can't also
explore new techniques in film language as well as new ideas that
are not normal subject matter for most movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film Ellen Burstyn plays a woman addicted first to candy
and television who then turns her obsession to diet pills. Three
other characters also ``come face to face with their own worst
nightmares,'' Aronofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans
and Louise Lasser. The film is to be released next year by Artisan
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Aronofsky is also planning several other high-profile projects.
One is ``Proteus,'' a World War II science fiction thriller for
Dimension Films, a division of Miramax. The other is based on the
comic strip ``Ronin,'' about a 13th-century samurai who is
transported into Manhattan in the 21st century. ``I call it a
cyber-samurai movie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he is busy in the editing room with ``Requiem for a
Dream,'' which was made mostly in _ where else? _ Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once told me you've got to make them cry, make them
laugh or scare them,'' Aronofsky said. ``I'm hoping to do all three
in this movie.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's life after ``Charlie's Angels.'' Ask Cheryl Ladd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done 35 television films and features and mini-series,
and I haven't stopped working,'' said Ms. Ladd, who played Kris
Munroe in the 1970s series. ``But even now all people want to talk
about is `Charlie's Angels.' People are still so attached to those
girls. It was such a phenomenon. There are still `Charlie's Angels'
fan clubs and newsletters. It's like Trekkies and `Star Trek.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ladd, 48, is hardly complaining. She appears in a new film,
``A Dog of Flanders,'' based on the children's book written in
1872. The tale of a young boy and his friendship with a remarkable
dog, the book has been adapted for films three times: in 1924, when
it was called ``Boy of Flanders''; in 1935, and in 1959. The
current version, directed and adapted by Kevin Brodie, will be
released on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ladd said she had decided to appear in the movie for one
reason. ``I wanted my career to have one children's classic like
this,'' she said. ``I wanted to have my `Old Yeller' or
`Pollyanna.' I wanted to make a movie that families can see
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ladd said ``Charlie's Angels,'' which took her from
obscurity to almost instant fame, had had a surprising impact on
her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are young directors who can't wait to meet me and put me
in their films precisely because of `Charlie's Angels,''' she said.
``They grew up with the series. And there are older directors who
won't let me walk past their door because of `Charlie's Angels.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a stigma sometimes because of that particular show,''
Ms. Ladd acknowledged. ``For some directors it's seen as a ball and
chain. On the other hand it's given me a bit of a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades Ms. Ladd has appeared in some
surprisingly dark feature films. Last year she played opposite Ben
Stiller in ``Permanent Midnight,'' based on the turbulent life of a
Hollywood writer and heroin addict. Ms. Ladd portrayed the star of
a television series _ she was given a fictional name _ who helped
the writer stay clean.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ladd lives near Santa Barbara with her husband, Brian
Russell, a writer. She has a daughter and a stepdaughter, both
actresses in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them that the major pitfall is the amount of rejection
and the out-and-out cruelty you have to take when you want to get
work,'' she said. ``Waiting two hours in a room with other actors
to get two minutes to see if you're the person for the part. It's
so hard on your psyche. You get hundreds of nos for one yes.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it was certainly difficult for older actresses to find
work in movies. But television, Ms. Ladd said, is less restrictive.
``Television has been kind to all of us from `Charlie's Angels,'''
she said. ``There are a lot of good roles for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she is still looking for the one film role that
would take her career far beyond ``Charlie's Angels.'' She said
with a laugh, ``I'm constantly looking for the Mrs. Robinson
part.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PIE,' starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Natasha
Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Eugene
Levy. Directed by Paul Weitz (R, 100 minutes). The snickering
teen-age comedy about four boys, all seniors in the same Michigan
high school, who make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of
the school year serves up a new gross-out joke every five minutes.
The movie obviously wants to outdo ``There's Something About Mary''
in raunchy guffaws, but it lacks the antic spirit of its
forerunner. More like an upper-middle-class ``Porky's,'' it parades
its dirty jokes as crassly as an old-time burlesque show (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ARLINGTON ROAD,' starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope
Davis, Robert Gossett and Joan Cusack. Directed by Mark Pellington
(R, 117 minutes). In a smart, stylish thriller that recalls the
paranoid classics of the '70s, Bridges plays a history professor
who begins to suspect that his smiling suburban neighbors are not
what they seem. Tracking down clues to an anti-government terrorist
network, he also engages in a battle of wits with Robbins' cryptic
character, and these fine actors square off to gripping effect.
Swift and pulse-quickening, this thriller has more than its share
of surprising twists, including a whopper at the finale. All in
all, a welcome change of pace from the season's dopey blockbusters
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN TALE,' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere, Didier
Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric Rohmer
(PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The final
chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand). The movie follows the adventures of
this wiry and vital but lonely widowed mother of two after she
allows two friends to play matchmaker. The film's plot, like that
of other Rohmer movies, is mathematically schematic as the
characters indulge in exquisitely verbalized soul-searching. As
sensuously gratifying as it is civilized, with a wonderful central
performance by Ms. Romand, it reaches a happy ending that feels
entirely earned (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pinup status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and much more, this clever little indie is at the center of
a new form of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP BLUE SEA,' starring Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool
J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard and
Samuel L. Jackson, Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 100 minutes).
Better not mess with Mother Nature. That's the familiar message of
this man-against-shark horror film in which the research team of a
floating ocean laboratory is stalked by three 8,000-pound
genetically ``improved'' mako sharks. Ms. Burrows is the chilly,
anything-for-science marine biologist behind the research, and Jane
the hunky shark-wrangler who tends these razor-toothed killing
machines. ``Titanic'' meets ``Jaws,'' without romance, history,
myth or credible characters, only nonstop action and half an ocean
full of crimson, blood-thickened water (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `DICK,' starring Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams. Directed
by Andrew Fleming (PG-13, 90 minutes). Now we know the identity of
Deep Throat, the confidential source who gave the journalists Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein the inside dish about Richard Nixon's
role in the Watergate scandal and helped bring down his Presidency.
``Dick'' reveals the snitches to have been two giggly 15-year-old
girls, Betsy (Ms. Dunst) and Arlene (Ms. Williams), whom Nixon had
appointed his official dog walkers. In remembering the good old
days of plumbers and White House tape recordings, this extended,
wildly funny ``Saturday Night Live''-style sketch spares no one.
Dan Hedaya's shifty-eyed, hunch-shouldered Nixon caricature is the
hilarious embodiment of paranoid guilt (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `EYES WIDE SHUT,' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last cryptic,
spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a stunning
epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a dead-serious film
about eros and mortality, one that flirts with the ridiculous but
sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. Cruise,
as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of strange,
dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks his
jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film) is a joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton and James Woods. Directed by
Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a military base was once
enough of a pretext for a detective thriller, but nowadays it takes
more. The prevailing sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this
galling adaptation of a Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to
oblige. So the title character, a pretty young officer who the film
thinks has no place in the military, is the victim of a lurid
crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though
the unraveling of the crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point
of their ponderous investigation is that the victim asked for what
she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `GRAND ILLUSION,' starring Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay and Erich
von Stroheim. Directed by Jean Renoir (not rated, 117 minutes). An
oasis of subtlety, moral intelligence and deep emotion on the
cinematic landscape this summer. And the third inspired reissue in
as many years from Rialto Pictures, which previously resurrected
Godard's ``Contempt'' and Fellini's ``Nights of Cabiria.'' As this
1937 masterpiece refracts wartime through the peculiar civility of
life in German-run prison camps, it creates a rich and stirring
vision of all that war destroys. And the sole casualty in one of
the most devastating films about battle is a man who dies in bed
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HAUNTING,' starring Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jan De Bont (PG-13, 117
minutes). In a wildly overdone haunted house with a Gothic nouveau
riche look, walls warp, statues morph and things go bump in the
night. The special effects are piled on so relentlessly that after
a while the sight of the flying cow from De Bont's ``Twister''
would not be amiss. Firmly committed to the idea that more is more,
this is a remake of a 1963 black-and-white film that left much more
to the imagination. But the cast is good; Neeson plays the doctor
who leads the other three principals to Hill House for a psychology
experiment that goes really, really wrong (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam. Written and
directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best thing about
Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they're almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ILLUMINATA,' starring John Turturro, Katherine Borowitz, Susan
Sarandon, Rufus Sewell, Christopher Walken and Donal McCann.
Directed by Turturro (R, 111 minutes). An enormously fond homage to
the world of acting, beguilingly presented and full of knowing
backstage humor. The usual suspects _ the aging diva (Ms.
Sarandon), the self-involved leading man ( Sewell), the idealistic
aspiring playwright ( Turturro) _ are played invigoratingly, as is
Walken's snide, Transylvanian-sounding critic. Turturro and Ms.
Borowitz, his somberly beautiful wife, play out a delicate balance
of love and ambition against this nicely tumultuous backdrop
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `INSPECTOR GADGET,' starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert
Everett. Directed by David Kellogg (PG, 85 minutes). The midmorning
midden of children's cartoons that yielded a vein of cinematic gold
with ``George of the Jungle'' has now been mined for this clinker.
Too bad, because this Disney comedy wastes good talent. Broderick
brings an endearing combination of intelligence, wit and naivete to
his portrayal of a security guard who is transformed into the human
gizmo, Inspector Gadget, after being blown up in an effort to
capture a megalomaniacal magnate ( Everett). But even Broderick can
go only so far with the film's noisy, childish material. Watching
this movie is like watching a human Swiss Army knife for nearly an
hour and a half. It's a remarkable device, but do you really want
to spend a lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store
Frankenstein creation that can light cigars with his thumb, shoot a
grappling hook to the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter
from his head? (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE IRON GIANT,' with the voices of Elie Marienthal and Harry
Connick Jr. Directed by Brad Bird (PG, 90 minutes). Based loosely
on a children's fable written in 1968 by Ted Hughes, this film
looks at the fearful years of the Cold War through the politically
correct lens of the 1990's. All this re-examination of the
atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a
bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a
50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the
sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Maine
Hogarth Hughes saves the giant when it becomes entangled in
high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate.
Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid government agent is closing in on the
giant, leading to a showdown with the military. ``The Iron Giant''
is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Many parents
will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how
the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history (Van
Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `MY LIFE SO FAR,' starring Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene
Jacob, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell and Robert
Norman. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 93 minutes). A steady
``Masterpiece Theater''-like glow warms ``My Life So Far,'' a boy's
reverie of growing up in the misty Scottish highlands of Argyll in
the late 1920's. Frisky little Fraser ( Norman), who narrates the
story, recalls a year in the life of the mildly troubled Macintosh
clan. What strife there is mostly involves his father, Edward (
Firth), an eccentric fiery-eyed inventor, and his Uncle Morris (
McDowell), who brings home a beautiful French wife (Ms. Jacob),
with whom Edward falls in love. If the story is slight, it is
smoothly told and well acted (especially by Firth), and the
nostalgic atmosphere is beguiling (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MYSTERY MEN,' starring William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Hank
Azaria, Janeane Garofalo and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Kinka Usher
(PG-13, 100 minutes). Based on a comic book, this satire on the
superhero genre has a fine deadpan cast and a funny premise, even
if its skit-worthy material is allowed to run out of steam. Its
characters are lovable losers, convinced that superhero status is
mostly a state of mind and can be achieved even if one's secret
power is throwing forks or hoisting a shovel. Macy sets the
entertainingly tongue-in-cheek tone as the intrepid Shoveler, but
Usher does some shoveling, too. His film loads up on so many jokey
characters that it begins to be as overblown as a ``Batman'' _ and
not so far removed from the genre it mocks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later,
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy (
Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist (
Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT,' &UR;  &LR; with the voices of Trey
Parker, Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman. Directed by Parker (R, 88
minutes). The movie spinoff from the outrageous Comedy Central
cartoon series following the adventures of some potty-mouthed
third-grade boys in South Park, Colo., is extremely funny and
jubilantly obscene, with several sewers' worth of bathroom humor.
It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy of
a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and
gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect
of children's being exposed to dirty language and sexual
explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie
filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents
raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada.
Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled
affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in
an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs
spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to ``Les
Miserables'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TARZAN,' &UR;  &LR; with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Rosie
O'Donnell and Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris
Buck (G, 88 minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan
movie could improve on the 47 others that preceded it. Disney
animation turns the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk, lets the
apes talk to him and whooshes through lush jungle settings with
exultant agility. This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways
that are hard to resist, with lively vocal performances, excitingly
kinetic animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in the
background. Parents will stay awake, and children will be charmed
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' &UR;  &LR; starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK,' &UR;  &LR; starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TWIN FALLS IDAHO,' &UR;  &LR; starring Michael and Mark Polish and
Michele Hicks. Directed by Michael Polish (R, 100 minutes). This
eerily effective film carries the real-life closeness of twin
brothers into the realm of haunting fantasy. The look-alike Polish
siblings play conjoined twins whose delicately balanced
interdependence yields a rare brand of tension. With a bleak,
lonely look and a strain of black humor (in their three-legged
suit, the film's Falls brothers impress everyone on Halloween), the
film introduces a wild, gorgeous young woman into their lives and
watches what happens when one twin starts to court her. The story
is intensely rendered, without gimmicks (Maslin). Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT: MON TRUFFAUT PREFERE.' &UR;  &LR; Francois Truffaut,
who helped to reinvent cinema as part of the French New Wave, was
born in 1932 and died in 1984, so this year is not one of those
anniversaries that prompt a retrospective. But Truffaut's films are
always something to celebrate, and right now the Rose Cinemas of
the Brooklyn Academy of Music are doing just that. This weekend, an
11-film retrospective offers the final two installments of his
five-film semiautobiographical Antoine Doinel series _ ``Bed and
Board'' (1970) today and ``Love on the Run'' (1979) tomorrow _
followed on Sunday by his 1961 classic ``Jules and Jim,'' with
Jeanne Moreau, Oskar Werner and Henri Serre. Among the coming films
in the retrospective are ``Small Change'' (1976), ``The Bride Wore
Black'' (1968), ``The Man Who Loved Women'' (1977), ``Day for
Night'' (1973) and ``Confidentially Yours'' (1983). Admission to
the series, running through Aug. 22 as part of the BAM Cinematek
repertory program at the BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at
Ashland Place, Fort Greene, is $8.50 for adults and $5 for people
over 62, children under 12 and students with valid identification.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rapidly strengthening low-pressure system crossing Ontario
will bring much-needed rain to New England and the Northeast on
Friday. A series of jet-stream disturbances passing over this
region will initiate thunderstorms from upstate New York to the
Middle Atlantic states. Some of the storms will be severe, with
damaging winds and large hail possible. Meanwhile, farther north,
warm air will be lifted up and over cooler air at the surface,
creating a swath of steady rain from the northern Great Lakes to
extreme northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Ohio Valley, a cold front undercutting warm and
humid air will spawn scattered showers and thunderstorms. Cool air
behind this front will make it feel like early autumn over the
northern Plains and western Great Lakes with readings as much as 10
degrees below normal. In addition, a pocket of cold air at 18,000
feet will promote a few showers over the western Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry conditions will persist over the Southeast as high
pressure provides additional warm and humid air to the region. The
southern Plains will remain very hot under abundant sunshine.
Meanwhile, sunshine will pervade the Rockies as the monsoonal flow
of moisture is temporarily interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies will envelop southern California as offshore winds
promote breaks in the low clouds. In the Northwest, cool ocean air
surging inland will create a deck of low clouds from the Pacific to
the Cascades. Cool air aloft over the Northwest will also spark
scattered showers and an isolated rumble of thunder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tornado Shield &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Urban environments and mountainous terrain have often been cited
as shields against tornado formation. The twister that ripped
through Salt Lake City on Wednesday challenged both of these
notions. Strong twisters have been observed in many cities as well
as over hilly terrain. There is some indication that the roughness
associated with tall buildings or undulating terrain may interfere
with the establishment of the circulation of weak tornadoes. But
when a potent mixture of atmospheric ingredients comes together,
neither cities nor mountains prevent tornados.

OFFERING A POOL OF NICHE VIDEOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   OFFERING A POOL OF NICHE VIDEOS: Mainstream movies roll on, but
at more specialized levels of video distribution _ for example, the
``art house'' or the foreign levels _ inventories inch up or down
according to conditions. Right now they seem to be doing both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that worries me is conglomeration,'' said Milos
Stehlik, director of Facets Multimedia, a Chicago company known for
its substantial mail-order assortment (30,000 titles) of
predominantly foreign and independent movies. Consolidation, which
continues at a high rate in the video business, has always played
hob with older films in release. New owners often drop movies,
especially those that do not sell in large numbers. ``A lot of
titles always get lost,'' Stehlik said. ``Who knows if they will
ever come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he added, new packaging alone can cause delay and
further decimate the ranks. ``Everybody wants to have an input,''
he said. ``It's their label, their marketing strategy. But that's
what the movie business is all about: ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Facets will begin answering customer requests
to track down missing films, if possible, and dig out whatever
copies can be found lying around shunned or forgotten. In a modest
way, that kind of activity also helps encourage enterprise in the
niche areas, which Stehlik regards as video's last refuge in the
coming era of mass electronic delivery of movies to the home.
``Interesting films are still coming out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How interesting is sometimes a question, of course, but the
point is to keep the supply diverse and growing. For example, on
Aug. 24, Facets will introduce its own line of titles whose appeal
may be limited to dedicated movie lovers but certainly broadens
choice. The first of these films, all of which have had little or
no exposure in this country, is ``Germany, Pale Mother'' (1979),
Helma Sanders-Brahms' film, based on her own experiences, about a
young woman's attempt to save her child and herself after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The next two titles are Jacques Rivette's diptych about Joan of
Arc: ``Joan the Maid: The Battles'' and ``Joan the Maid: The
Prisons'' and Victor Erice's ``Dream of Light'' (1992), which
examines the Spanish painter Antonio Lopez as he renders sunlight
filtering through the leaves of a quince tree. ``Mr. Erice's method
is modest, yet his film manages to achieve a mesmerizing
intensity,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times when the film
was shown at the New York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Facets will release two films by Michelangelo
Antonioni: ``Mystery of Oberwald'' (1980), which Antonioni shot on
video, and ``Identification of a Woman'' (1982), actually about two
women and the difficulty of relationships. ``An excruciatingly
empty work,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. ``It's also
beautiful and sad _ virtually a parody of the director's great
`L'Avventura' and some of his other earlier films.'' Not
everybody's cup of tea, but just the thing to flesh out the
Antonioni oeuvre. ``This is the level we need to be,'' Stehlik
said.  &QL;

   Concerned about his fading urge to kill and intimidate, the
mobster Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) furtively consults the
psychiatrist Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal). It's a case Sobel could do
without. One doctor has already been bounced around by Vitti for
suggesting that the constriction in his chest is not a heart
problem but is brought on by anxiety attacks. Then there are the
weeping jags, not the best ailment for a mob kingpin facing
extermination by rivals looking for any little weakness. As
gangster and doctor sort it out, the director Harold Ramis proves,
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, that he ``knows how to
handle a high-concept story with unusual cleverness.''

   In New York on New Year's Eve, 1981, everyone in the East
Village is reluctantly straggling toward a party at Monica's. Lucy
(Courtney Love) and Kevin (Paul Rudd) battle over their longtime
nonrelationship. Two aspiring hipsters (Christina Ricci and Gaby
Hoffmann) wonder if they'll survive Avenue B. A good-looking
bartender (Ben Affleck) likes his chances at the dawn of yuppiedom.
An innocent from uptown (Kate Hudson) hooks up with the first man
she ever went home with (Jay Mohr). And at the party site,
panicking that no one will show up, waits Monica (Martha Plimpton)
in a film that has barely enough story line to puff on but ``gets

   BOB AND MARGARET. The Comedy Central series about a genteel
middle-aged English couple (he's a dentist; she's a podiatrist) is
based on ``Bob's Birthday,'' an Oscar-winning animated short. The
idea here is to turn the commonplace into humor, and though the
adventures lack glitz (for example, getting fit with couples
badminton), the bold visual look has its own distinction. ```Bob
and Margaret' brings to mind Nick Parks' hilarious, inventive films
about Wallace and Gromit,'' Caryn James wrote in The New York
Times. While this series lacks Parks' inspired lunatic touches, it
``has an appealing, close-to-the bone wit of its own.'' 1998.

NASCAR'S TOP FIVE LEAVE FOES IN THE DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK ZIER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   After he finished second to Dale Jarrett in last Saturday's
Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, Bobby Labonte was asked if he
thought Jarrett was as dominant this year as Jeff Gordon was in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see if Dale wins 13 races to see if he's doing
better than Jeff did last year,'' Labonte replied.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that, so far, Jarrett is doing to the
competition this year what Gordon did in '98.
</P>
<P>
   And the majority of the time, Gordon is right there with him,
although this isn't reflected in the point standings because you
don't win points by being competitive for most of the race and then
falling out. Instead, you win points by finishing even if you don't
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Indy, though, was a clear reflection of what is taking place in
Winston Cup racing, the culmination of a trend that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That season, two teams _ Labonte's and Jeff Burton's _
established that they were ready to move into the elite group of
cars that can consistently race up front and win.
</P>
<P>
   And while NASCAR likes to talk about the competition in Winston
Cup, the accepted generalization that many cars are capable of
battling each other at the top is not accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1997, when Labonte and Burton moved into the top
group, five cars have dominated Winston Cup racing. They finished
1-5 at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   The five are Jarrett, Gordon, Labonte, Burton and Mark Martin.
Hanging on the fringe, but now distinctly behind, is Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, someone like a Dale Earnhardt pops up, but he no
longer has the consistency to be classified with the top five.
</P>
<P>
   The dominance of Jarrett, Gordon, Labonte, Burton and Martin is
reflected in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   This year of 100 possible top-five finishes in the first 20
races, they have garnered 67 of them. Of 20 possible wins, they
share 16 between them.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the top-five cars, plus Wallace, have won 71 of a
possible 85 races. That doesn't leave much for anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   By himself, Gordon has won 27 times.
</P>
<P>
   What is more disturbing from a competitive standpoint is that
the five best cars seem to improve much faster than the others,
which means almost no one can mount a challenge outside the elite
group.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart may be an exception, but that remains to be seen.
He has had an impressive rookie year, but he will have to build on
that before he reaches the level of the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everyone else is being left in the dust, and NASCAR
can only hope they don't choke on it.

 &HT;    Ciao, Chase: Stylist heads to Europe
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Chase Thomas, hairstylist, has one
honkin' big car. A long, black Cadillac Fleetwood, surprisingly
cool in the midday sun, made in ... what year?
</P>
<P>
   ``1997.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997. Smooth black interior, ash-flecked as Chase tips a
cigarette into the wind, talking, talking, something about
marathons. Fresh Dunkin' Donuts coffee in the cupholder. One Gucci
loafer on the gas. Where we going?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wellington.'' He starts talking again.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington, for a house call. Chase recently sold his popular
West Palm Beach salon, the Chase Salon, and he's supposed to be ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this bothering you?'' He interrupts his own discussion on
hyperactivity and waves a hand in front of the AC.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ... supposed to be resting, getting ready for a new life ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ... A new life in Europe ...
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Hey. Let me tell you a story.''
</P>
<P>
   All right. (Open window, take list of interview questions, chuck
it.)
</P>
<P>
   (BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   All you need to know about Chase Thomas is he does good work.
And his running commentary, in or out of the salon, has charmed all
sorts of people _ Rod Stewart, Heather Locklear, Larry King ...
</P>
<P>
   Now Chase is leaving this month, to do hair and makeup for
Italian Vogue. He's 35. If it works, it works. He'll keep his West
Palm Beach apartment just in case.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the first thing Chase talks about. The first is
that he loves half-and-half, especially with cereal. The second:
When he's alone in his apartment, he raps the rhymes of Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   Any idea of a typical interview skitters into the westbound lane
of Southern Boulevard. ``I change my mind a lot,'' Chase says
earnestly, from behind the wheel. ``I don't know if it's ADD or ATD
but I know it's creativity-T-T. You know?''
</P>
<P>
   Chase is not a local guy. He's from rural Nutbush, Tenn. (home
of Tina Turner), where his dad sincerely hoped he would become a
cowboy. Instead, Chase read Vogue in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always kept my Tonka trucks clean,'' he says. Chase knows a
good quote.
</P>
<P>
   In third grade, his mom found him reading a copy of ``The Magic
of Thinking Big.'' As a teen-ager, he said, ``Daddy, I'm not
interested in riding around the courthouse square, screaming and
blowing the horn. I want to get into something and make a career.''
</P>
<P>
   He got right to it. At age 19 he went to Memphis and started a
salon. In four years it was the biggest in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He gave that up and came to Palm Beach County, he says, because
he hated the winters.
</P>
<P>
   (BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   Here, in no decent order, are other bits and pieces of Chase
Thomas, grabbed on the fly:
</P>
<P>
   He's a heck of a dancer. ``I guarantee he can get down and get
with it,'' says his dad, Ralph, a siding salesman for Sears.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, he'd try to get out of spankings by saying, ``All
right, just let me pray first.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked like Barry Manilow in high school.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't use ice in his drinking water ``because it's not
European.''
</P>
<P>
   He once made Allure magazine's list of the country's best
hairstylists.
</P>
<P>
   To build a Palm Beach reputation, he gave makeovers to members
of The Gardens mall teen board and had them model at The Breakers
during Sunday brunch, passing out business cards.
</P>
<P>
   His motto: Be authentic. ``In Palm Beach, a lot of people make
up stories about themselves, buy titles. I grew up on a farm in
Tennessee. How much more honest can you be?''
</P>
<P>
   He's cut Rod Stewart's hair in each of the singer's three homes.
</P>
<P>
   Clients say they can do the entire New York Times crossword as
he works.
</P>
<P>
   While a client's color sets, he sneaks in a half-hour of
thrift-store shopping.
</P>
<P>
   When the power would go off at his most recent salon, he would
take his client into a nearby alley and continue trimming.
</P>
<P>
   He has done hair for Burt Reynolds, Marla Maples, Sally Jessy
Raphael, Jimmy Buffett and Morgan Fairchild.
</P>
<P>
   During a photo shoot, he once slipped into a bubble bath with
the model for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   He's a trip. ``Palm Beach, for all its supposed glamour, is not
all that colorful,'' says Palm Beach client Tom Leddy. ``He's
colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   He can arrange for a reporter to get a friendly quote from
Allure editor Linda Wells: ``I was giving a speech at a Chanel
sales meeting in Boca and the first thing I did was go to Chase's.
He was very sweet and opened his salon at the crack of dawn so I
could get my hair blown out ... He's completely charming.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know a word of Italian, or even French, but figures
he'll get by in Europe. With his talent he can make it, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good boy,'' his dad says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been good company,'' says his mom.
</P>
<P>
   (BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   Chase arrives in Wellington and enters the bathroom of socialite
Dorothy Sullivan, one of his first and favorite local clients. He
stuffs envelopes for her charities. For her, he also makes house
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do my hands smell like smoke?'' he asks her. ``I'll wash
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's cute,'' Sullivan says, as he primps in the mirror and
gets to work. ``I remember after the Listerine heiress died, we
were talking about who the next heiress would be, when Chase comes
out in a blond wig and fur coat, holding a bottle of Scope.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase just smiles. He can't talk and concentrate on makeup at
the same time, he says. Hair's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Palm Beach shop was as interesting as he is,'' Sullivan
continues. ``It was always filled with people who weren't even
there for hair.''
</P>
<P>
   A nod. A final touch or two. ``All right,'' he says.
``Sexycrazycool.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the thing about Palm Beach, Chase says later. ``It's a
small community. It doesn't take long to get around. What I heard
when I first got here was, `You can blow my hair, but my stylist in
New York colors it.' I was reminded of that story, about the
emperor and his clothes. They were the last to know how ridiculous
their haircuts were.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I put a pin in that,'' he says, then finds something
catchier. ``I let the air out of their hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Good one. ``Yeah,'' he says, pleased. ``Write it.''

   ``AMERICAN PIE''
</P>
<P>
   (R) B
</P>
<P>
   This raunchy, uproarious teen sex farce pushes gross-out humor
to new heights _ or lows, depending on how easily you are offended.
While not as clever as ``There's Something About Mary,'' this tale
of a randy quartet of high-school buddies looking to get lucky has
crude belly laughs galore. What keeps it from sinking to the level
of ``Porky's'' is its frequent nods to the female point of view.
(7/9) Strong sexuality and sexual talk, profanity, nudity and
drinking; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B
</P>
<P>
   The gut-busting return of Mike Myers' randy retro spy puts a
wacky spin on the whole of pop culture, from ``Jerry Maguire'' to
Jerry Springer, but it doesn't quite live up to the hilarious 1997
original. Still, there are plenty of belly laughs as Austin returns
to 1969 to reclaim his ``mojo.'' (6/11) Sexual innuendo, crude
humor; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``BIG DADDY''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) C
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler maintains a string of Jekyll-and-Hyde characters,
this time as the guardian who ``adopts'' a tyke to impress his
girlfriend. Details play out with as much engaging amusement as
they do boorish irritation. (6/25) Profanity, sexuality; 13 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT''
</P>
<P>
   (R) B+
</P>
<P>
   This terrifying low-budget horror film scares the living
daylights out of you without a single special effect or an ounce of
gore. Its terrors lurk just beyond the camera's range, allowing
your imagination to conjure them through the power of suggestion.
Although the film's ingenious premise is fiction, airtight
execution makes it easy to suspend disbelief and share the
vicarious nightmare. (7/30) Profanity; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``DEEP BLUE SEA''
</P>
<P>
   (R) B
</P>
<P>
   This killer-shark flick is closer in style to ``Alien'' than to
``Jaws,'' and it makes up in thrills and suspense what it lacks in
story and character development. Director Renny Harlin (``Cutthroat
Island,'' ``The Long Kiss Goodnight'') is a master of the
big-orange-fireball school of filmmaking, and he sets a furious
pace as Samuel L. Jackson and a cast of relative unknowns try to
escape genetically enhanced mako sharks run amok. (7/28) Graphic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``DICK''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) C
</P>
<P>
   Historical revision of Watergate by director Andrew Fleming,
whose comedy would have us believe two teen-aged girls (Kirsten
Dunst and Michelle Williams) befriended President Nixon and
uncovered his scandalous activities. Breezy satire and the young
co-stars' chemistry soon give way to belabored jokes and
predictable double-entendres about the titular moniker. (8/4) Adult
language; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``DROP DEAD GORGEOUS''
</P>
<P>
   (R) C-
</P>
<P>
   The mock documentary about a back-stabbing teen beauty pageant
in small-town Minnesota is a mean-spirited dark comedy that makes
fun of the mentally retarded, the physically handicapped and
lip-syncing anorexics. Lacking the warmth of ``There's Something
About Mary'' and the sweetness of ``American Pie,'' which also
pushed the limits of taste to great extremes, the cold-hearted film
is more cruel than funny. (7/23) Crude humor, sexuality, profanity;
17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``ENTRAPMENT''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B-
</P>
<P>
   This old-fashioned suspense thriller features a fair amount of
action, but it eschews the contemporary staples of sex and
explosions in favor of intrigue and romance. The film may move a
bit slowly for today's young audiences and it occasionally
stretches credibility, but tense heist sequences and the chemistry
between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones offset most of its
flaws. (4/30) Some profanity, sensuality, violence and drug
content; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``EYES WIDE SHUT''
</P>
<P>
   (R) A-
</P>
<P>
   The provocative final achievement of Stanley Kubrick's career is
stylish, disturbing and ambiguous. What it's not is a typical Tom
Cruise movie. The meditative psychosexual drama plays like a waking
dream. Like many of Kubrick's classic films, it will prompt debate
over its deeper meaning and perceived outcome. Cruise and Nicole
Kidman give intense, soul-bearing performances that stand among the
best of their careers. (7/16) Strong sexual content, nudity,
profanity and drug content; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAUNTING''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) C
</P>
<P>
   Jan De Bont's grossly overblown adaptation of Shirley Jackson's
``The Haunting of Hill House'' assaults the senses with special
effects. The latter are all too obviously hydraulics or
computer-generated imagery, shattering the illusion that you are
witnessing any sort of supernatural phenomenon. Apart from Lili
Taylor, the cast hits one note each at the outset and sustains it
for the duration of the story. (7/23) Intense horror sequences; 13
and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``INSPECTOR GADGET''
</P>
<P>
   (PG) B-
</P>
<P>
   The live-action cartoon about a bumbling bionic cop is an
eye-popping, self-referential comedy for kids. What makes it more
of a go than Disney's similarly styled ``Flubber'' and ``My
Favorite Martian'' is that its premise calls for a deluge of
special effects. The film is great fun to watch. However, director
David Kellogg emphasizes gadgets over gags, resulting in more
chuckles than laughs. (7/23) Wacky action/violence, language and
innuendo; 8 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE IRON GIANT''
</P>
<P>
   (PG) A-
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from the 1968 children's book by British poet laureate
Ted Hughes, this animated adventure about the friendship between a
boy and a giant robot is a rare family film that leaves you all
choked up and wanting to cheer, no matter what your age. The
well-crafted film's strength is its intelligent story, which is
genuinely funny and remarkably moving. It also contains a wealth of
worthwhile messages. (8/6) Fantasy action and mild language; 6 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``LAKE PLACID''
</P>
<P>
   (R) D
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' is a crock. The comedic horror film about a
monstrous crocodile terrorizing a Maine lake is an easy payday for
stars Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman and Oliver Platt. But the gory
and badly written ``Jaws'' rip-off fails to translate
writer-producer David E. Kelley's golden touch (``Ally McBeal'') to
the silver screen. The only laughs come from hearing Betty White
cuss like ``South Park'' 's Eric Cartman. (7/16) Violence, gore,
profanity; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``LIFE''
</P>
<P>
   (R) B-
</P>
<P>
   The sweet but predictable story of two bickering inmates
unjustly sentenced to life in a Mississippi prison veers between
sentimental drama and sassy comedy, with sometimes touching and
often funny results. ``Life'' has more depth than expected,
particularly when it delves into racial issues, but the laughs are
fewer than one would imagine, given the talents of Eddie Murphy and
Martin Lawrence. (4/16) Strong profanity, violence; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MUMMY''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) C
</P>
<P>
   Universal Pictures' $80 million revival of its classic horror
franchise is an unscary special-effects extravaganza. ``The Mummy''
boasts some impressive visual effects, but the computer-generated
title creature is disappointing, and director Stephen Sommers
undercuts every potentially frightening scene with corny humor.
</P>
<P>
   (5/7) Adventure violence, partial nudity; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``MUPPETS FROM SPACE''
</P>
<P>
   (G) B
</P>
<P>
   The title is misleading _ no one goes to space _ but apart from
some stumbling by their human co-stars, the Muppets have little to
be ashamed of in this kids movie aimed squarely at _ surprise! _
kids. Gonzo goes in search of an identity, and we are left with a
warm heart. (7/14) Some bad puns, but nothing objectionable;
suitable for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``MYSTERY MEN''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Dark Horse Comics series, ``Mystery Men'' is a
rollicking, often-uproarious action comedy that soars on the
strength of its offbeat cast, which includes Ben Stiller, Janeane
Garofalo and Geoffrey Rush. The unevenly paced superhero spoof gets
off to a shaky start, but once it hits its hilarious stride, the
stylish and silly adventure will have audiences cackling like the
Joker. (8/6) Comic action violence, crude humor; 12 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``NEVER BEEN KISSED''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) C-
</P>
<P>
   Another romantic farce aimed at teen-agers, about an
ugly-duckling copy editor (Drew Barrymore) who gets her ``big
break'' as an undercover reporter posing as a high-school student.
Barrymore's scribe will atone for her adolescence, meet the ideal
man and help her brother (David Arquette) fulfill his dream, while
audiences wonder why the actress continues treading water in a sea
of cliched comedies. (4/9) Profanity, mild sexuality; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``NOTTING HILL''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B
</P>
<P>
   That beloved Brit, Hugh Grant, convincingly stars as a
bookseller who finds himself falling for a famous U.S. movie star
(Julia Roberts, essentially portraying herself). When she returns
the sentiment, which spawns a seemingly improbable premise, we're
treated to a crafty and agreeable never-the-twain-shall-meet tale
that rises above any concurrent romantic-comedy pretenders. (5/28)
Profanity, sexuality; 14 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``RUNAWAY BRIDE''
</P>
<P>
   (PG) C+
</P>
<P>
   Garry Marshall's latest entry in the romantic-comedy canon
flaunts ``Pretty Woman'' co-stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere as
the title heroine and big-city reporter. Audiences are taken on a
sweet, predictable journey sprinkled with laughs and heartache, but
they may struggle to accept the premise of someone backing out of
numerous weddings. (7/30) Adult language; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTH SENSE''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13) B-
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis gives a weighty, measured performance in this eerie
psychological thriller, but he is outshone by Haley Joel Osment as
an intense young boy who is terrorized by ghosts. The film is
effectively creepy, despite its muted tone and tendency to drag,
with many scary and disturbing scenes. The story builds to a
well-handled whammy of a plot twist that redeems the film's
shortcomings. (8/6) Intense scenes, violent images; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``TARZAN''
</P>
<P>
   (G) A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' is one of Disney's most visually beautiful animated
films and brings the character to life as never before. The rousing
and sometimes poignant adventure combines action, humor and romance
to make the familiar tale of a man raised by apes seem fresh and
exciting. The fast-paced film features several scenes of intense
peril and lacks a clear-cut villain, but it has a tremendous amount
of heart. (6/18) Nothing objectionable; 5 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR''
</P>
<P>
   (R) B-
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 romantic caper is retooled, glossed over and tweaked by
John McTiernan. It stars Pierce Brosnan as the title billionaire
who finds Rene Russo's investigator on his heels and under his
covers. Fascinating and steamy at turns, absurd and hokey at
others; ultimately a commendable remake, stylishly executed. (8/6)
Profanity, nudity; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``TRIPPIN' ''
</P>
<P>
   (R) C-
</P>
<P>
   G (short for Greg) is a high-school senior whose L.A. suburban
parents want him to get off his butt and fill out his college
applications. But G is caught up in stupid fantasy scenes, most of
which involve topless girls and untold wealth. The film can't
decide if it's an encompassing family drama, a romantic comedy, a
raucous farce, or a violent, shoot-'em-up thriller. What started
out as a parody of black stereotypes turns into one long parade of
them. (5/12) Vulgar language, partial nudity and violence.

THE CAR YOU COVET: WAS IT TOTALED? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ind., Ore., Pa., Conn., Md., Calif.)  (See also CARS-TITLE-HISTORY) 
(mk) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ann Hasselbach paid $27,000 for a low-mileage, three-year-old
Toyota Supra from A.J. Foyt Honda in Kingwood, Texas, in 1997. When
the car developed steering problems, the nursing student took it to
a mechanic, who gave her more bad news. It needed a new
transmission and its electrical systems required an overhaul
because it had been flooded. The seat belts were not even bolted
down, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she confronted the dealer's used-car manager, she said, he
denied knowing the car's history and declared the vehicle safe.
``Talk about anger,'' Ms. Hasselbach said. ``Even a slight fender
bender and I could have been dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the general manager at A.J. Foyt Honda, nor the dealer's
lawyers, returned phone calls seeking a response.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hasselbach's lawyer obtained a title history indicating that
the car had passed among three auto brokers in a year before
reaching the dealer. Only after filing suit against the dealer and
brokers for fraud did Ms. Hasselbach, 25, learn she had paid top
dollar for a cosmetically disguised wreck.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that a doctor from Beaumont, Texas, had
surrendered the once-flooded car to Progressive Insurance Co. after
receiving a $31,000 payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody did this intentionally,'' said Mark Lapidus,
Progressive's lawyer in Houston. ``I think what happened is, a
mistake was made and the paperwork didn't get sent.'' A trial is
set for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Concealing damage when reselling autos prompts so many
complaints that legislation to set a national car-title standard
has been proposed in Congress several times, only to collapse under
pressure from competing interest groups. Insurers, law enforcers,
the collision industry and consumer advocates agree that the issue
should be resolved, but they disagree over how.
</P>
<P>
   From 20 to 40 percent of the 2.3 million vehicles that are
declared ``totaled'' by insurers each year are rebuilt and put back
on the highway, some legally, some not, say experts who have
studied the problem. A significant portion of the vehicles that
insurers consider too damaged to repair are freshened up and
reregistered without their titles being branded as salvage _ the
category for cars that cannot be economically fixed. Telltale
signs, like spot frame welds and parts from different model years,
can be hard to detect.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Indiana, State Farm Mutual Insurance Co., the
nation's largest auto insurer, agreed to pay nearly $4 million in
restitution to settle a case involving extensively damaged cars it
had bought and resold without obtaining salvage titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hear from other states is that the practice is not
unique to Indiana,'' said Jeffrey Modisett, the state attorney
general. He said a similar investigation was under way in Iowa;
plaintiff's lawyers in Texas and New Jersey are at work on
class-action suits over similar allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Unscrupulous rebuilders and car thieves have plenty of
opportunity to reregister vehicles with clean titles or new
identification numbers, since there is no national database for
salvaged and stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   And state laws governing vehicle titles are inconsistent. In
Iowa, for example, a car must be given a salvage title if repairs
exceed 50 percent of a vehicle's value. In Texas, the threshold is
75 percent. States with relatively lax rules, like Oregon and
Pennsylvania, become havens for laundered vehicle titles, cleaned
through reregistration.
</P>
<P>
   A bill proposing a national standard for titling salvage
vehicles was approved in June by the Senate Commerce Committee. It
is supported by insurers and auto rebuilders, but opposed by
consumer groups and several state attorneys general. Critics hope
that the bill, written by Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority
leader, will be amended before it is considered by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general including Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut,
Joseph Curran Jr. of Maryland and Bill Lockyer of California oppose
the proposed federal standard, saying it is weaker than many
existing state laws that it would pre-empt. The proposal defines a
salvage vehicle as one needing repairs worth 75 percent of its
value, but exempts vehicles over six years old and those valued at
less than $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups support a competing bill by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif. Rather than focus on salvage vehicles it would
require presale damage disclosures on registrations, a condition
set in a few states including North Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. Her
bill, which would set criminal penalties, was not considered by the
Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers oppose rules requiring owners to tell potential buyers
about accident damage that falls short of salvage status. Insurers
do not want policy-holders' vehicles to be stigmatized over what
amounts to cosmetic damage, said Dave Hurst, a State Farm spokesman
in Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy repairs stem partly from the strong used-car market.
Insurers end up declaring repairable cars ``totaled'' and paying
policy-holders the full value, then recouping much of that expense
by selling the cars at auction, said Jack Rozint, marketing vice
president of CCC Information Services Inc., an auto claims
processor in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebuilder has a strong incentive to complete the repair as
cheaply as possible, as every penny saved goes in his pocket,''
Rozint said. ``The title still should be branded as salvage.''

CLUES ON THE WEB FOR TITLE SLEUTHS

  (With CARS-CONCEALED-DAMAGE)

<P>
   Prospective used-car buyers need not accept on faith assurances
about a car's history from salespeople or private parties. For $20,
consumers can obtain a title history from Carfax or VHR, rival
information providers that have long catered to insurers and auto
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Carfax began in 1985 as a service to dealers who wanted to avoid
buying problem cars at auction. A third of its business now comes
from consumers, who can check histories online at
www.carfaxonline.com or by calling (888) 422-7329.
</P>
<P>
   VHR, owned by CCC Information Services of Chicago, developed its
database from its business of auto-insurance claims processing. It
includes records on 18 million vehicles declared ``totaled'' by
insurers, said Jack Rozint, a company spokesman. Its Web site is
www.vehiclehistory.com.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' historical knowledge can be useful to buyers of
used cars. Even so, gaps exist in both databases, because a few
states have refused to make public their registration and title
records.
</P>
<P>
   Histories are indexed based on vehicle identification numbers
and labels like ``lemon buyback,'' ``salvage'' and ``gross
polluter.'' These red flags are sometimes excised when cars are
moved between states that use different definitions of what is a
lemon or a flooded vehicle. ``Title washing happens all the time,''
said Scott Fredericks, a spokesman for Carfax, which was recently
acquired by Polk Co. With a title history, consumers can learn the
previous registrations and transactions involving a vehicle,
whether it was repossessed or used as a taxi, and whether its
odometer was rolled back.

Freedom in the East Room of the White House to Americans who have
contributed greatly to this country. Three of the recipients were
Jewish. The message the Jewish community hears is simple,
straightforward and ancient. No matter how much you succeed, no
matter how hard you work to serve your country, there will always
be a man with a gun around the corner, saying: You may live in this
country, but you are not of it. Though one of the wealthiest and
most influential minorities in the country, Jews maintain a
wariness bred from a heritage of persecution. Despite their medals,
their money and their acceptance, it never quite goes away.

 &HT;    Christening gowns represent great beginnings
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They resemble miniature wedding dresses _ long and white, sewn
from linen, silk or delicate cotton batiste, and trimmed with rows
of dainty antique lace. They are christening gowns for infants,
worn on the day they're presented for baptism, a dedication or
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Some babies, such as the children and grandchildren of Queen
Elizabeth of England, wear heirloom gowns that have been in their
families for generations. Others, when presented in a church or at
home, wear a brand-new christening dress bought by a doting
grandmother. After time, this dress might be handed down and worn
by other babies in the family, thus creating a new tradition.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, part-time Greensboro, Ga., resident Joyce
Daniel, 44, has designed and custom made ``modern'' heirloom
christening gowns. Using age-old, sewing techniques such as French
seaming, pin tucking, smocking and hem stitching, she turns out
simple yet exquisite gowns in new age polyester/cotton blends as
well as linens and silk batiste. The designer has also used fabric
from a customer's wedding gown to make a christening dress for the
woman's firstborn. Each gown, which comes with a matching bonnet or
cap, is machine made, with most of the trims done by hand. Prices
range from $55-$150.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each gown is truly a labor of love,'' said Daniel who sells
her gowns _ The Joy Collection _ on the internet
(mtcnet.net/(tilde)mdantel). ``I learned to sew from my mother when
I was in the 6th grade and took classes in heirloom sewing at
Martha Pullen's School of Art Fashion in Huntsville. That's when I
developed a love for making christening gowns. They are special
dresses for such happy occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   As added touches, Daniel trims many of her dresses, which are
lined or have a slip, with antique laces and embroideries that she
cuts from old pillow cases and tablecloths. She also embroiders the
child's name and birthdate on the back of the dress. And if you
have a family gown that's too fragile to be worn, she will copy it
for you in another fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dresses, Daniel also makes romper suits for boys,
although many mothers choose to put their tiny boys in non-fussy
dresses. Daniel can also be reached at her home in Iowa:
712-722-4235.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't own a treasured old dress, you can find antique
christening dresses at estate sales and specialty shops. Cornelia
Powell on East Paces Ferry Road has a good selection of gowns from
the late 1800s through the early 1900s. ``A christening is a rite
of passage, like a confirmation and a wedding,'' said shop owner
Powell. ``These rituals require special dresses, which are usually
white, to signify purity.''
</P>
<P>
   All antique christening dresses were made by hand from linens,
silks or fine cottons. ``Sewing was, and is, a way for a woman to
express herself,'' said Powell. ``And what better way than by
sewing a christening gown for your baby.'' Antique gowns average
around $400.
</P>
<P>
   Christening gowns bought in stores such as Neiman Marcus in
Lenox Square and Jack &AMP; Jill's Children's Boutique in Alpharetta,
Ga., run the gamut, from simple to sumptuous. In Rich's stores,
short cotton christening gowns and little boys romper suits from
manufacturers Alexis and Feltman Brothers are popularly priced from
$30-$50. Royal Kids, a shop in Decatur, sells white christening
gowns starting at $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   At Gretchen's Children Shop on West Paces Ferry Road, big
sellers are long, hand-embroidered gowns from Feltman Brothers
ranging from $75 to $300 as well as more elaborate gowns from
Posies, which fall into the $200-$350 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find people are making a big production of christenings,''
said Gay Kattel, shop co-owner. ``They are wonderful celebrations
for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Trina Summins,who owns the children's shop Through the Looking
Glass on Roswell Road, says christening gowns by California
designer Isabel Garreton are popular with moms and grandmoms. ``The
dresses are beautiful,'' she said, ``in silks, linens and dotted
Swiss, with tucking and ribbon trims.'' Prices range from
$250-$350.
</P>
<P>
   Are high prices deterents for shoppers? It depends, according to
Summins. ``Some people ask, `Why spend so much on a dress that a
baby wears only once?' Others say, `We are happy to spend any
amount for this once-in-a-lifetime dress and occasion.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tips on preserving christening gowns:
</P>
<P>
   An antique christening gown must be carefully preserved to keep
it in tip-top shape. Follow these suggestions from Martha Pullen,
author and sewing instructor from Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  After each wearing, wash in a mixture of 1/2-cup detergent
(Biz works well) and a gallon of cold water. Soak continuously for
two weeks, to remove stains and spots, including rust. Line dry. Do
not starch or iron.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Never store the dress in plastic. Instead, wrap it in
acid-free tissue paper, available at art center stores, including
Binders. A 20-by-30-inch sheet is 15 cents. Or, carefully put the
washed and dried dress in a cotton pillowcase then staple it shut
and put in a bureau drawer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you want to display a new _ or old _ christening gown, put
it in a shadow box, with the booties, cap and birth certificate.
You can also dress a life-size doll in the christening gown and put
in on a bed grouped with other dolls and lace-trimmed pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Baptism gifts
</P>
<P>
   After a christening, friends and family often celebrate with
parents at a reception, brunch or party. Appropriate gifts should
be lasting mementos, which might be engraved with the baby's
initials or date of the christening. Silver is a typical gift and
could include a picture frame, a small comb and brush set, a mug or
cup or a fork-and-spoon set. Other silver suggestions: a baby
rattle, a Bible with a silver overlay, a keepsake box or a
christening cup that holds the water used in certain baptisms and
christening ceremonies. A bit more whimsical gift might be a small
toy, a piece of clothing such as a cotton bib or booties or a set
of children's china.

 &HT;    Classrooms will see cargo, Capri and vested interest
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Relaxed. Functional. Utility chic.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the terms designers and retailers use to describe the
clothes they're marketing toward students headed back to school
this fall. They're emphasizing clothes with such details as
textured fabric, multiple pockets, Velcro, zippers, hoods and
contrast stitching.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger predicts that his ``destroyed'' denim jeans will
be a hit. Lands' End is pushing chinos, snuggly cotton sweaters and
rugby shirts. Old Navy is promoting its fleece tech vest, while the
Gap hopes its nylon bungee pants and graphic T-shirts take off.
</P>
<P>
   If the merchandise in stores such as Macy's, Marshall's and
JCPenney is any indication, the hot colors this year are espionage
gray, virtual green, baby or slate blue, pink, red and other
brights. Patterns are mixed and matched, and textures are natural,
nubby, plush, shaggy or furry.
</P>
<P>
   For girls, the looks in pants will be khaki or chinos with
pleats or pockets, in cotton or stretch fabrics. Tops will be tiny
and tight, with three-quarter length sleeves. Two piece sweater
sets and shrugs will be around for another season, while hooded
cardigans that zip and half-zip tunics with kangaroo pockets make
their debut. Twill skorts (yes, that's how it's spelled) and cargo
skirts and jumpers with jumbo pockets offer form and function.
</P>
<P>
   For boys, the hot styles are stretch jersey and brushed flannel
shirts and waffle-weave knit tops. Anything hooded, whether it's a
shirt, sweater or outerwear, is cool. Pair it with cargo pants with
legs that are roomy but not baggy, or relaxed-fit carpenter jeans.
Basic bluejeans are passe. The top jean colors this year are
stone-washed, indigo or dark denim with motorcross influences.
Athletic gear will also be popular.
</P>
<P>
   The American Express Retail Index estimates that consumers will
spend an average of $455 per child on school clothes and supplies
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ashli Sims, a 13-year-old eighth-grader at Inman Middle School
in Atlanta, already knows how she'll spend her parents' money.
After looking at magazines such as Teen People and YM, she prepared
a list: ``I want Capri pants, tank tops, skorts, skirts, overalls
and three-quarter-length-sleeved shirts. I've seen what's in style,
and they're cool, comfortable and stylish.''
</P>
<P>
   Noah Killingsworth, who'll be in seventh grade at Inman, has two
must-haves for his fall lineup. ``I want a pair of Timberland
boots, and I like those new tech vests,'' he said. He also wants a
pair of Gap cargo pants in khaki.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just look nice,'' Noah says.
</P>
<P>
   But Caroline Kilpatrick, 14, doesn't plan to be among the trendy
ninth-grade crowd at Grady High School in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really follow trends,'' she says. ``I'll probably just
be wearing jeans and
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she wants a hooded jacket and a pair of cargo pants so
she can put a lot of stuff into the pockets, Caroline says she
won't be buying items such as tech vests and sweater shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't really like them that much. I'd rather have a
regular jacket.''

 &HT;    Saturn draws the faithful for Homecoming
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are car shows and cruise-ins. Then there's
Homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn owners from around the country gathered recently in the
company's ``hometown,'' Spring Hill, Tenn., for the automaker's
second Homecoming _ a two-day gathering that included concerts,
factory tours, food and a celebration of all things Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat Saturn owners Herbert Mock and Joan Brucher _ along with
sons Matt and Kevin Brucher _ traveled 850 miles from Wilkes-Barre,
Pa., to the festivities the last weekend in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy our car so much, we thought this would make a good
vacation and allow us to see just how our Saturn was built,'' Mock
said. ``I've always thought the car had great fuel economy and was
reliable. I wanted to see just how they put them together and maybe
get a peek at their new LS line.''
</P>
<P>
   Test drives in Saturn's first midsize car, the LS, also were on
the agenda. The vehicle will be built in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shircliff of Sherwood, Ark., was one member of the Saturn
Car Club whose members traveled in caravans to attend the
Homecoming. With 160 chapters nationwide, the club provides ``a
chance to enjoy our car together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A caravan of Saturn owners from Florida and Georgia passed
through metro Atlanta the day before the event, gathering at White
Water in Marietta to socialize and take a spin in the LS in the
parking lot before lining up at dawn for the drive to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have social functions and take trips together,'' Shircliff
said. ``We also get a discount on service and merchandise at our
Saturn retailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturn merchandise was plentiful at the Homecoming in Spring
Hill. There were blankets, hats, golf shirts, jackets, bandannas
and, of course, T-shirts. A popular one read, ``If you don't own
one _ you just wouldn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Homecoming in 1994 was held in torrential rains. This
year, more than 30,000 people each day braved triple-digit
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other car company would do this?'' asked Marcia
McDiarmid, whose family drove 600 miles from Grand Rapids, Mich.,
for the event. ``It's hot. We're all sweaty, but it makes you feel
special that they invite everybody down here like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the few events of the same size were an anniversary
gathering of Ford Mustang owners in Charlotte, N.C., earlier this
year, and the upcoming Corvette celebration planned for Labor Day
weekend just up Interstate 65 in Bowling Green, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn prepared for the hordes with air-conditioned tents, cool
buses to take people to the plant for tours and thousands of
gallons of drinking water. A host of food stands, tents and gazebos
gave owners an opportunity to escape the heat and chat about their
favorite subject _ Saturns.
</P>
<P>
   The attractions rivaled a county fair: amusement rides, sporting
activities, food and entertainment, including Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, the Temptations, and Blood, Sweat
and Tears.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Bowden, a former Atlanta-area resident and now a Saturn
employee, volunteered to work Homecoming in the morning before
reporting to her regular shift at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   She said she volunteered because it really got her ``charged up
to see how excited people get about their cars. It makes me want to
build them an even better car.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was organized by the car company and the United Auto
Workers. And it wasn't free. Adults paid $40 each and $15 per child
ages 6-17

TREASURY YIELDS SKYROCKET, FUELED BY STRONG RETAIL SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yields of Treasury securities moved sharply higher
Thursday as stronger-than-expected retail sales kept investor
concerns alive that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term
interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Also weighing on the market was a $10 billion government bond
sale, which generally reduces demand for existing issues anyway. It
was the third and final part of the Treasury's $37 billion
quarterly refunding this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bond auction did not go as well as some market participants
had hoped. The issue's high yield came in at 6.144 percent, which
was slightly higher than expected. But even as the number of bids
for the securities produced an acceptable bid-to-cover ratio of
2.22 to 1, retail demand was weak.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, the price of the current 30-year bond
dropped 13/32, to 86 12/32, while its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.27 percent from 6.21
percent on Wednesday. The newly auctioned long bond saw its yield
rise to 6.17 percent from an average 6.113 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market participants are now firmly convinced that another Fed
move to a less accommodative policy stance will take place at the
Aug. 24 FOMC meeting,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at
Chase Asset Management. The Fed last raised rates on June 30, when
it increased the overnight lending rate between banks, known as the
Federal funds target rate, a quarter-point, to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this juncture, the best planning assumption looks for a
quarter-point rise in the target federal funds rate to a level of
5.25 percent,'' Fine said. Furthermore, he added, an additional
quarter-point increase seems likely at the Fed's meeting on Oct. 5
in light of rising prices and wages amid a buoyant economy with low
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales in July rose a greater-than-expected seven-tenths
of a percent, although a downward revision to the June data took
some sting out of the number. The latest weekly jobless claims were
also interesting, Fine said, as the four-week moving average
registered a cyclical low of 288,250, a sign of an extraordinarily
tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   On that note, the market is awaiting the release Friday of
Producer Price Index data for July. While the core rate is expected
to be subdued, rising energy prices are projected to raise the
overall index by three-tenths of a percent to four-tenths of a
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to be released Friday are business inventory
figures for June and the University of Michigan's mid-month
consumer sentiment survey, the first look at consumer attitudes in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Ake, Treasury note trading manager for First Union
Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C., said Thursday, ``The Street bid
on the long bond today and they now own it, while for the most part
the retail side continues to wait for upcoming inflation data
before they decide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What direction short-term interest rates will take will be
dictated by those numbers,'' Ake said. ``However, the real question
is how many more Fed tightenings will it take? The market is
betting on not too many more in the pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of weeks, the yield on the 30-year bond
should hover around 6.25 percent, Ake said.

and, of course, T-shirts. A popular one read, ``If you don't own
one _ you just wouldn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Homecoming in 1994 was held in torrential rains. This
year, more than 30,000 people each day braved triple-digit
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other car company would do this?'' asked Marcia
McDiarmid, whose family drove 600 miles from Grand Rapids, Mich.,
for the event. ``It's hot. We're all sweaty, but it makes you feel
special that they invite everybody down here like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the few events of the same size were an anniversary
gathering of Ford Mustang owners in Charlotte, N.C., earlier this
year, and the upcoming Corvette celebration planned for Labor Day
weekend just up Interstate 65 in Bowling Green, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn prepared for the hordes with air-conditioned tents, cool
buses to take people to the plant for tours and thousands of
gallons of drinking water. A host of food stands, tents and gazebos
gave owners an opportunity to escape the heat and chat about their
favorite subject _ Saturns.
</P>
<P>
   The attractions rivaled a county fair: amusement rides, sporting
activities, food and entertainment, including Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, the Temptations, and Blood, Sweat
and Tears.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Bowden, a former Atlanta-area resident and now a Saturn
employee, volunteered to work Homecoming in the morning before
reporting to her regular shift at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   She said she volunteered because it really got her ``charged up
to see how excited people get about their cars. It makes me want to
build them an even better car.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was organized by the car company and the United Auto
Workers. And it wasn't free. Adults paid $40 each and $15 per child
ages 6-17

JACKSON SEEKS TO HELP PUERTO RICO REGAIN BOMBING RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson, forging a
potentially powerful political alliance with Hispanics, launched a
nationwide campaign Thursday to persuade the White House to
surrender a controversial military bombing range on the Puerto
Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson joined Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello and Rick
Dovalina, national president of the U.S.-based League of United
Latin American Citizens, to urge the Clinton administration to end
the Navy's ``occupation'' of a 58-year-old maneuver area where a
bombing accident in April killed a Puerto Rican security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the alliance of African-Americans and Hispanics
over the future of nearby Vieques could affect the possible Senate
campaign of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York, as well
as the presidential campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly an American fight,'' Jackson declared. ``What is
happening in Vieques is un-American and undemocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson urged President Clinton to ``take the same decisive
action to free Vieques that he took to free Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added: ``I'm hopeful that the same spirit that prevailed
in the struggle for freedom from occupation in Kosovo will prevail
in the struggle for freedom from occupation in Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson planned to visit Vieques on Friday to hold an ecumenical
religious service at a beach-front camp set up by some of the more
than three dozen protesters who have occupied the 899-acre impact
area for live ordnance since the April 19 accident.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of a Marine FA-18 fighter-bomber mistakenly targeted
the range observation post located more than a mile from his
approved practice target and dropped two 500 pound bombs, killing
David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, a civilian employee of the Navy, and
wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,300 civilians live on the 22-mile-long island, two
thirds of which was acquired by the Navy beginning in 1941 as a
forward base at the outset of World War II when Nazi submarines
were prowling the Caribbean. The Navy controls 22,000 acres of the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that the positions that presidential and Senate
candidates take on the question of Vieques are ``reasonable litmus
tests for all who would dare lead a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson vowed: ``I can assure you that once we leave this place
and take our case to the people of New York in great numbers, and
Illinois and Texas and California and Florida, this issue will be a
critical matter on the agenda for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson promised ``major educational rallies'' on the Vieques
dispute in states with large Hispanic populations, including
California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The five states control more than half the 280 electoral votes
that a candidate for president must win to capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is preparing a possible Senate campaign in New York
against the likely Republican candidate, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 2.6 million Hispanics, New York state ranks
third behind California and Texas with the largest Hispanic
population, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, the Democratic governor of the U.S. commonwealth, said
that Puerto Ricans are ``all very grateful'' for Jackson's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.8 million residents of the island territory, which was
seized by the United States in the Spanish-American War in 1898,
are American citizens by birth. But they do not vote in
presidential elections. Nor do they have full voting representation
in the House or the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said Jackson's involvement ``will be very helpful in
our cause to make sure that the Navy finishes their military
exercises in Vieques and that they retire from using Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Dovalina, the Hispanic leader who joined the effort, said the
black-Hispanic coalition could pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can stay focused on the issue without all the local
divisions cropping up, we can have a great impact,'' Dovalina said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson joined a coalition of religious leaders here in Puerto
Rico to sign a letter to Clinton requesting a White House meeting
next week to discuss the Vieques dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton awaits a Pentagon panel's recommendation on possible
solutions to the controversy. The report is due at the White House
by Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie A. Gadlin, press secretary for Jackson's Chicago-based
Rainbow-Push Coalition, said that Jackson would be willing to work
as an intermediary to seek a compromise between the Navy's
insistence that live-fire resume on Vieques and Puerto Rico's
demands that the bombing moratorium continue indefinitely as the
Navy withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Navy and Marines Corps contend that live-fire
training on Vieques remains essential to prepare aviators, sailors
and Marines for possible combat overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and his aides said the veteran civil rights leader has
spoken to Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and unnamed officials at the White House in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we can do to support the Navy in a graceful exit out
of Vieques, we'll do to help it leave,'' Jackson said. ``When our
Navy honors the will of the people here ... it's good for the Navy,
it's good for America, and it's good for Puerto Rico.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Officials here said they were more hopeful that Clinton would
honor Puerto Rico's request for Navy withdrawal following the
president's decision on Wednesday to offer conditional clemency to
16 Puerto Rican nationalists who have been imprisoned in the United
States for their roles in a wave of 130 bomb attacks on political
and military targets in the United States from 1974 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered to commute sentences ranging from 15 years to 90
years if the pro-independence Puerto Ricans requested commutations,
renounced violence and satisfied conditions set by law or parole
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would visit the prisoners in the next several
weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PATHUM THANI, Thailand _ The sheer psychic power of 30,000
people meditating together can make miracles happen, say the monks
here at the headquarters of Thailand's biggest, richest and _ to
the established priesthood _ most dangerous new Buddhist sect.
</P>
<P>
   Last Oct. 5, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In the harsh heat of the afternoon, worshipers say, the sun
seemed to soften above them into a cool crystal ball. Then the
vivid image of the sect's founder materialized within the ball,
deep in meditation along with his followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tens of thousands of people saw it,'' said Chuleeporn
Chungrangsee, a witness. ``Some saw only a halo effect. Some saw
the sun spinning in rainbow colors.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle was reported widely in Thai newspapers, along with
pictures of the sect's newly constructed temple, a vast, low-slung
building that sits in the dry fields, 30 miles north of Bangkok,
looking like a slightly menacing flying saucer.
</P>
<P>
   People suddenly became aware that a huge and unsettling
religious movement had been growing in their midst and had put up
by far the largest temple in the land.
</P>
<P>
   The movement calls itself Dhammakaya (pronounced tah-mah-guy),
and the circular shape of its main temple is meant to represent the
universe, a fitting symbol: Its leaders intend it to become the
central landmark of world Buddhism, a sort of Vatican or Mecca for
their faith, whether the established hierarchy likes it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Already the movement claims to have more than 100,000 followers
who gather in temples around Thailand and 10 foreign countries,
including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Religious scholars and commentators say this is a movement for
its time _ a sign of the failure of the established priesthood in
Thailand to minister to a changing, modernizing nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dhammakaya, they say, offers solace to Thailand's newly affluent
middle class _ with its newly acquired middle-class angst _ left
reeling and rootless by two decades of heady economic growth
followed two years ago by a sudden and dislocating crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forgot where we were going,'' said Manit Rattanasuwan, an
advertising executive who worships in Pathum Thani. ``Our
youngsters want to be like Westerners, with their music and clothes
and outgoing style, not so serious about life. And the old
traditions cannot deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another worshiper, Penchara Asavasopon, managing director of an
executive-search company, offered a familiar middle-class
complaint. ``These days we hardly find time for the children, for
the family,'' she said. ``We have all these problems with
teen-agers, with drugs, so many things. So we are looking for some
activities that the whole family can do together, like
meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is making money. Over the last two decades, many
here say, it has become a national pursuit, as much a part of
today's Thai culture as its Buddhist traditions. That's fine with
Dhammakaya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience is the globalizing middle class, and Dhammakaya
is telling people they can have it both ways,'' said Suwanna
Satha-Anand, a professor of philosophy at Chulalongkorn University.
``It is trying to transform Buddhism to make it comfortable with
both capitalism and consumer culture.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said: ``One teaching is, you make money Monday
to Friday, then on Saturday and Sunday you come to the temple and
meditate and your mind will be more supple and clear so that on
Monday you can make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has thrown Thai Buddhism into an uproar. The sect's
leader, Phra Dhammachayo, 55, has been accused of fraud and
embezzlement as well as religious heresy. Newspapers are filled
with demands that he be tried or defrocked or both.
</P>
<P>
   The top body of Thai Buddhism, the Sangha, has demanded the
abbot's removal and has summoned him for questioning _ all of which
he has ignored, only deepening the public's sense that the
traditional religious structure has become weak and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy strikes at the cultural heart of Thailand, where
Buddhism is a state religion in all but name and most of the
country's 60 million people follow the established religion. There
are 40,000 temples in Thailand and 300,000 full-time monks, whose
numbers are augmented each year by tens of thousands of young men
who enter the monkhood for a short stay.
</P>
<P>
   But respect for the monkhood has been shaken in recent years by
scandals involving corruption and criminality. Monks frequently
attract followers and make money by telling fortunes and suggesting
lucky lottery numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it in a nutshell, traditional Buddhism does not cater
for modern Thai people, only for those who go to temples for
superstitions or astrologers or fortune telling,'' said Sulak
Sivaraksa, a Buddhist scholar and social critic. ``Otherwise people
only care about the temples for funeral services and car parking.''
Many temples make extra money by letting out their grounds for
parking.
</P>
<P>
   Or in other words, said Kavi Chongkitavarn, a columnist for the
Nation, an English-language daily: ``It is Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Suwanna offered a telling detail. ``Over 95 percent of all
the textbooks the monks read today were either written, revised or
supervised by one monk, and that monk lived almost one century
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Wat Dhammakaya, the main temple, is modern: clean,
efficient, quiet, with a huge underground garage and ample bathroom
facilities. Almost all its monks have college degrees, while most
other monks have only minimal education.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most temples, this one is a place where people come to
spend the day, eating and meditating together. Dressed mostly in
white _ a sign of purity _ they sit cross-legged in a huge
open-sided hangar, with the distant abbot cloned conveniently on
hundreds of television monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Insulated from the traffic, the pollution and the abandoned,
half-built office buildings of Bangkok, the giant temple offers its
adherents a vague, one-world utopianism that has as much in common
with New Age optimism as with Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``World peace through inner peace,'' proclaims the temple's
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the new religion is peacefulness,'' Manit said. ``Maybe
we can share that. Share the similarities, avoid the differences;
that is what we always say.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We are at the forefront. Maybe that is why we are
being attacked.''

ANOTHER RUSSIAN CRISIS - HO HUM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If in watching President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest game
of political shuffleboard, you feel you have seen this movie
somewhere before, you are almost right. It was called ``Groundhog
Day,'' the 1993 film where Bill Murray plays a man who is condemned
to reliving the same events over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   So it is here in Moscow where ordinary citizens and political
commentators are wearily picking their way through the debris of
what some were still calling a government crisis, despite the fact
that Yeltsin has changed his government so many times in the last
17 months _ four to be exact _ that the word ``crisis'' has lost
all meaning.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday one well-known political analyst,
Vyacheslav Nikonov, marveled at the turnout. ``I am surprised at
the attention,'' he said, ``since this latest government crisis is
the most predictable, understandable and boring of all government
crises'' _ to date, he might have added.
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers have become so blase that many started their
first day of reporting on Yeltsin's replacement of one prime
minister for another with a resounding, ``I told you so,'' under
headlines that ranged from the ``The Agony of a Dinosaur'' to
``Total Eclipse.'' It is true that many journalists had been
predicting the fall of Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin (mind you,
as one of several possible scenarios) for days, even weeks but
Communist leader Gennadi Zyuganov took the prize for political
prescience by reminding anyone who would listen that he had
predicted it last May when Stepashin first took office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as attention turns to the more serious issue of an ugly
little war on Russia's southern border, the politicians are left to
take stock of the latest gamble by the man who has once again shown
his determination to dominate the Russian political stage, no
matter the cost to the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a transitional prime minister serving for a lame-duck
president, Vladimir V. Putin's personal qualification for his
latest job seem to be the least of anybody's concerns. As for his
policies, he has indicated that they will differ little from those
of Stepashin, which after three months in office, weren't all too
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts and politicians expect Putin to be confirmed by
the Parliament's lower house, where deputies are eager to get on
with business of running for reelection next December. For this
they need to hold onto their seats, free plane tickets, phones and
faxes which would be taken away from them if they repudiate the
president's choice three times, forcing him to disband the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the change at the top of Russia's government
promises to make no difference to the political status quo, except
in one respect: Yeltsin has said he wants to see his latest prime
minister succeed him as president when he is supposed, according to
the Russian Constitution, to step down next July. This week,
Yeltsin once again promised to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   How Yeltsin expects Putin to get elected is still a mystery. The
president himself is deeply unpopular, and has no political party
at his command. His influence is waning rapidly, as became clear
last week when the Kremlin tried, and failed, to stop Moscow Mayor
Yuri M. Luzhkov from joining forces with a group of powerful
regional governors, thus taking a commanding lead in the bid for
the political center.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Fatherland-All Russia'' alliance _ which next week may
be boosted by former Prime Minister Yevgeni M. Primakov's
long-awaited return to politics _ was, by all accounts, the
catalyst for the dismissal of Stepashin, who seems to have been
judged by Yeltsin to be too weak, too neutral or both to fight the
Kremlin's battles and become a viable presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   By naming Putin, Yeltsin has signaled that the battle will go
on. The weapons of choice will probably be the media _ much of it
under the control of the Kremlin and its ally, financier Boris A.
Berezovsky _ and the flow of money from the federal treasury. The
targets will most likely be Zyuganov's Communists and Luzhkov's new
alliance, with or without Primakov at its head.
</P>
<P>
   In resorting to these tactics, several analysts have noted the
Kremlin will be refighting the war of 1996, which it won with
Yeltsin's remarkable come-from-behind victory over Zyuganov in the
second round of presidential elections. But the situation this time
is different, starting with a thoroughly disgusted electorate that
probably wouldn't buy a used car that came recommended by their
outgoing president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a feeling in the Kremlin one can get anyone
elected if all the information resources and huge financial means
are committed to support him,'' said Nikonov Wednesday. ``Honestly,
I doubt this is so. As you know from marketing theory, there are
some goods that are impossible to sell. And this applies to
political marketing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The December Parliamentary elections will set down an important
marker for the Yeltsin Kremlin since the Constitution forbids a new
Parliament from being disbanded in its first year. That means an
end to the government merry-go-round next year, since the
Parliament would be unlikely to accept a new Yeltsin-nominated
prime minister, should Yeltsin find Putin wanting.
</P>
<P>
   The real test of Yeltsin's gamble comes next year, in the race
for post-Yeltsin presidency. Discounting Zyuganov's chances,
Nikonov predicted that ``at present, the only credible future
presidents of Russia are Primakov, Luzhkov and the man who occupies
the post of prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   If the race were held today, Putin would be the dark horse.
``True, dark horses sometimes win,'' said Nikonov. ``But usually
they lose. That is why either Yeltsin and his family are ready to
take a big risk by staking on Putin, or Putin is a temporary
figure, or there will be no presidential elections in the
country.''

 &HT;    Jews face persecution despite success, wealth
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Three hours after a 37-year-old gunman
told police he shot three small children at a Jewish Community
Center in Los Angeles as ''a wake-up call to America to kill
Jews,'' President Clinton awarded seven Medals of Freedom in the
East Room of the White House to Americans who have contributed
greatly to this country. Three of the recipients were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The message the Jewish community hears is simple,
straightforward and ancient. No matter how much you succeed, no
matter how hard you work to serve your country, there will always
be a man with a gun around the corner, saying: ``You may live in
this country, but you are not of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though one of the wealthiest and most influential minorities in
the country, Jews maintain a wariness bred from a heritage of
persecution. Despite their medals, their money and their
acceptance, it never quite goes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me quote Golda Meir,'' said Bill Gralnick, the southeast
director of the American Jewish Committee. ''Just because we're
paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get us.''
</P>
<P>
   In 2,000 years in the diaspora, Jews have never had it as good
as they have it in America today. Virtually all the barriers have
been knocked down. A generation after they were barred from Ivy
League universities, the presidents of more than half of those
schools today are Jewish. The grandsons and granddaughters of
tailors and merchants are now CEOs and senators. The world laughs
with ``Seinfeld'' and screams for Goldberg, the wrestler, to thrash
his opponent in sold-out arenas. The rock band Phish plays
thousand-year-old Jewish folk music to a generation of college
students who travel from city to city to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   But the confidence of Jewish-Americans about their place in
society rests on a cracked foundation. Along with Hebrew lessons
and holiday rituals, Jewish children all over the world are also
taught about the pogroms and the Spanish Inquisition and the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell kids from the age of 3 that Haman tried to kill the
Jews. We teach kids what the Pharaoh did. We tell kids that the
Romans (ripped) the skin off our bodies. We teach the kids this
because there is evil in the world, and people can be bad,'' said
Rabbi Richard Yellin of Temple Emeth in suburban Delray Beach. ``We
teach them this because eternal vigilance is always necessary to
keep evil at bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a day-to-day concern
</P>
<P>
   The result is as complicated as the identity of any hyphenated
American. Jews, by and large, don't think about anti-Semitism in
America on a day-to-day basis. They don't have to; there were only
about 350 anti-Semitic incidents reported to the Anti-Defamation
League in the United States last year, and America has more legal
safeguards against bigotry than any country Jews have called home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a group, Jews work disproportionately hard for civil
rights and in support of liberal causes. Part of this concern is
based on the Jewish mandate of Tikkun Olam _ to heal the world _
and part of it is self-interest to guard against a society that can
devolve into anarchy and savage its minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie ``Annie Hall,'' Woody Allen boils down what happens
when this feeling of otherness slides into paranoia. Allen is asked
by a stranger on a New York street, ``Did you eat?'' He is
convinced the stranger is an anti-Semite. Did you hear what he
said? Allen asks his friend. ``Did Jew eat? Jew?''
</P>
<P>
   When a swastika appears on the door of a synagogue or an
Uzi-toting madman with links to neo-Nazi groups walks into a day
care center, the events are understood to be what they are _
isolated attacks. Desperate acts of the lunatic fringe. But they
are also perceived in a larger context of all that's happened in
the past and as the possible precursors to something much more
organized and much more malignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jews talk about non-Jews, they invariably talk about how
non-Jews talk about Jews,'' writes Joshua Halberstam in his book,
``Schmoozing: The Private Conversations of American Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam goes on to write that overt anti-Jewish
discrimination in America is almost nonexistent, but the
sensitivity to it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Fine-tuned `antennae'
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell an American Jew that another Holocaust is imminent, or
even possible, and you will be accused of paranoia, but tell the
same Jew that anti-Semitism doesn't lurk in the country and you
will be accused of naivete. Jewish antenna remain set to the on
position, fine-tuned and sensitive, ever ready to pick up even the
finest murmur of Jew hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could what happened in L.A. happen here? I don't see why it
couldn't,'' said Robin Kanel of Palm Beach Gardens, whose children
attend a Jewish day school on the campus of the West Palm Beach
Jewish Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I thought (when I heard about the shooting)
was I'm sure glad we have Don (the security guard at Meir Academy).
My daughter is going into sixth grade, and he doesn't let anyone on
campus. I felt more certain than ever that we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Heightened security
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, security at Jewish community centers was increased
about 10 years ago after a spate of anti-Semitic acts, according to
Harry Rosen, a consultant from Lake Worth who has helped build more
than 100 centers across the country. But he adds, overall, security
is still not particularly good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to tighten things very quickly,'' Rosen said.
''It's already happening. Things won't stay as relaxed as they are.
People won't let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rothchild, director of the Palm Beach Regional
Anti-Defamation League, said his office has received calls from
Jewish groups wondering if they should cancel meetings. Rothchild
tells them not to barricade the doors. He is also organizing a
security conference for Jewish organizations with local police and
FBI to be held today.
</P>
<P>
   Geography and numbers, it would seem , should insulate South
Florida's Jewish community _ the third-largest in the United
States. Boca Raton is to Florida what Paris is to France. Jews here
are, by and large, successful and empowered. So, too, in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But if Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., the man who barged into the JCC
in Los Angeles, went there to send a message that even in the heart
of the one of the wealthiest Jewish communities in the world, Jews
can be shot, he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   `It really is bothersome'
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime that a religious place _ and by that I just mean a
place under the auspices of a faith community _ anytime a place
like this is encroached upon, it really is bothersome,'' said
Bishop Anthony O'Connell of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm
Beach. ''And when it happens on a place of a Jewish community, it
stirs up fears in all of us and I think it's good. It shows that
we're tuned into the past and we're tuned into a people that have
suffered extraordinary injustices in the name of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews _ even non-observant Jews _ identify with other Jews
because they have so often been treated as a single entity.
Paradoxically, when an attack is perpetrated, it acts as a unifying
force in the Jewish community _ as in any community when a
substantial tragedy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   How much this incident will heighten the Jewish community's
wariness remains to be seen. Rabbi Stephen Pinsky of Temple Beth
Torah in Wellington said he did not think there would be a guard at
the door of his synagogue during the High Holy Days next month.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would post a guard if there were another violent
anti-Semitic attack between now and then, Pinsky replied: ''I think
the answer is to build bridges and not build walls. But in the
meantime, we'd better watch our doors.''

ANDOVER.NET BUYING LINUX SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Andover.net does not make products based on
the Linux operating system, but it is becoming mighty chummy with
those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Founded to create and market graphics software, Andover.net has
morphed into a provider of Web-based services and information
through its popular Dave Central Web site. Now it is on a buying
spree, acquiring major Internet sites devoted to providing
information about the trendy Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is the leading edge of a software phenomenon called ``open
source,'' in which software is designed to allow advanced users to
modify and customize the programs running on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Andover.net bought Slashdot, one of the
best-known Web sites for expert information on Linux and other
open-source computing topics. Then on Tuesday, the Acton, Mass.
company revealed it had bought Freshmeat, another leading Linux
site, which specializes in providing news on the latest software
packages.
</P>
<P>
   And if that wasn't enough to get the geeks' attention,
Andover.net threw one of the biggest parties at this week's
LinuxWorld Expo, a beer bash that attracted thousands of thirsty
computer buffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an effort to invest in Linux and open source,'' said
Andover.net chief executive Bruce Twickler. The spectacular success
of Wednesday's initial public offering of stock in Linux software
company Red Hat Software Inc. suggests that companies that build
strong positions in the fast-growing Linux market could reap lavish
rewards. Twickler hopes to establish Andover.net as a top provider
of information and services to the Linux community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a technology Web site for three years,'' said
Twickler. Andover.net was founded in 1992 to sell graphic design
software, and embraced the Internet as a potent sales tool. The
site also began to accept advertising from other software firms.
``By the end of 1996, we were making more money from advertising
than we were from our own software products.''
</P>
<P>
   So Twickler decided to focus on Web publishing, and has homed in
on the market for Linux information. ``We already have a million
and a half visitors to Andover.net who are not Linux users.''
Twickler thinks many of these are serious computer users ripe for
conversion to the open-source camp, and he expects to win them over
with links to Slashdot and Freshmeat.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the transaction haven't been disclosed, but
both sites will retain a great deal of editorial independence.
Indeed, the sites' founders are now employees of Andover.net.
Slashdot founder Rob Malda and Freshmeat creator Patrick Lenz spent
most of LinuxWorld seated on brightly colored inflatable sofas,
pounding away on laptop computers linked to their Web sites. They
were editing messages and news stories, constantly updating their
popular pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone from 70 hours a week to 50 hours a week,'' said
Malda, who established Slashdot with several friends from Hope
College in Holland, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lenz came to LinuxWorld from Wallrabenstein, Germany,
where he also works at a computer reseller firm owned by his
father. He said he will now be free to focus on improving the
quality of Freshmeat, rather than just concentrate on basic
maintenance tasks. ``I'm going to grow Freshmeat even bigger,'' he
vowed.

in memoirs published Thursday by the German daily Die Welt. The
statement, part of an attempt by Eichmann to portray himself as a

AFTER TORNADO, SALT LAKE CITY COUNTS ITS BLESSINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Among the expensive houses in the hills
overlooking City Creek Canyon, the brick ranch on 18th Avenue was
about the hardest hit by the tornado that tore through Salt Lake
City at lunchtime on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The roof was gone. Walls were missing. Pieces of a life shared
by the owners, Glorya G. Schow and her husband, La Mar P. Smith,
were strewn about like pieces of shattered glass. But like so many
people in Salt Lake after the terrifying moments in which the
tornado snaked northeast through downtown into the hills above the
city, Ms. Schow and her husband were lucky. They were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Deedee Corradini said Thursday that the death toll
remained at one. The victim was Allen Crandy, 38, of Las Vegas, who
was helping exhibitors set up booths outdoors for a sporting goods
convention that had been scheduled to start Thursday. It will start
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Crandy was hit by a steel beam from a tent in which the booths
were going up. About 70 people were injured seriously enough to
require hospitalization, the mayor said. A few of them were still
in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the city escaped catastrophic consequences of
the storm, which meteorologists said was a rare event for this
region of the Rocky Mountains. Most of the damage was limited to
isolated areas of downtown, where billions of dollars of
construction are under way for the 2002 winter Olympics, and the
upper-income neighborhoods beyond.
</P>
<P>
   No monetary estimate has been made of the damage, but it is
certain to reach into the millions, said Sen. Robert F. Bennett of
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, cleanup crews were busy clearing fallen trees,
restoring power and boarding up broken windows. The tornado was
rated as an F-2, on a scale that ranks twisters according to their
wind velocity, from an F-0, with winds up to 72 miles per hour, to
an F-5, which has winds in excess of 270 mph. Winds from 112 to 157
mph are considered an F-2.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the speed of the twister on Wednesday, debris from the
Delta Center, the home of the Utah Jazz basketball team, and
Assembly Hall, a building under construction by the Mormon Church,
was scattered as far as Ms. Schow's neighborhood, more than five
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest-hit spots was the open area where two large
white tents had been constructed to house the overflow from the
annual sporting goods convention in the Salt Palace, the city's
main convention center. The sporting goods convention is the
biggest in the state each year, with 18,000 visitors. While many
vendors were setting up their displays in the Salt Palace, others
had space under the tents, at least until the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   The high winds shredded the tents and toppled the supporting
beams. John Davis, a salesman from Vancouver who was setting up his
wares when the storm approached, said he found safety under a
nearby flatbed truck. He said he watched the tents fairly
disintegrate as winds sent the interior into a whirling frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to me 5-year-old son last night who saw it on TV,''
Davis said. ``He asked me if I went to Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wyndham Hotel, which stands beside the Salt Palace and
adjacent to where the tents stood, was also damaged extensively,
with gas leaks and many windows blown out. The hotel was filled
with conventioneers, who were evacuated and sent to other hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Weller, a vendor from York, Me., was attending a meeting on
the second floor when the tornado approached. ``It was like a bomb
went off,'' he said. ``Some people were really freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   Corradini, who joined state and federal officials at a news
conference at the Schow house because it was judged to be one of
the worst hit, said 121 houses in the city were damaged, with 34 of
them uninhabitable. But she and other officials, including Gov.
Michael O. Leavitt, said they had been assured by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency that the federal government would
contribute to cleanup and renovations costs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, insurance adjusters are here to assess the damage to
Ms. Schow's house, which was built in 1960 and had a current sale
value of about $300,000. Still, her eyes welled with tears as she
recalled the happenstance that kept her and her husband out of
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gone to a friend's funeral,'' she said, standing on her
front lawn, now piled with broken furniture and other belongings.
``Afterward, we decided to go out for lunch. If we had come home,
we would have been here when this happened. We could have lost our
lives. The house, we can rebuild.''

JOHNSTON SHRUGS OFF POSTER FAUX PAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the reigning World Boxing Council lightweight champion,
Stevie Johnston will lend some marquee value to Saturday night's
12-round title fight against Angel Manfredy at Foxwoods Casino
Hotel. But to look at the posters hyping the fight, you'd think
Manfredy, who gets top billing, ranks as the bigger name.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Diaz, Johnston's trainer, says the slight has not gone
unnoticed by his fighter, who is 28-1 with 14 knockouts and has
dropped weight to fight Manfredy (28-3-1, 21 KOs) on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've leaped up to another level as a lightweight now, and I'm
fighting at my natural weight and I feel so strong and so fast
now,'' Manfredy said Thursday. ``I feel like I'm in the zone right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manfredy-Johnston bout _ or is it Johnston-Manfredy? _ will
headline a card that includes a 10-round bout between junior
lightweights Arturo Gatti (29-4, 24 KOs) and Reyes Munoz (21-3, 9
KOs).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming down (in weight),'' said Diaz, speaking on behalf
of Johnston, whom he barred from prefight interviews. ``And in
boxing _ in a fight between two good fighters _ the rule is that
the big man always beats the small man.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the 5-foot-4-inch Johnston, who claims to
be a ``small but bad'' southpaw, will likely be physically
overshadowed by the taller Manfredy, 24, of Gary, Ind., who will
pose quite a menacing figure when he enters the ring wearing a
devil's mask, as has been his custom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little shorter than I am,'' Manfredy said. ``But,
body-wise, I think I'm bigger and stronger. But lightweight is my
weight and I'm going to let it be known when I take care of him
easily and quickly. I'm not going to let him breathe. I'm going to
be all over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said Johnston ``knows Manfredy is a tough customer, and he
will take care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear Manfredy and Johnston are entering the fight
heading in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Manfredy, who hasn't lost since suffering a technical knockout
in an IBF super featherweight title bout against Floyd Mayweather
Dec. 19 in Miami, has looked strong in his last two fights. After
the Mayweather loss, Manfredy came back and savagely beat Ernesto
Benitez to score a third-round technical knockout. He followed that
victory with another April 17, outclassing Ivan Robinson in a
10-round decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for Manfredy to be in front of Stevie, and so
we're going to be looking to counter,'' Diaz said. ``We don't need
to be toe-to-toe. We can if we want to, but we're going to box him.
We're not going to do any running _ just boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Manfredy, ``I expect him to fight. I'm a boxer-puncher and
I'll be right in front of him. I'll be right there, right in front
of him, and he's not going to be able to breathe. He's going to
have to come through me to get his oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston struggled his last time out, needing 12 rounds to earn
a decision over Aldo Rios, an inferior opponent, June 26 in Las
Vegas. According to Diaz, Johnston suffered a setback by splitting
his training time between his hometown of Denver and Las Vegas,
where Diaz's gym is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him not coming to Vegas to spar is what produced such a bad
performance against Rios,'' said Diaz, who added that Johnston
prepared for this fight by spending five weeks in Las Vegas and
sparring 80 rounds against three strong lightweight partners. ``I
don't think (the Rios fight) was a wake-up call, it was just a
mistake to train over there in Denver and he was the first one to
recognize that and that's why he came to Vegas to train this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, in his second reign as WBC lightweight champ, escaped
losing a title for the third time in his career by rallying to win
the 10th, 11th, and 12th rounds against Rios. An experienced
fighter with an impressive amateur record that includes American
junior and senior national titles and a Pan American Games gold
medal, Johnston first won the title two years ago in Paris when he
overcame a bad cut over his right eye to outpoint Jean-Baptiste
Mendy. Johnston lost the title to Cesar Bazan of Mexico June 13,
1998, but regained it in a 12-round rematch with Bazan Feb. 27 in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets no respect from the posters,'' Diaz said. ``They all
say `Manfredy vs. Johnston.' But (Saturday) night we're going to
see who is bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at Foxwoods, Mark Johnson of Washington D.C., will
defend his International Boxing Federation junior bantamweight
crown in a 12-rounder against Jorge Lacierva of Mexico City.

 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metropolitan Police Sergeant  &UR; Chris Gilbert &LR;  of London, who
prepared  &UR; Prince William &LR;  for his driver's test _ license obtained
on July 29 _ said this week that the 17-year-old has ``a natural
flair for driving.''
</P>
<P>
   In other royal news,  &UR; Prince Philip &LR;  remarked during a factory
tour this week that a low-tech fuse box looked ``as if it was put
in by an Indian,'' a comment not greeted with great delight by
Indians and Indian-symps, such as the British Commission for Racial
Equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Duke of Edinburgh regrets any offense which may have been
caused...'' said an official Buckingham Palace statement the next
day. ``With hindsight, he accepts that what were intended as
lighthearted comments were inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In still other royal news, next week's People includes an
excerpt from  &UR; Sally Bedell Smith &LR; 's forthcoming ``Diana in Search
of Herself'' describing the late princess' passion for  &UR; Hasnat &LR; 
 &UR; Khan &LR; , a Pakistani heart surgeon she met in 1995. She loved him so
much, says the book, that she would have converted to Islam for
him, and begged  &UR; Christiaan Barnard &LR;  to give him a job in South
Africa, so they could live there together. When Khan learned,
however, that she had secretly visited Pakistan to meet his
parents, he decided to call the whole thing off. Shortly
thereafter, she took up with  &UR; Dodi al-Fayed &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The BBC has released bits of a forthcoming series, ``The
Major Years,'' in which former British Prime Minister  &UR; John Major &LR; 
criticizes his predecessor.  &UR; Margaret Thatcher &LR;  was guilty of
``incessant plotting,'' he said, and considered herself a
``backseat driver'' in his administration. ``In retrospect,'' said
Major, ``I think her behavior was intolerable. I hope none of my
successors are treated in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of the Conservative Party said that the series,
which will be broadcast in October on the eve of their party's
annual convention, will be much debated.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ANTI-SOPRANOS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Fugazy &LR; , chairman of the National Ethnic Coalition of
Organizations, told  &UR; Neil Travis &LR;  of the New York Post that ``The
Sopranos'' has inspired him to hold a ``massive protest'' against
HBO next month. ``It is a distorted view of the typical Italian
American family,'' he said, ``and how Italian Americans achieve
success. It is a horribly negative stereotype, an embarrassment and
a slap in the face to every Italian American.''
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Sen.  &UR; Alfonse d'Amato &LR;  responded: ``I love the
show. It's an obvious spoof. If you can't laugh, God help you.
These politically correct people are taking all the joy out of
life.''

   &UR; THE GROWING IS GOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; George Gund &LR; , philanthropist, film festival angel and owner of
the San Jose Sharks, grows 34 fruits, herbs and vegetables on the
roof of his Fifth Avenue penthouse, reports the New York Times, and
is particularly determined to make his heretofore barren papaya and
guava trees yield fruit. ``I thrive on adversity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he's not in New York when the crop is ripe, he has it
overnighted to him by Federal Express, said the Times, in a story
cited by  &UR; Firat Yener &LR; . At other times, ``I just fly in for a
couple of hours to pick fruit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; WITH ALL DUE RESPECT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Reading in Via of the American Hawaii Cruises' December plans
for a Pearl Harbor Remembrance/Big Band Cruise,  &UR; Minna &LR; 
 &UR; Lieberman &LR;  pondered some other opportunities to combine World War
II history and fun: Kristallnacht Wine-Tasting Tour; London Blitz
'n' Blintz Party; Sands of Iwo Jima Surfing Festival.
</P>
<P>
   _ The gift shop of the National Atomic Museum at Kirtland Air
Force Base, N.M., has stopped selling silver earring replicas of
the A-bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A Japanese
anti-nuclear group had protested the jewelry. Museum director  &UR; Jim &LR; 
 &UR; Walther &LR;  said selling the earrings, at $20 a pair, ``just wasn't
worth the bad feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Carl Kozlowski &LR; , who toiled in Chicago as the Kraft
Cheesasaurus, writes in POV magazine about the trials of what's
called ``suit work.'' Outfitted in a hot and cumbersome getup,
Kozlowski was taunted by children who poked at him verbally and
manually. ``Since the Cheesasaurus suit sports only four fingers on
each hand,'' he writes, ``I can't even flip them the bird. The
suit's creators must've known that a middle finger would surely be
used to provoke lawsuits.''

<P>

<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather sport jeans and a T-shirt, but the only free
clothes anyone will ever give anyone is the really expensive stuff.
So I end up prostituting myself to Armani in front of the
cameras.''

on July 29 _ said this week that the 17-year-old has ``a natural

of Herself'' describing the late princess' passion for  &UR; Hasnat &LR; 
 &UR; Khan &LR; , a Pakistani heart surgeon she met in 1995. She loved him so
much, says the book, that she would have converted to Islam for
him, and begged  &UR; Christiaan Barnard &LR;  to give him a job in South
Africa, so they could live there together. When Khan learned,
however, that she had secretly visited Pakistan to meet his
parents, he decided to call the whole thing off. Shortly
thereafter, she took up with  &UR; Dodi al-Fayed &LR; .

``backseat driver'' in his administration. ``In retrospect,'' said
Major, ``I think her behavior was intolerable. I hope none of my
successors are treated in that way.''

MOWLAM SAYS SHE WANTS TO COMPLETE JOB IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There are many things Mo Mowlam would endure to help
bring about peace in Northern Ireland, but getting the bum's rush
out of Belfast is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   And so last month, when Prime Minister Tony Blair was poised to
move her from her job as secretary of state for Northern Ireland to
a more high-profile position, she said no. She was, in effect,
refusing a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   She was also breaking precedent. Cabinet reshuffles midway
through the five-year term of British governments are routine, and
Cabinet ministers have traditionally deferred to the wishes of the
prime minister and his chief advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But as the first woman to serve as Britain's top official in
Northern Ireland, and as the most unconventional of the nine people
who have held the job since it was created in 1972, Mowlam is used
to breaking new ground. This time she broke new ground by standing
her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job isn't finished. That's why I wanted to stay,'' she
said Thursday, speaking for the first time about the controversy
that saw Downing Street's plans to capitalize on her popularity
collapse when she used that popularity to defy Blair's strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for her bluntness and informality, Mowlam was
uncharacteristically diplomatic when describing how she brought
Blair around to seeing things her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it, weighed the pros and cons. We both agreed
the job wasn't finished, and that it was best if I stayed on,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She denied suggestions that she had threatened to resign if
Blair went ahead and moved her. ``We don't have that kind of
relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking rested and tanned after a two-week vacation in a remote
part of Turkey, Mowlam said her holiday was scheduled before the
planned Cabinet reshuffle and said it was not her intention to be
unavailable to the news media when it emerged that she had fought
for and won the chance to stay in her job.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers had spent considerable time and money trying
to track her down. A tabloid, The Sun, offered a $16,000 reward for
anyone who could spot her. Mowlam said she called the tabloid to
claim the reward, saying she had seen herself in the mirror, ``but
the editor said the offer was over.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace process is stalled over a dispute between the biggest
party, the Ulster Unionists, which represents middle-class
Protestants, and Sinn Fein, which has links to the Irish Republican
Army. The unionists refuse to sit in local government with Sinn
Fein until the IRA begins disarming, while Sinn Fein accuses the
unionists of trying to renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement of
1998, which does not link the creation of a power-sharing
government with disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an attempt to return power to a local assembly for
the first time in 27 years collapsed. George Mitchell, the former
US Senate majority leader from Maine who chaired the talks that led
to the Good Friday Agreement, has been brought back to try to find
away around the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Mowlam is the Cabinet member most popular with
the public. Many believe that besides wanting to give Mowlam a job
with higher visibility in domestic British politics, Blair's
advisers saw her transfer as a way to appease David Trimble, the
Ulster Unionist leader who has called for her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But Mowlam said, ``Calling for my resignation is not exactly a
new or uncommon thing. There have been about a dozen calls for my
resignation, from both unionists and nationalists. I get
frustrated, because I think it's unfair. But people lash out, and
if that makes them feel better, if that helps make progress, then
I'm willing to put up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Rev. Ian Paisley, the fundamentalist preacher who
leads the hard-line Democratic Unionists, approached her recently
to set the record straight, saying, ``Young lady, don't forget I
was the first to demand your resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she acknowledged that unionist opposition to her is more
strident, and that some of it is sexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them can't work with women,'' she said, declining, as
she has in the past, to name names. ``Secondly, they have to have a
hate figure. I'm it. They're talking to the prime minister, so I'm
the hate figure.''

 &HT;    Kiss up: `Detroit Rock City' a fun, moronic teen ride
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You don't have to be a Kiss fan to enjoy
``Detroit Rock City,'' but a high threshold for mindless comedy
helps.
</P>
<P>
   The dumb but exuberant romp is a live-action cartoon, much like
Kiss itself.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by the band's blood-spitting bass player, Gene Simmons,
the broadly comic coming-of-age story follows in the rowdy and
rebellious tradition of such teen rock comedies as ``Rock 'n' Roll
High School'' as it trails four Cleveland youths in their desperate
quest to see a Kiss concert at Detroit's Cobo Hall, circa 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the film are truly awful, but others are outrageously
funny. For all of its moronic humor, which involves a high degree
of violent pratfalls, the brash comedy has a lively anarchic
spirit, as well as some occasionally clever moments.
</P>
<P>
   High-school stoners and fledgling rock-band members Hawk (Edward
Furlong), Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip (James De Bello) and Jam
(Sam Huntington) are counting down the hours until they can see
``the hottest band in the land,'' having missed out on two previous
tours. Bad luck strikes again when Jam's devoutly Christian mother
(Lin Shaye) finds their tickets in her son's jean jacket and
torches them, believing the group's name to be an acronym for
``Knights in Satan's Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to see the show at all costs, the remaining trio
ditch school, ``borrow'' a car and hilariously break Jam free from
an oppressive religious academy where he's been imprisoned. But
getting into the concert will require them to surmount a series of
herculean obstacles _ both together and alone _ that includes
muscle-bound gorillas and pipe-wielding grease monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   They also encounter two young women, Beth (Melanie Lynskey) and
Christine (Natasha Lyonne), named for classic Kiss songs.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet's musical goal is beside the point. Any rock band
would have sufficed, although few have been as revered and reviled
as Kiss, and only Simmons could inspire the ``tongue cam'' shot
used during the inevitable concert finale. The important thing is
their nostalgic journey to Detroit _ and adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' demonizes authority figures, runs a bit
long and is often too far-fetched. Few would buy the notion that
former Playmate of the Year Shannon Tweed _ Simmons' longtime
partner _ would have to pay anyone, especially scrawny Furlong, to
have sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   We could have done without Hawk's power vomit scene, too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the better-than-expected comedy is shot with verve by
director Adam Rifkin (``The Dark Backward'') and has its share of
inspired moments, including a crude but funny scene in the girls
bathroom; a roadside run-in with disco-loving Italians; and Lex's
fearsome encounter with snarling backstage guard dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kiss, ``Detroit Rock City'' is a guilty pleasure.

 &HT;    Tina Brown talking, but will anyone be listening?
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It seems she was just warming up. Time at Vanity
Fair honed her instinct for the edge and the glitz; six years at
The New Yorker was well-spent on weightier things. In the process,
Tina Brown became quite possibly the only magazine editor known to
readers by name, and quite incredibly, the only magazine editor
whom readers followed from address to address as she dealt with her
particular issues.
</P>
<P>
   When wooed by movie-mogul Harvey Weinstein, Brown couldn't say
no so she said yes, and so began talk of what was to become Talk.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, network news programs led with the leak that
Talk talked to Hillary Clinton, and Hillary Clinton talked back _
and not just about Kosovo and Senate campaigns (there is some of
that), but about Bill, and that woman, and those things he does. It
was a coup, certainly, and Talk was on the map a full 24 hours
before Brown and her invited guests took over the Statue of Liberty
for a pre-publication party.
</P>
<P>
   Talk has hit the newsstands and it's, well, just another
magazine, meaning it's 126 pages of advertising (waif, waif, Dom
Perignon, waif, waif, Cartier) with plenty of editorial content
breaking things up. Brown writes in her kick-off editor's note that
the plan was a dream magazine with the ``slightly oversize look of
the European `news-yellows,' with their multiple-image covers and
glossy photo reportage.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Liz Smith that she sought to create new editorial
voices, in a format she hoped would be free from corporate editing,
giving the impression that these writers were e-mailing their
buddies _ you talking to me? It's supposed to be like conversation
_ talk, get it? _ except written down and sold for $2.95 a month,
or $12 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has unquestionably done what she set out to do. The first
half is full of the writerly e-mail-like little essays that are
full of ``I'' and ``me'' and esoteric topics (Krav Maga as the new,
trendy self-defense exercise; an opera ``roundup''; the awesome
political clout of a New Hampshire news anchor). Pictures are used
big and small, big if it's Harrison Ford or Gwyneth Paltrow, small
if it's of a deadly safari with no known celebs. The heavier pieces
are stashed in the back _ that's where you find Hillary Clinton,
the safari, and an update on Saddam Hussein _ but keep going and
there's more froth to be had in the horoscopes and a lively book
section and a page by the supposedly funny Christopher Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Talk is more Vanity Fair than New Yorker, if one chooses to
compare, but either of those established magazines has a better
handle on relevancy. Talk will take some getting used to, if we
take the time (and dump the Times, Time, and Good Housekeeping,
too).
</P>
<P>
   Our magazine plate has been full for years. Talk is just
gluttony.

IF YOU CAN STAND SLOW PACE, THERE IS SOME REDEMPTION TO `TWIN FALLS
IDAHO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea is certainly intriguing, as are the affecting,
synchronous and symmetrical performances by Mark and Michael
Polish. But ``Twin Falls Idaho'' is often as stillborn in pace as
it is conceptually compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish brothers may be striving to create a lulling,
hypnotic world with their thudding, slow-moving story (they
co-wrote and Mark directed the film).
</P>
<P>
   If viewers can muster patience for the tempo, there is some
redemption to this saga of twins Blake (Mark Polish) and Francis
(Michael Polish) Falls who share more than the same mother. They're
conjoined from birth and must share part of each other's body. They
have a pathos and strength that would elude any normal person.
</P>
<P>
   Blake yearns for autonomy and his own life but knows Francis
would never survive without him. When a young street woman named
Penny (Michele Hicks) suddenly enters their womb-like world, Blake
discovers a surprising new emotional engagement is stronger than
his bond with the brother from whom he can never escape.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``Twin Falls Idaho'' follows the same track as
David Lynch's 1980 film, ``The Elephant Man.'' At the core of the
story is the search for mother and for acceptance from the absent
woman who gave birth _ and then abandoned _ her child because he
was different and considered ``freakish'' by the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which showed at this year's Seattle International
Film Festival, refuses to view Blake and Francis as freaks,
however. Instead, it relishes their uniqueness and lends a tragic
beauty to their plight. It explores a romantically squalid world in
which everyone and everything is equally unsettled and askew. And
it has a resonant somber tone that asks as many questions as it
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this noble intent, however, something refuses to gel.
Perhaps it's just that by attempting to make Blake and Francis so
wholeheartedly normal, their differences are magnified and
heightened.
</P>
<P>
   Had the filmmakers quit gazing adoringly and with extreme
close-ups of Blake and Francis, the story may have made more
impact. But by lingering, they end up dwelling on their abnormality
and force any cogent story arc into the background. That lack of
narrative focus ultimately causes ``Twin Falls Idaho'' to sputter
and stutter to a static dead end long before the final credits
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Twin Falls Idaho. Directed by Michael Polish. Written by Michael
and Mark Polish. Cast: Mark Polish, Michael Polish, Michele Hicks,
Lesley Ann Warren. Sony Pictures Classics. 105 minutes. Rated R for
language, sexual content.

DEUTSCHE BANK STRATEGIST AIMS FOR NATIONAL CABLE TV SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESCHBORN, Germany _ Axel C. Pfeil's office has only a simple
four-sided conference table and a few wall hangings, betraying
little hint of purpose or power.
</P>
<P>
   But Pfeil has a lot of both, and he is using them to shake
things up. As chairman of DB Investor, the investment arm of
Deutsche Bank AG, the 45-year-old corporate strategist is
transforming the bank's large but passive stock holdings into a
tool for industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Deutsche Bank's financial muscle, Pfeil is trying to
buy cable television networks across Germany and knit them into a
national system he can modernize and eventually resell.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price alone is likely to exceed 20 billion marks,
or about $10.9 billion. Upgrading the systems for Internet access
and other advanced services could cost another $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeil is trying to recruit a slew of partners, including
Microsoft Corp. GE Capital, the financial arm of General Electric,
has already pledged to help finance some of Pfeil's deals.
</P>
<P>
   The activism doesn't end there. After years of sitting languidly
on stocks it had acquired years earlier, including a major stake in
what is now DaimlerChrysler AG, Deutsche Bank has given Pfeil a
mandate to help restructure many of its companies.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Pfeil (pronounced P'FILE) has formed a new company
with Europe's biggest retailer, Metro AG, which is in the process
of polishing up and selling more than a dozen of Metro's
``non-core'' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He is also investing in small growth companies that are not yet
on the stock market. These range from American Internet startups
like FortuneCity.com to German biotechnology firms. On Thursday, DB
Investor announced plans to acquire 40 percent of Clean Car AG,
which claims to have a system for washing up to 300 cars an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not aiming for an ever bigger portfolio,'' Pfeil said
in an interview Thursday at his spartan office in this Frankfurt
suburb. ``We take stakes, create value and then we sell it. We say
we should hold our stakes for three to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds reminiscent of American buyout firms like Kolberg
KravisRoberts &AMP; Co., there is a reason. Pfeil began his career as a
corporate restructuring consultant in New York. He went on to
become a corporate strategist for Lufthansa, the German airline,
and was a top strategist for VEBA AG, an industrial conglomerate
that has refocused itself through a blizzard of acquisitions and
spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeil's plans at Deutsche Bank mark a major shift from the
bank's historical approach. Though the bank has always wielded
heavy influence, it has in recent years stayed in the background
and behaved like an indifferent investor.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank acquired stakes in dozens of companies over many
years, often as a result of letting corporate borrowers convert
loans to stock when they faced financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Deutsche Bank put its holdings into a separate
legal entity, DB Investor. Part of the goal was simply to manage
the investments better and make it easier for investors to see what
was going on.
</P>
<P>
   But Pfeil had a much more expansive mandate than reshuffling
stocks. While at VEBA, he engineered a deal in which VEBA, Deutsche
Bank and two other companies combined their stakes in a tourism
company called Hapag-Lloyd, then sold it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pfeil and Deutsche Bank took an even more activist
role in restructuring Metro AG, a huge retailing conglomerate that
runs a range of businesses including supermarkets and convenience
stores.
</P>
<P>
   In a complex deal, Metro sliced off more than a dozen smaller
companies and put them into a new entity in which Deutsche Bank
owned 51 percent. DB Investor took responsibility for selling the
companies, and will receive a portion of the profits if it can sell
them for more than the companies' original valuations.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this pales in significance to Pfeil's plan for the
cable industry. The effort comes after years of failed attempts by
Germany's biggest media companies _ Deutsche Telekom, Bertelsmann
AG and Kirch Group _ to develop a common system for advanced new
services.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeil was galvanized by Deutsche Telekom, Germany's dominant
telephone carrier, which is selling cable television systems that
reach about 34 percent of the country's homes.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to buy those systems and meld them to others across
Germany. In May, he reached an agreement to buy Germany's
second-biggest cable system, Telecolumbus, which had been owned by
VEBA and a German utility, RWE AG, for 1.45 billion marks or $790
million. He is also in negotiations to buy systems in every other
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the biggest restructuring projects in Europe
right now,'' he said. ``If you want to establish a real data
network, a data autobahn, you need an integrated system.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problems are immense. Telekom executives, who are
selling the cable systems largely because of pressure from
government regulators, do not want a national cable system that
would likely compete against their telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Telekom executives have become alarmed about Deutsche
Bank's plans, worrying that the bank was a front for rivals like
Mannesmann AG or outside phone carriers like France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeil denies that. In a written presentation of his plans
prepared for analysts, he went so far as to dismiss the charge in a
bold-type expletive derived from bovine scatology.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Bank has other challenges as well. For one thing,
companies like Mannesmann AG and Bertelsmann AG are also interested
in Telekom's cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Pfeil needs minority investors. Despite Deutsche
Bank's huge portfolio, the taxes on decades of accumulated capital
gains make it unattractive for the bank to sell most of these
securities for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pfeil has already teamed up with several other
banks and GE Capital to bid on several systems around the country.
He is in talks with banks and other investors from Berlin to North
Rhine Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   If all works out according to plan, DB Investor would own a
majority stake in cable systems across Germany. But to pull that
off he will have to attract all those partners and then persuade
them all to agree on the plan. That could be complicated.

NATIVE AMERICAN BAND KNOWS ITS YOUTHFUL IDENTITY WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEITH RAETHER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Churchill was right and the world is made to be wooed and won
by youth, then Indigenous is a willing suitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Native American blues and rock group, one of four booked for
the B.B. King Blues Festival Sunday at the Chateau Ste. Michelle
winery in Woodinville, Wash., is the first American Indian band to
have a single release in the Top 10 on the music charts. The band's
newly released debut album, ``Things We Do,'' sold more than 75,000
copies in a few months without the red carpet of a major record
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started out, we'd only listened to records. We'd never
seen any band perform live,'' says lead guitarist and singer Mato
Nanji, who's all of 25.
</P>
<P>
   Youth means being invited to play at the 30th anniversary of
Woodstock and realizing that you weren't even in the world to know
what the original Woodstock festival was.
</P>
<P>
   Youth means, 10 days after Woodstock '99, taking on a national
tour that covers 40 cities in 60 days, travel dates included, and
living to talk about it. The latest Indigenous tour began on Aug. 4
in Boise, Idaho, and won't end until Oct. 3 with Robert Cray in St.
Louis. More concert dates are likely to be added.
</P>
<P>
   Youth, thy name is Indigenous. Thy spirit is self-assurance,
even if the band members didn't know what the name meant when their
parents suggested it more than a blue moon ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just kids,'' says Mato Nanji, named after the Native
American chief Standing Bear. ``(But) we're proud of being Indian,
and that's always part of us no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous is a family within a family. All four band members
belong to the Nakota Nation in South Dakota, and all four come from
the same family tree. Mato's sister, 22-year-old Wanbdi Win (Good
Eagle Woman), plays drums and sings. Their brother, 20-year-old
Ptehcaka Wicasa (Little Buffalo Man), plays bass and sings. Their
cousin, Tasunka (Horse), also 20, supplies percussion with a kit
that includes congas, bongos, timbales and tambourine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got together in a room and played, and songs happened,''
Wanbdi simply says.
</P>
<P>
   The music didn't happen without a little help from Wanbdi, Pte
and Mato's father. Greg Zephier was a member of a '60s rock band
called the Vanishing Americans. His record collection began with
the three Kings of the blues _ Albert, Freddie and B.B. _ and ended
with Jimi Hendrix. His heart dictated that he teach his children
well about the music he made and the indigenous culture they
shared.
</P>
<P>
   Zephier, an activist in the American Indian Movement, took the
family to AIM marches in Washington, D.C. He passed on the language
of the Nakota Nation. He made the children aware of two variations
on the blues _ social and musical _ as they grew up on the Yankton
Indian Reservation in Marty, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the kids were old enough to hold instruments, Zephier
took them down to his basement studio, showed them his equipment,
had them listen to everybody from Santana to Buddy Guy, and taught
them the rudiments of rock `n' roll and the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) showed us the basics, but from then on, he made us work
everything out ourselves,'' says Wanbdi.
</P>
<P>
   Zephier let them choose the instruments they wanted to play but
insisted that they practice day in, day out for two years before
they went public. Five years passed before Indigenous ever
performed before an audience. Venues in the vicinity of Marcy were
scarce. The biggest music room for miles was the reservation
casino, where keeping the customers satisfied meant supplying a
salve of Chubby Checker tunes to heal their wounds at the gaming
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Indigenous got its act together and took it on the
road in 1995. They packed the musical inspiration of Hendrix and
Stevie Ray Vaughan, the cultural imperative of Robbie Robertson
(late of The Band) and the spiritual blessing of their father, all
of which kept them secure and sanguine. They lived in their cars
and logged 200 playing dates a year.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Native American band got out, and activist musicians
such as Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne took up the cause. Raitt
connected the band to record producers and earlier this year the
newly formed, independent label Pachyderm Records released ``Things
We Do.''
</P>
<P>
   The title track on the record is now a video directed by Chris
Eyre, the Cheyenne-Arapaho filmmaker responsible for ``Smoke
Signals.'' And the band's stock continues to soar with audiences
from the reservation to Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our music to be color-blind,'' says Mato. ``We want
anyone who comes to hear us to be able to get down with the music,
not with a message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We love what we do,'' says Mato. ``There's nothing about it we
don't love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for us not to play,'' adds Pte.
</P>
<P>
   This is the brighter side of youth speaking: alive, alert and
assiduous. Street-smart but unjaded. In the Native American lexicon
of Indigenous, the painted desert is a synonym for ``future,'' and
``fail'' is not a word.

 `DETROIT ROCK CITY' ROUSINGLY FUNNY AS CRUDE SATIRE ABOUT '70s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After enduring a wearying run of plot-cloned movies about
entitled teenagers, their SUVs and high school proms, it's fun to
watch a film that actually has some chutzpah and sense of real
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City,'' a heavy metal-meets-John Hughes comedy,
is, especially in its first half, rousingly funny as a rude and
crude satire about a naive, idiosyncratic decade _ the '70s _ that
pitted disco, bad fashion, Donny and Marie and ``Saturday Night
Fever'' against the wild antics of such black leather, serpent
tongued, goth musical badboys as KISS and AC/DC.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the credit must be given to the Farrelly Brothers'
secret weapon, Lin Shaye, who played the lascivious and disgusting
landlady in ``Kingpin'' as well as the George Hamilton-toned and
tanned Magda, a gal who loves her dog just a little bit too
ardently, in ``There's Something About Mary.'' In ``Detroit Rock
City'' she's the ultra-moral mom of Jam Bruce (Sam Huntington), a
slavish KISS worshiper and member of a knock-off garage band called
MyStery.
</P>
<P>
   Jam and his band mates, Hawk (Edward Furlong), Lex (Giuseppe
Andrews) and Trip (James De Bello), have secretly scored tickets to
the highly coveted KISS concert in Detroit that very night.
</P>
<P>
   When mom finds these passes into the portals of hell and
damnation, all hope of the boys hearing their heroes live flies out
the window. Mrs. Bruce scolds her boy, ``You want to reach out and
touch evil _ and in Detroit no less.'' After scorching the tickets,
she sentences Jam to St. Bernard's, a religious institution for
wayward boys that would make Charles Dickens roll over in his
grave.
</P>
<P>
   But his loyal buddies break him out and what ensues is a
coming-of-age comedic adventure about first flight from home and
fulfilling first dreams. It culminates in a night full of surprises
that will never be forgotten by these four young misfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' is truly raunchy but it's more sweetly
stupid and silly than anything. It's one of those movies in which
the viewer must shed the cloak of adulthood in order to enjoy it.
Like the calculated John Hughes-directed and scripted comedies
(``16 Candles,'' ``The Breakfast Club,'' ``Some Kind Of
Wonderful''), the Chris Columbus film ``Adventures In Babysitting''
_ or George Lucas' ``American Graffiti'' _ it proves to be a
universal experience for kids and adults alike. The film
energetically revved up the interactive younger viewers at a
preview screening while it felt like a walk down memory lane for
those of us who actually lived through the time.
</P>
<P>
   Plus there's truly something fascinating about watching a bunch
of guys who dress up in weird gear and paint their faces while
destroying their musical instruments on stage. I suspect this film
taps into a secret wish-fulfillment for many of us. It's about
getting away from establishment rules and I wouldn't be surprised
if ``Detroit Rock City'' has more relevance for 30-something
viewers than the budding teens of today who are more hellbent upon
becoming models or millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Rock City. Directed by Adam Rifkin. Written by Carl V.

GERMAN NEWSPAPER PUBLISHES INTRODUCTION TO EICHMANN MEMOIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ ``Obeying an order was the most important thing to me.
It could be that is in the nature of the German.''
</P>
<P>
   So, early on in memoirs published Thursday by the German daily
Die Welt, does Adolf Eichmann seek to explain his central role in
the killing of 6 million European Jews by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, part of an attempt by Eichmann to portray himself
as a man driven by a visceral sense of duty, rather than hatred, to
organize the mass murder of Jews, appears on page 6 of 127 pages of
handwritten reflections that Die Welt said it found at the Center
for Research on Nazi Crimes in the southern German town of
Ludwigsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Justice Ministry announced this week that 1,200
pages of notes by Eichmann, who was captured in Argentina by
Israeli agents in 1960 and executed in Israel two years later,
would be released to German researchers for scholarly publication.
</P>
<P>
   The photocopied pages in Ludwigsburg _ whose authenticity was
confirmed by several German historians and has not been contested
by Eichmann's family _ appear to be a synopsis of, or an
introduction to, the larger body of Eichmann's writings that Israel
has said it intends to release.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The precise relationship of these pages to the rest of his
writing in Israel is not entirely clear,'' said Johann-Michael
Moeller, the editor at Die Welt responsible for the publication.
``What is clear is that they are genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hans Mommsen, a respected historian, said: ``There is no
question that these papers are authentic. They are a shorter
autobiographical outline of what is still in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the outline of his life published Thursday, Eichmann wrote:
``From my childhood, obedience was something I could not get out of
my system. When I entered the armed services at the age of 27, I
found being obedient not a bit more difficult than it had been
during my life to that point. It was unthinkable that I would not
follow orders.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Now that I look back, I realize that a life
predicated on being obedient and taking orders is a very
comfortable life indeed. Living in such a way reduces to a minimum
one's own need to think.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks appear likely to prove sensitive here because the
question of the responsibility for the Holocaust of Germans who, at
a farlower level than Eichmann, merely ``obeyed orders,'' remains
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the appropriate relationship between order and
freedom, and between initiative and obedience, remains an open
question in a highly regulated German society still marked at times
by the rigid mentality of the ``Beamte,'' or functionary, for whom
duty has greater value than enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The pages appear to have been handed to Germany by Israeli
officials as part of the summary of Eichmann's trial in 1961 and
lodged in the judicial archives at Ludwigsburg, one of two large
German legal archives dealing with Nazi war crimes. The other is in
Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   Germany had an official observer at the Eichmann trial, Diedrich
Zeug, and it appeared likely that a copy of the memoir was brought
by him to Ludwigsburg, where it languished in the archives,
historians said. Moeller of Die Welt said he had learned of the
existence of the writings through an anonymous tip.
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann, a traveling salesman in his youth, began dealing with
``Jewish questions'' for the Nazi regime two years after Hitler's
rise to power in 1933. Rising through the ranks of the SS, he was
entrusted in early 1942 with carrying out the ``final solution,'' a
goal of annihilation he pursued with unrelenting bureaucratic zeal.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he escaped to Argentina in 1946, before being
brought to Israel in 1960. At his trial the next year, he showed
the same determination to portray himself as no more than an
obedient servant of orders from on high as he does in the pages
published by Die Welt.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pages are genuine, but they amount to a legal defense
more than a memoir,'' said Irmtrud Wojak, a prominent historian of
the Nazi years. ``And in them he defends himself, as he always did,
as an innocent because he did no more than obey orders.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann begins the memoir by noting that he is starting to
write on May 9, 1960. This was seven days after Israeli agents
tracked him down in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and two days before
his abduction to Israel. Ms. Wojak said the writings were completed
on June 16, 1960, before he embarked on the larger body of notes
still in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the overarching theme of obedience is struck.
His father, Eichmann wrote, raised him ``in a strict manner that
none of my siblings would experience.'' He was not a difficult
child, but an ``agreeable and obedient boy.''
</P>
<P>
   So deep was the instinct for obedience in him, he wrote, that
when the Nazis were defeated in 1945, he was in a panic at the
prospect of living an existence not dictated by orders. ``I found
myself completely incapable of living as my own person and fell
into a deep depression.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann first went to Auschwitz in 1941, the year he was
promoted to an SS lieutenant colonel. He made later visits there,
and to other death camps in Poland, to analyze progress in the
elimination of the Jews.

   ``I was to report on the Fuehrer's plans to destroy the Jews,''
Eichmann writes on page 109. ``I was sent to Treblinka, Minsk,
Lemberg and Auschwitz. When I see the images before my eyes, it all
comes back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``Corpses, corpses, corpses. Shot, gassed,
decaying corpses. They seemed to pop out of the ground when a grave
was opened. It was a delirium of blood. It was an inferno, a hell,
and I felt I was going insane.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Eichmann showed no signs of insanity, at least by the
standards of the Nazi bureaucracy within which he worked. He
complained regularly about death-camp quotas not being fulfilled,
about the problems of getting all French Jews to the death camps,
and about the intermittent failure of the Italians to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1944, he played a leading, and open, role in the
killing of Hungarian Jews, and in August of that year he reported
that 4 million Jews had died in the death camps and another 2
million at the hands of the Nazis' mobile extermination units in
Eastern Europe. At no point did he show the least compunction over
the planning, organization and execution of what became known as
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Defiant to the last, Eichmann writes on the last page of this
shorter memoir: ``I am certain, however, that those responsible for
the murder of millions of Germans will never be brought to
justice.''

TANDYCRAFTS REPORTS LOSS FOR FISCAL YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LILA LaHOOD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tandycrafts posted a $23.8 million
fiscal-year loss as the company continues to streamline holdings
and pay off debt, trying to set it on the path to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Tandycrafts lost $10.8 million, or 89 cents a share, during the
fourth quarter, which ended June 30, compared with a gain of
$414,000, or 3 cents a share, for the same period the year before.
Sales dropped to $40.5 million from $50.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Fort Worth-based company's net loss amounted
to $1.96 a share. That compares with a net gain of $4.6 million, or
37 cents a share, for the previous year. Annual sales dropped to
$194.7 million from $232.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Tandycrafts, a consumer products maker, closed down
6.25 cents Thursday at $3.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Tandycrafts Treasurer Michael Murray said that executives
expected the losses but that the company is pleased with the
progress of its business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pared down and continued to zero in on the profitable
core,'' he said. ``It's taken several years for us to work our way
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that transition has included slashing long-term debt to
$30 million from about $70 million during the past three years,
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Jacobowitz, an analyst with the Robotti &AMP; Co. investment
firm in New York, said the company is headed in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual businesses are doing well, and management is
making the right decisions,'' he said. ``You're not seeing that in
the bottom line yet, but you will see profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Tandycrafts said fourth-quarter income was affected by an $11.2
million charge for a write-down in other assets. Those costs,
combined with $17.6 million related to the closing of Tandy Leather
retail and manufacturing businesses and guaranty of bank debt for
the recently reacquired Cargo Furniture and Accents, contributed to
annual losses.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in 1999 decreased because of the leather operations
closings and the sale of Joshua's Christian Stores. When those
businesses are excluded, Tandycrafts' sales increased 3 percent to
$159.8 million in 1999. The strongest sales were in the Cargo
furniture, frames and wall decor line, and the office supplies
divisions. The company experienced losses in gifts and licensed
lifestyles, a sports-licensed products division.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the company is focusing on multidivisional branding
and marketing opportunities and finalizing the transition of its
picture frame manufacturing from California to Durango, Mexico.

SCIENTISTS FIND EVIDENCE COMPLEX LIFE EXISTED EARLIER THAN
THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Australian scientists say they have found evidence that complex
forms of life existed on the earth 2.7 billion years ago, 500
million to 1 billion years earlier than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The life forms are single-celled creatures called eukaryotes,
the first known cells to have nuclei and specialized internal
structures for processing energy. Present-day descendants of this
group include all the higher kingdoms of life, like plants, animals
(including people) and fungi, as well as many single-celled
creatures like amoebae.
</P>
<P>
   The first life, simple bacteria with no nuclei, is believed on
the basis of fossils to have appeared by 3.5 billion years ago, and
possibly as long ago as 3.8 billion years ago. The earth is about
4.6 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, reported in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, are based on fatty molecules known to be produced by
living cells that were found in ancient shale in northwestern
Australia by a team led by Jochen J. Brocks, a geoscientist at the
University of Sydney. The chemicals, called sterols, are found in
the membranes of eukaryotes. Cholesterol is a member of this group
of compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is possible that simpler organisms produced the
sterols, the Australian researchers wrote in Science, the abundance
of this class of chemicals ``is convincing evidence for the
presence of eukaryotes'' around 2.7 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists noted that it was not known whether the cells
that produced the fatty molecules had yet developed the other
characteristics of eukaryotes. Besides the nucleus, these included
small structures called chloroplasts, which enable plants to draw
energy from the sun through photosynthesis, and mitochondria, which
enable plant and animal cells to process energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can say is that one important attribute of eukaryotes
was in place'' by 2.7 billion years ago, Andrew H. Knoll, a
paleontologist at the Harvard University Botanical Museum, said in
an interview. In a commentary in Science, he wrote that ``we can
make only limited inferences about the overall biology'' of the
organism in question.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he wrote, the finding highlights two points.
First, there was a very long interval _ 1.5 billion years or more,
if eukaryotes did arise as long ago as the new study suggested _
between their first appearance and the beginning of their flowering
into higher organisms some 1.2 billion to 1 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the findings push back still farther the frontier of
investigation of early life. For generations, Knoll wrote, an
explosion of higher forms of life about 544 million years ago, at
the beginning of the Cambrian period, marked a Terra Incognita
beyond which little or nothing was known about life. This ``line of
paleontological frustration,'' as he called it, later receded to
about 2 billion years ago, and had now receded still further.
</P>
<P>
   The Brocks findings, he wrote, dramatically lengthen ``both the
geological record of eukaryotic biology and the list of questions
we need to ask about early evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Brocks' team also found evidence that blue-green bacteria called
cyanobacteria also lived 2.7 billion years ago. These were the
first organisms to perform photosynthesis, and thus to pump oxygen
into the atmosphere, making the subsequent rise of oxygen-breathing
animals possible.

 &HT;    Williams wedded to Saints, for better or worse
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ First of all, let's set the record
straight: He wore a size-20 dress and, although you can't see them
in the photo, size 12 EEE white pumps.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, Ricky Williams has been deflating his
statistics, telling reporters visiting the Lacrosse, Wis., training
camp home of the New Orleans Saints, that the wedding dress he wore
for a ESPN Magazine cover featuring himself and Saints coach Mike
Ditka at the altar was a size 13.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to take Williams at his word. After all, this is a
guy who signed what others are calling a bad deal because it will
force him to earn his riches; a guy who after a recent practice
suggested that it might be nice if he went over to the fans and
signed some autographs; a guy who you wouldn't expect to fib about
his dress size.
</P>
<P>
   But now the truth must be told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's a size 20,'' ESPN Magazine photo editor Nik
Kleinberg said, explaining that the dress, bought off the rack in
New York, now is hanging on the door in his Manhattan office. ``The
latest thing around here is for (staffers) to get a Polaroid taken
wearing the dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The dress is part of the most memorable image of the
NFL off-season, moving ahead of the memory of Ditka wearing a
dreadlocks wig the day he traded away his entire draft to the
Washington Redskins so he could have the fifth overall pick _ and
use it to take the Heisman Trophy winner from the University of
Texas who set 20 NCAA records.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shot of Ditka in dreadlocks that gave ESPN
photographer Greg Heisler the nerve to suggest that the man
nicknamed ``Iron Mike'' put on a tuxedo and pose for a ``classic
wedding photo'' ... with a 234-pound, tattooed running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to come up with a visual metaphor of the
relationship Ditka and Ricky were entering into,'' Kleinberg said.
``Both have given up a lot. And their futures are somewhat tied to
each other. ... Of course, we were looking to have some fun with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover photo features the two men, both with serious
expressions on their faces, and a headline that says, ``For better
or worse, Ricky and Ditka take the plunge.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction?
</P>
<P>
   When the Saints reported for training camp, a headline in one
Wisconsin newspaper blared: ``Here comes the bride.'' And to say
the cover got a rise in New Orleans would be an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple weeks, the New Orleans Times-Picayune's
letters-to-the-editor page has been turned into a
point-counterpoint debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction has ranged from that it defiled the institution
of marriage to, `Come on, this is the city of Mardi Gras,''' said
Greg Suit, the Saints vice president of marketing and
administration. ``Someone wrote that it was an insult to women. So
the next day a woman wrote supporting it, saying that at least he
kept his dress on, unlike the U.S. women's soccer player who took
off her jersey after scoring the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made Williams wish he had never posed for the
photo. You see, the funny thing is that he really doesn't like
attention. Those close to him _ and there aren't many _ describe
him as very shy.
</P>
<P>
   The first night Ditka gave the team off, most of the players hit
the town, searching for a little excitement. Williams stayed in his
dorm room. He studied the offense, then went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that when Williams comes off the field and does
his every-other-day interview with the media, he refuses to take
off his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of his way of keeping people at arm's length,'' said
Greg Bensel, the Saints' media relations director.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Williams hasn't mingled. It's just that he has
learned that it isn't easy. Not with Ricky-mania in full force.
</P>
<P>
   At the team's first mini-camp, the Saints tried to do an
autograph session with Williams. He signed for about 1 1/2 hours.
But when the staff took him away with hundreds of fans still in
line it resulted in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overrun to the point where we were concerned about
getting him off the field,'' said Greg Suit, vice president of
marketing and administration. ``It's been crazy. He's like a rock
star.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores can't keep his jersey stocked. Season ticket sales are
up. The Times-Picayune runs a daily ``Camping with Ricky'' box that
posts reader questions such as ``How would you like to be
remembered after your NFL career?'' (Answer: ``Not necessarily as a
football player but as Ricky Williams'').
</P>
<P>
   No offense, but the team's fans, who haven't watched the Saints
in a playoff game since 1992, are hoping to remember him as a
football player. The team's slogan this season is ``Ready to Run.''
And already Ditka is talking about Williams making a run at the
rookie record for yards rushing (2,015 by Eric Dickerson).
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a horse, and I'm going to ride him,'' Ditka said.
</P>
<P>
   With all of this in mind, you can understand why Williams wasn't
thrilled about having more hoopla stirred up by the wedding photo.
But, he admits, he kind of likes the idea behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm married to the Saints,'' he said. ``I did sign an
eight-year contract.''
</P>
<P>
   With no escape clause.
</P>
<P>
   Most long-term rookie deals include some kind of out. Not
Williams'. He is tied to the Saints. For better or for worse.
</P>
<P>
   A reminder of just how much the Ditka and the Saints are married
to Williams came during a practice earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams fell to the ground after banging knees with
defensive end Rob Lurtsema, it looked like a scene out of a movie.
Players and coaches on other parts of the field stopped what they
were doing. The place turned quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like a funeral,'' Ditka said later.
</P>
<P>
   Then Williams hopped to his feet ... and the funeral turned back
into a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   This is the honeymoon now; the time when people are willing to
forget Williams' two fumbles in the opening practice and remember
the way he sprinted down the sideline for a touchdown in a
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   How Williams and Ditka will look at that picture years from now
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it will be just like with any other wedding photo.
If it turns out to be a bad marriage, they will want to burn it. If
it turns out to be a long, happy marriage, they will look at it and
do what they resisted doing when it was shot _ smile.

LATINO ALT ROCK TOUR WORTH CHECKING OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Watcha, roughly translated, means ``check it out''
_ and that's exactly what audiences are doing as the inaugural
version of this edgy Latin-rock caravan tour rock 'n' rolls its way
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   People are finally discovering Latin rock is much more than
simply (ITAL STARTS)la vida loca.(ITAL ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   You've heard all about Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and other
top-selling Hispanic-causing-panic performers riding the (ITAL
STARTS)mucho caliente(ITAL ENDS) Latin-pop craze all the way to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   But another less well-known Latin musical world exists. And
while it may require a bit more effort to discover the experimental
sounds of Cafe Tacuba than to hear Lopez's current Top 10 smash,
``If You Had My Love,'' the universe of Latino alternative rock
just got closer.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point of the Watcha tour.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-date trek, produced by the organizers of the annual
hard-rock- and thrash-fueled Warped tour, accents a genre-bending
and quite varied lineup that includes Cafe Tacuba, Puya, Molotov,
Illya Kuryaki, Control Machete, Todos Tus Muertos, Fishbone, Los
Mocosos, Bersuit, Enanitos Verdes, Union 13, Chris Perez and Viva
Malpache.
</P>
<P>
   The high-energy roadshow hits the 6,000-seat Greek Theatre on
Sunday, following dates in Florida, Texas (four shows) and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the perfect time to unite the creativity of
(ITAL BEGINS)roc en espanol(ITAL ENDS) and Latin hip-hop with the
spirit of Warped,'' explains Kevin Lyman, co-founder and producer
of the sister tours. ``With the current success of Latin music, we
wanted to give exposure to the more underground sounds that
culturally diverse Latino and Anglo youth are embracing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, salsa, mambo, rumba and other Latin rhythms made
their mark on the American musical map long ago. After all, Gloria
Estefan, Celia Cruz, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Carlos Santana, Tito
Puente, Ritchie Valens, Los Lobos and Ruben Blades, among many
others, scored hits, pioneered new sounds and became household
names.
</P>
<P>
   But while the most successful of the new crop, such as Martin
and Lopez, are enjoying success with hits sung in English, another
bunch of bilingual Latin artists are mixing thrash, hard-rock and
hip-hop while aiming for the tattooed and teen-aged end of the
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic Watcha lineup ranges from the innovative Cafe
Tacuba to the Santana-inspired Afro-funk of Los Mocosos to the
bilingual power-pop of Perez, widower of slain Tejano superstar
Selena.
</P>
<P>
   It's as varied a bill as the Latin genre itself _ and the bands
know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tour is a brand name to identify different types of
music,'' said bassist Quique Rangel of Mexico City's Cafe Tacuba,
one of Watcha's best-known names. ``It gives people a chance to
experience the different visions of this music. In a place like
Mexico City at the end of the century, there isn't just one culture
but a lot of cultures existing together.''
</P>
<P>
   The band, whose arty new Warner Bros. release, ``Reves/Yo Soy''
(``Backwards/I Am''), is an all-instrumental sonic free-for-all
that recalls the Kronos Quartet alongside the ambient soundscapes
of Brian Eno, has received airplay on public-radio stations at the
same time that it's been favorably compared to Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our music is a response to the place where we live and the
times we live in,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   A multicultural environment far from Mexico City but closer to
Los Angeles inspired the sprawling San Francisco outfit Los
Mocosos, a Latin-funk act also on Watcha who are somewhat similar
to Latin-tinged '70s funk acts like Malo. Los Mocosos includes
musicians from Santana, Tower of Power and Primus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is a melting pot of cultures, and that's what
inspires us,'' says Los Mocosos leader Piero ``El Malo'' Ornelas.
``The thing about Latin music is it took awhile to reach the
average person, just like hip-hop did. Eighteen years ago, people
in the Midwest weren't listening to hip-hop. Today, they are.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But today, it's much easier to find records by
artists such as, for example, Cafe Tacuba, Puya and Ozomatli _ all
of whom are signed to major labels _ in out-of-the-way places. And
many of Watcha's diverse range of acts have been embraced by
college- and public-radio throughout this country.
</P>
<P>
   A tennis-shoe-wearing skateboard kid can just as easily pick up
the new effort by Mexico City's Mana on the WEA Latina label as
they can the new Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the new cross-cultural era Watcha hopes to capitalize
on. The tour came together when political fire-starters and Mexican
rap-rockers Molotov were invited to appear on the summer's Warped
tour. It soon became clear the time had arrived for a ``Latin
Warped,'' a multi-act Latin-based alt-rock summer festival, Lyman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect it to be financially successful,'' Lyman
admits. ``We're building a bridge to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That bridge also leads to Puya, a Puerto Rico-bred quartet that
switches from a swinging Afro-Cuban pulse to metallic frenzy in the
space of a song. The band, signed to MCA Records, broke ground this
summer as part of the highly successful OzzFest '99 tour headlined
by Black Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our music used to be underground,'' said Puya bassist Harold
Hopkins Miranda. ``Now, there's lots of new people getting into it.
It's growing all the time because we're playing new places
everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, maybe, Puya and Cafe Tacuba might just be as widely
known as Martin and Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his experience on Watcha, Ornelas enthused about the
production crew, borrowed from Warped, who don't all speak Spanish
but have gone beyond the call of duty for the various acts on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've helped when cars have broken down or when some of the
younger musicians who've never been out on the road before needed
moral support,'' Ornelas said. ``Some of them have even had to use
sign language to communicate with the guys who don't speak English.
But the whole experience has been great. It's just been a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Watcha, of course, is just one of many (ITAL STARTS)roc en
espanol(ITAL ENDS) or Latin music events coming to Los Angeles in
this summer of Rickymania. Forthcoming dates at the Greek alone
include Marc Anthony, Los Lobos, and the Ritmo de Corazon '99 show
featuring Maldita Vecindad and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a three-act bill featuring Santana plus leading
Latin-rockers Mana and Los Angeles' own Ozomatli has sold out four
nights at the Anaheim Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize Watcha is a gamble,'' tour producer Lyman offers.
``But we're looking to the future. These bands are going to be the
next big commercial breakthrough in alternative rock. They say 12
percent of the population will be Latino by next year. This music
hits on two fronts _ it's good music and it reflects the
culture.'' &QL;

`FIRST DAUGHTER' IS ROUTINE TV-MOVIE FARE, WITH OCCASIONAL BRIGHT
SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all its implausibles, not the least being the immaculate
state of Mariel Hemingway's fingernails after they've scrambled up
three vertical rock formations, ``First Daughter'' is an adventure
thriller with enough sass to keep the viewer from zoning out.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than some big-budget films achieve these days with
their incendiary mix of gunpowder and testosterone. So ``First
Daughter'' might be forgiven its cable-budget lapses, such as
placing Whitefish, Mont., in the Bitterroot Range or having a
would-be assassin gain rooftop access to a home where the president
of the United States (played in this case by Gregory Harrison) is
attending a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there's a metaphor hiding in the underbrush, ``First
Daughter'' isn't trying to be anything more than two hours of
summer-TV escapism. Hardly original, it resembles ``The River
Wild,'' with quick pacing and decent characterization of the
principal good guys. And though Hemingway will never be mistaken
for Meryl Streep, the film manages to rise above its derivative
nature often enough to awaken anyone who might be dozing. Had
writers Chad and Carey Hayes put some meat on the bones of the bad
guys, ``First Daughter'' would be a highlight in TBS's
original-movie initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the producers cast World Championship Wrestling star
Diamond Dallas Page as a baddie, proving that promotional synergy _
WCW and TBS are Ted Turner enterprises _ supersedes artistic
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the film is routine TV-movie fare _ with occasional
bright spots. Hemingway plays Alex McGregor, a fast-rising Secret
Service agent heavy on professionalism and light on humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But after saving the president from a group of nut-job
terrorists, McGregor is demoted for disobeying an order. Her new
assignment: guarding the president's 16-year-old daughter, Jessica,
on an Outward Bound-type excursion that turns into a downward
spiral when the terrorists kidnap Jessica and use her as a
bargaining chip to set their imprisoned leader free.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor, savvy inside the Beltway, is as comfortable in the
wilderness as a salmon would be en croute. ``What's that smell?''
she asks upon arriving in the boonies. ``That would be pine,''
another agent replies.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor and Jessica, played by Monica Keena, resident brat of
the ``Dawson's Creek'' supporting cast, don't get along, and
McGregor doesn't hit it off too well with the expedition leader,
Grant Carlson, either. Agent Daley, McGregor's boss, is also on her
case, so the dramatic tension is established early and often: a
strong, independent woman alone against the world, and at least
some of the world is crazy and has big guns.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor's only supporter seems to be President Jonathan Hayes,
but even that relationship widens the gap between McGregor and
Jessica, who thinks the agent is putting the moves on her widowed
dad so she can become first stepmom.
</P>
<P>
   As screen presidents go, Harrison is a pale version of Michael
Douglas in ``The American President.'' Part of the problem is that
Harrison's screen time is briefer than the actual presidency of
another Harrison: William Henry.
</P>
<P>
   The role of McGregor is a good one for Hemingway, who, when it
comes to range, is not the Omar Vizquel of acting. Hemingway's
McGregor is a dedicated fed who doesn't smile much, and Hemingway
seems to have little trouble tapping into the character. If
McGregor's upper lip were any stiffer, she'd be on her majesty's
secret service, not her president's.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Savant, the former ``Melrose Place'' hunk, does his best to
break down McGregor's defenses as Carlson, the outdoorsy type. With
his help, McGregor sets out in search of Jessica and a happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Smarmy, yes. But credit the Hayes brothers with not including
the timeworn smooch scene just before the climax. Its absence lifts
the film above those in the vast mudpit into which most
action/adventure films fall. And credit Keena and Savant with
crafting strong supporting characters that make ``First Daughter''
slightly better than your basic-cable movie.
</P>
<P>
   First Daughter. Two-hour TV movie about a Secret Service agent's
attempt to rescue the president's teenage daughter from kidnappers.
Starring Mariel Hemingway, Monica Keena and Doug Savant. Sunday at
5 and 7 p.m., TBS Superstation. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR MICROSOFT IN BATTLE WITH AMERICA ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. acknowledged on Thursday that one of its
programmers apparently masqueraded as an independent computer
consultant earlier this week in an effort to discredit America
Online's tactics in the companies' quarrel over instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had reason to be red-faced about the incident _ first,
because the company was unable to identify which employee had
forged an e-mail message on Tuesday accusing America Online of
irresponsible behavior and second, because whoever did it sent the
message to the one computer security expert who was most likely to
find a way to trace it back to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse has added a bit of Spy vs. Spy melodrama to a bitter
dispute over instant online messaging that American Online and
Microsoft _ the world's two largest Internet service providers _
have been waging for several weeks. The dispute began last month
when Microsoft introduced a clone of the AOL Instant Messenger
program, which permits computer users to chat over the Internet
with other computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Since Microsoft released its clone, the two companies have waged
a public war of words while simultaneously carrying on a hacking
cyberwar as American Online has attempted to electronically lock
Microsoft Messenger users out of its network and Microsoft has at
least 13 times managed to find new backdoors.
</P>
<P>
   America Online executives say Microsoft is making illegal use of
proprietary directory information that is essential to connect
instant messenger users with each other via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft disinformation incident came to light on Wednesday
when Richard Smith, the president of Phar Lap Software and a
leading computer security expert, received an e-mail message from
someone identifying himself as Phil Bucking of Bucking Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   The author suggested that he was developing his own instant
messaging program and was studying America Online's tactics in
blocking Microsoft users. In his message, he asserted that America
Online is using a programming error that has created a security
flaw _ one not found in Microsoft's clone program _ to detect the
Microsoft Messenger program. The author said he was contacting
Smith because Smith had ``significant credibility with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you would agree that this is a heinous and risky
action,'' stated the electronic message, which was sent using a
free Yahoo e-mail account. ``I am perfectly fine with AOL and MS
fighting it out with standard software practices, but putting user
security at risk is unacceptable. It is inconceivable that a
company would even consider doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith, who has criticized Microsoft's software development
and privacy practices in the past, examined the message, he
discovered that it had actually originated within Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to use me as a pawn in their fight with
AOL,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Rob Bennett, the director of marketing
for Microsoft's Internet service, MSN, confirmed that the author of
the message was almost certainly a Microsoft employee, but he said
the company had not yet discovered his or her identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's somebody who got a little over-passionate but
went about it the wrong way,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry analysts said that the incident echoed a 1992
controversy in which Microsoft employees masqueraded as independent
computer users and posted messages to public computer bulletin
boards with opinions critical of IBM's OS/2 operating system, a
product that competed with Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is par for the course for Microsoft marketing,'' said
John C. Dvorak, a columnist for PC Magazine. ``In the past we
called them Microsoft munchkins. It was a scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said there had been no Microsoft plan to
play dirty tricks in its dispute with AOL. Bennett also said that
members of Microsoft's software development team had told him they
knew nothing about the incident.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bennett, however, insisted that the charges made in the message
were accurate and that America Online's programmers had been
exploiting a security flaw in the AOL Instant Messenger software to
identify Microsoft Messenger customers. He said that since the
dispute began in July, Microsoft had made 13 changes to its program
to get around America Online's efforts to block users of
Microsoft's clone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate they're putting user security at risk,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   An America Online executive disputed that there was any security
issue involved and said the company would not acknowledge that its
software contained a vulnerability known as a buffer-overflow
error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fake issue by a fake consultant, `` said Barry
Schuller, director of interactive services at America Online. ``Our
whole approach is all about privacy and security for our members,
and I think this is really embarrassing for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   A buffer overflow error is a type of programming defect that
could permit an intruder to execute rogue programming instructions
on a remote machine via a computer network. In some cases buffer
overflow bugs can be exploited to crash remote programs while
simultaneously executing illicit code.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that in the case of the AOL Instant Messenger,
the buffer overflow error did not result in a program crash. But by
running a program on its servers, America Online could exploit the
bug by weeding out users whose software did not have the error and
therefore had to be using the Microsoft clone.
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that the code Microsoft was questioning in
America Online's program might not, in fact, be a bug. But if it
was, he said, America Online's exploiting it to detect the
Microsoft clone was risky from the standpoints of privacy and
computer security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting network back doors in software products should be
against the law,'' he said. ``I don't like the idea at all of
`spyware.'''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft posted a change to its program Thursday night to work
around the new America Online strategy, Bennett said. But he added
that the workaround did not use a buffer overflow error.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, America Online and the Novell Corp. on Thursday
announced that Novell, a network software provider based in Provo,
Utah, had licensed the AOL Instant Messenger software and planned
to build it into its Netware Directory Services software for
corporate users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a huge opportunity,'' said Michael Sheridan,
vice president of strategy businesses for Novell. ``This is
something half-way between a cell phone and electronic mail.''

justice in the slaying of a postal worker and the shooting of five

STAMP LEGISLATION INTRODUCED TO HONOR LELAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee has introduced
legislation to honor the late Rep. George Thomas ``Mickey'' Leland
with commemorative postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Leland and 15 others, were killed Aug. 7, 1989, in an airplane
crash in Ethiopia while on a food relief mission.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said she introduced the bills because she
wanted to do something that would bring national and international
recognition to Leland and his humanitarian work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there would be no better commemorative salute and
tribute to him than this,'' Jackson Lee said Thursday at a Houston
ceremony at Atherton Elementary School, which Leland attended.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee said the bills will create a regular postage stamp
and a semipostal stamp. Semipostals cost 40 cents and the extra
money generated by the sales can be earmarked for special
charitable causes.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from the Leland semipostals will be used to fund hunger
programs in the United States and abroad, Jackson Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   She said if the legislation is approved, the new stamps could be
issued late this year or early in 2000.

COMMENTARY: A CERTAIN CONTAGION CALLED GOODNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The choice of subject for this column was difficult for me to
make, journalistically and personally.
</P>
<P>
   Should I, must I, write at once about the shooting of the
children in Los Angeles, about the murders, in our own land, of
people because they were Jews, or blacks, or gay or students, or
worked in an abortion clinic, and so had to be killed?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, of course, I told myself for two days, not just for news
importance but in self-defense. The other killers that American
Nazism has spawned will never stop hunting Jews, blacks and the
other targets.
</P>
<P>
   The least we can do is use all our national and personal legal
power and strength to track them down before they spill more of
their evil passions to spill more of our blood.
</P>
<P>
   But then I knew I did not want to write about the Los Angeles
shootings for this particular column and would not. The reason is
that I had planned to write about the power, in a man I know, of
human goodness. If I wrote this column about the killer, his evil
would, for this day in this space, conquer my friend and his value
to the world, and I could not permit that.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that evil is contagious. But most of us do not talk
or write about the contagiousness of goodness. When we do, we mince
around it, as if the thought was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture of decency and determination in my friend, and his
spirituality _ another word we duck _ produces the aura of plain
goodness. Armed with that and nothing else, he has saved a small
nation and its religion from spiritual extinction by a huge
neighbor. He has attracted around the world a peaceful army of men
and women who work separately or together to help his people
preserve their identity.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Tenzin Gyatso, and he is the Dalai Lama of Tibet,
visiting and teaching in New York City for a few days. He has been
admired worldwide for almost a half-century, ever since he escaped
from Tibet after it was occupied by Communist China.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he goes, he is eagerly welcomed by the people and
painstakingly ignored by governments. Beijing has warned national
leaders of the price to be paid for supporting him. It terrifies
them _ less trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   To be infected by evil or affected by goodness, governments and
people have to have a receptivity to them. The men who run China or
other dictatorships cannot have the receptivity to what goodness
demands _ abandonment of repression of the people they rule. That
would mean the end of the Politburo's control apparatus, and of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   So, having killed a million Tibetans, burned thousands of
temples, arrested tens of thousands of monks, nuns and peaceful
freedom fighters, and followed military invasion with a Chinese
civilian takeover, Beijing cannot conceive of another way to govern
its colony while remaining in power.
</P>
<P>
   At his hotel, the Dalai Lama told me that oppression had
tightened. Monks and nuns are forced to choose between immersing
themselves in Communist political education and being ousted from
monasteries and convents, often into jail.
</P>
<P>
   The capital of Lhasa and other cities, he said, now have more
Chinese than Tibetans. His people must carry on their daily affairs
speaking Chinese, not Tibetan, and scrabble for droppings of work
not gobbled by Chinese newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   For Tibetans, he asks not independence but autonomy, the
self-rule over their lives that the West has demanded _ and fought
wars to attain _ for so many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998 China's president promised America's on world TV
that Beijing would finally talk with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened, the Dalai Lama said. Even Chinese
back-channel contacts Beijing had permitted were cut dead. Breaking
the promise was a direct insult to President Clinton. He does not
seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in India, I asked the Dalai Lama if he ever got angry. Not
anymore, he said; it benefited the Chinese more than it did him.
</P>
<P>
   He is a muscular man of robust voice, who loves to laugh. He
reciprocates respect and affection with a generosity possessed only
by the strong of soul.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, Tibet cannot achieve autonomous breathing room. But the
Dalai Lama has made millions around the world believe in the power
of goodness in the individual. In return, they give him a
determination that one day Tibet will be free, or freer. Meantime,
they will help its cause, and stand by its people.

BET HOLDINGSTO GAMBLE $35 MILLION ON WEB OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to close a digital divide on the Web, BET Holdings said
it has arranged a $35 million round of financing to revamp its
on-line offerings and draw in more African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, chairman and chief executive of Washington-based
BET, said his company will launch the site in November with backing
from Microsoft Corp., Liberty Media Group, News Corp., and USA
Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   BET is best known as the operator of the Black Entertainment
Television cable-TV network, but to date has had a relatively
modest Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   To change that, the investment group is targeting
African-Americans, who use the Internet less often than the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Thursday said the investment represented the
largest-ever amount for an African-American business and outlined a
mix of marketing ventures, entertainment content, and political
news tailored to the specialized audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among African-Americans, the Internet is not seen as something
you have to have yet, and we're going to change that mindset,''
said Johnson. ``Nobody has been talking to the community about why
it's important and that's what I think we'll change.''
</P>
<P>
   The new site will face off against competitors such as
NetNoir.com, in which America Online Inc. holds a major stake, and
Blackvoices.com, with backing from Tribune Co. in Chicago.
Microsoft and Liberty Media, partly owned by AT&AMP;T, had previous
investments in BET and its current site on the Web, known as MSBET.
</P>
<P>
   The site draws about 1 million visitors a month, but so far has
focused on entertainment figures such as singer Lauryn Hill.
Johnson said he hopes to double the number of visitors with the
updated site, known as BET.com.
</P>
<P>
   He will do so by offering a full-service portal site with news
and sports features, travel services, and financial advice.
</P>
<P>
   It will also become a direct on-line retailer of products aimed
at African-American consumers, and carry content from major
organizations such as the United Negro College Fund and the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, plans call for hiring 40 to 50 new staff members at
its Washington headquarters, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The new service mix seems a better use of BET's name
recognition, said Vaughn Halyard, analyst at Meta Group in
Stamford, Conn., and should allow the creation of more original
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their initial site was just a repurposing,'' Halyard said.
``This allows them to get control of their brand and get the `MS'
off the front of the name.''
</P>
<P>
   On a per-capita basis, market analysts say, African-Americans
already buy more cable-television and satellite-based services than
the general population, but they lag on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research in Cambridge estimates that 23 percent of
African-American households are on line, compared to 34 percent of
whites, 64 percent of Asians, and 36 percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of their low penetration rate, however, Internet
usage among African-American is also growing at the fastest rate of
the four ethnic groups, Forrester estimates. The consulting firm
predicts usage will grow by 10 percent this year to 3.8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   BET's initiative suggests the African-American market is now
getting more attention, said Ken Smikle, president of Target Market
News, a Chicago-based research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional media offerings often neglect African-American
audiences,'' said Smikle. ``We are constantly in search of things
that reflect our interests.''

PATRIOTS LOOK TO TO THE `SECOND-YEAR GUYS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The Patriots wish list for Friday's
exhibition opener against the Washington Redskins is simple: Let
the veterans stay healthy. Let them be productive. And then hope
the young guys are the second coming of Ben Coates, Curtis Martin,
and Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Simple wishes? Lofty goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``The second-year guys I'm just hoping will be able to carry it
from offseason to camp,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``Chris Floyd,
Tony Simmons, Harold Shaw, Rod Rutledge, and Tebucky (Jones) have
all made obvious changes. They just look different. More experience
will help, but these are the guys who keep coming on. They will
give us real nice depth and quality play. It's a wishful hope they
can carry on with that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the exhibition season shouldn't be about winning and
looking good, it will be. Those skepticle about the Patriots'
chances of finishing higher than fourth in the AFC East will be
looking for strong performances, especially at running back, where
Kevin Faulk will see time after new acquisition Lamont Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk leads a list of first-year players who will be asked to
step in and contribute. There will be a limited breaking-in period
for Faulk, center Damien Woody, and linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer.
Along with the second-year players, there is a significant number
of Patriots who will be asked to fill significant roles that used
to belong to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   While fans will be watching Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn, the
coaching staff will be focusing on guys like Rutledge, Floyd, and
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge will start for All-Pro tight end Coates, who is still
nursing a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm doing all right,'' said Rutledge. ``It's a short
opportunity, though. Ben will be back and I'll have the same role
I've had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are hoping Rutledge can be more of a factor
catching the football. He's used in short-yardage situations as a
blocker, a role he already has mastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been catching the ball pretty well and doing as good a
job as anyone,'' said Rutledge. ``I'm blocking just as well as I
did last year. I think I'm going to look better all the way around.
I lost a little bit of weight, about 10 pounds. I came in at 272
last year and this year I came in at 262. I feel I can block better
at this weight.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lovett Purnell having been traded to Baltimore, the
Patriots need Rutledge to do more than block. Coates has helped
Rutledge with his pass catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from him,'' said Rutledge. ``Like the legal
way to push off and different ways to get open. He's a master at
that. He never gets called for it because he does it in a fashion
where it's legal. He's Ben Coates and that Michael Jordan rule
works with him. I don't know if I'll be able to get away with some
of the stuff. But I'll pick up some things he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge has taken all of the reps in practice to allow Coates
time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben is getting up there in age and he don't like to hit those
big defensive ends anymore,'' quipped Rutledge. ``They brought me
in to beat them up while Ben catches some passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player to watch is Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who feel Jones is better suited to be a safety
after watching Shawn Jefferson beat him during an intrasquad game
last Saturday, but the coaching staff doesn't agree. Carroll
continues to laud Jones, while secondary coach Ron Lynn is
convinced the Patriots have a bonafide right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk will have to show more than he did in the intrasquad game
and much of that will depend on the offensive line's run-blocking.
It's certainly been emphasized by new line coach Dante Scarnecchia,
but whether it will translate to more yardage and tough yardage
remains to be seen. Faulk could also quell anxiety over the
position with a strong performance, though Warren will likely play
against Washington's first team.
</P>
<P>
   Woody's performance has steadily improved throughout camp. The
Patriots are excited about his run-blocking, but he'll have to go
up against Redskins tackle Dana Stubblefield, a formidable task
right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd may still technically be the backup, but his playing time
could wind up surpassing that of Tony Carter. Floyd is a bruising
fullback who can also run with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons made an initial splash at camp but has leveled off. The
Patriots need a big-time performance from Simmons in order to feel
comfortable if they decide to trade one of their veterans later in
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Besides focusing on Katzenmoyer, the Patriots also have to watch
for young linebackers to emerge as backups. Third-year player
Vernon Crawford needs to make more of an impact, as does Bernard
Russ. And on the defensive line, second-year tackle Brandon
Mitchell, who will be playing with a broken hand, needs to perform.

 &HT;    Singer Joe Cocker cleans out closet for yard sale
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Colo. _ One man's junk is another man's treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Ask British rock and blues legend Joe Cocker.
</P>
<P>
   Cocker's Mad Dog Ranch, tucked away in a private enclave beneath
the shadows of Needle Rock outside this small town, turns into
bargain central this weekend when the singer and his wife, Pam,
open their doors to the community for one of the swankiest yard
sales this side of Aspen to benefit the Cocker Kids' Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   An invitation to tour their basement has turned up dirt on the
Cockers.
</P>
<P>
   Yep.
</P>
<P>
   They are like any other couple in America who have too much
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the snowmobile jacket worn only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smelly business really, isn't it?'' asks Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the motorized model sail boat that sank during
it's maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and I took it out when he first got it,'' begins Pam.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the sails were put together wrong,'' interjects Joe, in a
lingering British accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe set it off in the pond and it started to sink, and of
course he's standing there screaming and I had to run into the pond
up to my waist in mud and retrieve it,'' finishes Pam.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the red velour smoking jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my smoking jacket,'' exclaims Joe as Pam holds up the
lost find before him, swinging it from side to side and teasing him
by saying, ``Look what's going,'' her angelic face breaking into a
toothy grin. ``He had to have it and never wore it.''
</P>
<P>
   The yard sale is a first for the Cockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if I was going to clean out my closet, other people
would too,'' says Pam, who organized the fund-raising event to take
the place of the Mad Dog Ranch home tour which is held every other
year.
</P>
<P>
   For two months, volunteers with the Cocker Kids' Foundation have
been scouring western Colorado picking up items donated by
individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the offerings up for grabs include Joe's concert tour
memorabilia _ featuring an autographed Fender guitar, two of Joe's
gold records and the black wool trench coat he wore on the ``Across
From Midnight'' tour _ furniture and decorating accessories from
the couple's Santa Barbara, Calif., home, handmade Western saddles
and designer shoes and clothes (at least 200 of Joe's shirts!) from
each of their respective closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Armani suits that Joe wore last year on tour,'' says
Pam. ``Once he's worn something on stage, he never wears it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm winding my wardrobe down,'' quips Joe. ``T-shirts,'' he
proclaims, ``when I'm here, that's all I wear. Once in a while I
dress up for the parades and put a shirt on.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the yard sale, there will also be an auction and
raffle with items donated by area businesses, which include gift
certificates, pottery, glassware, clothing, athletic gear, lift
tickets, hotel accommodations, plane tickets _ even a sightseeing
tour on a private plane.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are also invited to a garden party on the estate
grounds featuring live entertainment by Magpie, voted best new
debut band at the New Orleans Jazz Festival, and Treehouse, which
has opened for acts like Bonnie Raitt, Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash and
Keb Mo'.
</P>
<P>
   Food, activities for the kids and self-guided garden tours
featuring an array of flowers in full bloom and plants will also be
available, with master gardeners on hand to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The event is a fund-raiser for the Cocker Kids' Foundation
founded by the Cockers. The goal of the foundation is to foster
accountability and responsibility in youth while helping them
achieve personal goals that might not otherwise be attainable.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the foundation has contributed to many projects,
including the expansion of the Hotchkiss library, Paonia Sports
Field and Hotchkiss High School Track and Weight Room, and uniforms
and traveling expenses for local sports teams. The charity also has
funded medical aid, camp and child care scholarships and the start
up a North Fork Valley teen newspaper dubbed, ``PHAT,'' which
stands for Perspectives Held and Announced by Teens.
</P>
<P>
   The Cockers have made Crawford their year-round residence where
they raise Ankole Watusi cattle and championship quarter horses at
the Mad Dog Ranch named after famed early album, ``Mad Dog &AMP;
Englishmen.''
</P>
<P>
   They also own the Mad Dog Ranch Fountain Cafe in downtown
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, 55, has enjoyed a musical career that has spanned three
decades. Highlights include performances at Woodstock, an
appearance on the ``Ed Sullivan Show,'' and a host of hit albums,
including ``Civilized Man,'' ``Unchain My Heart,'' ``When The Night
Comes,'' ``Night Calls'' and ``Across From Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to sit idle, Joe has spent the past few months in the
studio recording his latest CD, ``No Ordinary World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a different project for me,'' says Joe. ``There is a
singer called Robbie Williams, a young kid who is a real big
success. My record company tried to get me to work with the same
producer thinking we might have a whole different way to make a Joe
Cocker record. I got quite nervous that the songs weren't going to
work out, but in the end, the songs sound like something I would
have done on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD will be released in Europe in September. A world tour to
promote the release kicks off in October in Germany.

   RUSSIA-OIL (Moscow) _ In November 1997, British Petroleum began
its acquisition of a 10 percent stake in the Russian oil company
Sidanko with a signing ceremony at No. 10 Downing Street. Eighteen
months after the smiles and handshakes, BP, now BP Amoco PLC, is
embroiled in a bankruptcy proceeding and a takeover fight that
threatens to destroy Sidanko and BP Amoco's investment in it. The
situation puts the very future of direct foreign investment in
Russia at risk. By Neela Banerjee.

AD BLITZ APPEARS TO BE PAYING OFF FOR FORBES IN IOWA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTERSET, IOWA _ When Steve Forbes dropped by the historical
complex in picturesque Madison County on Thursday, he immediately
posed for photographs with those who showed up to hear his
presidential pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later when the magazine mogul and GOP
presidential candidate had finished his presentation, the pictures
had been developed and spread out on a table as campaign mementos
for prospective backers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Forbes style takes resources. The millionaire
contender appears willing to spend what it takes to stroke
potential supporters and get them out for the first presidential
test Saturday at the GOP party straw poll in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have been promised lapel pins _ silver for supporters
and gold for team leaders _ along with T-shirts and free tickets to
the weekend event featuring a host of entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate has blitzed the state with radio ads, including
one featuring Debbie Boone urging people to come hear her sing at
the Forbes tent outside the straw poll site at Iowa State
University.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a half hour of time Thursday evening on a Des Moines
television station to host a live call-in show.
</P>
<P>
   Only Texas Gov. George W. Bush has rivaled Forbes in the
magnitude of his straw poll effort.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Bush, Forbes has spent a good deal of time traveling
around the state in his bus caravan hoping to persuade voters that
as a Washington outsider and a successful businessman he can shake
up the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has broadened his message beyond the flat tax-theme that
dominated his first presidential foray in 1996. In an effort to woo
social conservatives he tells his audiences that ``I am pro-life. I
recognize that many Americans don't share that goal. But that
doesn't mean you put that goal aside.'' He is running radio ads
pledging to appoint anti-abortion judges.
</P>
<P>
   He also appears eager to win social conservatives on other
issues, such as allowing the posting of the Ten Commandments in
public places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier to bring Hitler's `Mein Kampf' to a school than
the Ten Commandments,'' he told an audience at the Hotel Pattee in
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Forbes seems most enthusiastic discussing economic and
policy issues, such as his plan to revamp the tax system and his
proposal to invest a portion of the Social Security payroll tax in
the private market. He also attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan for raising interest rates when the economy is humming,
saying that would be similar to a doctor making a healthy person
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' time and investment in the state appear to be paying
off. A poll released Thursday showed him climbing to second place
behind Bush, and political observers expect him to at least come in
second in the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' campaign makes it clear it views the race as a
competition with the Texas governor. Forbes has criticized Bush for
his failure to flesh out positions on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he wanted to debate Bush and the other candidates so
that voters could distinguish ``who is for business as usual, just
a bunch of glittering cliches and mottos and nice sounding phrases,
and who has the real substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Luckinbill, who showed up at Forbes' Madison County event,
said he had already decided who was the meatier candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is pretty good about telling you what he thinks,'' said
Luckinbill. ``Some of the others don't say very much.'' Luckinbill,
who voted for Pat Buchanan last time, said he is backing Forbes
now.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hauslein, chairman of Miami-based Sunglass Hut, took time
off from work this week to travel with the Forbes campaign.
Hauslein said he believes that Forbes ``has the financial
wherewithal to mount a competitive campaign for office.''
</P>
<P>
   While many corporate leaders are backing Bush, Hauslein said, he
believes Forbes has a better understanding of businessmen's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a professional politician,'' he said.

 &HT;    Home Depot says earnings will exceed expectations
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's already-strong outlook got even brighter
Thursday as analysts increased their projections for the company's
profits this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest home improvement retailer said profit in
the second quarter would beat forecasts, thanks to surging home
sales and the demand for products that go in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building supply stores tend to do well when sales of existing
homes do well,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union
Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, consumers are fueling the longest run of retail sales
gains in at least a decade. Sales rose 0.7 percent last month to
$248.7 billion, according to a Commerce Department report. That
more than offset a 0.2 percent decline in June.
</P>
<P>
   But interest rates are creeping up, causing some potential home
buyers to hold off on purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Home Depot expects to report earnings of 44 cents a
share for the quarter, 5 cents more than the average estimate of
analysts polled by First Call Corp. The company earned 31 cents in
the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call expect the home improvement
company to earn $1.44 for the year, a 4-cent increase from an
earlier estimate. Analysts also increased their per-share forecasts
by 4 cents for 2000, to $1.73.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which will release a full earnings report on
Tuesday, said second-quarter sales rose 28 percent to $10.43
billion. Sales at stores open at least one year jumped 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter results will mark the sixth straight quarter
Home Depot has beaten forecasts, and the 14th out of the past 16,
according to Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call.
Analysts noted that Home Depot's earnings are difficult to project
because it doesn't release monthly sales figures like many other
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's stock closed Thursday at $59.37 1/2, up $1.62 1/2.

 &HT;    Bogle steps down from Vanguard
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John C. Bogle, the father of the index mutual fund, is
leaving the board of the Vanguard Group.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement _ announced Thursday, three months after Bogle
passed Vanguard's customary retirement age of 70 _ caps a 50-year
career that included managing the investments of millions of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle said from his vacation home Thursday that he was
surprised, rather than dismayed, that the board would not waive the
mandatory retirement policy for Vanguard's founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed emotions,'' he said. He said he will remain a
spokesman and adviser to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle founded Vanguard in 1974. It now manages about $500
billion in investments, second only to the Fidelity fund family.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's flagship Index 500 fund transformed the public's
investing patterns by providing low-cost access to mutual funds
that mimic the S&AMP;P 500-stock index and other indices.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle leaves his chosen successor, 45-year-old John Brennan, in
charge. Brennan was named chief executive officer in 1996 and
chairman in 1998, when Bogle became senior chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle has remained the public face of the Vanguard Group. He
spoke often _ including a 1998 appearance at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's Money&AMP;More investment conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Aboard his high-tech bus, watching the cornfields
whiz by, Steve Forbes is wheeling into town squares all over Iowa
these days in search of respect as a presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, politician and patrician is a blur of nonstop
motion, rolling around the rural landscape at the rate of four to
six cities a day, 180 events in four weeks. He is seeking enough
support _ and spending whatever it takes _ to make a respectable
showing in Saturday's Republican straw poll, a prize that confers
headline status even though it is no real test of voter sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by an entourage in two big shiny buses equipped with
the latest satellite and digital gear, Forbes is banking on a
decent enough showing to justify the $10 million he has spent so
far on his message of conservative morals, politics and economics _
themes his advisers believe resonate best in rural America.
</P>
<P>
   For all his money, in fact, Forbes is often seen here as being a
regular guy, as he travels the byways from Grundy Center to
Marengo, from Pella to Monona. ``I back everything he said,'' said
William Baretich, a retired high school principal who showed up at
a Forbes event this week in Eagle Grove. ``So far as I am
concerned, his wealth is a plus. I have no idea how he got it, but
he's got a good business sense, and we need someone with his
expertise to run the government because it's probably the biggest
corporation of them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the presidential candidates in footing his own bill,
Forbes, whose net worth is estimated to be between $440 million and
$500 million, said he would spend whatever it takes to make him
competitive with Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Forbes spent over $35
million on his failed presidential bid in 1996. Bush has raised
more than $36 million so far, and both candidates have opted out of
the campaign finance system and its limits on spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be assured,'' Forbes said, without being specific, in a
back-of-the-bus interview, ``I will spend enough to be very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, what he is buying, besides lots of radio and television
ads, is organization, which is what really counts in the nearly
25-year-old Iowa contest. His campaign entourage has been pulling
up to American Legion and Elks halls in hundreds of quiet Iowa
towns, the sound system on the buses blaring Forbes' presence like
that of a political music man. While the scenes can be charmingly
old fashioned, the buses are anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, they look like something from a James Bond movie set. A
squadron of clean-cut young men, all dressed in identical khaki
pants and blue polo shirts emblazoned with the Forbes logo, operate
from a hidden high-tech world of laptops, digital laser printers
and satellite phones, and make use of three cell line connections
and two lines for modem use from any town square. Also in the
entourage are a bevy of young women in khaki skirts and white polo
shirts with the Forbes logo, as well as a separate crew in gray
polos with a Forbes Iowa logo.
</P>
<P>
   All the gadgetry is aimed at creating grassroots support. Names
and phone numbers written on cards handed out at the events are put
into the campaign databank before the bus hits the next town.
Anyone who wants a picture taken with the candidate gets a color
laser copy of the photo before the campaign event is over. And any
photos taken can be put instantaneously onto the Forbes campaign
Web site, which has received 35 million hits and drawn 25,000
volunteers, according to the Forbes staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using the Wal-Mart strategy,'' said K.B. Forbes, the
campaign's Iowa press secretary who is no relation to Forbes. ``We
are hitting the rural areas first. We're finding the activists who
are attracted to Forbes. All the other candidates are focusing on
the chiefs, the elites. We're focusing on the Indians, the
grassroots activists.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend will be the first test of whether Forbes' methods
and messages really do resonate here.
</P>
<P>
   In his endless stream of gatherings, typically attracting
between 40 and 80 people, Forbes offers a stump speech that rails
against abortion, Washington-as-usual politics and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent interest rate hike, while
extolling a flat 15 percent income tax, higher defense spending and
more choice in education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   He has loosened up his speaking style, and, while he still
appears to be more banker than politician, his words are received
with respectful interest and standing ovations in this politically
conservative region. His reference to the ``infernal revenue
service'' is a standard laugh-getter, along with his designation of
Washington officeholders as ``critters looking for the honey pot''
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Goodman liked what she heard when Forbes appeared in her
hometown of Gundy Center earlier this week. ``We need a leader to
carry on the Reagan policies,'' she said. ``His idea for a flat tax
is honest and simple, and he's not a Washington politician.''
</P>
<P>
   John Whalen of Eudora said, ``We're in a world of hurt here, and
we've got to get the government out of things whether it's farming
or Medicare. He's right on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa straw poll has been criticized as a way for the local
Republican Party to gather publicity and dollars _ everyone who
votes in it must pay a $25 entry fee and voting must be done in
person here in Ames. As a result, candidates like Forbes pick up
the $25 entry tab and try to get as many people as they can to come
to Ames on a hot summer's weekend to vote in a poll that is not
binding on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contest where money matters, and Forbes is pouring on
his resources: His aides say they have lined up 85 regular buses to
transport potential voters _ a total of around 4,000 people in a
contest where 10,000 to 15,000 are expected to vote. To lure
supporters, Forbes is offering them a big barbecue party in Ames
beneath two air-conditioned tents where country music entertainer
Ronnie Milsap and inspirational singer Debbie Boone will entertain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' wealth, rather than being a political liability, seems
not to matter to some of those who have heard him here.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Broer of Iowa Falls, who said she typically votes
Democratic, said Forbes' wealth ``was one of the reasons why he
intrigues me. He's willing to risk his personal fortune in this
endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   And Keith Schwebke, also of Iowa Falls, said, ``His wealth does
give him the ability to compete with the Bushes. Yet he still comes
across as a common guy I could go up and talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes may be dismissed by some as indulging in the
political fantasies of a rich man, he sees himself as a man with a
message. He believes the party has failed when it offers candidates
who are long on image but short on policy substance. ``There can be
no victory without a message,'' said Forbes. ``Right now my party
is rallied around one candidate,'' he said, referring to Bush.
``But those who want real change will come more and more to this
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his slow start in 1996, Forbes came out early and
aggressively this time, and he is sustained by the belief that the
party establishment will no longer shrug off his candidacy if he
performs well in early party caucuses. Forbes is spending his money
on television, radio and newspaper ads and on direct mail and phone
banks in key early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona
and California. As a measure of how the candidate is doing, his
campaign likes to pull out a headline from The Fairfield, Iowa,
Daily Ledger, which said: ``Forbes, author of the flat tax, sings
to the choir in Fairfield.''

RENO CALLS FOR LICENSING OF ALL FIREARM OWNERS IN WAKE OF L.A.
SHOOTINGS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday the
federal government should consider requiring all firearm owners to
be licensed, going further than the gun-control measures President
Clinton has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, reacting to Reno's comments, said he ``strongly''
supports and associates himself with the suggestion. But the
president declined to add licensing to a wide-ranging gun-control
proposal he has presented to Congress and which lawmakers have
largely rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's and Clinton's comments followed the Wednesday surrender
of Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., a white supremacist and neo-Nazi
charged with attempting to kill two youngsters, a teen-ager and an
adult Tuesday at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, who surrendered to FBI agents in Las Vegas and was
returned to Los Angeles, also is charged with killing U.S. postal
worker Joseph Ileto after the center attack.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, speaking at her weekly news briefing, said licensing of
gun owners should be part of broader legislation aimed at
preventing felons and children from gaining access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are never going to get a serious grip on gun violence in
this country until we adopt comprehensive measures to keep guns
away from those who should not have them,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we must seriously explore the possibility of
requiring the licensing of all handguns,'' she said. ``It is common
sense, pure common sense, to ensure that guns are only in the hands
of those who know how to safely and lawfully use them and have the
capacity and willingness to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though endorsing Reno's comments, urged Congress to go
no further than supporting his existing gun-control proposal, which
includes raising the legal age for purchasing firearms from 18 to
21, placing trigger locks on weapons and holding parents
responsible if children gain illicit access to guns. The president
called the shootings in Los Angeles ``another compelling argument
for the passage of the ... common-sense gun legislation we have
recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv, explaining the president's
position, said Clinton, ``has had some positive things to say''
about the potential licensing of gun owners. But the president
``right now (is) focused ... on trying to get through the Congress
sensible ideas for limiting access to guns to criminals and to
children in order to protect children,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's suggestion that gun owners be licensed echoed similar
recommendations from Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey
Senator Bill Bradley, who are running for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination, has assailed licensing proposals, saying
they will not discourage hardened criminals from using guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is investigating Furrow's attacks to
determine if anti-semitism or prejudice against Asians motivated
the violence, in which case U.S. prosecutors could charge him under
the federal hate-crime statute.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, citing the possibility of prejudice as a motive for the
shootings, reiterated the Clinton administration's largely
unsuccessful call for Congress to pass stronger laws prohibiting
hate crimes and tightening gun control. The attorney general also
urged adults to teach children to be tolerant of ethnic differences
in order to stop the the cycle of violence driven by prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminating hate crimes and eliminating bigotry and bitterness
are among this nation's most important and most enduring
challenges,'' Reno said. ``We must do more to teach our children
tolerance and make sure that they learn to accept all people,
regardless of their race, religion, nationality or sexual
orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the Republican-led House and Senate have been
unwilling to broaden federal hate-crime and gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton has proposed extending to women,
homosexuals and disabled people the same protection from hate
crimes that racial, religious and national-origin minorities now
have. But many House and Senate Republicans oppose expanding the
law, saying instead that states should receive greater federal
assistance in combating and prosecuting crimes under the existing
statute.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also have largely rejected the president's gun-control
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, after rancorous debate, has approved legislation
that would require background checks be performed before a person
can buy firearms at gun shows. But the House has refused to close
what the White House calls the gun-show loophole, prompting the
administration to urge lawmakers to adopt the Senate version when
Congress returns to work after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical time in our nation's history,'' Reno said.
``We can go into the next century with a realistic prospect of
ending the culture of violence in this country. It is critical that
we do so now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In November 1997, British Petroleum marked its
acquisition of a 10 percent stake in the Russian oil company
Sidanko with a signing ceremony at 10 Downing St.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair joined executives from both
sides to begin a project they believed would succeed where others
between Russia and the West had failed. BP had the experience and
cash, paying $484 million for the Sidanko shares and planning to
invest $3 billion more over the next decade, mainly to develop a
huge Siberian gas field. And Vladimir Potanin, president of
Russia's Uneximbank, Sidanko's owner, had the political clout to
shepherd the project through Russia's hostile business environment.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months after the smiles and handshakes, BP, now BP
Amoco PLC, is embroiled in a bankruptcy proceeding and takeover
fight that threatens to destroy Sidanko and BP Amoco's investment
in it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this one deal, the future of direct foreign investment in
Russia is at risk. ``Everybody is watching this,'' one Western oil
executive said. ``If this can happen to BP, it shows that everybody
is vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly Russia's largest direct foreign investor, BP Amoco has
been outmaneuvered by an aggressive, well-connected rival, Russia's
Tyumen Oil Co. As many of its Moscow executives resort to
bodyguards or keep low profiles, BP Amoco accuses Tyumen of
tampering with Russian courts to wrest Sidanko's main production
unit away through the bankruptcy process. Tyumen denies this.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has already written off $200 million of its investment,
and company insiders say that if Tyumen succeeds in taking over
Sidanko, it will have to write it all off. Britain had raised the
issue with Russia's recently ousted prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin, but received no response.
</P>
<P>
   How could BP Amoco, with its experience in volatile developing
nations, fall into such a mire? Its involvement with Sidanko
unravels as a tale of carelessness and naivete, one in which it
tried to follow the rules of Western business only to discover too
late that those rules do not apply in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hadn't thought through the scale of risks,'' said
Stephen O'Sullivan, head of research at United Financial Group, a
Moscow investment bank. ``People see Russia as a poor First World
country, when it's really the Third World in many ways. There's no
history of doing business here, no tradition of the rule of law, no
civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidanko is now in bankruptcy proceedings, but BP Amoco wants to
avoid liquidating it. That will mean reaching an amicable
settlement with Sidanko's creditors, mainly a consortium of
European banks that lent the Russian concern a third of its $450
million in outstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
   Any settlement would involve the refinancing of Sidanko by BP
Amoco, which is also a creditor, and by the banks. For this to
work, all the banks in the consortium must agree. Most have, but
Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank has sold its $10 million portion
of the debt to Tyumen, people at both companies say. The bank,
which is owed about $100 million by Tyumen, apparently does not
believe the BP Amoco plan will save Sidanko.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Tyumen has bought this debt, it will probably vote
against the amicable settlement, sending Sidanko into liquidation.
That would increase Tyumen's chances of acquiring Sidanko's prime
production unit, Chernogorneft, cheaply. ``Without Chernogorneft,''
said one person close to BP Amoco, ``Sidanko as a company is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A bankrupt company picked apart by its rivals was the last thing
BP expected. Two years ago, Russia was a bull market. Many
foreigners believed the country would develop into a Western-style
market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sidanko was among the five largest Russian oil concerns. At its
helm was Potanin, a young, apparently pro-Western banker and one of
Russia's most powerful executives, with close ties to the Kremlin.
The conventional wisdom urged Westerners to pick powerful,
trustworthy Russian partners, and BP obviously thought it had.
</P>
<P>
   It chose Sidanko ``to get a long-term foothold in Russia,'' said
Howard Chase, director of BP Amoco's external affairs in Moscow.
The company had an eye on Sidanko's Kovytkinskoye gas field in
Siberia, from which it hoped, eventually, to export natural gas to
lucrative east Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight is seldom fair, but two years ago, if BP had dug a
little deeper into Sidanko or given more thought to the problems of
working in Russia, the deal might have turned out differently.
</P>
<P>
   No Russian oil concern, analysts point out, is a ``company'' in
the Western sense, with clear books and effective management. But
some are worse than others, and Sidanko was in the back of the
pack. Of Sidanko's seven production units, only Chernogorneft and
Udmurtneft were strong. Sidanko's main refinery is hundreds of
miles from its oil fields, in a sparsely populated region with only
dying military industries to sell to and no access to export
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Potanin, through his connections, paid about $470 million for
the whole company _ nearly what BP paid for a 10 percent stake, 20
percent voting rights and a few positions in Sidanko upper
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't influence a Russian company with a 10 percent
stake,'' said Erik Wigertz, oil analyst for the Moscow investment
bank Brunswick Warburg. ``You need at least a 25 percent stake to
block decisions at shareholders' meetings.'' If the reorganization
plan is approved, BP Amoco said, it will get that 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco managers in key financial posts in Sidanko, most of
whom do not speak Russian, have spent the last year trying to bring
its messy finances under control and then struggling to cut debts
and spending, with some success. But the British company could not
begin to deal with the many problems at Sidanko's subsidiaries, the
first to be driven into bankruptcy late last year.

FORECLOSED LANDOWNER TO SERVE JAIL TERM IN LOAN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A former Hamilton man who waged a year-long standoff
that cost the government more than $500,000 continued to insist
Thursday that he never disobeyed court orders to leave his former
estate, even as he was being sentenced to four months in jail for
defying them.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, a tall, former Army captain who became a familiar
television image in camouflage fatigues during the standoff, spoke
in a soft voice of how ``incredible'' he still finds his criminal
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A terrible wrong has been going on here and continues to go
on,'' said Sweeney, 59, a self-styled victim of what he says was
fraud by the bank that loaned him $1.6 million to subdivide his
14-acre estate.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal court disagreed, saying he had defaulted on the
loan and the government properly foreclosed on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney and his family remained on the Hamilton property for 10
years without making mortgage payments while suing the bank in
state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sweeney tried unsuccessfully to convince US District
Judge Robert E. Keeton to sentence him to probation rather than
prison. He came armed with 112 letters from friends and supporters
urging probation, including the president of a national
conservative political group. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
Sheehan's former roommate at Bowdoin College, sent along his good
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But Keeton chose a sentence two months shy of the six months
that Assistant US Attorney Alex Whiting urged him to impose. Keeton
focused on the cost of Sweeney's protest.
</P>
<P>
   The US Marshals Service alone spent $370,000 on staff and
resources. The federal agency that took over the failed bank that
had loaned the money to the Sweeneys paid at least $150,000 in back
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hamilton Police Chief Walter Cullen said he had not
tallied his department's expenses for extra security patrols. And
some costs _ such as the ``tremendous amount of anxiety for
(Sweeney's) neighbors'' during the standoff _ could not be
calculated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney stirred fears by predicting a bloody climax to the
standoff, similar to confrontations at Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco,
Texas. Sweeney asked for assistance from militia groups around the
country and communicated with members and reporters via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cullen said, ``unusual characters'' showed up and
volunteered to guard the property. People dressed in camouflage
clothing, driving camouflaged vehicles and identifying themselves
with names like ``Iron Hand,'' began camping out at the perimeter,
Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Absenteeism shot up at the high school, which is across the
street from the Sweeneys' former home, and turnout dropped sharply
at school sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting said a six-month sentence also was warranted because the
standoff was entirely avoidable. The Sweeneys rejected settlement
offers that would have left them in a better financial situation
than they were in before they took out the loan. The FDIC offered
the Sweeneys one of the homes for $1 if they would give the other
one back to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But all attempts at mediation and settlement failed at the
Sweeneys' insistence.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a Superior Court judge found that the bank that
made the loan had defrauded the Sweeneys out of $4 million. That
ruling, however, was overturned on appeal in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Keeton said Sweeney never had the right to decide which judicial
decisions to obey and which to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your belief that some court orders were wrong is no trumping
of them,'' said Keeton. Sweeney's repeated flouting of court
orders, Keeting said, was``one of the very troubling forms of
disrespect for the law.''

 MOSCOW: last year.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They felt that if they put people into a few positions of
power and gave instructions, they would be carried out, because
that's how it happens in the West,'' O'Sullivan said. ``But they
weren't carried out, either because Russian management culturally
won't do so or because they're getting their orders from someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   If Western companies resist outsiders poking about in their
books for fear of change, Russian companies fear the discovery of
rampant misappropriation, Western analysts and oil executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Other Western oil companies, like Amoco and Elf Aquitaine,
contemplated similar investments in Russia, but shied away. ``When
BP did this deal, people thought it was a bold move,'' said the
Western oil executive, ``but one the company would regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after that move, the bankruptcies began. Most
Russian companies carry a risky mixture of debt, often as a ploy to
show low earnings and avoid taxes. But in late 1998, small
creditors were able, under Russian bankruptcy law, to use such
debts to try to force three of Sidanko's main oil producing units,
including Chernogorneft, into bankruptcy. Then in late January, a
mysterious company to which Sidanko owed $20,000 filed to bankrupt
the company.
</P>
<P>
   This is Russia's first big industrial bankruptcy, so much of the
process is uncharted territory. But smaller cases in the past have
shown that bankruptcy is used in Russia more often to strip assets
than to restructure debts and pay creditors, which BP Amoco fears
is now happening.
</P>
<P>
   While bankruptcy courts in the West generally favor creditors,
most rulings involving Sidanko and its units have gone the other
way. Russian courts declared Sidanko bankrupt in May, although most
creditors had asked for time to develop an amicable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chernogorneft case, the main lenders, the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development and the Export-Import Bank, were
initially not registered as creditors, which prevented them from
voting on new managers. In May, the Chernogorneft outside manager
was removed by a Siberian court. Europe's development bank
protested to the Supreme Arbitration Court in Moscow. The Moscow
court backed the bank and had the original manager reinstated _
only to reverse itself four days later, with no further
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the eve of a crucial Chernogorneft creditors'
meeting in July, the Export-Import Bank found that the
Chernogorneft outside manager had fully repaid its debt, violating
bankruptcy principles that call for all debts to be settled
simultaneously. More important, the bank was once more excluded
from a vote on the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and major creditors see the efforts of Tyumen Oil
behind the courts' erratic behavior. The powerful Alfa financial
conglomerate and Access Industries, a New York investment firm,
acquired 51 percent of Tyumen from the Russian government in late
1997. The owners brought order and moderate growth to foundering
production and refining units, installing Western-trained managers
and trying hard to forge an image as a progressive company. Tyumen
Oil has won preliminary approval for $489 million in Export-Import
Bank loan guarantees, a decision now under review by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen concedes that it wants Chernogorneft, whose rich fields
abut its own rapidly depleting ones. But Tyumen bristles at
suggestions of influence peddling, insisting that BP Amoco is
trying to blame someone else for its failures at Sidanko. Seeing
that Chernogorneft was ``falling apart,'' said Tyumen chief
executive Simon Kukes, himself a long-time veteran of Amoco, ``we
considered a hostile takeover attempt. It's not pleasant, but it's
all legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, various details have led analysts, oil executives,
creditors and Chernogorneft insiders to believe that Tyumen is
involved in behind-the-scenes moves. The company already has a
history of playing rough with foreigners: the Canadian company
Black Sea Energy has filed suit in Swedish arbitration court
against a Tyumen subsidiary for reneging on a joint venture
contract.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, experts suggest that Tyumen has influenced the
regional courts in the Sidanko subsidiaries' bankruptcies to vote
against creditor recommendations. The company adamantly denies
this. Still, after court-appointed outside managers arrived, two
Sidanko units moved to sell their oil through a trading firm
thought to be closely linked to Tyumen's main shareholder, Alfa
group. Previously, the units sold their oil through Sidanko.
Russian newspapers have also printed photos of Tyumen executives
socializing with bankruptcy judges.
</P>
<P>
   As all this continues, BP Amoco's supposed ally, Potanin, the
owner of Sidanko, is nowhere to be seen, his political clout
suddenly gone. This leaves BP Amoco to grope its way through the
murkiness of the bankruptcy process alone, part of its bitter
education in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``BP wanted to undertake a learning process to see if it is
indeed possible to work through a Russian company in Russia,'' said
one person close to BP Amoco. The lesson has been painful. ``Just
because you're an international giant,'' he said, ``doesn't mean
you can work in Russia.''

cream shops, nine Republican presidential candidates have been
scouring this state for votes, set off by something that,
technically, has no direct bearing on who will capture the
nomination: a straw poll. The poll at Iowa State University in Ames
on Saturday was designed as a scheme for the Iowa Republican Party
to enrich itself. Not once in its two-decade history has the event
predicted a presidential victor. But like it or not, the straw poll
has transformed into what most presidential campaigns agree is the

role in the extermination by the Nazis of 6 million European Jews
in memoirs published Thursday by the German daily Die Welt. The
statement was part of an attempt by Eichmann to portray himself as
a man driven by a visceral sense of duty rather than hatred, and it

 &HT;    BET to focus on blacks for new Net portal
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Banking on the power of its brand to attract
African-American consumers and eventually advertisers, BET
Holdings, the popular black-owned media company, announced plans to
create a new Web portal for African-Americans called BET.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site, slated to launch in November, hopes to be a
``comprehensive and compelling online destination'' for the
African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   BET.com will be the product of quartet of partners: Microsoft,
USA Networks, and the interactive divisions of Liberty Media and
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. The four companies are kicking in a
combined $35 million, the largest investment to date for sites
focusing on African-Americans, according to The Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   BET.com also plans to offer more than content from its media
holdings and online shopping. The site will have the same features
most major portals have, including e-mail, instant messaging and
personal Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   However, when it comes to online shopping, BET.com will sell
Afrocentric goods directly to users of the portal, not just link
them with retailers at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits are predicting that BET.com's proposed mix of news,
entertainment and shopping will force other Web sites targeting
minority groups to step up their marketing and promotional efforts.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, BET.com, with its loyal TV following and deep
pockets, could knock them off the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   There are already several outstanding sites aimed at
African-Americans, including the Atlanta-based Blackfamilies.com.
(Blackfamilies.com is part of Cox Interactive Media, which is owned
by Cox Enterprises, parent company of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.) There's also NetNoir (www.netnoir.com), a
group of black-oriented Web sites featuring news, entertainment,
shopping and chat, which said Thursday it plans to go public in the
first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rising tide floats all boats,'' says Marissa Gluck, an
analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``What BET is doing makes
sense to me because it's a market that's relatively underserved
online. Still, I do think it's a little bit like the chicken and
the egg. Do you serve the market before there is a market, or do
you build and hope they will come?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite studies showing that African-Americans are the
fastest-growing online group, not everyone is convinced they are
different enough from the rest of the online world to help sites
like BET.com turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing is half affinity marketing and half portal
play,'' says Forrester Research analyst Jim Nail. ``To the extent
it's a portal play, I don't think they have very much to offer
their audience. There really is no differentiation from a Yahoo! or
a Lycos or any other portal. I don't see any reason for an
African-American to choose this over anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nail says a site like BET.com isn't like other niche sites such
as woman-centered entries like iVillage, Oxygen or Women.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African-American population is 12 or 15 percent of the
U.S. population. The question is do they really have significantly
different issues and concerns and needs than their white
counterparts,'' he says. ``Their need for e-mail is no different;
their need for news is no different. Their need for business
information isn't going to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Pembroke, brand manager for Blackfamilies.com, says
there are significant cultural differences that will make sites
like his or BET.com attractive to its target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you can make a product or service relate to a
consumer, the more appealing it is to a consumer,'' he says.
``There are similarities between mainstream audiences, but their
are cultural differences, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Pembroke says the investing habits of
African-Americans are more conservative than white investors. ``In
producing our family and finance channel, we understand those
differences and provide money management advice and tips to help
them invest for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Pembroke says there are also health and medical issues, such as
sickle cell anemia and hypertension, that are more prevalent in the
black community. ``They translate into the needs of our audiences
so we fill that need. The site is designed to be a resource for the
African-American community. If there is something we can't provide,
we'll point you there, so it's the best place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is media fragmentation on steroids,'' says
Jupiter's Gluck. ``There is a need here the mass market entities
aren't filling. BET has the resources to go out and build their
brand and get their name out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at their partners,'' she says, ``Those guys have pretty
deep pockets. From the advertising side, it's really hard to target
demographically when users aren't willing to give up that much
information online.''
</P>
<P>
   But BET.com can count on an African-American audience with
disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   ``If BET.com takes off,'' she says, ``there will be lots of
competition.''

NOTHING PREPRED SEIDMAN FOR CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Seidman thought he was ready. He spent the
offseason lifting weights and running sprints and perusing the
playbook. He hired a personal trainer. He even joined the UCLA
veterans each week for informal workouts.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing he did this summer _ or during his standout career
at Westlake High School _ prepared Seidman for his first college
training camp, which began Monday when UCLA's freshmen reported for
two-a-days. (Full-squad practice begins Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty overwhelming,'' Seidman said. ``I knew there
would be a lot of football, but there's !ital!a lot of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Seidman, a tight end who is expected to challenge for immediate
playing time, begins his day at 7:30 a.m. and returns to his dorm
room, exhausted, 14 hours later. In between, he practices twice and
attends several meetings.
</P>
<P>
   No, summer workouts were nothing like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer seemed really short,'' Seidman said. ``I'm looking
forward to the competition and seeing how I do against the
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was hard to leave home. I didn't really leave because
I'm only 35 minutes away, but the fact is I'm starting a new
chapter in my life. It was hard to leave my friends and my
girlfriend (who attends Thousand Oaks High). But my dream has been
to play college football. Now it's here.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hall's back: Junior defensive end Santi Hall, who was
suspended for spring practice for violating team rules, has been
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Hall likely will begin the season at linebacker, since three
starters (Ryan Nece, Tony White and Ali Abdul Azziz) and the top
reserve (Robert Thomas) are serving two-game suspensions for the
disabled-parking fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update I: Defensive back DaShaun McCullough, who
signed with UCLA in February, has not met NCAA eligibility
requirements. McCullough, an Inglewood native, is expected to take
the SAT again in September. If he passes, he might delay enrollment
until the winter quarter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update II: The Bruins landed their sixth recruit
of the 1999-2000 season last month when Irvine cornerback Keith
Short gave an oral commitment. Short is 5-11, 180 pounds and will
attend Irvine High this year.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's other committed recruits are: Vista (Calif.) linebacker
Tim Warfield, Valencia linebacker Ray Cassaday, Newhall fullback
Pat Norton, Sacramento tailback Albert Hollis and Las Vegas center
John Ream. The Bruins have approximately 18 scholarship available.
</P>
<P>
   __ Policy change: Invitations are required to attend practice at
Spaulding Field this season, with priority given to the players'
families, recruits and high school coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want the Internet people coming in and writing a
bunch of stuff,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the football office.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: The Sept. 4 season opener against Boise State
begins at 6 p.m. The unusual kickoff time serves two purposes: it
avoids the afternoon Pasadena heat and it allows Fox Sports West 2
to televise the UCLA and USC games. The Trojans play at Hawaii at
9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff for the UCLA-Fresno State game Sept. 18 is 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman defensive lineman Rodney Leisle broke his ankle in a
summer all-star game and probably won't practice for at least a
month.

LONG BEFORE MADONNA, THERE WAS SARAH SIDDONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were no stretch limos when Sarah Siddons was
the talk of London, no lunching at Spago or agents driving around
with cell phones attached to their ears.
</P>
<P>
   But if there had been, it's a good bet the statuesque British
actress would've availed herself of those essential modern
marketing tools. After all, in her own time, Siddons (1755-1831)
was nearly as famous for managing her image as she was for
mastering her craft.
</P>
<P>
   By far England's most celebrated female thespian of the late
18th century, Siddons had been a flop at comedy before turning to
drama and earning her regal moniker, ``the Muse of Tragedy.'' At
the peak of a career that stretched from 1772 to 1812, her
painstaking portrayals of long-suffering heroines in plays such as
``The Mourning Bride'' made men weep, while women had to be carried
from theaters in hysterics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's Siddons' backstage machinations that make her a
prototype of modern celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Like some Age of Enlightenment Madonna or Princess Di, Siddons
courted rich and powerful patrons, conspired with England's
brand-name painters to turn her into a popular icon and handed out
engravings of herself to fans and tastemakers as if they were
8-by-10 glossies.
</P>
<P>
   When the actress toured Scotland in June 1784, commentators
began using the phrase ``Siddonimania'' to describe her phenomenal
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Siddons' portraitists boosted their own reputations and
finances. Some, such as Sir Joshua Reynolds, were marquee names in
their own right. Siddons' fame spelled the beginning of today's
log-rolling mass-media culture, in which every celebrity
endorsement or talk-show appearance feeds the mill of mutual
self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Siddons is getting the star treatment once again in
a joint venture involving three L.A. cultural heavyweights: the J.
Paul Getty Museum; the Huntington Library, Art Collections and
Botanical Gardens; and Center Theatre Group, the production arm of
the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the project's components are art exhibitions at the Getty
and the Huntington. The third is a new play by Frank Dwyer, ``The
Affliction of Glory: A Comedy About Tragedy,'' commissioned by the
Getty and CTG, that will open next week at the Getty for a run of
only 17 performances.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty show, ``A Passion for Performance: Sarah Siddons and
Her Portraitists,'' brings together for the first time in two
centuries two works depicting Siddons posed allegorically as the
tragic muse.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier (1784) and greater of the pair was done by Joshua
Reynolds and is part of the Huntington's permanent collection, on
temporary loan to the Getty. A very similar 1789 painting, with
Siddons in an identical pose and accouterments, is being borrowed
from the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. Technically less
virtuous than the earlier work, it was probably executed by one of
Reynolds' assistants in the large studio-workshop the artist used
to crank out orders for his wealthy clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty exhibition includes eight paintings showing how other
famous artists tackled Siddons' mythic persona. Thomas Gainsborough
depicted her as an aristocratic clotheshorse, George Romney as a
thoughtful deity and Thomas Lawrence as a high-society grande dame.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the collaboration, Getty conservation scientists gave
technical assistance and helped remove a yellowing coat of varnish
from the Dulwich work.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles away, the Huntington is presenting ``Cultivating
Celebrity: Portraiture as Publicity in the Career of Sarah
Siddons,'' a survey of prints, drawings and watercolors
representing Siddons in dramatic roles, such as Lady Macbeth, as
well as in more intimate offstage moments.
</P>
<P>
   This contrast between public and private lives underscores some
of the exhibitions' secondary themes.
</P>
<P>
   Siddons' success partially signifies the growing
``feminization'' of popular culture, says Robyn Asleson, a
Huntington research associate who organized both exhibitions and
assembled the accompanying catalog.
</P>
<P>
   During the bloody upheavals in Colonial America and France,
followed by the even more warlike Napoleonic era, ancient Roman
values of sacrifice and manly heroism were celebrated in European
painting.
</P>
<P>
   Women, on the other hand, were usually depicted in passive,
contemplative poses associated with intelligence, religious purity
or moral conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to do with women being more a kind of cipher''
in that era, Asleson observes.
</P>
<P>
   But with Siddons, a new set of ``feminine'' values _
introspection, deep feeling, romantic passion _ began to seep into
popular culture. Siddons opened the way for the ``full-blown
romanticism'' that followed her, Asleson says.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Dwyer, the Taper's literary manager, says the
actress's elevation to a stature previously reserved for kings and
queens blurred the line between elite culture and middle-class
culture.
</P>
<P>
   She also popularized a new performance style based on emotional
projection rather than stylized mannerism.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Siddons' name may be best-known from ``All About Eve,''
Joseph L. Mankiewicz's catty 1950 comedy-drama in which a scheming
ingenue played by Anne Baxter is awarded the Sarah Siddons Award
after double-crossing her former mentor, played by Bette Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Siddons might blush to see the outrageous trickle-down effects
of her ambitious quest for fame. But, as Dwyer says, ``Sarah had 30
years of extraordinary fame and then immortality because of a
talent. That's different from having 15 minutes of fame.'' &QL;

BUSH UNDER FIRE AS EXECUTION DATE NEARS FOR MENTALLY ILL TEXAS MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The upcoming execution of a mentally ill Fort
Worth man gives Gov. George W. Bush a chance to demonstrate his
commitment to ``compassionate conservatism'' and to patch some
chinks in his presidential armor, according to political and mental
health experts.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP front-runner could get that opportunity as early as
Friday, depending on action by the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for lethal injection Tuesday is Larry Keith Robison _
a 42-year-old paranoid schizophrenic convicted of a 1982 sexual
mutilation and slaying in which trial testimony suggested the
possibility of cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Parole board members hope to have a recommendation for or
against clemency to the governor in the Robison case by Friday
afternoon. However, that could be delayed to allow the 18-member
board time to review supplemental documents the inmate's family and
supporters provided the board Wednesday, according to board
chairman Gerald Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Granting Robison clemency ``might help (Bush), especially
because of the impact of the Talk magazine interview concerning
Karla Faye Tucker,'' said Larry Sabato, a political science
professor at the University of Virginia who follows presidential
campaigns. ``This would be a way for Bush to demonstrate compassion
and put the interview behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has drawn fire this week over that interview because it
portrays him as mocking Tucker's execution, although Bush aides say
he was not making light of the Houston pickax murderer. Tucker, who
said she was a born-again Christian, was put to death last year
amid an international outcry to spare her life. She was the first
woman executed in Texas in more that 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, Bush cannot commute Robison's death sentence to
life imprisonment unless the parole board recommends such action;
however, all of its members were appointed by him.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent action a governor can take in halting an
execution is to grant a single 30-day delay. Bush, however, has not
taken that action in any of the 99 executions that have taken place
since he was sworn into office in January 1995. Only once has the
board recommended clemency, and Bush granted it.
</P>
<P>
   For the governor to allow the execution to proceed ``would be an
indictment against every'' American whose family is touched by
mental health issues, said Melodee Smith of Florida, Robison's
clemency attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can fathom the notion that Gov. Bush _ a very
compassionate individual _ would want to execute a mentally ill
man. The entire mental health community is calling on him to
consider this very seriously and then to be compassionate about
it.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Sabato said Bush and other Republican governors have far more
freedom to commute a death sentence than their Democratic
counterparts do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic governors have very little flexibility on the death
penalty,'' Sabato added. ``They are assumed to be soft on the death
penalty, and therefore any push toward clemency by them can hurt
them politically. ... But a Republican governor is assumed to be
strongly in favor of the death penalty. They can politically get
away with the occasional grant of clemency because it does moderate
their image a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor will make his
decision after the parole board makes a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   She said the controversial nature of Robison's case is not an
issue. ``The death penalty itself is controversial, but Gov. Bush
is sworn to uphold the laws of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In their quest to spare Robison, the inmate's family and
supporters also are indicting Texas' mental health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Larry was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, we tried
to get help for him from every mental hospital in Texas and every
agency that we could find out about,'' said Lois Robison, the
inmate's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The former schoolteacher has been speaking out about the metal
health system ever since her son was sent to death row. ``We were
told repeatedly that unless he became violent, Larry could not be
committed for the long-term treatment that he needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Robert Hager, vice president for Capacity for Justice, a
Houston-based organization that promotes humane treatment of
mentally ill defendants:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state of Texas had provided effective medication and
intensive care management to those Texans who suffer from severe
brain disorders and are incarcerated for acts of violence, many of
those acts would never have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the parole board, Sheila C. Mullins, president of
the Mental Health Association in Texas, emphasized the lack of
treatment for Robison. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``As a result of his untreated illness, Mr. Robison eventually
degenerated into a state of violence,'' she said. ``The
responsibility for the loss of five precious lives must be shared
between Mr. Robison and the system that failed him long before he
turned violent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Nuncio
for the United States, urged clemency for Robison on behalf of Pope
John Paul II, writing Bush: ``A life sentence without the
possibility of parole provides substantial safeguards for society
and represents an adequately grave punishment for the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gruesome details in Robison's case make it difficult for
some to offer any sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth &UR;  &LR; on Aug. 10, 1982, Robison _ then a 24-year-old
unemployed veteran who was severely delusional _ decapitated his
homosexual roommate, sexually mutilated him and then killed four
people next door, including a woman and her 11-year-old son,
according to trial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Police cited indications that Robison might have cannibalized
his roommate, Ricky Lee Bryant, after killing him and
fingerpainting on the walls in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Although charged with murdering Bryant, Robison was convicted of
murdering Bruce M. Gardner, 33, who had stopped by to see his
girlfriend, Georgia Ann Reed, 34. Robison also was charged with
murdering Reed; her son, Scott, and her mother, Earline H. Barker,
55.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed to all the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Robison was diagnosed in the 1970s with paranoid schizophrenia,
but trial testimony indicated that a long history of drug abuse _
including LSD and PCP _ may have contributed to his delusional
state. He also had a history on run-ins with the law, primarily
theft and drug arrests.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, Brian Gardner of Fort Worth, the
brother of one of the victims, said he doesn't buy Robison's mental
illness claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a scheme cooked up by his lawyers and family,''
Gardner told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``If you ask me, he was
just a dope freak.''
</P>
<P>
   Parole chairman Garrett says the gist of the arguments filed on
Robison's behalf deal with his mental illness. Robison, however, is
not the first prisoner to have raised such issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general terms when the mental health issue is raised, then
we tend to get communication from people who have strong feelings
about the delivery of services that the state is providing,''
Garrett said. ``... We are hearing from people not only that are in
opposition to the death penalty but we also are hearing from people
that have strong feelings about the mental health system in the
state and the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the board has received more letters of support for
Robison than in many death penalty cases, but fewer than the number
supporting clemency for Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the board does not consider the political
implications for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are forces beyond us,'' he added. ``We're staying
focused on answering the issues before us. I truly don't know as to
politically what the impact might be. I don't look at the case and
try to determine what the political outcome might be.''
</P>
<P>
   For Robison's mother, Tuesday dawns as the end of an 18-year
odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little bit of hope,'' she said this week,
acknowledging the strong possibility her son will be put to death.
But she hopes her efforts to raise awareness for the mentally ill
will make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we can't help Larry, we don't want any other victim's
family to wake up some morning and find their loved one brutally
murdered,'' she said. ``Texas ranks 49th nationally in mental
health care, but No. 1 in the execution of the mentally ill.
There's something wrong with that.''

HED:  &UR; `Picture' out of focus &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
By Reed Johnson &LR; , Theater Critic &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ready for their close-ups, Mr. DeMille?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, even the director of ``The Greatest Show on Earth'' might
have trouble breathing a little old-fashioned razzle-dazzle into
``The First Picture Show,'' the blurry and emotionally flat
silent-movie homage that opened Wednesday at the Mark Taper Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would a campy, charismatic monster like Norma Desmond
necessarily be enough to supply this ethereal chamber musical with
a good, solid core of dramatic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we get Anne First, a crusty-saintly 99-year-old former
silent-movie director, waiting around to die in a retirement home,
and her great-great-niece, Jane Furstmann, a TV director determined
to tell the old woman's story.
</P>
<P>
   Although Estelle Parsons, the great actress who plays the elder
Anne, has no peer in making crankiness seem next to godliness, her
scrappy personality here feels largely subdued. Like most
everything else in ``The First Picture Show,'' Anne's character is
as monochromatic and fuzzy at the edges as an old daguerreotype.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, ``The First Picture Show'' isn't trying to be ``Sunset
Boulevard'' revisited. David and Ain Gordon, the father-son
writing/directing team whose work ``The Family Business'' was
produced at the Taper in 1995, obviously had something very
different in mind than an Andrew Lloyd Webber-style extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Known for their heavily stylized, unconventional fusions of
text, movement and music, the Gordons initially thought of
developing a show about early Hollywood censorship. Somewhere along
the way, that theme got combined with Anne's story, which is
partially the story of how early Hollywood briefly opened its doors
to women writers and directors like Lois Weber and Alice Guy Blache
_ only to slam them shut once the rough-and-tumble business of
moviemaking turned into a tightly regulated corporate undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Both Weber and Guy Blache appear here as characters, as does
Universal Studios honcho Carl Laemmle, portrayed by Ken Marks as a
smarmy pragmatist. Indeed, while ``The First Picture Show'' parades
some 40 different fictional and non-fictional characters across the
stage, most of them stay virtually as ill-defined and
one-dimensional as the cardboard cutouts that form part of Robert
Brill's design.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gordons smartly recruited talented young composer
Jeanine Tesori (``Violet'') to work with them, the music is a
patchwork of tone poems and melodic suggestions, well performed by
two pianists. Though Tesori's wit and ability to filter old musical
styles (vaudeville, Victorian parlor tunes) through a contemporary
sensibility is in evidence, the snatches of music never resolve
themselves into anything resembling an organic, coherent score.
</P>
<P>
   Despite or possibly because of the nonstop movement on stage,
with characters dashing on and off after delivering a couple lines,
and the decades flying by in a blur, the show's narrative wobbles.
Unaccountably, the Taper house lights go up and down several times,
adding to the sense that the Gordons are too intent on stripping
away the magic of movies rather than creating a theatrical
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking about the Dream Factory here, right? Glamour,
excitement, hedonism, scandal? The Gordons are more interested in
studio mergers and acquisitions, Japanese-American internment
camps, white producers' exploitation of black ``race movies,'' and
other issues, which would be fine if they were better integrated
with the underdeveloped relationship between Anne and Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Many serious theater people, from Clifford Odets on down, have
arrived in Hollywood hoping to tame the movies and ended up as
their victim. Sadly, ``The First Picture Show'' can now be added to
the list of casualties.

 &HT;    For Every Tax Provision, A Century of History
 &HT;    For Release Sunday, Aug. 14
 &HT;    By Julia Malone
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican plan to cut taxes by $792 billion
would redraw key provisions of a revenue code that has been
stirred, shaken and expanded for most of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a capsulated history behind the major elements in the
legislation Congress has passed over President Clinton's veto
threat:
</P>
<P>
   - Income tax rates. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution
enacted the first permanent federal income tax in 1913. Western and
Southern states fueled the movement for the new tax, which they
believed would soak the rich, who were concentrated in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The levy began modestly, with a maximum rate of 7 percent
charged to a tiny number of the nation's richest residents, those
with incomes over $500,000. By 1918 the top rate had shot up to 77
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, fewer than 14 percent of American workers paid income
taxes until the middle of World War II, when the U.S. Treasury
drafted none other than Donald Duck to sell Americans on the idea
of an income tax for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   In a film commissioned by the U.S. Treasury Department, Donald
filled out his revenue forms as he was instructed that it was
``your privilege, not just your duty, but your privilege to help
your government by paying your tax.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 32 million theater-goers watched that film in early
1942, and the Gallup poll reported that 37 percent said it
encouraged them to pay the tax. Just four years later,
three-fourths of all workers _ whether they felt privileged to do
so or not _ were paying income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Although advertised as part of the war effort, the new broad
income tax survived peacetime and became the chief source of Uncle
Sam's money.
</P>
<P>
   Rates soared to as high as 91 percent for the wealthiest
taxpayers and then dropped to 70 percent in the 1960s and to 28
percent under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s. The rate
edged back up to 31 percent under President George Bush and to 39.6
percent under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress has now voted to lower all brackets
by 1 percent, so that the lowest rate would change from 15 percent
to 14 percent and the top rate would be reduced to 38.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Marriage ``penalties.'' For decades, the tax code has shifted
back and forth on taxes for married couple. All payers calculated
their taxes the same way, whether filing a joint return or singly,
until 1948. In that year, Congress set a separate rate for
joint-filers, which provided a bonus for many couples but penalized
single taxpayers. In 1951 and in 1969, Congress swung back the
other way, repealing some of the marriage benefits and imposing
changes that penalized some couples.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a complicated code that produces mixed results for
couples and singles.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Treasury study says that among the 51 million couples who
are expected to file joint tax returns this year, 48 percent will
have to pay more than if they were single, 41 percent will receive
a bonus, and the remaining 11 percent will be neither helped nor
penalized.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tax cut plan would increase the deduction for
married filers gradually, to double the deduction for single
taxpayers, and increase the amount a couple could earn and still
remain in the lowest tax bracket. However, if history is repeated,
Congress may later be asked to come to the rescue of single people.
</P>
<P>
   - Estate taxes. Dubbed the ``death tax'' by its opponents, the
tax on estates came and went beginning as early as 1797 to help pay
for arming the country in wartime. But a levy on estates enacted in
1916 remains in effect today.
</P>
<P>
   At first charging only 10 percent for estates valued over
$50,000, the law now applies to estates valued over $625,000 at a
rate as high as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The levy has long drawn fire from business groups and farmers,
who charge that it causes the break up of family companies. The tax
is ``confiscatory,'' says the Cato Institute, a Libertarian
research group, which notes that it collects only $18 billion a
year, a relatively small portion of government revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The government officially describes this revenue as a ``transfer
tax.'' The impetus behind the tax is a matter of some speculation.
``Some say it was to break up the accumulation of great wealth,
dynasties that could destroy the democratic instinct of the nation
_ like the Rockefellers or the Morgans or the Carnegies,'' writes
political gadfly critic Martin Gross in his book ``The Tax
Racket.'' Gross pans the tax as ``fiscal undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would eliminate most estate taxes, along with gift
taxes and generation-skipping taxes, through 2009 and then resume
estate taxes, but at a much lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   - Capital gains. Starting in 1921, the tax code has had
preferential tax rates for profits and losses from sales of stocks
and other property, in part to stimulate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   During a move toward a flatter, simpler tax system in 1986,
capital gains rates increased from 20 percent to 28 percent.
However, a decade later the rate was lowered to 20 percent and 10
percent, depending on the taxpayer's income bracket.
</P>
<P>
   For decades a debate has raged over whether lowering capital
gains taxes will boost the economy, as Republicans argue, or drain
the treasury to benefit the rich, as many Democrats counter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican's tax legislation would lower capital gains rates
to 18 percent for wealthier taxpayers and 8 percent for others.

DESERT KNIFING VICTIM DEHYDRATED, AUTOPSY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBARD, N.M. _ Autopsy results on the body of David Coughlin
released Thursday bolstered Raffi Kodikian's claims that he killed
his best friend in a remote desert canyon near here because
Coughlin was severely dehydrated and believed he was going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin was suffering from ``moderate to severe dehydration''
at the time of his death, said Tim Stepetic, of the Albuquerque
Medical Examiner's office. The severity of dehydration could not be
pinpointed, Stepetic added, but he said both men were likely
delusional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very well could have believed that in the heat and
everything else that he was close to death and the person who
committed the act could also have believed that,'' Stepetic said.
``Carlsbad is like a furnace in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat and dehydration could have induced ``severe lapses in
judgement on both parts,'' Stepetic said.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Coughlin's autopsy came as the county sheriff
read chilling excerpts from his accused killer's diary, whose
hand-scrawled chronicle climaxes, he said, with the words: ``I
killed and buried my best friend today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, accompanied by his father, won court permission to
leave Eddy County to confer with his newly retained lawyer, who
said his client is distraught, remorseful and the victim of an
excursion into unfriendly territory that ended in a grisly burial
in an unforgiving desert canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering a plea of not guilty,'' said attorney Gary
Marshall of Ruidoso. ``Both men thought they were going to die.
They had made out a last will. They were out of water and violently
ill. It was like being lost at sea for five days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eddy County Sheriff M.A. ``Chunky'' Click continued to cast
doubt on Kodikian's story that the Boston man stabbed long-time
friend David Coughlin, 26, of Millis, Mass., twice in the chest to
put his dehydrated friend out of his misery last weekend at
Carlsbad Caverns National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Click said one of his investigators, who attended Coughlin's
autopsy, reported that Coughlin's bladder was full. ``His blood
levels were not deficient to the point that he was anywhere close
to death,'' said Click. ``If you're completely dehydrated, you have
no fluids hardly left in your body. There's no question that David
Coughlin would not have died if he hadn't killed him. No
question.''
</P>
<P>
   But an official in the state's medical investigator's office
said the contents of Coughlin's bladder are moot, since other tests
proved he was in fact moderately to severely dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   Gary W. McCandless, the county sheriff department's chief of
detectives, said the medical investigators conclusions did not
surprise him and do not, he insisted, indicate that Coughlin was
anywhere near death when he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out in the desert and you're going to get a little
dehydrated,'' McCandless said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have found and developed photographs from the two
Massachusetts men, some of which show their camp in the canyon.
``But nothing earth-shattering,'' McCandless said.
</P>
<P>
   Click said a search warrant has been issued to seek handwriting
samples from Kodikian as well as the blood-splattered clothes he
wore when authorities found him and Coughlin's shallow grave on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they are painstakingly assembling a case
against Kodikian _ one almost certain to stop short of capital
murder, which could bring a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be a death-penalty case because we have
special requirements for that in New Mexico,'' said Chief Deputy
District Attorney Les Williams, noting that in capital cases a
murder must be accompanied by other aggravating factors such as the
murder of a police officer, a rape, or a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Mr. Kodikian is a ruthless, hideous, serial
killer,'' Click said. ``This is a very bizarre case. It doesn't
make a lot of sense. But I don't think he would be a candidate for
the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall dismissed any suggestion other than that Coughlin's
death was exactly what Kodikian has claimed: A merciful act by a
friend to put his struggling companion out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still the West and it's still a dangerous place to
live, especially if you're without water,'' Marshall said. ``Mother
Nature can be pretty mean and brutal. I know what it's like to be
in the middle of nowhere and the panic that can set in.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said authorities have not established _ and will not be
able to establish _ any nefarious motive for last weekend's killing
in Rattlesnake Canyon. ``These were good boys _ the kind of young
men you'd want your sons to grow up to be. We're not dealing with
boys who were into drugs or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall, one of the state's best known criminal defense
lawyers, agreed with Click that Kodikian's cross-country journal
will be a central piece of evidence if the case goes to trial. The
lawyer said Thursday he has requested copies of the writings in the
spiral notebook.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday in his office, Click read excerpts from
the journal kept by Kodikian, a former Boston Globe editorial
assistant who penned a previous account of a 1997 cross-country
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's real hard to read,'' said Click, who said the
journal begins on July 30, when it appears Kodikian picked Coughlin
up from work before their journey began. ``When they left Boston
the journal is more chit-chat stuff. They drank a beer here. They
did this. They did that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just talking about their friends and their
girlfriends,'' said Click, who quoted this Aug. 1 entry: ``Up at 7.
Out the door by 8. And on our way to Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   The county sheriff said the journal notes that the friends
arrived in Nashville around 6 o'clock. ``It says they drank a beer
some place. They were in a lounge,'' Click said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, the journal said Kodikian and Coughlin woke up early,
showered and made their way to Memphis and Graceland, the mansion
where rock 'n roll legend Elvis Presley lived and, in 1977, died.
</P>
<P>
   The following pages of the journal contains a rough, hand-drawn
map of the routes leading to southeastern New Mexico, where the
friends would camp and, according to Kodikian's account, become
hopelessly lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filled out a back country card on Wednesday evening and
headed down,'' the journal states. ``Camped Wednesday and started
back on Thursday morning but couldn't find the entrance leading to
the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said the men were just 240 feet from the trail
and about a mile and a half from their red 1994 Mazda Protege.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the day officials believe Coughlin was killed, the
journal takes its darkest turn. On top of the page that begins
Kodikian's account of Coughlin's death, there are large block
letters reading: ``HELP HELP.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Went back to camp in hopes that St. Nicholas would have
f---ing showed up,'' the journal states, according to Click, who
said he presumes Kodikian was the author of most of the diary's
passages, although the notebook appears, he said, to contain two
different handwriting styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying that sometimes Saturday they had no water left,''
Click said. ``So they didn't run out of water until Saturday. Then
he writes about how much he loves his mom and dad. There is more
talking about mom and dad and grandma and family friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The county sheriff said the journal contains sentimental
farewells to friends named Kevin and Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday's first entry reads: `I killed and buried my best
friend  &UR; today &LR; .' ''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said Kodikian is frustrated by a court order that
prohibits him from speaking to Coughlin's friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible situation for both families,'' the defense
lawyer said. ``I think this is a situation where everyone needs to
keep an open mind.''

   WASHINGTON _ Unimaginable as it might have seemed a year ago,
President Clinton's top private lawyer and the former senior aide
to Kenneth Starr in the impeachment battle recently joined to argue
on the same side of one of the biggest legal fights in years.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, David Kendall and Brett Kavanaugh, are but one
example of the unusual alliances being forged in the dispute over
which companies will end up dominating high-speed Internet service
delivered through cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, representing America Online, and Kavanaugh, whose firm
represents GTE, are among a legion of advisers who are quickly
finding business in the dispute, which has turned into the latest
full employment act for lawyers and lobbyists here and in many
cities around the nation. (When Kendall and Kavanaugh found
themselves in a room together, meeting with the Federal
Communications Commission's general counsel on the issue, ``their
eyes were like saucers,'' recalled William Barr, the general
counsel at GTE and former U.S. attorney general, who also was at
the meeting.)
</P>
<P>
   Their common adversary in the fight is AT&AMP;T, which is rapidly
acquiring cable systems and offers high-speed Internet access over
those lines exclusively through a company, Excite(at)Home, in which
it owns a major stake. Led by America Online and GTE, a coalition
of Internet service providers and other telephone companies have
mounted a nationwide campaign to force AT&AMP;T to let cable customers
use Internet providers other than Excite(at)Home without additional
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T opponents have several business interests with billions
of dollars in future revenues at stake. GTE is developing a rival
high-speed Internet service, and many smaller providers believe
that if AT&AMP;T's system proves popular, they will be doomed if they
are shut out. Some of the other telephone companies in the fray are
either competitors of AT&AMP;T or are using the issue to press for
greater deregulation and the ability to compete with the company's
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T contends it would have little incentive to upgrade its
cable systems to provide high-speed Internet service if it must
serve as a carrier for all providers, and that in any case,
comparable telephone- and satellite-based services will insure
competition.
</P>
<P>
   While a precise figure on spending on the lawyers and lobbyists
and for campaign contributions is not available, executives and
lawyers involved in the case estimate that it is already in the
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a field where exaggeration is common, it is fair to say
that this issue is regarded as the most important public policy
question in telecommunications for the decade,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of Media Access Project, which promotes
consumer rights and diversity on the airwaves and has taken sides
against AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term,'' Schwartzman said, ``there's billions of
dollars in revenue at stake. Over the longer term, the outcome of
this fight will play a large role in determining who will be the
dominant telecommunications and Internet players for the next
decade. As a consequence, the bedfellows are stranger than
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, for example, have joined the anti-AT&AMP;T side but
acknowledge they are in an awkward position, allied with telephone
companies that they have sharply criticized in the past. The
consumer advocates have also criticized William Kennard, the
chairman of the FCC, after lobbying fiercely to get him appointed
two years ago. Kennard has in essence sided with AT&AMP;T by
formulating a policy that only the federal government, and not
local authorities, has jurisdiction, but ruling out intervention
for now.
</P>
<P>
   There have been high-stakes struggles over telecommunications
policy in the past, but perhaps never one fought on so many fronts,
including a number of localities where approval is needed _ and
conditions on the Internet issue can be attached _ if AT&AMP;T is to
assume the franchises of the cable companies it is acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute is also notable because it involves a
convergence of technology that has far outpaced laws, court
opinions and regulatory decisions, all of which treat cable and
telephones differently and for better or worse, have said little
explicitly about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one front where AT&AMP;T's opponents have scored their biggest
gains, the issue is heading to a federal appeals court. It will
hear oral arguments in October over a decision by local authorities
in Portland, Ore., to require AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines there to
any Internet company on the same terms as Excite(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also is moving to a new group of cities that are
considering whether to permit AT&AMP;T to acquire the cable franchises
controlled by Media One. Among other places, new skirmishing is
expected in the suburbs of Boston and in other parts of
Massachusetts, where a drive to get the issue on a statewide ballot
in 2000 began this week, as well as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Richmond
and major parts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and cities around the nation, both sides have
retained battalions of advocates. This week, for instance, the
anti-AT&AMP;T forces announced that in addition to Kendall, they had
retained Lloyd Cutler, the former White House counsel, and Bruce
Ennis, a leading Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T and the cable industry have retained many of
Washington's lobbyists, including Vin Weber, the former Republican
representative from Minnesota, and the lobbying firm founded by the
late Dan Dutko, a major Democratic fund-raiser who died in an
accident two weeks ago. More than 50 lobbyists for AT&AMP;T and the
cable companies showed up at an organizational meeting last
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have told me that they owe me thank-you
notes,'' said Gregory Simon, a former top aide to Gore, who is
collaborating with Richard Bond, a former chairman of the
Republican National Committee, in directing the anti-AT&AMP;T
coalition. ``They were retained just so I couldn't hire them. In
Washington it took weeks to find somebody who was not lobbying for
AT&AMP;T I could not find three firms that had not been retained on
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the regional Bell telephone companies have managed
to retain some well-known Washington figures for the fight,
including Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican
National Committee; Mike McCurry, the former White House press
secretary, and Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman
from Staten Island, N.Y. They maintain that Congress and federal
regulators should eliminate restrictions on their clients to make
it easier to offer high-speed Internet services to compete against
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The experience in Florida alone is illustrative of the magnitude
and fervor of the struggle. According to local records, AT&AMP;T and
the cable companies have retained more than 40 lobbyists in the
state. GTE responded by persuading officials in Broward County to
adopt an ordinance requiring AT&AMP;T to open its cable system to other
Internet service providers _ and by agreeing to pay the county's
legal costs if AT&AMP;T sued over the issue. AT&AMP;T lawyers say they are
preparing to challenge GTE's legal assistance to the county.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been Potemkin-like attempts at local organizing,
a process known by some consumer advocates as Astroturf campaigns,
in contrast to grass roots. Contrived rallies were staged in front
of San Francisco's City Hall, for instance, and both sides have
made extensive use of telephone banks to gin up support by asking
loaded questions and making alarmist predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and lobbyists from all sides are pouring campaign
contributions into the coffers of the major presidential
contenders, though none of the candidates have stated a clear
preference. (The issues have transcended party politics, although
some of the major players have been identified with particular
candidates. For instance, James Cicconi, general counsel of AT&AMP;T
and a former aide to President George Bush, was recently a
co-chairman of a fund-raiser in Washington for George W. Bush.
George Vradenberg, the general counsel of America Online, is a top
adviser and fund-raiser for John McCain. And Simon has been raising
money for his former boss, Vice President Gore.)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides say that the candidates are not likely to
take a position that could jeopardize more donations.
</P>
<P>
   While competing legislation over the issue has been introduced
in recent weeks in Congress, both sides acknowledge that there is
nothing that the lawmakers will likely do any time soon. As a
result, the anti-AT&AMP;T forces have embarked on a strategy of trying
to find support in states and municipalities, hoping the issue may
then begin to resonate with more force in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensity of the fight, there is widespread
assumption that it will be settled either at the corporate
bargaining table or by a Supreme Court decision, which could be
years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a business motivation here and everybody likes
cloaking their arguments in terms like open access, but what's
really going on here is AOL has a business plan and wants the
government to put its thumb on the scale to tip the balance in its
favor,'' said Cicconi, general counsel and head of government
relations at AT&AMP;T. He said the opposition has been ``going in at
the local level and hiring as many people as possible who have
connections with city commissioners and local officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and AT&AMP;T's corporate rivals say the battle
is as much over principle as it is over business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe of the magnitude and money involved,'' said Donna
N. Lampert, who had to leave her law firm, which represents major
cable companies, to continue her work for America Online. ``But at
its core this is really about an important principle. This involves
a lot more than whose garage the Mercedes will be parked in, as the
saying goes about big money cases. It involves who will control the
Internet.''

 &HT;    Bush's cash flow doesn't stop in Georgia
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas swoops into Atlanta on
Aug. 27 for a pair of fund-raisers that will give many of his
Georgia backers their first look at the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hoopla, the only sound Bush's rivals are likely to hear
is the din of a fund-raising vacuum cleaner sucking up $1,000
contributions faster than any candidate in presidential history.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, as in the rest of the country, Bush has shattered
fund-raising records for a presidential candidate this early in the
race. In the first six months of the year, Bush raised $606,223 in
Georgia, almost twice what the other eight GOP candidates have
raised combined.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Bush has boosted his Georgia total to
$750,000 _ the goal his Georgia fund-raisers had set for the entire
year. Now, Bush may well end up with $1 million before the year is
out.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, Bush has raised the money without setting foot
inside the state. Bush's upcoming trip to Georgia will be his first
since he formed his presidential exploratory committee earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is just pouring in,'' said Eric Tanenblatt, Bush's
state chairman. ``There has never been a presidential campaign that
has raised this much money in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Bush raised almost $37 million for the first half of
the year, although he did not officially start until February. The
amount broke all previous fund-raising records at this point in the
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind to Vice President Al Gore in the first
quarter of the year, Bush outraised Gore almost 5-to-1 in the
second quarter in Georgia, pushing him well head of the Tennessee
Democrat for the year. In the first six months of the year, Gore
raised $346,445 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush is drawing on some powerful fund-raising allies
to help him out, principally his father, former President Bush.
Nearly all of the $513,659 that Bush raised in Georgia in the
second quarter of the year came from a single fund-raising dinner
featuring the former president May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has an extensive set of connections that he's
tapped into from his father,'' said attorney Keith Mason, Gore's
state contact.
</P>
<P>
   Mason said he was unconcerned about Bush's early lead in the
money race, noting that the Gore campaign had only just begun to
draw on the fund-raising contacts of the Democratic officeholders
that have endorsed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to see support grow for the vice president,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the only challenger to Gore
on the Democratic side, raised $46,150 in Georgia, further evidence
that the East Coast Democrat has yet to develop much of a financial
base in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Republican rivals, meanwhile, continue to struggle for
cash. Elizabeth Dole was third overall in contributions for the
first half of the year, raising $75,100. Dole was closely followed
by Family Research Council President Gary Bauer, publisher Steve
Forbes, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former Education Secretary
Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Blue, Bauer's national finance chairman, who lives in
Atlanta, said a July 16 fund-raiser has pushed Bauer to close to
$100,000 in Georgia, joking that the amount was ``probably less
than what George Bush has raised on West Paces Ferry,'' the monied
street that winds through Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost overwhelming how much money he has raised,'' Blue
said of Bush. ``He is just sucking up money.''
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, Bush is getting financial help from Georgians
publicly supporting other candidates. At least two members of
Dole's Georgia leadership team, for example, wrote $1,000 checks to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Carter Stevens, a former executive director of the state
Republican Party, gave Bush $1,000 on June 17. The next day, Dole
named Stevens co-chair of her Georgia leadership team, along with
attorney Oscar Persons, who also contributed to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a lot of people who are giving to both
campaigns,'' Persons said. ``The consensus is that the two
strongest candidates out there would be Bush and Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rush to contribute to Bush is forcing candidates such
as Dole to look outside the circle of usual political donors.
</P>
<P>
   Mary O'Connor, Dole's finance chairwoman, has a background in
charitable giving and nonprofit fund-raising. She's looking to
people in those fields to support Dole, the former president of the
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reaching out beyond the traditional political
fund-raising community,'' O'Connor said. Dole will appear at two
fund-raising events in Georgia on Sept. 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Bush has adopted the same type of fund-raising
strategy that has worked for him nationally. Aiding his national
finance committee in Texas, Bush has a circle of more than 100
``Pioneers'' who have each committed to help raise $100,000. In
Georgia, Bush's finance committee is made up of people who pledge
to raise at least $10,000 for the candidate. The committee now has
close to 100 members, with new ones joining every week, Tanenblatt
said. ``People are really attracted to the campaign,'' Tanenblatt
said. ``If we can get to a million (dollars) that would be great.
That would be historic.''

   HOUSTON _ Four former engineers of a New Jersey ship maintenance
company and two others have been charged with bid-rigging as part
of a nationwide, four-year investigation of the maritime repair
industry, the U.S. Attorney's Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the contracting firm that maintained mothballed
government ships accepted bribes from subcontractors, including
country club dues, cars and big-screen televisions, according to
indictments unsealed Thursday and statements by federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The port engineers, formerly employed with Bay Ship Management
Inc. based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., are each charged with
accepting kickbacks from subcontractors who were vying to get a
piece of federal contracts to maintain the vessels, including ships
docked at the Port of Houston and Beaumont, Texas, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say taxpayers were bilked in the scheme because the
subcontractors allegedly billed the federal government for the cost
of the kickbacks in falsified invoices.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments are the result of an undercover investigation
dubbed Operation Knotdock, conducted jointly by the FBI, the
Department of Defense's Criminal Investigative Service and the
Naval Criminal Investigative Service.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI set up an undercover company in New Orleans, Coastal
Marine Engineering Group, and agents posed as employees of the fake
maritime repair business to investigate allegations of bribery
involving maritime contractors nationwide, the U.S. Attorney's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic surveillance, including wiretaps, were used during
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Targets of the investigation were companies who had federal
contracts to service merchant marine and military ships belonging
to the Department of Defense's Military Sealift Command and the
Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The ships are kept in reserve and manned by skeleton crews but
used to transport materials _ such as munitions and fuel _ in times
of war or national emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation centered on the repair of ships in Beaumont
and Houston, New Orleans, Jacksonville, Fla., and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the subcontractor billings were padded in order to
cover the additional cost of the kickbacks, so essentially they
were getting reimbursed,'' said Michael Bradford, U.S. Attorney for
the Eastern District of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four former Bay Ship employees are accused of
accepting monthly country club dues ranging up to several thousands
of dollars a month from a Dayton, Texas, sandblasting company.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said that in one case, about $34,000 in country club
dues were secretly billed to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, prosecutors said, the owner of a maritime
repair company gave a Jeep Cherokee to a then-employee of Bay Ship.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that small companies provided kickbacks and
bribes in exchange for preferential treatment in the awarding of
subcontracts.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with accepting kickbacks on federal contracts are Donald
Lee Allender, 53, of Belvue, Colo.; Robert Chandler Kessler, 34, of
New Orleans; Cary Gordon Byron of Jacksonville, Fla., and Eric
Metzner Bardes of New Orleans, both ages unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The four are former port engineers for Bay Ship and oversaw the
company's ship maintenance contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Raymond Bradley, 47, of Houston, identified by the FBI as
owner of Fire Protective Service Inc., is accused of offering
Allender $9,800 on May 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged was Barney Dale Chrisley, 52, of Aransas Pass,
Texas, identified as owner of Horizon Maritime Industries Inc., who
is accused of offering a $10,000 kickback to Allender on Sept. 17,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Ship Management President Eugene Rose, in a telephone
interview from his New Jersey office, said the company has taken
steps to rectify problems in its procurement practices since the
allegations came to light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have cleaned house,'' Rose said. ``We took a whole series
of corrective actions, including retaining an independent counsel
to an internal investigation, which resulted in the discharge of
these employees and I believe two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reviewed our method of doing procurement, which means bids
for subcontracts, and we have also had the benefit of various
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The company has instituted a zero-tolerance policy regarding
vendor gratuities, Rose said, and all employees pay all their
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, the company has started a comprehensive ethics
training program and there is more oversight from the home office
over the outlying ports.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of bid-rigging, the six could face up to 10 years
in prison and fines of up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of several other maritime repair companies already
have pleaded guilty to similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office said charges could be leveled at
several other individuals, but declined to elaborate, saying the
investigation is ongoing.

<P>
   GOMA, Congo _ People at a shoe market here could not keep quiet
about why they still hate the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   They stood in a polite, if loud, line to complain. They were not
afraid to give their names, even after the police in this
rebel-held city arrived at the market. When asked what good the
rebels had done since the war began a year ago now, dozens yelled
out in Swahili with one voice, ``Nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   ``They came with a war, and we don't want war,'' said Samuel
Pascal, 31. ``It's a bad war. People are dying for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first days of this rebellion, the men seeking to
overthrow the president of Congo, Laurent Kabila, have been
decidedly unpopular even as they conquered nearly half of this huge
country. They are linked too closely with Rwanda, which provides
the rebels with troops and arms but is despised by many ordinary
Congolese.
</P>
<P>
   But the discontent seems to have grown only deeper, despite the
rebels' efforts to win ordinary Congolese to their side. Compared
with a year ago _ when strangers asking questions here were often
met with hostility _ people are far more open now about their
anger.
</P>
<P>
   As unpopular as Kabila appears to be in Kinshasa, the capital,
in the west, his stature here seems only to have soared when
compared with the rebels who rule the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kabila's time I had $100 a month,'' said Jose Kabika, 30,
the wife of a soldier fighting with the rebels, referring to
Kabila's first year in power starting in mid-1997. ``I was waiting
for a baby when my husband was taken to the war. I had the baby but
no medical care, no food for the baby. No money for the rent. No
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no importance to this war of the RCD,'' she said,
using the acronym in French for the main rebel group, the Congolese
Rally for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The group's public relations problems hit a low in July in the
eastern city of Bukavu. Then, witnesses said, a crowd threw stones
at the rebels' military commander, Jean-Pierre Ondekane, when he
tried to talk about the peace deal just drafted in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was very angry,'' said a 30-year-old student at the
rally, who identified himself only as Mutanyagwa.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ondekane then left Bukavu through the Rwandan border
town of Cyangugu _ a fitting symbol for the closeness of the rebels
to their sponsor, Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese who live in the eastern provinces of North and
South Kivu dislike the Rwandans for many reasons. Part of it is
antipathy for Tutsi, the ethnic group that has ruled Rwanda since
they were nearly exterminated as a people by ethnic Hutu in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions can be traced in part to efforts by Mobutu Sese
Seko, who was president when this country was called Zaire, to stir
up hatred in the east in the early 1990s against the Congolese
Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   Many people also suspect that Rwanda wants to annex eastern
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But the anger seems aimed mostly at the fact that two rebellions
in Congo, in 1996 and 1998, began in part because of Rwanda's
worries about its safety. Both times, the Rwandan soldiers crossed
over into Congo to chase the remnants of the Hutu militants who
carried out the 1994 mass killings and continued to attack the
borders. In the process, Rwandan soldiers have been accused of
killing both Hutu rebels and some Congolese as Rwanda sought to
create leadership in Congo friendlier to its concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, said Ndeko Mihanda, 29, are ``working for Rwanda's
interests,'' adding: ``They are Rwandan slaves. They are
marionettes. We are waiting for Kabila to get back here so we can
get back a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, rebel leaders launched into earnest speeches about
how the people would rush to their side once they realized how bad
Kabila was and they tasted the fruits of the rebellion. But now the
rebels seem merely to concede their own unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are not popular,'' said Bizima Karaha, the former Foreign
Minister for Kabila who is now a top rebel official. ``Wars are
never good. Wars destroy. However, a liberation struggle, it is a
like a pregnancy. It is like labor. It is painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what makes people survive it is the hope they have a good
outcome,'' he said. ``They know they will get a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as the rebels might try to minimize the problem, the
group's unpopularity is no trifle. There is little doubt that the
rebels could have made even greater military gains if people were
on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Their unpopularity is also a reason why Uganda, the other nation
supporting the war against Kabila, encouraged an alternate
rebellion in the north, led by Jean-Pierre Bemba. Diplomats say the
problem has also caused tensions between Rwanda, which has
reportedly argued for a full-bore military victory, and Uganda,
which has reportedly made the case that the rebels need greater
political support.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have felt the pressure. Some diplomats and other
followers of African politics say one reason the Rally's leadership
in May dumped its president, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, was that he
lived in exile for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by Emile Ilunga, a medical doctor and a
political activist from Kabila's home province, Katanga.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that even though Ilunga's selection was meant to
enhance the Rally's claims to being a genuine Congolese group, it
seems to have accomplished the impossible: Wamba dia Wamba has
suddenly become popular here in Goma, if only because he was
willing to negotiate with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The Rally, on the other hand, is taking the flak here for not
signing the peace accord drafted in Lusaka, which they say they
will not sign as long as Wamba dia Wamba insists that he too sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wamba wanted to negotiate,'' said John Eleande, 30, a jobless
teacher. ``They didn't want to end the war.''

 &HT;    Kahn's list of contributors expected to give a Barr run for his
money
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Roger Kahn has never run for political office, but
he boasts an impressive list of contributors in his campaign to
unseat three-term Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Kahn raised more than $250,000 in the first half of 1999,
receiving checks from former Democratic Govs. Carl Sanders and Zell
Miller, Braves manager Bobby Cox and UGA athletic director Vince
Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy former liquor distributor and Georgia graduate, Kahn
gives Democrats their best hope of matching Barr's financial
strength in a race that has attracted national interest because of
Barr's prominent role as an advocate of President Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans expect that candidates in the 7th
District will have to raise between $1.5 million and $2 million to
mount a credible campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like other House members who served as prosecutors in Clinton's
trial in the Senate, Barr reported a dramatic increase in his
campaign contributions in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He raised more than $700,000 and has built a half-million dollar
campaign war chest by soliciting contributions nationwide and by
getting help from fellow House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Barr's contributions came from outside Georgia,
said Allan Lipsett, a public relations consultant to the
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Lipsett said Barr expects a ``competitive race'' and is waging a
more aggressive fund-raising campaign. Lipsett also indicated that
Barr's campaign would display the same hard edge that has won him
both passionate support and criticism in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Kahn's contributions from people in the liquor
distributing industry, Lipsett said, ``When you look at Roger
Kahn's (campaign finance) report, don't do it in an enclosed room.
The alcohol fumes will drive you crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, though, received contributions from similar sources,
including an executive with the Georgia Wine and Spirits Council.
</P>
<P>
   Barr has spent nearly $250,000 on a mail and telemarketing
campaign to attract money from people like Louis Camilleri, a
retiree from Bellmore, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands for things I believe in and he wasn't afraid to
assert his position, which of course was against the terrible
things our president was doing. We need champions and Bob Barr is a
champion,'' said Camilleri, who sent Barr $250.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Nicholson, a homemaker from Humble, Tex., said she gave
Barr $300 because ``he was one of the few who did not play it safe,
who didn't hedge his bets. If there is anything admirable in our
government, I feel he personifies it.''
</P>
<P>
   The former prosecutor also received support from former Gov.
Lester Maddox, GOP gubernatorial nominee Guy Millner and Post
Properties Chairman John A. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he received $5,000 from the political action
committee of House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, and $2,000
from fellow Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston. Their contributions were
unusual in that colleagues typically pitch in later, when an
incumbent is locked in an unexpectedly tight race.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also may benefit from a fledgling PAC intended
to help the House managers in Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Barr and several other managers have been targeted by Democrats
who believe the GOP went too far in pushing for Clinton's ouster
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say that Barr's national prominence can, in fact, be
exploited as a weakness in the 7th District, particularly as 2,000
people are losing their jobs at the Lockheed Martin plant in
suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn suggested that Barr did not pay enough attention to the
Lockheed situation, and cited it as one reason he is running.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn did not not invoke Barr's role in impeachment as a reason
for undertaking his first campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Barr has said he is working closely with colleagues and Lockheed
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Democrats are considering running against Barr,
but only police union official Charles Warren has raised any money
so far. Warren reported raising $8,700 in the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential candidate, former Georgia Corrections
Commissioner Wayne Garner, signaled he would not run by sending
Kahn a $1,000 contribution. ``It took me about a week, really only
about two hours to decide'' not to run, Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   While he has never before run for office, Kahn has been a
prominent, if behind-the-scenes, fund-raiser for Georgia Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been active in raising money for the University of
Georgia, which he said led to his friendship with Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn described Cox as a fishing partner he has known for many
years. ``My son is a Braves batboy so I see a lot of Bobby and the
Braves,'' he said.

JORDAN SHUTS DOWN PEPSI BOTTLING OPERATIONS AFTER COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After repeated complaints from government officials about
objects found in Pepsi-Cola soft drinks, Pepsico has been ordered
to shut down part of a bottling plant in Amman, Jordan, a company
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The order came in a letter late Tuesday, and the plant's line
that handles returnable glass bottles was closed down on Wednesday,
said the spokesman, Jeff Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said there had been no reports of illness or injury from
consumers in Jordan, and no one in the government had asked for a
product recall. Parts of the plant that turn out soft drinks in
cans and plastic containers remain open.
</P>
<P>
   The partial plant closing comes less than two months after
Coca-Cola Co. was forced to recall soft drinks and shut down
bottling plants in parts of Europe after hundreds of Belgians said
they felt ill after drinking Coca-Cola and Fanta.
</P>
<P>
   The order in Jordan affects the largest part of Pepsi's business
in the country, where about 80 percent of Pepsi drinks are sold in
returnable glass bottles. The country is one of the few where Pepsi
holds a commanding lead over its archrival, Coca-Cola. Pepsi's
market share in Jordan is 77.2 percent, compared with 22.8 percent
for Coke, according to Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The objects found in Pepsi's drinks have included paper,
plastic, sand and bits of cement, according to local newspaper
accounts. Brown said the plant had been cited three times in the
last 18 months, most recently on Aug. 5. The first complaint, which
predated Pepsi's ownership of the plant, he said, ended with the
government suggesting that employees wear different shoes when on
the production line. The second, in April, ordered Pepsi to paint
the plant's ceiling, which the company did, Brown said. The company
has offered to add more inspectors on the lines, who would make
``visual inspections'' of finished soft drinks as a backup to
existing quality procedures, he said. A group of manufacturing and
quality-control experts from Pepsico headquarters in Purchase,
N.Y., has been sent to Amman to help clear up the situation, Brown
said.

 &HT;    L.A. shootings sadden suspect's family
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The parents of Buford Furrow Jr., the white
supremacist charged in Tuesday's Los Angeles Jewish community
center shooting, are ``heartbroken'' over their son's alleged
crime, an uncle in South Carolina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you handle it if your only son was in that kind of
trouble?'' Bill Wells, of West Columbia, S.C., said Thursday in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he wasn't aware of Furrow's extremist views, which
police said prompted Furrow to shoot five people at the community
center as a ``wake-up call to America to kill Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, also faces a murder charge in Tuesday's slaying of a
postal worker near the community center. He was involved with
neo-Nazi groups and had a long relationship with the widow of the
founder of The Order, a violent offshoot of the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally surprised. I did not know he was involved in
anything like that,'' said Wells, who owns a music shop. ``He is
from a good family.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he telephoned his sister Wednesday, after he learned
of her son's alleged involvement in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Furrow's parents attended a family reunion in West
Columbia. Furrow, who grew up in Washington near the Idaho border,
did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them how he was doing,'' said Wells, who last saw his
nephew in 1963 when he was a child. ``They said he was doing
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he didn't inquire beyond that. ``We come from the
mountains of Virginia, and we do not delve into other people's
business. That is the way we were brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``They know I am here for them if they need me.

FBI LIMITED IN ABILITY TO PROBE HATE GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is no FBI file on the views of the Aryan
Nations, the neo-Nazi group whose members have said they are
``involved in a holy war.'' Nor are there FBI agents monitoring the
dozens of Web sites devoted to white supremacy _ even ones spewing
hatred of blacks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Attorney General Janet Reno deplored the ``culture
of violence'' that gave rise to Buford O. Furrow Jr., who was
charged Thursday with hate crimes in Tuesday's shooting spree near
Los Angeles, there were no plans to create an FBI system for
tracking hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The agency's own embarrassing history of
overzealousness and First Amendment protection of individual
rights.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials acknowledge a surge in domestic terrorism in
recent years, with the number of cases skyrocketing to 1,000 from
100 in 1993. Alarmed officials had responded to the trend with
force, reassigning 350 new agents to investigate such crimes long
before Furrow's rampage, in which he allegedly killed a
Filipino-American postal worker and wounded five others, including
three boys, at a Jewish community center.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI cannot target groups for investigation based on
their beliefs, at least not overtly. This restraint rests on the
belief that the government should respect free speech and not crack
down on groups or individuals who espouse unpopular ideas, unless
there is some criminal activity involved.
</P>
<P>
   So while fears of hate crimes mount and as federal officials
brace for potentially heightened violence around the millennium,
the notion of monitoring hate groups solely because of their
beliefs ``doesn't fit into our lexicon here,'' said FBI spokesman
Tron Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that you not focus on a group unless you have
a reasonable indication that they are engaged in criminal
conduct,'' Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for the federal government,'' said Eric
Ward of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, which
monitors hate organizations. ``Many people now feel frustrated,
because law enforcement is effectively restricted from monitoring
these groups. But the cost of that would be our civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions weren't always in place.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades ago, at the behest of then-director J.
Edgar Hoover, the FBI covertly tracked ideological groups _ mostly
liberal, political ones _ on the basis of their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Panthers, the American Indian Movement, and Students
for a Democratic Society were among the organizations monitored,
and even infiltrated, by a special FBI unit known as the Counter
Intelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, said Ward and other hate
crimes specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI came under intense criticism in the 1970s for the
practice, and following congressional hearings, two top FBI
officials were convicted of crimes related to the secret
investigation force. The agency ultimately instituted a set of
guidelines that forbids launching or classifying investigations in
a way that would violate the First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were severely chastised'' for COINTELPRO, said Brekke, the
FBI spokesman. ``There was not a necessary showing of criminal acts
on their part. There was an infiltration of their activities. Hence
the guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are widely hailed by civil liberties advocates.
But law enforcement officials have complained in the past of
feeling constrained. Such constraints exist even in cases like
those of Eric Rudolph and James Kopp, two of the suspects on the
FBI Most Wanted List, who are accused of hate crimes and affiliated
with hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   But being linked to a hate group is not sufficient for the FBI
to target the organization as well, Brekke said. If an individual
is acting alone, instead of under the imprimatur of the group, he
can be charged with a civil rights violation by the FBI's criminal
investigative division. But the group itself will not be monitored
unless there is compelling evidence it is plotting an act of
domestic terrorism. In that case, it would be tracked by a separate
FBI division dealing with national security, Brekke said.
</P>
<P>
   However, certain groups can still be under investigation. The
Order, a white supremacist group whose members have been convicted
of murders and bank robberies, has almost certainly been looked at
by the FBI in the context of crimes its members committed, not its
racist beliefs, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also works in tandem with outside nonprofit agencies
such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.
``Law enforcement agencies come to us every day with questions
about particular groups,'' said Mark Potok, a spokesman for the
center. ``I think the current division of labor is a good one, in
which the government has police powers but is precluded from
investigating groups merely because they have unpleasant views.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has urged Congress to adopt hate crimes legislation that
would bolster federal and state prosecutors' cases against people
accused of committing a crime based on bias. But she has not backed
down from the FBI's emphasis on protecting free speech. Even
Thursday, Reno said she had been reviewing the guidelines for
monitoring hate groups since she took office.
</P>
<P>
   Brekke added: ``We don't have files on every group that espouses
hate in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't deal in what people think, believe, say,'' Brekke
said. ``For every group that has a Web site, there is not a
corresponding FBI file. Talking about violence is a whole lot
different than actually taking the steps to do the violence. . .
. &UR;  &LR; There has to be some criminality or potential criminality
involved.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The mountain villages of Dagestan, scene of Russia's latest
military clash with Chechen and Dagestani rebels, are
extraordinarily remote. The people of the Botlikh region, a high
corner on the Chechen-Dagestani border, are unique to their valley
and speak their own language. The stark, barren crags of the Great
Caucasus mountain range where they live are even more impenetrable
than the wooded mountains of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   A skirmish in this southernmost point of Russia may seem like a
small problem with bandits in the hills. Yet at least 10 Russian
soldiers have already died in five days of fighting, with many more
wounded, and no accurate count of how many guerrillas have died.
The casualties show that both sides regard the area and the issue
important enough to fight for. The rebels have a vision and proven
determination. The Russian authorities are again trying to smash
incipient separatism with brute force, despite the lessons of
Chechnya that such tactics may only reinforce popular resistance
and could bring greater instability and even military humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of Dagestan, stuck in the middle, the conflict
spells trouble. Dagestan, which only just managed to survive the
fallout of the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya, is double the size of its
Chechen neighbor and far more fractured, with a population of 2
million made up of 34 different ethnic nationalities. The power
sharing between them is intricate and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia, Dagestan retains an important strategic value.
Dagestan commands 70 percent of Russia's shoreline to the
oil-producing Caspian Sea and its only all-weather Caspian port at
Makhachkala. It provides the crucial pipeline links from
Azerbaijan, where Russia maintains important oil interests.
Geographically placed between Chechnya and the Caspian and
Azerbaijan, it has served as a containing buffer, controlling the
Chechens' access to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   For Chechnya, which won its freedom from Russian rule but has
suffered drastically from the consequent economic isolation,
Dagestan offers the way out to prosperity. During the war Dagestan,
and in particular the Botlikh region, became a conduit for weapons
and men into and out of Chechnya. Hundreds of wounded Chechen
fighters were spirited over the mountain roads to Azerbaijan for
treatment. Now the routes offer the promise of trade, jobs and
economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   There is much more than economics driving this confrontation,
though. The men leading the incursion into Dagestan are determined
revolutionaries, who want to see the whole Caucasus region free
from Russian rule. They regard much of Dagestan as theirs by right,
harking back to the Islamic state that resisted Russian conquest
for so long in the last century. The Dagestanis they see as their
Muslim brothers, but those who are loyal to Moscow they see as
their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   There are few people in Dagestan who actively support
independence from Russia, yet discontent with Moscow runs deep.
Since the war in Chechnya, the republic has suffered drastic
economic decline and instability. Unemployment is the highest in
all of Russia, and like all people from the Caucasus, the
Dagestanis suffer ethnic discrimination in Russia. Their
predicament leaves them susceptible to ideas of radical Islam, or
even separatism, according to Enver Kisriyev, a Dagestani
sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   Mukhu Gumbatovich Aliyev, chairman of the People's Assembly of
Dagestan, said in Moscow on Tuesday that many polls have shown that
more than 90 percent of the people in Dagestan think they remain
part of Russia. He is a critic of Moscow's war in Chechnya, but
says the guerrillas' incursions into Dagestan have outraged
Dagestanis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are really incensed,'' Aliyev said. ``They are
demanding that possession of firearms be legalized. We are setting
up companies formed by local people in each district of Dagestan.
We are setting up these detachments so that they could defend their
districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamil Basayev, the Chechen guerrilla commander who led his
troops in the fiercest fighting of the war and executed the hostage
raid on the southern Russian town of Budyonnovsk in which nearly
150 people died before Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin began
negotiations that led to the release of hostages and the opening of
serious peace talks to try to end the secessionist war in Chechnya,
is the driving force behind the latest fighting.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He has had Dagestan in his sights for more than a year now.
After six months as Chechen prime minister last year, he resigned
to set up a formal movement called the Congress of the Peoples of
Chechnya and Dagestan and head its ``peacekeeping force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim is the union of Dagestan and Chechnya,'' he said in an
extended interview last year. Asked if that meant removing Dagestan
from Russian jurisdiction, he answered, ``Inshallah,'' which means
``God willing.'' He said that he hoped Dagestan would win
independence without recourse to war, but that there were many
Dagestanis willing to fight and he was prepared to help them. ``I
am helping Dagestan and will help anyone who is against Russia,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Basayev is a fierce fighter with a clear political aim.
For many years he has argued that the world is witnessing the
collapse of the Russian empire and its dominance of the North
Caucasus region. He was always confident that Russia would withdraw
from Chechnya and predicts the same for Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dagestan will be independent, there is no doubt,'' he said.
``Russia will not have a presence in the North Caucasus, it will
simply leave. Probably without war or bloodshed, it will collapse.
Our job will be to prevent great bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Basayev is supported and possibly helped with funds by a
commander known by his nom de guerre, Khattab, who arrived in
Chechnya in early 1995 to join the fight against Russia. Khattab
keeps his origins secret, but is thought to be from Jordan or Saudi
Arabia and a follower of Wahhabism, the conservative sect of Islam
practiced in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   He fought with the rebels against the Soviet Army in Afghanistan
but has since made his home in Chechnya and married a Dagestani.
Wounded three times in Chechnya, he is very close to Basayev and
has been training young Chechen and Dagestani fighters. His agenda,
he says, is to fight the Russians and bring Islamic rule once more
to the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Khattab is reticent about his connections with other Wahhabi
organizations around the world and about his long-term aims. Yet he
is part of a growing presence of Wahhabis in the Caucasus, in
particular in Dagestan and Chechnya. Their version of Islam is
strict and militant, and much of it alien to the Caucasus. Not all
Wahhabis advocate armed intervention; some are living peacefully in
other Dagestani villages. But militant Wahhabis are finding fertile
ground among the young, particularly when tempted by weapons
training.
</P>
<P>
   While Basayev defends Khattab fiercely as a brother who spilt
his blood for Chechnya, he has spoken against Wahhabism, or extreme
Islam, for Chechnya. Basayev is a practising Muslim. Unlike the
Wahhabis who are against the presence of infidels in a Muslim
country, Basayev says that that he would welcome the presence of
NATO in the Caucasus and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Basayev and Khattab makes the Russian
leadership see red. While Moscow can tolerate the moderate Chechen
President, Aslan Maskhadov, it regards Mr Basayev as a terrorist
and a radical with whom it cannot negotiate, and Khattab as a
dangerous foreign mercenary.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are not even considering negotiating with them
over their occupation of several villages in Dagestan, Zagir
Arukhov, the deputy minister of Nationalities in Dagestan, said in
a phone interview. ``We will not go to negotiate. They are bandits
and we see this action as an aggression and occupation of
Dagestan.'' So, as in Chechnya, they are resorting to helicopters
and artillery to attack the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of Dagestan, the consequences could be long and
terrible. Kisriyev, the sociologist, roundly condemned the Russian
action, which he says will only bring destruction and
impoverishment for the local people and throw them into the arms of
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not want war but the entire people will gradually be
drawn in, as happened in Chechnya,'' he said.

KROGER AGREES TO SETTLE HIRING DISCRIMINATION SUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kroger Co. has agreed to pay $240,000 to 21 plaintiffs to settle
an age and disabilities discrimination lawsuit filed by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, issued in a consent decree by a U.S. District
Court in Dallas, ends the class-action suit filed in early 1998 and
a case initiated by grocery warehouse workers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC accused the Cincinnati-based Kroger of age
discrimination after investigating the workers' complaints filed in
1994, based on the grocer not rehiring 23 men older than 40. They
had been working in a warehouse in Keller, Texas, that Kroger
bought in 1994. The suit alleged that discrimination resulted from
a physical ability test that Kroger used in its hiring process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kroger categorically denies that its test in any way
discriminates, specifically noting that the test had been developed
by a nationally recognized testing firm,'' the EEOC said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was resolved,'' said Gary Huddleston, Kroger's spokesman
for its Southwest Marketing Area, based in Houston. The grocer has
since sold its Keller warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Huddleston declined to comment beyond the EEOC statement.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had also accused Kroger of violating the
Americans with Disabilities Act by subjecting the workers to
pre-employment medical tests that required them to divulge their
medical histories.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC ruled in 1996 that Kroger had violated federal laws
applying to age discrimination and disabilities. The commission and
Kroger tried to work out a settlement before the EEOC filed its
lawsuit early last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decree provides $240,000 for 21 applicants who failed the
test in 1994,'' the EEOC said.
</P>
<P>
   That sum is far less than the EEOC's lawsuit was originally
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The suit aimed for back wages and out-of-pocket medical costs
for all 23 workers in the affected group. It also sought $6.9
million, or $300,000 per person, in punitive damages under the
disabilities act. Why the settlement affects 21 rather than 23
plaintiffs was unclear Thursday.

SOME PUERTO RICANS ANGERED BY CLINTON PARDON OF PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton may have thought he was resolving a
politically awkward human-rights issue when he commuted the
sentences of 16 Puerto Rican prisoners Wednesday, but he has only
angered many of those he tried to please.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners are members of a militant Puerto Rican nationalist
group who have been serving sentences ranging from 35 to 90 years _
and have already spent between 14 and 25 years in jail _ for crimes
committed in the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, various groups and politicians have been
calling for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal step came last April, when all 16 of New York City's
elected Puerto Rican officials met at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe and
jointly wrote a letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Rivera, a City Council member who was there, said the
letter urged Clinton to resolve the matter before the next
presidential election _ or risk seeing it brought up at the
Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Settling the issue would also help Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
needs not only the support but the heavy turnout of New York's
900,000-strong Puerto Rican community in order to win next year's
US Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-language paper El Diario reported Thursday that
Clinton may also have commuted the sentences to mollify widespread
anger over an incident last month when two US Navy bombs, dropped
over a firing range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, went
astray and killed a civilian security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motives, Clinton's decision _ which was the product
of long negotiations between Puerto Rican activists and an
interagency panel of administration officials _ satisfies some of
these pressures.
</P>
<P>
   However, it falls short of one crucial demand _ that the
prisoners be not merely paroled but given unconditional amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, a Puerto Rican congressman from the Bronx,
said by telephone from Puerto Rico: ``What the president did is
important, it's a door-opener. But I am shocked by the conditions
he set on their release.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists all over town were complaining Thursday about these
``conditions.'' However, White House and Justice Dept. officials
insisted these complaints are based on misunderstandings or
falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Velgara, an activist at Pro Libertad, which has been
lobbying for the prisoners' freedom for six years now, said he had
heard Clinton's offer hinged on the following conditions: the
released prisoners could not talk with each other (even though some
are relatives), engage in any political activity, or express
support for Puerto Rican independence.
</P>
<P>
   Velgara and others called these strings ``a violation of
constitutional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a White House official who has been involved in the
deal from start to finish said Thursday evening: ``The only
condition is that they renounce the use of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that, they must abide only by the rules that apply to
all parolees. One of those rules forbids them from associating with
known felons without the knowledge of their parole officers. ``That
would mean they can't associate with each other, since they're all
known felons,'' he said. However, he noted that parole boards have
frequently made arrangements allowing contact with spouses or other
relatives who are also felons.
</P>
<P>
   The official outright denied the claim that they cannot engage
in political activities.
</P>
<P>
   He was also puzzled by statements from some politicians that the
prisoners had been convicted only for sedition and conspiracy. For
example, Rep. Nydia Valezquez, a Puerto Rican congresswoman from
Brooklyn, said Thursday they ``never caused personal injury to
anyone.'' Puerto Ricans commonly refer to them as ``political
prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   However, documents released Thursday by the Justice Dept. show
that, in addition to sedition and conspiracy, the prisoners were
convicted on such charges as armed robbery, possession of
unregistered firearms, manufacturing bombs, and taking hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a White spokesman, said Thursday: ``The president
took this action in a way that recognizes that these individuals
committed serious crimes, but that also recognizes that the
sentences they received were far out of proportion to the nature of
their crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 prisoners whose sentences would be commuted in
Clinton's offer, 11 could be freed, three have their sentences
shortened, and two _ who are already out of jail _ would be
relieved of unpaid fines.

   LOS ANGELES _ To those who criticized us for our position on

</P>
<P>
   __ We aren't anti-Latina sportscaster. Any critique of someone

mistakes that often come with inexperience. Additionally, we've
never had anything but compliments for KCBS Channel 2's hiring of

of inferior work, made his ageism issues known when his contract
wasn't renewed at the end of June and has since asked people at the
station to ``let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: KTLA news director Jeff Wald has to start
taking responsibility for feeding Trejos to the wolves and then
trying to cover himself with ridiculous and insulting comments made
in the media. The most recent appeared in Monday's New York Times,
where he not only denied Trejos was hired to appeal to Hispanic
viewers but said there were too many tapes of ``cookie-cutter''
sportscasters that he had watched before deciding on Trejos, who
had no experience at an English-language station after seven years
at several Spanish-language ones.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what gender, what ethnic background, Los Angeles
viewers and even those sportscasters who've been grumbling about
Trejos' hiring care about one thing _ a quality sportscast.
Anything less in a market this size and with this many options for
televised sports news won't fly.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Wald seems to have missed the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Had Wald admitted that Trejos has been brought in as a way to
attract more bilingual Hispanic viewers, we'd actually like to give
him some credit. And it would be understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Neilsen ratings will soon attempt to better measure Hispanic
viewers in Spanish-speaking households because L.A.'s population
base is nearly 40 percent Hispanic, and of that, almost 60 percent
speak Spanish as the primary language. Some stations have already
become ``more Hispanic'' by hiring more Latino-surnamed talent.
Fact is, if a station is accused of being ``too Hispanic,'' some
station managers are taking that as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Wald isn't going there, he says, but will use the ethnic card
against those critical of his hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Given, Trejos is nice to look at and has enthusiasm. But any
logic of bringing her in to fill that perceived Hispanic need goes
out the window once the sports viewer sees past her most revealing
shortcoming _ her inability to comfortably and fluently speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where gimmickry does tend to set one apart, why didn't
anyone think of trying the Ricky Ricardo approach _ put someone on
who butchers the language and gets laughs. But that's even more
degrading.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers' Spanish-language
broadcaster who was going into the Hall of Fame, was asked if he'd
ever consider breaking in on an English-language broadcast some 30
years ago because at the time there were very few Spanish-language
stations willing to broadcast sports.
</P>
<P>
   Never, he said, because there are so many nuances in the English
language. He added that those who speak fluent Spanish are
sometimes intimidated and are so proud of their own language that
to disrespect English would only hurt their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   How does this fit with Trejos' situation? It was her desire to
work for KTLA; she wasn't recruited. While at Spanish-language
KWHY-TV, she asked Arnold about coming by the station on a weekend
to watch him work and discussed how he did his job on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   If Trejos felt she was ready to make the transition, that's her
decision. But someone like Wald could have told her she wasn't
ready, directed her to a smaller market _ how about Bakersfield? _
to hone her talent. Then, in a few years, give the L.A. spotlight a
try.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in this market had been ready to make that sort of
leap, a better candidate would have been Mario Asalas, a visible
sports reporter for KMEX-Channel 52.
</P>
<P>
   Trejos, most often in a weekend role at KTLA, has been on the 10
p.m. newscast all this week because of the vacationing Tony
Hernandez _ and there's the irony, the most Anglosized sportscaster
in the market with an Hispanic surname is Trejos' team captain.
Whether it's because of KTLA's expanded coverage of the Granada
Hills shooting or that they're trying to keep Trejos from handling
too much too soon, her air time has been limited. That's a
disservice to sports viewers, too.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to make this out to be an knee-jerk
affirmative-action reaction to an experiment that's already blown
up in Wald's face while the rest of KTLA news' credibility
continues to slide. If Trejos seizes this opportunity and becomes
something more than an average sportscaster, it'll be her doing,
because the deck is stacked against her.
</P>
<P>
   Many of KTLA's top sports producers have already left the
station to work for the new TVG network. Scott Verona, a talented
producer who stayed, has his hands tied by Wald's hiring of a
special writer just to feed Trejos her lines on the TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   Trejos can't quit _ this opportunity is too valuable. But she
can't keep taking the heat for Wald's miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing Arnold was in itself nonsensical. Hiring Trejos at
this point in her career without at least keeping Arnold on to help
just magnified the blunder. If KTLA, at one time the best
independent news operation in town, ever recovers from this, it'll
be just as surprising. &QL;

UNICEF SURVEY BLAMES SADDAM FOR INCREASED CHILD MORTALITY IN IRAQ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The first major survey of child mortality in
Iraq since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 has found that in areas of
the country controlled by President Saddam Hussein, children under
5 years of age are dying at twice the rate they were before the
conflict, UNICEF reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But in Kurdish areas in the north of the country, where U.N.
officials and not the Iraqi government administer food and medical
programs, the health of children appears to have improved to some
degree, and mortality rates have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The figures for infant, child and maternal mortality rates place
Iraq in the company of Third World nations in Asia and Africa, a
significant drop from the oil-boom years when Baghdad was a city
reaching the living standards of some rapidly industrializing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The toll that international sanctions have taken on Iraq since
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait has been apparent in recent years in
the harsher lives and increased deaths of children, as families
struggle to provide adequate food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But the UNICEF survey also indicates that Baghdad could have
done more to alleviate suffering in large regions of the country
and in its major cities.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was published jointly with the Iraqi government but
not widely distributed. The Iraqis, however, have dissociated
themselves from the findings about the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release Thursday, UNICEF recommended that Baghdad
``should urgently expedite implementation of targeted nutrition
programs.'' It also called on the world to provide more money for
relief in Iraq and asked that the Security Council sanctions
committee, which governs imports to Iraq, put a priority on
supplies that could benefit children.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of sanctions, Saddam has been permitted to
import food and medicines free of restrictions, but with oil sales
blocked, he chose to spend what money was available on lavish
palaces and construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the fall of 1991, the Iraqis were also offered a
program allowing them to sell some oil to buy supplies for
civilians, but the government refused to accept what became the
``oil for food'' program until 1995, and it was not put into effect
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, U.N. officials directing the program have told the
Security Council that Iraq appears to be warehousing medicines and
has not acted on recommendations that more nutritional goods be
purchased for children under 5 and lactating mothers. Thursday,
UNICEF also urged Iraq to stop spending money on infant formula and
promote breast feeding instead.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has consistently used the suffering of children to argue
its case against sanctions, a policy the Clinton administration has
clung to in the face of international criticism. When important
foreign visitors go to Baghdad, funerals of children are staged in
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is involved, however, in developing a
Security Council plan to offer Iraq new ways to cooperate in
clearing itself of charges that it is still harboring or attempting
to make biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. That could lead to
a suspension of sanctions, but no decision is expected until the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said,
``The United States is very concerned about the death of children
in Iraq.'' He added that ``the bottom line'' was that Iraq was
blocking aid available through the oil-for-food program and that
there was nothing outsiders could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our view that the fact that in northern Iraq the
mortality rate is improving, with the same sanctions regime as the
rest of Iraq, shows that in places where Saddam Hussein isn't
manipulating the medicines and the supplies, this works,'' he said.
``We can't solve a problem that is the result of tyrannical
behavior by the regime in Baghdad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to UNICEF, deaths of children under 5 in the south and
central parts of Iraq, where 85 percent of the people live, more
than doubled, from 56 deaths for each 1,000 live births in
1984-1989, to 131 deaths in 1994-1999. That matches the under-5
mortality rates of Pakistan, Haiti or Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Kurdish areas, deaths of children under 5
declined from 80 for every 1,000 births in 1984-1989, to 72 in
1994-1999, about the level of Egypt or Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   In the south and central areas of Iraq, infant mortality _ that
is, death in the first year of life _ rose from 47 deaths per 1,000
live births in 1984-1989, to 108 in 1994-1999, similar to rates for
Cambodia, Mongolia or Equatorial Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in northern Iraq, infant mortality dropped from 64
deaths for every 1,000 live births, to 59, the same as the rate in
Guyana or Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   The survey in southern and central Iraq was carried out entirely
by Iraqi interviewers, all women who are recent graduates of
medical schools. The fieldwork was done in February and March, and
Iraqi officials compiled and entered the data, which were then
copied daily for study by UNICEF. In the autonomous regions of the
Kurdish north, U.N. officials and local authorities were directly
involved in gathering data.

TONY GWYNN'S SON HAS SCOUTS WATCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As the left-handed batter settles into the
box, one-by-one he displays all the identifiable traits of his
heritage: the spread, slightly-open stance; the smooth,
back-and-forth rocking of the bat as the pitcher stares in for a
sign; and finally, the bat cocked just over the left-shoulder, not
flat but not upright, either.
</P>
<P>
   And then, Anthony Gwynn Jr., betraying all the expectations of
what might be next, drops a bunt down the third-base line that is
so well placed he reaches first base without a throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Gwynn acknowledged later, sitting on at a picnic table
down the left-field line at Blair Field. ``My dad hasn't done that
in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are any great expectations that come with being the
only son of Tony Gwynn, who is widely considered the best hitter of
his generation and who last week became the 22nd major leaguer to
record 3,000 career base hits, they don't appear to be a burden.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Gwynn is a 5-foot-10, 150-pound outfielder, who will be
a senior this fall at Poway High, about 20 miles northeast of San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He lacks the size, speed (7.0 seconds in the 60-yard dash) and
arm strength to make him a top-level prospect, but any question of
whether he belongs at the Area Code Games, a national showcase for
elite high school players that's being held this week at Blair
Field, is answered soon after he steps into the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   Through two games for the San Diego Padres-sponsored team, he is
3 for 5 with a walk, which came after he fell behind 0-2 and fouled
off a half-dozen pitches. One of his two hits Wednesday came when
he lined an outside pitch just under the glove of a diving third
baseman and just past the lunging backhand of the shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly a prospect,'' said Tim McWilliam, a Padre scout
who put together the team. ``He's got to get a little stronger, but
he shows signs of being a chip off the old block.''
</P>
<P>
   A player's pedigree won't get him drafted, McWilliam says, but
it is sure to get him looked at. Padres manager Bruce Bochy's son
played in the Area Code Games in 1996 and the sons of former Padres
shortstop Garry Templeton and third baseman Graig Nettles
participated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said for bloodlines,'' said McWilliam,
the scout who last year signed Wilson High's Sean Burroughs, the
son of former American League MVP Jeff Burroughs. ``By being around
the game, a lot of times they pick up the intangibles and the
instincts. It's not an absolute, but it certainly helps. I don't
see how it can be a hindrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's stance is slightly more closed than his father's and he
uses a longer bat (34 inches to 31), but it's quickly apparent that
many of the intangibles and instincts people notice in Tony Gwynn
the focus, determination and attention to detail are found in
Anthony. The difference being that Anthony is 16.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, for example, has no qualms about passing up the
opportunity to see his father's 3,000th hit Friday in Montreal.
He'd spent the previous three days in St. Louis, something he
called ``the best thing I ever experienced,'' but when his father
went to Montreal one hit shy of the milestone, Anthony returned
home so he could be well-rested for the Area Code Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a nice understanding about it,'' Anthony said,
occasionally slipping into the same nasal voice as his father. ``He
knows I was committed to this and he was proud of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting prepared in St. Louis I was hitting and shagging
balls, but I wanted to make sure I didn't have any jet lag. I was
real nervous (over the weekend).''
</P>
<P>
   If cross-country flights, clubhouse passes and working out among
major leaguers are some of the privileges that come with being
Anthony Gwynn Jr., there is another having access to a human
encyclopedia on hitting.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, when Gwynn, who batted .400 for Poway this
season, realized ``I can play this game a little,'' he's approached
his father more often for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``An encyclopedia just doesn't come to you,'' he said. ``You
have to go look it up. He doesn't come to me. He never wants to put
pressure on me. I see a lot of parents put pressure on their kids
to be successful. I see it happen a lot They say, `do this, don't
do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the upside of being Anthony Gwynn Jr., the other side
of the ledger is, well, being Tony Gwynn, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what everybody always wants to know do I ever get tired
of people asking about what it's like,'' Anthony said. ``Yeah, it
gets on my nerves sometime, but I realize there's not a lot of
people in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates and coaches many of them having just met Gwynn
find him just a regular guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen he has no ego,'' said Ferdy Reed, one of
the Padres coaches. ``He's a free spirit, and I mean that in the
best sense, and a class act. If you didn't know his name, you'd
have no clue who his father is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a funny guy,'' said Adrian Gonzalez, a pitcher-first
baseman from Bonita. ``He makes everybody relax. Sometimes I feel
like asking him about his dad, but I don't. I think he hears that a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   So, despite all the attention he's received for his name, Gwynn
is eager to earn some for his game. He says he's able to forget
about the hundreds of scouts this week and focus on putting the bat
squarely on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time where the attention has been on me
(instead of his father),'' Anthony said. ``Earlier this year, we
were playing Rancho Bernardo and Tommy Lasorda was there. I was so
nervous I went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   My mom told me to stay within myself and not to worry everybody
else looking at you. It's thrill to come out here and play with a
lot of these guys. I just want to come out here, play hard and show
everybody what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps make a name for himself.

POLICE ON HOT SEAT OVER PEPPER SPRAY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It sounds crazy, and most medical doctors and
law enforcement experts say it is. Nonetheless, police here claim
they instruct their officers that a potent anti-personnel weapon,
pepper spray, is less effective against Mexican Americans, Indians,
Cajuns and certain other ethnic groups, because of their fondness
for spicy foods.
</P>
<P>
   Without any scientific data to support the idea, Cambridge
police officers are instructed that some minority groups and
individuals exposed at an early age to hot peppers, either in diet
or in the fields or in food-processing plants, develop a tolerance
to pepper spray, used by police to temporarily incapacitate
belligerents.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pasquarello, a spokesman for the Cambridge Police
Department, said he saw nothing inherently wrong with presenting
such information in training, which he said was discussed by a
Cambridge Police department instructor at annual training sessions
at the Cambridge Police Academy in a professional, uninflammatory
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not slandering anyone. He's not making fun of any
ethnicity,'' said Pasquarello. ``He's teaching the class based on
information he's received. If he feels, as an instructor, it's
benefiting the officer as well as the person who might be subjected
to this, then it's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pasquarello: ``We've never been given any classes that say
people from certain ethnic grouops should be sprayed longer than
others. You don't give a (longer) burst to a person who is Mexican,
Latin American or Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations, which were reported Thursday in the local
Cambridge Chronicle, have alarmed minority leaders who worry that
the training will send a subliminal message to officers that
members of certain ethnic groups should be sprayed more agressively
than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will laugh when they hear this _ it's so
ridiculous'' said Manuel Macias, a lawyer who assists Central
American refugees at Centro Presente in Cambridge. ``But it's a
laugh with irony and an edge because of the knowledge that these
officers think you are physically different.''
</P>
<P>
   James Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern
University, said he wondered why ethnic distinctions would even be
mentioned in a training program _ even if they were correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is disconcerting that training would venture into such
areas,'' he said. ``These are broad-brush generalizations that are
questionable factionally and of limited value logistically: How do
you tell the difference between whether someone is a food handler
or not? By whether they have a chef's hat on? There are many
Hispanics who can't tolerate spicy foods.''
</P>
<P>
   The training programs are taught by Cambridge Police Officer
Frank Gutoski.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people it doesn't affect are people who have consumed
cayenne pepper from the time they are small children, and this
generally breaks into ethnic categories,'' Gutoski told the local
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper spray, a mixture of cayenne pepper and natural oils, is
sprayed from a pressurized container. It is a non-lethal,
self-defense device used by law-enforcement officers around the
country. They commonly refer to the substance as ``O.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Widely advertised on the Internet and other places as a personal
security product for fending off everything from psychotic
attackers to grizzly bears, the works effectively only when it is
sprayed directly into the face or eyes. It causes severe burning
for approximately 45 to 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gutoski, who could not be reached by the Globe, told the weekly
paper that people who worked in produce departments or processing
plants, or who handled cayenne peppers regularly, were less
susceptible to the effects of pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican-Americans tend to be pickers,'' he said. ``So with
Cajuns, Mexican-Americans, Pakistani, Indian . . . what happens is
that O.C. is effective for a much shorter time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he received the information from the Massachusetts
Criminal Justice Training Council, which trains members of police
departments across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquarello said the Cambridge Police Department was waiting for
the Criminal Justice Training Counsel to send him lesson plan
information from its defensive tactics curriculum in order to
confirm this claim.
</P>
<P>
   But MCJTC director Kevin Harrington flatly denies that such
information was a part of that organization's defensive-tactics
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``How (pepper spray) affects different groups is not part of our
curriculum,' he said. ``This is not something that's condoned by
our agency at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts and pepper-spray manufacturers said people who
work in the food industry or who have prolonged exposure to hot
peppers often do develop thickened skin, known as Hunan Skin. But
they said there was no scientific evidence that these people or any
particular ethnic group were desensitized to pepper spray when it
was sprayed in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an extremly dangerous jump to make,'' said Dr. Michael
Burns a medical toxicologist and emergency medicine physician at
Beth Israel Deconness Medical Center in Boston. ``This is based on
what they call hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Baugher, the president of Security Plus, a Yakima, Wash.
pepper spray manufacturer was even more blunt. ``It seems crazy.
I've heard of Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster,'' Baugher said.
``It's like saying that because you're an iron-worker your less
susceptible to being killed by a bullet.''

STUDENT STRIKE CONTINUES AT MEXICO'S LARGEST UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For most of the last four months, Edson Molina
Munoz, a 22-year-old philosophy student, has been spending his
nights on the tiled floor of a classroom at Mexico's biggest
university.
</P>
<P>
   He says he would like to go home. But he is not giving up on a
strike that has paralyzed the National Autonomous University of
Mexico since late April.
</P>
<P>
   Classes for the fall term are supposed to start on Monday. But
neither Molina nor, it seems, anyone else here thinks that is going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the authorities are not responding to our
demands,'' Molina said, talking near the main library building,
which is fancifully embroidered with a Diego Rivera mural. ``We've
been here for nearly four months, and we can stay as long as it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   With much of the 270,000-member student body, the largest in the
hemisphere, apparently eager to get started with a new school year,
the administration looks increasingly helpless. Yet neither the
rector, Francisco Barnes de Castro, nor government officials want
to storm the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are constrained by the Latin American tradition _
occasionally violently breeched _ of treating the campus as a
sanctuary and by the horrendous memories of 1968 when, shortly
before the Mexico City Olympic Games, Mexican security forces mowed
down waves of protesting students with gunfire. The number of
casualties still remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Especially, now, in the early days of campaigns for mayor and
the presidency, no one wants to lead a charge on the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to negotiate,'' said Gerardo Dorantes, a
spokesman for the university. ``But even if the strikers agree to
discussions, I don't think we will be able to open on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   The university capitulated on the original demand that brought
classes to a halt on April 20: an increase in tuition from a few
cents to about $150 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But with that victory the students pressed on, widening their
demands to an insistence that the governing university council be
abolished and replaced by a new body designed by the strikers. And
now that is the main sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only possible way of resolving university issues,
according to our law, is through the university council,'' Dorantes
said. ``We cannot create another body.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorantes said the university has generally accepted the
students' demand that strike leaders not be prosecuted. But the
university is intent on working out other demands by the strikers
with the entire student body _ including a return to open
admissions based on minimal high school grades _ once the strikers
have relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to discuss these things with the whole student body,
not just this group,'' Dorantes said.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the campus, a handful of nonstriking students
said they just wanted to get back to their studies. ``They are
wasting a lot of time and money and hurting the prestige of the
university,'' said Lorena de Anda, 19, a chemistry student.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say how many students are striking; the strikers
say it is tens of thousands, the administration says it is no more
than a few hundred. But there is no question that the campus is
theirs. Walls are plastered with posters and slogans and banners
flutter from trees. ``Now that we've risen,'' said one slogan
painted in rough brush strokes on a low breezeway, ``let's not
kneel again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The broad, green main campus south of the capital's center looks
deserted. But in several departments, groups of students and
professors were laboriously hashing out what it would take to get
things back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us didn't expect it to go on this long,'' said Gandhi
Bedoya Garcia, another philosophy student standing in the classroom
decorated with posters of Che Guevara and Emiliano Zapata where he
and Molina have been camping.
</P>
<P>
   Molina has been helping cook meals for his fellow students in
the kitchen of the philosophy department's cafeteria and, at night,
he and some of the others patrol the university roads to guard
against burglars. ``It's our university,'' Molina said, ``and we
have to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Faculty groups as well as an organization of professors emeritus
have tried to act as intermediaries with no success. Rafael Ibarra
Contreras, a chemistry professor and a member of a faculty group
that supports the strike, said it was hard to see how a compromise
would be reached. ``The administration is playing with words,'' he
said. ``wording their proposals carefully to protect their own
position.''

FBI LIMITED IN ABILITY TO PROBE HATE GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is no FBI file on the views of the Aryan
Nations, the neo-Nazi group whose members have said they are
``involved in a holy war.'' Nor are there FBI agents monitoring the
dozens of Web sites devoted to white supremacy _ even ones spewing
hatred of blacks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Attorney General Janet Reno deplored the ``culture
of violence'' that gave rise to Buford O. Furrow Jr., who was
charged Thursday with hate crimes in Tuesday's shooting spree near
Los Angeles, there were no plans to create an FBI system for
tracking hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The agency's own embarrassing history of
overzealousness and First Amendment protection of individual
rights.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials acknowledge a surge in domestic terrorism in
recent years, with the number of cases skyrocketing to 1,000 from
100 in 1993. Alarmed officials had responded to the trend with
force, reassigning 350 new agents to investigate such crimes long
before Furrow's rampage, in which he allegedly killed a
Filipino-American postal worker and wounded five others, including
three boys, at a Jewish community center.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI cannot target groups for investigation based on
their beliefs, at least not overtly. This restraint rests on the
belief that the government should respect free speech and not crack
down on groups or individuals who espouse unpopular ideas, unless
there is some criminal activity involved.
</P>
<P>
   So while fears of hate crimes mount and as federal officials
brace for potentially heightened violence around the millennium,
the notion of monitoring hate groups solely because of their
beliefs ``doesn't fit into our lexicon here,'' said FBI spokesman
Tron Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that you not focus on a group unless you have
a reasonable indication that they are engaged in criminal
conduct,'' Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for the federal government,'' said Eric
Ward of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, which
monitors hate organizations. ``Many people now feel frustrated,
because law enforcement is effectively restricted from monitoring
these groups. But the cost of that would be our civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions weren't always in place.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades ago, at the behest of then-director J.
Edgar Hoover, the FBI covertly tracked ideological groups _ mostly
liberal, political ones _ on the basis of their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Panthers, the American Indian Movement, and Students
for a Democratic Society were among the organizations monitored,
and even infiltrated, by a special FBI unit known as the Counter
Intelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, said Ward and other hate
crimes specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI came under intense criticism in the 1970s for the
practice, and following congressional hearings, two top FBI
officials were convicted of crimes related to the secret
investigation force. The agency ultimately instituted a set of
guidelines that forbids launching or classifying investigations in
a way that would violate the First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were severely chastised'' for COINTELPRO, said Brekke, the
FBI spokesman. ``There was not a necessary showing of criminal acts
on their part. There was an infiltration of their activities. Hence
the guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are widely hailed by civil liberties advocates.
But law enforcement officials have complained in the past of
feeling constrained. Such constraints exist even in cases like
those of Eric Rudolph and James Kopp, two of the suspects on the
FBI Most Wanted List, who are accused of hate crimes and affiliated
with hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   But being linked to a hate group is not sufficient for the FBI
to target the organization as well, Brekke said. If an individual
is acting alone, instead of under the imprimatur of the group, he
can be charged with a civil rights violation by the FBI's criminal
investigative division. But the group itself will not be monitored
unless there is compelling evidence it is plotting an act of
domestic terrorism. In that case, it would be tracked by a separate
FBI division dealing with national security, Brekke said.
</P>
<P>
   However, certain groups can still be under investigation. The
Order, a white supremacist group whose members have been convicted
of murders and bank robberies, has almost certainly been looked at
by the FBI in the context of crimes its members committed, not its
racist beliefs, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also works in tandem with outside nonprofit agencies
such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.
``Law enforcement agencies come to us every day with questions
about particular groups,'' said Mark Potok, a spokesman for the
center. ``I think the current division of labor is a good one, in
which the government has police powers but is precluded from
investigating groups merely because they have unpleasant views.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has urged Congress to adopt hate crimes legislation that
would bolster federal and state prosecutors' cases against people
accused of committing a crime based on bias. But she has not backed
down from the FBI's emphasis on protecting free speech. Even
Thursday, Reno said she had been reviewing the guidelines for
monitoring hate groups since she took office.
</P>
<P>
   Brekke added: ``We don't have files on every group that espouses
hate in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't deal in what people think, believe, say,'' Brekke
said. ``For every group that has a Web site, there is not a
corresponding FBI file. Talking about violence is a whole lot
different than actually taking the steps to do the violence. . .
. &UR;  &LR; There has to be some criminality or potential criminality
involved.''

CLINTON PUSHES FOR ACCELERATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to bolster the development of clean and
renewable energy, President Clinton ordered federal agencies
Thursday to begin a coordinated effort to accelerate the creation
of fuels from plant and agriculture wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, appearing before a panel of experts at the Department
of Agriculture, hailed biomass _ the conversation of trees and
crops into fuels and electricity _ as the energy alternative for
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   He equated the work being done today in the biomass field to the
work by William Meriem Burton, the Standard Oil chemist who
launched the petrochemical industry at the turn of the last
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``And on the verge of the 21st century, we may be nearing a
similar breakthrough, a technological fix that can help us to meet
our economic challenges, maintain our security, sustain our
prosperity and ease the threat of global warming. Science will be
the key to our progress,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president signed an executive order that established a
permanent council consisting of the chiefs of the energy,
agriculture and environmental protection departments as well as the
director of the National Science Foundation and other agency heads.
The council will develop a research program that will be presented
annually as part of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to triple the use of biomass energy, currently 3
percent of the fuel being used, by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The White House action also provided a backdrop for Vice
President Al Gore who spent the day campaigning in Iowa and talking
about the same technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, the Environmental Protection Administration
administrator, said biomass products also can be used to create
ink, paints and packing material that will decay and further reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, biomass is to the next century what petroleum
was to this century,'' Browner said. ``It is the next generation of
fuels and chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that corn-based ethanol alone can in 20 years replace
348 million barrels of imported oil. She said a new biomass
industry could provide thousands of jobs and generate $15 million
to $20 million in new income for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reicher, a Department of Energy deputy in charge of energy
efficiency and renewable resources, said the use of biomass
products has been increasing at the rate of 2 percent a year since
1990. However, he said the growth is currently too slow to meet
concerns about dependence on imported energy, air quality and
climate change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a strong industry-government partnership, greatly
fostered by today's executive order, we'll accelerate the uses of
waste agriculture products like corn stalks or rice straw or sugar
cane byproducts or a whole host of other waste to make
clean-burning ethanol for our cars,'' Reicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He said companies already are developing several plants,
including one in Louisiana that will convert sugar cane waste into
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term technical and economic objective is to make a
ton of biomass a viable market competitor to a barrel of imported
oil,'' Reicher said. ``In the next century, bio-refineries will
crack renewable carbon just like we do fossil carbon today.''

ANOTHER HASSELBECK TO LEAD BC FOOTBALL EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For the second time in three seasons, Boston College
football coach Tom O'Brien will have a Hasselbeck at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year on the job, O'Brien named Matt Hasselbeck, now
with the Green Bay Packers, as his starting quarterback. Thursday,
O'Brien announced that Tim Hasselbeck, Matt's younger brother, had
won the starting job over redshirt freshman Brian St. Pierre and
junior Dave Robbins and would be under center when the Eagles host
Baylor in the Sept. 4 season-opener at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel extremely confident in Tim's ability to lead our
football team,'' O'Brien said. ``He's an excellent quarterback, and
he knows our system well and he's had an outstanding spring. He's
talented and smart and we expect great things out of him. As I've
said before, the coaches were extremely pleased with all three kids
at quarterback, but we're looking to Tim now to accomplish our
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck, a 6-foot-2-inch, 212-pound junior from Norfolk, went
into the spring as the No. 1. In the end, he did nothing to hurt
his status.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it hurt Hasselbeck's candidacy that he ranked as the
most experienced quarterback on BC's roster, seeing action in six
games in last season's 4-7 campaign and completing 12 of 25 passes
for 174 yards and two touchdowns as Scott Mutryn's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that helped him in the process,'' O'Brien said. ``But I
don't think that has factored in, or has factored in the last three
years in making the decision on who's going to be quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came down to it, O'Brien said, the decision to go with
Hasselbeck was not based on any one factor. It was, rather, a
cumulative decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I've done in the past and what I continued to do
this year is that you go into spring practice and you evaluate what
you see on the field and look at the tapes when you're done and go
back and sift through all the information,'' O'Brien said. ``Then
you let it sit and everybody goes recruiting in May and then you
evaluate your football team. I had an idea, but it wasn't totally
confirmed in my mind what I thought I was going to do in this
situation and in a couple of other situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I go away on vacation and let it sit there and as we
come back from the summer we talk it out in our week of meetings.
Sometimes there are different thoughts and different things that
come up, but I still feel this is the way I want to go and that's
how I go about my decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he informed all three players of his decision
Wednesday. Unlike a year ago, when Hasselbeck appeared upset after
learning of O'Brien's decision to go with Mutryn during BC's Media
Day, Hasselbeck showed little, if any, emotion when he got the
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he thought it was coming,'' O'Brien said. ``But, no, he
didn't jump up and high-five me. No one in the previous two years
I've done this has showed any emotion; it's probably more of a sigh
of relief that, `Now the job is mine and I've got to keep it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for St. Pierre's reaction? ``Understandably, I'm sure that he
was disappointed,'' O'Brien said. ``Brian doesn't say much. He's
very quiet, so it's tough to get things out of him one way or
another. He just accepted it. Part of the conversation with him is
that he's got to realize that he's one play away from being the
starter. If he wasn't disappointed, I would've been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happened the last three years. Scott the first
year, Tim last year, and Brian this year. They were all
disappointed because they think they should be, and will be at some
point, the starting quarterback at Boston College.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, that job belongs to Hasselbeck, who will wear the
same number (7) that he and his brother wore at Xaverian.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said before, Brian's got the best job in America, because
he'll probably be the most popular guy in Boston by the middle of
the second quarter (against Baylor),'' O'Brien joked. ``But, as I
told Tim, he doesn't have to look over his shoulder. He's got his
job, but it's just like every other position on the field. He has
to maintain that job and maintain his position.''

NEW YORK AREA SCHOOLS TAKING STEPS TO AVOID SHOOTING TRAGEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCHOOL-SECURITY) 
(EDS: Spelling of `Randal' in byline is correct) 
(yn) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., have led school officials in the New York City metropolitan
area to reassess security and in some cases to make changes to
minimize threats.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme is West Hartford, Conn., where administrators
devised what they termed a ``lockdown'' drill in which students and
teachers, practicing in case there should be a shooting, lock all
doors and stay put until they are told that the police have
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But a more common reaction is that of New York City, where the
Police Department obtained blueprints of the 1,100 schools and
asked precinct commanders to work with principals and
superintendents on how to handle such an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the potential for violence at schools has weighed
heavily on many administrators and has generated forums for public
discussion in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have been
spared school shootings but not the heightened alarm.
</P>
<P>
   There were bomb threats in New York area schools after the April
20 shootings at Columbine High School, but no serious incidents
were reported. Shootings at New York City schools are rare; there
has not been a fatal one since February 1992, when two teenagers
involved in a feud over a gold bracelet were shot dead in the
hallway of Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn just moments
before Mayor David Dinkins was to arrive for a speech, said Karen
Crowe, a spokeswoman for the board. That shooting led to the
widespread use of metal detectors, now installed at 70 city
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Columbine, New York state officials are requiring
districts to report major violent acts _ bomb threats, explosions,
shootings _ to the state Department of Education within 48 hours of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation is designed to better track violence and help
raise awareness among school officials and the communities they
serve to the potential for violence, said Christopher Carpenter, a
spokesman for the department. He said school officials who failed
to comply could face disciplinary action by the state, which
licenses principals and superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a task force headed by Lt. Gov. Mary Donahue
has held public hearings across the state _ the final one was on
Wednesday _ to prepare a report for Gov. George Pataki on improving
school safety.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, New Jersey state officials convened public forums to
gather information toward a similar goal, and local districts in
Connecticut must report to Gov. John Rowland by September on how
they have improved security.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who work in schools are taking no chances. A
conference on Monday sponsored by the Connecticut Association of
Schools and Connecticut Center for School Change at Quinnipiac
College in Hamden included agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation instructing teachers on how to be good hostages. It
drew 225 people, the association's largest audience in four years.

 &HT;    Let's work together to defeat twin demons of gunplay, media
violence
 &HT;    By Mary McMarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's in a mother's DNA to be paranoid, to imagine
every worst possible scenario.
</P>
<P>
   I have a particular talent for this. After Oklahoma City, my
imagination worked overtime. When I drove my son to the Dayton
Jewish Community Center, where he attended preschool at the time,
the thought crossed my mind, ``What if it happened here? What if
some bigot targeted the JCC?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be preposterous,'' I scolded. ``Only you would imagine
such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, an armed guard stands in the lobby of the Dayton JCC,
a precaution against a copycat attack like the one against a Los
Angeles JCC child care center. Buford Furrow Jr. shot three
children and two adults as ``a wake-up call to America to kill
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Every other day in America, it seems, our most outrageous fears,
our most far-fetched movie plots, are becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
   I still believe my old fears were irrational. The Dayton JCC's
child care center is no less safe than anyplace else. The scariest
thing is that it could have happened anywhere. In any child care
center, restaurant or office complex.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN camera caught a photo of children linking hands, crossing
the street. The image is chilling because it is so ordinary, except
that police officers, not child care workers, form the links in
this chain of children.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if we will become immunized to this kind of scene, if
we will one day say, ``Oh, well, another one.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, that has already happened. The newspaper
headlines, the sidebars summarizing the summer's psychotic
rampages, no longer jolt us.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take for Congress to get serious about gun control?
Will it take something happening every day? Posting the Ten
Commandments in schools is hardly the kind of solution an
increasingly substantial majority of Americans are hungering for.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take for all of us to look seriously at our culture
of violence? A bizarre juxtaposition of news items last week
reminded us of just how low we have sunk: The government announced
it will pay the heirs of Abraham Zapruder $16 million for his film
of the Kennedy assassination; Marilyn Manson announced he is
holding back the video of his single ``Coma White'' _ which
includes a recreation of the assassination _ for the second time
(the first was after Littleton) because of JFK Jr.'s death.
</P>
<P>
   What sensitivity. What delicacy. Did it ever occur to Manson _
or to his record company _ not to release the video at all? Did it
ever occur to the Zapruder family _ whose initial asking price was
$30 million _ that it's obscene to make millions from a profound
national tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's only human nature that our resolve, and our
character, grow weak when large sums of money are involved. But as
voters and as consumers we have choices.
</P>
<P>
   We can boycott hyperviolent movies and music. We can make gun
control an issue at the polls. A Time/CNN poll showed that 59
percent of Americans would be more likely to vote for candidates
who favor stricter gun controls. And 76 percent think the federal
government should require handgun owners to register each handgun.
</P>
<P>
   We can work together to defeat the twin demons of gunplay and
media violence.
</P>
<P>
   Or we can wait for every town in America _ Jonesboro, Paducah,
Littleton _ to become a byword for unspeakable tragedy.

LIBERTY MUTUAL TO CUT JOBS, COSTS TO BOOST EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Liberty Mutual Group, the nation's largest workers
compensation insurer, announced plans Thursday to cut 1,500 jobs
and reduce costs by $150 million to boost declining earnings in its
commercial insurance operations.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said a ``commercial operations realignment''
will be completed in the next 45 days, but layoffs have already
begun. The expense reductions will take affect by the first quarter
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual President and CEO Edmund F. Kelly said the
layoffs and costs reductions are necessary for the company to
retain its position in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes will enable us to acheive greater focus and
scale in each of our chosen markets, enhance our ability to meet
commercial insurance buyer needs through whatever channel they
prefer, and improve our financial performance,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 new job cuts are in addition to hundreds of employee
layoffs that Liberty Mutual officials confirmed last week as part
of national effort to contain costs and consolidate operations.
Liberty Mutual employs 37,000 workers and manages more than $61
billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, who asked to remain anonymous, said that as many as
800 workers have lost their jobs during the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual spokesman John Cusolito said that number is not
accurate, ``but it is still too premature to come up with a precise
number.'' Company officials have not yet said how many
Massachusetts employees would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with increased competion and recent workers compensation
reform laws, profits at the Boston company have consitantly
declined during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's most recent annual report, Liberty
Mutual net income was nearly cut in half in 1998, falling from $412
million in 1997 to $245 million a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial property and casualty industry has been in a
prolonged period of price deflation,'' Kelly said. ``Industry-wide
results have been extremely poor, and there is no sign of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat some of the competition, Liberty Mutual initiated a
aggresive acquisition campaign during the past few years, aligning
with companies in Latin America, the United Kingdom, California,
Virginia, and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the current reorganization is to integrate
operations at Wausau Insurace Companies, a large Wisconsin workers
compensation company that Liberty Mutual acquired last year, with
those at the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Cusolito said positions will be lost ``across both
organizations.'' He said it was too early to know how many cuts
will be made in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pulling the best talent and the best practices from
both Liberty Mutual and Wausau,'' Cusolito said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual executives re-distributed a list of ``talking
points'' to senior managers at the company last week that state, in
part: ``Change is a way of business life. Liberty Mutual is not
immune to change. . . . This is not a special event. This is the
way we and others do business today.'' The list was originally
distributed last month when the national cost cutting measures were
first initiated.
</P>
<P>
   When Wausau, which claims to be the first insurer to write a
workers compensation policy, became a subsidiary of Liberty Mutual,
both comapny officials said the two organizations would maintain
separate operations. But Matthew Coyle, an analyst with Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp., said that restructuring was necessary to consolidate
the operations and increase profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the restructuring) is a great idea,'' Coyle said.
``Especially in today's market where pricing is soft and the only
legitimate way to lift profit margins is through internal cost
reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will combine Liberty Mutual's and Wausau's
national accounts into a single large account business unit to be
sold under the Liberty brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Middle market accounts will be separated into two units. Liberty
Mutual will manage direct sales and Wausau solely will be
responsible for operations through distribution agents and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Wausau will continue to operate it health benefits unit and the
Liberty Mutual brand will offer a newly created specialty Risks
unit to manage bond and property insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Mutual is still a strong company, Coyle said, but has
suffered due to competition and redundancies in staff from recent
acquisitions.

SPORTS COLUMN: RYDER CUP   DISSENSION:   SO WHAT!  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ They're the world's No. 1 and No. 2-ranked
golfers, but as the Ryder Cup runneth over with opinions on how to
use its finances, David Duval and Tiger Woods suddenly are public
enemy No. 1 and No. 2, or at least Ben Crenshaw's enemy No. 1 and
No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Duval realized that while walking to the 14th tee at the Medinah
Country Club Thursday when he heard a voice in the gallery call,
``Play for the love of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Duval was distracted. Despite a hooked drive into the
tall trees, he birdied that 583-yard, par-5 hole and shot a
2-under-par 70, as did Woods. Both are only two strokes off the
lead going into Friday's second round of the 81st Professional
Golfers' Association Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went out and played,'' Duval said later. ``When you're
inside the ropes, I think it's easy to forget about stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's heckler, of course, was alluding to the Ryder Cup
golfers' request in a Tuesday meeting that the PGA of America set
aside a substantial sum for charity in the name of each of the 12
U.S. pros in the Sept. 24-26 matches outside Boston against the
European team.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting provoked Crenshaw, the Ryder Cup captain, to being
``personally disappointed in a couple of people'' for their
viewpoints on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he was,'' Duval was saying now, when asked if
he thought Crenshaw had meant him, ``but when I called and asked
him, he said he was.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woods was asked about Crenshaw's outburst, rare for the
usually taciturn Texan, he said, ``He's the captain, and he's
concerned. I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's concern is that dissension, a word seldom heard in
golf, will disrupt the U.S. team not only over the finances, but
over the importance of the Ryder Cup matches. What irked Crenshaw
was Duval's earlier reference to the matches as an ``exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval acknowledged Thursday that ``exhibition might have been a
poor choice of words,'' but Woods reiterated that the Ryder Cup was
an exhibition, asking, ``Is there a winner's check?''
</P>
<P>
   Woods should know better than to think that a winner's check is
what defines a competition. His recent Monday night television
match with Duval, the so-called ``Showdown at Sherwood,'' had a
winner's check of $1.1 million (with $400,000 to the loser), but it
was the ultimate exhibition, a prime-time television show with no
real significance.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Ryder Cup has emerged as anything but an
exhibition. Even though the American golfers were really playing
for the PGA of America rather than for the United States, virtually
every one agreed that the stress was greater than in any of the
majors _ the Masters, the U.S. Open, British Open or the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Duval will be a Ryder Cup rookie this year; he has been on two
President's Cup teams against the International team from outside
Europe, winning in 1996 and losing last year. Woods was on the 1997
Ryder Cup team that lost to the Europeans at Valderrama, Spain, and
on the President's Cup team that lost in Australia last year.
</P>
<P>
   But when Duval was asked if dissension was the last thing this
year's Ryder Cup team needed, he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we need to be unified and be excited about playing,
which I, for one, am,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to it very
much. The European team is very good, very formidable. And
certainly if we don't get a little tighter than we, well, I
shouldn't say that. I think all the players are on the same page.
So we just need to get the juices going.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, admitting that ``my philosophy bubbled over''
Wednesday, minimized the possibility of dissension.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want, and what I'm sure I'm going to get,'' the captain
said, ``is 12 committed players.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if some dissension exists, it won't necessarily detract
from the golfers' Ryder Cup performance. The New York Knicks seemed
riddled by dissension before their recent run to the National
Basketball Association finals. The New York Yankees won the 1977,
1978, 1996 and 1998 World Series despite the turbulence created by
George Steinbrenner's mere presence.
</P>
<P>
   It's like David Duval said about his 2-under-par 70 Thursday:
When you're inside the ropes, it's easy to forget about stuff. &QL;

WILD CARD RACE GETTING DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The contenders and pretenders, charlatans and dreamers, in the
American League wild-card race should reveal themselves in the next
couple of weeks as the Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, Oakland A's, and
yes, even this weekend's guests, the Seattle Mariners, engage in a
round robin of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox returned home from a 5-2 swing through Anaheim and
Kansas City a half-game behind the Blue Jays, who were finally
cooled off Thursday by Minnesota and rookie Joe Mays, 3-0, and two
games ahead of the A's, who are in Toronto Friday night for the
start of a seven-game trip against the Jays and Sox, followed by
four more games against the Jays next weekend in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are coming off one of their best homestands in years, a
10-3 run in which they had more than 46,000 (over 20,000 walk-up
ticket-buyers) for the finale against the Yankees. Even though they
lost in the ninth, the A's, who added pitchers Omar Olivares and
Kevin Appier at the trading deadline, believe they're in this thing
to the finish, a small-market team with big ideas. It doesn't even
faze them that while they were on their hot streak, the Blue Jays
ran off nine wins in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely happy, we played extremely well and we showed
a lot of character,'' former Sox DH Matt Stairs said. ``We played
well with the Yankees, and even though we lost, the guys are not
unhappy. We still have a lot of confidence in this team, and now,
we get ready for Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have lost eight of nine games to the Red Sox, but
lately have been murder on everybody else. Manager Jim Fregosi
discovered a closer in Billy Koch, five-tool outfielder Shawn Green
is an MVP candidate, and first baseman Carlos Delgado exploded at
the plate, hitting eight home runs in six games, giving him 34 for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never quit,'' Delgado said. ``We go out there and we keep
swinging until the last out. It's a good attitude. No one gets down
on themselves. No one quits. We just keep going hard until it's
over. If we lose we talk about it, and then come back the next day
and try to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays added David Segui to play first base and left
field, but he's out with a hand injury. They recently picked up
center fielder Brian McRae in a waiver deal with the Rockies, which
should address their biggest need because of the poor play of Jose
Cruz Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And lately, Blue Jays followers say the club has been spending
more time tracking the surprising A's than the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire a team like that,'' catcher Darrin Fletcher said.
``They are a young organization that is in the bottom third of the
payroll list and I played with Matt Stairs in Montreal. They're
kind of a blue-collar team. They keep coming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher said he didn't expect the A's or Blue Jays to deliver a
knockout punch over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a lopsided winner in the two series we have
remaining with them, that could propel one of us into a nice
spot,'' said Fletcher. ``It's going to be important to hold your
own in that series. I think at this point in the season you just
try to avoid huge setbacks or strings of losses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners? They're still two games below .500 and seven games
behind the Sox, and made some trading-deadline trades (moving
veterans Segui and Butch Huskey) that would suggest they already
have 2000 in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Mariners remain a dangerous team that has shown
renewed signs of life since moving into their new outdoor palace,
Safeco Field. The Mariners ran off a six-game winning streak,
looked awful in losing four straight to the Yankees last weekend,
then rebounded to take three in a row against the White Sox before
arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners who are visiting Yawkey Way are claiming a
different identity than the homer-happy powerhouse that boasts
all-world players Ken Griffey and Alex Rodriguez. Junior and A-Rod
continue to do their thing, of course, but manager Lou Piniella has
actually begun to say a few good words about the M's pitching
staff, which has kept this team from the World Series the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do this darn thing here with pitching and
defense. It's coming along. The arms here have improved,'' Piniella
said this week. ``Unless you have a really productive farm system,
you have to do what we have done _ stock up some arms, start
building a pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   They've already used a club-record 26 pitchers this season, and
Jamie Moyer is the only one (with Jeff Fassero recently shunted to
the bullpen) who was in the starting rotation a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it feels like the team is really playing with
enthusiasm,'' said Rodriguez, who has had two five-RBI games in the
last five days. ``That's what I'm most proud of. That's what's
different between this year and last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, have a three-game set against the M's,
four with the A's, then head back on the road for a four-game
series against the Texas Rangers, leaders of the AL West. They
finally fattened up on teams with losing records in the Angels and
Royals, hitting 13 home runs in seven games and batting just under
.300 as a team, but the rotation remains shaky and closer Tim
Wakefield has had back-to-back blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   Their sternest test is still to come, in September, when their
longest trip of the season takes them to Oakland, Seattle, New
York, and Cleveland. Two division leaders and two teams that may
still have wild-card ideas.

GIFTS FOR CLINTON'S LEGAL DEFENSE FUND START TO SLOW TO A TRICKLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Md., Ark.)  (dal) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal defense fund has raised a
total of $6.3 million in 18 months, but the flow of checks has
slowed considerably in recent weeks, causing supporters to worry
that they will not be able to pay off the Clintons' entire debt
before the president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly half of the Clintons' $10.5 million in legal
bills has already been paid, the fund's administrators on Thursday
acknowledged that they would have to devise new fund-raising
strategies to try to retire the first family's enormous legal bills
before Clinton's term expired on Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters attributed the slowdown to the end of
the impeachment trial in February and the fact that Clinton's legal
troubles have faded from the headlines. They also said they had
discovered that it was difficult to compete with a dozen
presidential candidates, and the major parties, for contributions.
In the last five weeks, the fund received a total of $200,000, less
than half the usual take during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the country thinking that the president's troubles are
behind us after the impeachment trial, we started to see a downturn
and we expect it to continue,'' Anthony F. Essaye, the executive
director of the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The slackening of support could also reflect a growing fatigue
with the president. According to a Pew poll taken in April, 74
percent of Americans say they are tired of the problems associated
with the Clinton administration. Some Democratic fund-raisers have
acknowledged that Clinton's appearance at fund-raising events has
not commanded the same level of support as just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye denied the suggestion that the trust's contributions are
linked to a perception that the president, whose term has just over
17 months left, is a lame duck. ``I don't think that applies to
us,'' Essaye said, ``because the president cannot raise money for
the trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being formed by supporters of the president in February
1998, just weeks after the Monica Lewinsky scandal became public,
the trust has received 79,000 contributions from people in all 50
states and the District of Columbia. Most of the money was raised
in response to direct-mail solicitations, but Terence McAuliffe,
the prolific Democratic fund-raiser and one of the president's
closest friends, has raised most of the trust's large
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president's standing in many public opinion polls, the
trust's success is a measure of Clinton's popularity. Last year, an
avalanche of checks was received by the trust, exceeding all
expectations, while the president suffered through the Lewinsky
inquiry. The checks continued to pour in while the president was
impeached by the House and then acquitted by the Senate in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the trust's past success reflected the opinion among the
president's supporters that the congressional impeachment
proceedings and the inquiry by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, were deeply partisan and inherently unfair. In
solicitation letters, Starr was never mentioned by name, but the
Clintons' enormous debt was blamed on the viciousness of the
political climate in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   While the checks poured in last year, the president's legal
funds ballooned from $5 million to a total of $10.5 million. The
trust has paid $4.5 million to Clinton's lawyers at Williams &AMP;
Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the contributions have slowed, the trust's directors
are searching for creative ways to raise money. The trust may host
a fund-raising event, Essaye said. But he quickly wondered who the
marquee star of such an event would be. ``That is a factor to
consider _ how effective will an event be if the president and
first lady cannot participate?'' Essaye asked.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, he said, is a fund-raising concert. The trust
has received an outpouring of $10,000-checks from the Clintons'
friends in the entertainment industry, including film director
Steven Spielberg, Dreamworks executives David Geffen and Jeffrey
Katzenberg, actor Tom Hanks and performers Barbra Streisand, Tony
Bennett and Don Henley.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye said the trust had not been asked to pay the $90,000 fine
imposed on Clinton by a federal judge in Little Rock last month.
The judge concluded that Clinton had made untruthful statements
during his deposition in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by
Paula Jones. It is unlikely that the trust will be asked to pay the
fine, Essaye said, because the trust's revenues can only cover the
Clintons' attorneys' fees and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president to accept donations while in
office to help pay his lawyers' fees. President Richard Nixon
accepted donations to help defray legal costs after he resigned
from office, but he paid most of his legal bills himself.
</P>
<P>
   The trust's $6.3 million total eclipses the $1.3 million raised
over three and a half years by Clinton's original legal defense
fund, which was disbanded in December 1997. The original fund was
tainted by the campaign finance inquiry and hobbled by a strict
$1,000-a-year limit for individual donors. It had also received
$639,000, later returned, in questionable donations.
</P>
<P>
   The new trust was established independently of the Clintons. The
trust's founder, former Sen. David Pryoer of Arkansas, said, ``We
hope that our continued efforts will further reduce the expenses
owed by them, so the president and the first lady can continue
their public service unburdened by this debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributors can give a maximum of $10,000 each year. In 18
months, the trust has received 158 checks for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, Geffen and Katzenberg have given $10,000 to the trust
this year and last year. Other two-time, $10,000 contributors are
also big-money contributors to the Democratic National Committee.
The list includes Smith Bagley, a wealthy grandson of the tobacco
magnate R.J. Reynolds; Ronald Burkle, the California supermarket
mogul; Ely Callaway, the chairman of Callaway Golf; David Chang,
senior adviser of Panacom; Thomas P. O'Brien, chairman of Tectrade
International; Sol Price, a retired investor of La Jolla, Calif.;
Alan D. Solomont, a Newton, Mass., entrepreneur; Thomas O. Stanley
and Edmund A. Stanley Jr., both of whom are retired and living in
Oxford, Md.; S. Donald Sussman, chairman of Paloma Partners, a
hedge fund; Edward Z. Tabash, a Beverly Hills lawyer, and Chiao Jen
Wang, an executive at International Corp. of America.
</P>
<P>
   The average check received by the trust was $80. About 95
percent of the contributions were less than $100. And the smallest
contribution received by the trust was 50 cents.

SUSPECT IN COMMUNITY CENTER SHOOTING CONFESSES TO POSTMAN'S
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In chilling detail, Buford O. Furrow Jr., the
suspect in a shooting on Tuesday at a Jewish Community Center here,
has confessed that he shot a Filipino-American letter carrier the
same day because he was a nonwhite ``target of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He told investigators that he was driving down a quiet
residential street in a Toyota he had hijacked when he spotted the
letter carrier, 39-year-old Joseph Santos Ileto, in his uniform,
stuffing letters into a mailbox next to his mail truck.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow said he thought Ileto was Hispanic or Asian, so he
stopped his car and asked Ileto if he would mail a letter. Ileto
agreed. Furrow then pulled a Glock Model 26 pistol from his back
pocket and shot Ileto twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stated that the mail carrier bent over and attempted to run
away,'' said a criminal complaint filed on Wednesday but unsealed
Thursday morning. ``He then shot the mail carrier a few times in
the back until he saw the mail carrier fall to the ground face
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ileto was shot at point-blank range nine times.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint added that five of the nine shots that hit Ileto
were considered fatal by the coroner. Both the federal and the
state charges filed Thursday for that murder could bring the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state prosecutors on Thursday charged Furrow, a
white supremacist, with capital murder and other felony counts.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, made an initial appearance before a federal
magistrate Thursday and was denied bail, but the relaxed-looking,
heavyset man in prison blues, handcuffs and manacles stood in
stunning contrast to the cold-blooded, racist murderer described by
both the U.S. attorney and the Los Angeles district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with close-cropped hair, a
mustache and wire-rimmed, aviator-style glasses sliding down his
nose, shuffled into the courtroom so quietly at precisely 11 a.m.
that few of the several dozen reporters present seemed to notice
him initially. He tersely answered a few procedural questions posed
by the federal magistrate, Carolyn Turchin, and spoke up only once
during the seven-minute hearing, to correct her when she read his
name, adding ``Junior'' after she had said Buford Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to fill in details of Furrow's violent rampage
here on Tuesday, the authorities only deepened the mystery of how
Furrow, a well-known member of white supremacist groups and a
convicted felon, could have amassed the huge arsenal of weapons he
brought here and how he financed his murderous expedition to Los
Angeles from his home in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   He was believed to be unemployed with a history of losing jobs,
but he used at least $4,000 to buy a van last Saturday. He then
spent $800 on a taxi ride to the Nevada border, where he then
caught a second taxi to Las Vegas. Law enforcement officials said
they would not comment on whether they have evidence that he
received financial or other kinds of assistance from anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings began at about 10:49 a.m. Tuesday, when Furrow,
according to charges, entered the North Valley Jewish Community
Center in the Granada Hills section of Los Angeles and fired at
least 70 shots with an Uzi submachine gun, hitting five people,
including three children at a day camp. All five are now
recovering, although one 5-year-old boy was still listed in
critical condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Burford then fled in his van, parked it and then carjacked the
Toyota, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that the murder was racially motivated,''
said Alejandro Mayorkas, the U.S. attorney here.
</P>
<P>
   Another puzzling element was added Thursday when the taxi
company whose driver transported Furrow to Las Vegas after the
shootings said here that Furrow had hailed the taxi near the heart
of Hollywood, some 15 miles from where he had abandoned the stolen
Toyota after shooting Ileto. Somehow he managed to cover that
distance in spite of a massive police dragnet near the scene of the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Konopov of Independent Taxi Co. said that a driver,
Hovik Garibyan, had picked up Furrow near the corner of Sunset Blvd
and Cherokee St. Furrow initially asked to be taken to the airport,
Konopov said, then said he was afraid of flying and asked instead
to be taken to Las Vegas. A price of $800 was negotiated. Furrow
paid with $100 and $50 bills, and then slept most of the four-hour
drive, before being dropped off at the New York New York Casino.
Police would not comment on what they know of how Furrow got to
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising serious concerns about a broader
conspiracy, the shootings intensified the debate over gun control.
Furrow had such a large arsenal _ it included handguns, an assault
rifle, hand grenades and thousands of rounds of ammunition _ that
police had said earlier that they felt lucky more people had not
been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton commented on the shootings on Thursday,
calling them ``another compelling argument for the passage of hate
crimes legislation and the common-sense gun legislation.'' Law
enforcement officials have not yet said how they believe Furrow
obtained the weapons or announced the results of any tracing they
may have done of the origins of the guns.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint unsealed Thursday listed two charges, the
premeditated murder of a federal employee in the performance of his
duties, and the illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon. Furrow had been convicted of assault in Washington state.
Mayorkas said Furrow could face other federal charges later. His
next hearing on the federal charges is scheduled for Aug. 24.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A press conference Thursday morning was held jointly by Mayorkas
and the district attorney, Gil Garcetti, who separately filed a
seven-count complaint against Furrow, including the hate-motivated
murder of Ileto, the attempted murder of the five people at the
Jewish community center, and carjacking. The state murder charge
could also bring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials did their best to present a unified
front, since there had been a behind-the-scenes struggle between
the U.S. attorney's office and the district attorney over who would
charge and try Furrow first. Those issues remained unresolved
Thursday, but at the press conference Garcetti said a joint task
force had been formed to continue the investigation and to
determine when and where Furrow would ultimately be tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to continue working together to insure that justice
is served,'' said Garcetti, who added that he expected Furrow to be
arraigned on the state charges within the next few days.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is the year's other war. While the nation's
attention has focused on Kosovo, American warplanes have quietly,
methodically and with virtually no public discussion been attacking
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past eight months, American and British pilots have
fired more than 1,100 missiles against 359 targets.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than triple the targets attacked in four furious
days of strikes in December that followed Iraq's expulsion of U.N.
weapons inspectors, an assault that provoked an international
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   By another measure, the pilots have flown some two-thirds as
many missions as NATO pilots flew over Yugoslavia in 78 days of
around-the-clock war there.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes, including ones as recently as Tuesday, have done
nothing to deter Iraqi gunners from firing on American and British
planes patrolling the ``no flight'' zones over northern and
southern Iraq. They, like officials in Baghdad, are acting as
defiant as ever. And there appears to be no end in sight to the war
_ to the surprise and chagrin of some administration and Pentagon
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle of tit-for-tat skirmishes has gone on so long that the
administration is debating whether to intensify its attacks,
expanding the list of targets to include more significant military
targets, from air defenses to things like bases and headquarters,
as long as Iraq fires at American and British jets, according to
senior Administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not made a decision, but within the
administration, some hawkish officials have argued that broader,
more punishing strikes would deter the Iraqis and do more to weaken
President Saddam Hussein's government, the officials said. On the
other hand, a tougher stand could also draw attention to strikes
that have generated little opposition at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our use of force so far has not risen to a threshold to cause
international concern,'' especially among Arab allies in the
Persian Gulf, one senior official said. ``Disproportionate
responses might.''
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed for much of the year by the war in the Balkans, the
administration's policy toward Iraq is increasingly facing
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of prominent senators and
congressmen sent a letter to Clinton scolding him for what they
called ``the continued drift'' in the administration's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While they expressed support for the strikes, they called on
Clinton to give Iraq a new deadline to comply with U.N. inspections
and threaten ``serious consequences'' if Saddam refuses, including
more potent air strikes throughout Iraq and an expansion of the
``no flight'' zones. They also called for increased support,
including military aid, to Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott
of Mississippi; Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Richard Shelby
of Alabama and Sam Brownback of Kansas, all Republicans; Sens.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both
Democrats; Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and Rep. Howard Berman,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials defend their policy _
including the unending air strikes _ as a firm, but measured effort
to isolate Saddam and weaken his armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   They concede, however, that the Iraqis have proved more
resilient than expected. They have quickly repaired damage done to
air-defense weapons, forcing the Americans to bomb some targets
over and over. They have even rebuilt some of the factories,
barracks and other sites destroyed in December's raids, including
buildings at the Al Taji missile complex, one of the critical
targets, according to Defense officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern is Iraq's ability to rebuild its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, programs that Saddam pledged to
halt as part of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war in
1991. In their letter, the lawmakers said there was ``considerable
evidence'' that Iraq continued to pursue those weapons, though
neither they nor their aides elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and Pentagon officials maintain there is no
evidence of that, but without international inspections, some
acknowledged, there is little to stop Saddam's government from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've very concerned,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who
served as the chief American representative at the United Nations
during last year's confrontation, told reporters on Wednesday. ``My
experience with the Iraqis is if you give them an inch, they take a
mile.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the administration is quietly supporting a draft
U.N. Security Council resolution by Britain and the Netherlands to
renew the international weapons inspections. That resolution, which
would create a new inspection agency to replace the United Nations
Special Commission, is expected to go before the council in
September but still lacks support from France, Russia and China,
which have veto power.
</P>
<P>
   Without some inspections, the patrols of the ``no flight'' zones
remain the core of the administration's effort to contain Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies created the zones _ north of
the 36th parallel and south of the 33rd _ in the years after the
Persian Gulf war to protect ethnic populations long repressed by
Saddam's government. Iraq has never recognized the zones, but
rarely challenged allied patrols of them.
</P>
<P>
   After December's raids, however, Saddam declared the zones a
violation of Iraq's sovereignty, and his troops have made good on
threats to challenge them. Iraqi MiG jets dart in and out of the
zones. Missile radars have tracked allied patrols and gunners have
fired anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles at them.
</P>
<P>
   American and British warplanes respond when challenged, though
not every time. Every few days, in almost numbing routine, they
have struck missile sites, radar stations and radio towers across
both the northern and southern zones. Since late July, there has
been a new flurry of strikes in response to newly vigorous Iraqi
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday alone, American A-10s and F-16s based in Kuwait or
Saudi Arabia and F-14s and F-18s aboard the aircraft carrier
Theodore Roosevelt attacked three anti-aircraft artillery batteries
and two radar sites in southern Iraq, while F-16s and F-15s based
in Turkey went after two communication centers in the north. Those
attacks followed heavy strikes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says the air strikes are merely defensive responses
to the provocations, meant to protect the pilots. But the targets
American and British pilots strike are often not the ones that
directly threaten them, especially since Iraq has placed many of
its weapons in places the Pentagon says is meant to put Iraqi
civilians at risk. When Iraqi forces fired an anti-aircraft battery
on Tuesday, they did so from downtown Mosul.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. David Deptula, who commands the patrols over northern
Iraq from the air base in Incirlik, Turkey, said the strikes could
stop at any time, as soon as Iraq stopped challenging the zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam really is in control over whether or not we drop any
weapons over his country,'' Deptula said in a telephone interview.
``We didn't for six years'' before December.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in tempo, the fighting over the zones is
costing upwards of $1 billion a year, though Pentagon officials say
it is difficult to fix an exact cost. More than 200 aircraft, 19
warships and 22,000 American troops are devoted to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The officials acknowledge that the strikes alone will not topple
Saddam, even though the White House has openly called for the
overthrow of his government and promised nominal support to
opposition figures. That has led to frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been kept in check,'' one Defense official said. ``But
the question is: Have you met any of your long-term goals? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that until a change in
government occurs, containment was the only viable policy at this
time, politically and diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither this administration, nor this Congress, nor any other
country is prepared to take the measures that would be truly
necessary to ensure there was a change of regime,'' the official
said. ``If you want to go beyond containment, you have to put your
money where your mouth is. And that means ground troops.''

VENEZUELA LEADER CLOSE TO TIGHTENING HIS AUTHORITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Venezuela's newly empowered
Constitutional Assembly on Thursday night discussed declaring a
national emergency. The message, which seems assured of passage,
will strengthen the authority of President Hugo Chavez and give the
assembly far-reaching authority to abolish government institutions
and dismiss officials.
</P>
<P>
   With the measure under discussion, which cites the ``exhaustion,
collapse and loss of legitimacy'' of the political and
administrative structure, the assembly will be giving itself the
right to ``decree measures pertaining to the competency,
functioning and organization'' of public bodies. No date is set for
the end of the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, a former paratrooper who led an unsuccessful coup
attempt in 1992, took office in February vowing to carry out a
peaceful social revolution. His critics maintain that his real aim
is to impose a left-wing military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly, which was sworn in last week, has six months to
write a constitution to replace the current 1961 version. Chavez
urged the representatives to speed their work so a referendum could
be held by year's end. He has submitted a draft constitution that
would expand his term to six years, and allow him to compete for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the decree will allow the assembly to dissolve even
the Congress and the Supreme Court, as Chavez repeatedly threatened
to do before the special election on July 31 that picked 131
assembly delegates. Seeking to avoid such a confrontation, Congress
has gone into recess until October and offered to let the new body
meet in the capital building.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members have made it clear that they intend to resolve
hundreds of cases involving lower-court judges accused of taking or
demanding bribes. They have also called for the dismissal of
several elected state governors and mayors, many of them opponents
of Chavez, whom they maintain are corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Acting in accordance with his argument that all other government
organs are subordinate to the new assembly, Chavez even volunteered
to resign as president.
</P>
<P>
   But to no one's surprise, his offer was rejected, and Thursday
afternoon he took his oath of office again before the body,
delivering a speech in which he spoke of a deepening economic
crisis and denounced what he called ``an international campaign
against Venezuela'' and its 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Chavez, including his wife, a brother and a half
dozen members of his cabinet, occupy 120 of the 131 seats in the
all-powerful body. Three other seats are reserved for
representatives of the Indian tribes, meaning that supporters of
Venezuela's two usual political parties and other members of the
opposition hold only eight seats.
</P>
<P>
   One of those critics, a lawyer, Alan Brewer Carias, described
the emergency-powers measure as too broadly drawn and likely to
cause alarm abroad because, ``at the level of international law, it
is the equivalent of declaring a state of siege.''
</P>
<P>
   But Isaias Rodriguez, a vice president of the assembly,
dismissed such concerns, describing the document as merely ``a
declaration of competence to deal with national problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was contradicted, though, by another pro-Chavez
delegate, Hermann Escarra, a constitutional law professor, who said
the new body has ``the duty and mission to substitute existing
powers that have been gravely delegitimized.'' &QL;

HEAT TAKES TOLL ON UTILITY COMPANIES AS `ROLLING BLACKOUTS' HIT

<P>
   DALLAS _ While Dallas and Fort Worth may have been hit hardest
by searing temperatures, the demand for air conditioning across the
state has sent ``rolling blackouts'' rippling from Brownsville to
Houston to Abilene as utility companies struggle to meet power
demands.
</P>
<P>
   At least four major businesses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
where temperatures have reached triple-digits for 17 consecutive
days, either closed down for parts of Tuesday and Wednesday or
stayed open in sauna conditions after TXU curtailed their
electrical service.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Market Center reduced its power consumption Tuesday
and closed all of its buildings at 1 p.m. Wednesday. More than
2,000 workers were sent home.
</P>
<P>
   The Market Center, like 230 other businesses in the Dallas area,
have ``interruptible'' contracts with TXU. In exchange for
discounted rates, they agree to service cutbacks during problem
periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under that agreement, we can buy around a cutback,'' said Bill
Winsor, president and CEO of the Market Center. ``We pay a premium,
but we keep the electricity running. They wouldn't let us do that
Wednesday. We're challenging them on that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the same contract, John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth
saves about $400,000 on electricity each year and uses its own
backup cooling units when normal power is curtailed. On Wednesday,
its backups failed and the hospital was without air conditioning
for about four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will now be sure that we are able to bring the other
systems on line and back up much more quickly,'' said Larry
Franklin of JPS Health Network.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Texas Industries Inc. closed its three largest North
Texas plants for four hours and closed its steel mill in
Midlothian, south of Dallas, for nearly three hours Wednesday.
Nearly 1,500 workers were affected.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, air conditioning at the General Motors assembly
plant was shut down, but work continued.
</P>
<P>
   Similar incidents have occurred throughout the state:
</P>
<P>
   _ Power to production lines at the Kelly-Springfield Tire Co.
factory in Tyler was cut off for several hours Tuesday and
Wednesday. Power curbs also were imposed at parts of the Broadway
Square Mall and the Trane Co. air conditioner factory in Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Abileen water department shut down one of its electrical
supply pumps after West Texas Utilities' Oklaunion power plant near
Vernon failed Monday and company officials issued a call for
customers to conserve power.
</P>
<P>
   _ Power to some parts of Brownsville was curtailed during the
afternoon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Reliant HL&AMP;P also has been curbing power to
customers with ``interruptible'' contracts. Reliant HL&AMP;P has
generating capacity of 13,960 megawatts, but had to buy power from
other sources this week when demand exceeded 14,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   The utility company would not disclose which customers had been
affected, but BP Amoco apparently was one of them. Pat Wright, a
spokeswoman, said service to the company's Chocolate Bayou
petrochemical plant near Alvin was curtailed for about four hours
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy, which serves much of the area to the east of Houston,
and Central Power and Light, which serves much of the coastal areas
south of Houston, also have curtailed power to large industrial
users, according to officials at both companies.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks come as a result of an emergency advisory issued by
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the group of utilities
and power producers which runs the state's ``grid'' of wires and
switches that move power from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   ERCOT has eight stages of emergency conditions, with eight being
the highest. According to spokeswoman Leticia Lowe, Reliant HL&AMP;P
was at condition one, a short supply advisory, Thursday. If ERCOT
moved the company up to condition two, further restrictions would
be imposed to prevent a possible blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Under condition one, utility companies must retain at least 15
per cent of its generating capacity in reserve for peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   Interruptible customers come in different classes, based on the
amount of notice required before power is curtailed. Entergy
spokeswoman Carol Clawson said her company so far has had to cut
power only to those with the longest notice time required.
</P>
<P>
   Although this summer's heatwave has not been as prolonged as
last year's, when there were 56 days of 100-degree plus
temperatures logged in North Texas, population growth and a booming
economy have created demands that have severely taxed the grid's
capacity to move electricity.
</P>
<P>
   TXU spokeswoman Sandy Smith said the cutbacks Tuesday and
Wednesday were, ``problems with transmission on the grid.``
</P>
<P>
   Kent Saathoff of ERCOT agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing system was not built to handle the load it is
being asked to carry,'' he said. ``We have recommended some
transmission projects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical situation,'' Michael Mach, of the National
Weather Service in Fort Worth, said of the wilting weather. ``Just
typical weather patterns for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there is no sign that the high pressure system parked
over Texas and holding cooling rains at bay is about to be
dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no storm systems to weaken or move it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County recorded its fifth heat-related death Monday and
area towns have begun to curb lawn watering and outdoor burning.
</P>
<P>
   The mild, wet spring that promised to ward off another brutal
summer in Texas may have actually made it worse, Mach said.
</P>
<P>
   Grasses and foliage fed by the spring rains grew tall and lush.
Now, they have turned brown and brittle, the stuff of wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything south of the Red River is a fire danger,'' he said.

   ``We will now be sure that we are able to bring the other
systems on line and back up much more quickly,'' said Larry
Franklin of JPS Health Network.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Texas Industries Inc. closed its three largest North
Texas plants for four hours and closed its steel mill in
Midlothian, south of Dallas, for nearly three hours Wednesday.
Nearly 1,500 workers were affected.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, air conditioning at the General Motors assembly
plant was shut down, but work continued.
</P>
<P>
   Similar incidents have occurred throughout the state:
</P>
<P>
   _ Power to production lines at the Kelly-Springfield Tire Co.
factory in Tyler was cut off for several hours Tuesday and
Wednesday. Power curbs also were imposed at parts of the Broadway
Square Mall and the Trane Co. air conditioner factory in Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Abileen water department shut down one of its electrical
supply pumps after West Texas Utilities' Oklaunion power plant near
Vernon failed Monday and company officials issued a call for
customers to conserve power.
</P>
<P>
   _ Power to some parts of Brownsville was curtailed during the
afternoon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Reliant HL&AMP;P also has been curbing power to
customers with ``interruptible'' contracts. Reliant HL&AMP;P has
generating capacity of 13,960 megawatts, but had to buy power from
other sources this week when demand exceeded 14,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   The utility company would not disclose which customers had been
affected, but BP Amoco apparently was one of them. Pat Wright, a
spokeswoman, said service to the company's Chocolate Bayou
petrochemical plant near Alvin was curtailed for about four hours
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy, which serves much of the area to the east of Houston,
and Central Power and Light, which serves much of the coastal areas
south of Houston, also have curtailed power to large industrial
users, according to officials at both companies.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks come as a result of an emergency advisory issued by
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the group of utilities
and power producers which runs the state's ``grid'' of wires and
switches that move power from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   ERCOT has eight stages of emergency conditions, with eight being
the highest. According to spokeswoman Leticia Lowe, Reliant HL&AMP;P
was at condition one, a short supply advisory, Thursday. If ERCOT
moved the company up to condition two, further restrictions would
be imposed to prevent a possible blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Under condition one, utility companies must retain at least 15
per cent of its generating capacity in reserve for peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   Interruptible customers come in different classes, based on the
amount of notice required before power is curtailed. Entergy
spokeswoman Carol Clawson said her company so far has had to cut
power only to those with the longest notice time required.
</P>
<P>
   Although this summer's heatwave has not been as prolonged as
last year's, when there were 56 days of 100-degree plus
temperatures logged in North Texas, population growth and a booming
economy have created demands that have severely taxed the grid's
capacity to move electricity.
</P>
<P>
   TXU spokeswoman Sandy Smith said the cutbacks Tuesday and
Wednesday were, ``problems with transmission on the grid.``
</P>
<P>
   Kent Saathoff of ERCOT agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing system was not built to handle the load it is
being asked to carry,'' he said. ``We have recommended some
transmission projects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical situation,'' Michael Mach, of the National
Weather Service in Fort Worth, said of the wilting weather. ``Just
typical weather patterns for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there is no sign that the high pressure system parked
over Texas and holding cooling rains at bay is about to be
dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no storm systems to weaken or move it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County recorded its fifth heat-related death Monday and
area towns have begun to curb lawn watering and outdoor burning.
</P>
<P>
   The mild, wet spring that promised to ward off another brutal
summer in Texas may have actually made it worse, Mach said.
</P>
<P>
   Grasses and foliage fed by the spring rains grew tall and lush.
Now, they have turned brown and brittle, the stuff of wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything south of the Red River is a fire danger,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite regulatory concern about the world of day trading, some
of the nation's leading investment and securities firms have held
talks in recent months with a number of day-trading firms.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, Lehman Brothers and Instinet, a division
of Reuters Group, have discussed adopting the software platforms of
day-trading firms, forming alliances with them or making outright
acquisitions, according to several executives who were briefed on
the meetings. Executives at the three firms declined to comment on
any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Why would big firms want to get involved in such a small
industry with a poor reputation and an uncertain future?
</P>
<P>
   The electronic trading boom is forcing them to look for cheaper
and more efficient trading formats. Day-trading firms, which in the
1980s and 1990s paved the way to faster and cheaper trading that
rankled the powers on Wall Street, now have critical experience
developing and using advanced trading and trade-routing software,
systems that could someday give all investors instant access to the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   To be clear, Wall Street firms have little or no interest in the
computer-jammed offices where day traders converge to make
rapid-fire trades. Instead, they want the software and in some
cases the transaction volume generated by these smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
   People briefed on the talks say that the big firms are moving
gingerly because of the day-trading industry's recent spate of bad
publicity, including the shootings in Atlanta by a disgruntled
trader, Mark O. Barton. Just this week, state securities regulators
blasted day-trading firms for misleading naive investors into the
risky world of rapid-fire trading.
</P>
<P>
   The day-trading firms at the center of the talks have largely
avoided regulatory fines and are best known for their software
development and relatively heavy trading volumes. Broadway Trading,
Tradescape.com and Cybercorp, all privately held companies, have
each been approached in recent months by companies interested in
buying a stake or acquiring the firms, executives close to the
talks said. The three firms declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although some industry officials warn that Wall Street firms may
be talking to day-trading firms simply to gain valuable insights
about their technology, a deal between a major broker and one or
two day-trading outfits is expected within a few weeks. At least
one offer has been made, by Lehman Brothers to acquire Cybercorp,
according to someone briefed on the proposal. A major online broker
is also bidding to acquire a day-trading firm, industry executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day-trading firms clearly understand the notion of faster,
smarter, better technology,'' said Henry H. McVeigh, who covers
online brokers at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``So while it's taboo
to be associated with a day-trading firm, the technology they have
is extremely sophisticated and it can be leveraged.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of orders to buy and sell stocks is also
appealing to some of the bigger firms in the talks. With most
financial services companies scrambling to find the right system
and the right platform, the number of trading venues has
multiplied. The new systems need liquidity, or heavy trading
volume, to assure that investors can get good prices for their
trades. And that is where day trading firms come into play. ``The
key battle is going to be over order flow,'' said McVeigh of Morgan
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, a unit of FMR, has said in recent months
that it would like to attract more active traders, or those who
trade more than 36 times a year. Although its Fidelity Brokerage
Services unit has nearly 3 million accounts, the unit's trading
activity lags behind that of ETrade, which has fewer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity executives see faster and more efficient trading
systems as a way to lure active investors, though they say they are
not searching out day traders. ``We talk to a lot of companies
about what technology is out there,'' said Robert P. Mazzarella,
president of Fidelity Brokerage Services. We just launched our
active trader Web site. ``We want to improve the experience and
help people trade quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Bros., an institutional brokerage firm that has talked to
two day-trading firms, is seeking to improve and upgrade its
institutional trading systems, executives briefed on the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, an electronic network that leads in institutional and
after-hours trading, said last May that it was interested in
breaking into the booming retail market of online trading. It has
held talks with Cybercorp and Tradescape, according to people
briefed on the talks. Such a deal would give Instinet additional
day-trading volume for its electronic communications network, which
competes against the Island ECN, a network widely used by day
traders and developed by Datek Online Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been briefed say that at least one large online
broker talked with Broadway Trading in New York about buying all or
part of the company before talks broke down. Broadway does not
employ its own proprietary software; it uses a platform called the
Watcher, which was developed by Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Tradescape in New York and Cybercorp in Austin, Texas, are
generally considered the most attractive targets, largely because
of their software capabilities. Each company has developed
proprietary software that can be used on the Internet to trade and
get more direct access to the stock market. Tradescape recently
announced a merger with Momentum Securities in Houston, making it
perhaps the nation's largest day-trading firm in trading volume.
Softbank, an early investor in ETrade and Yahoo, recently agreed to
invest $40 million in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Though executives at Tradescape and Cybercorp declined comment
on any talks, they acknowledged that everyone is talking to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the largest Wall Street firms recognize they were
blind-sided by the electronic execution technology,'' said Philip
Berber, chief executive at Cybercorp. ``Primarily these firms want
to save themselves two years of time and tens of millions of
dollars that it would take to recreate this technology.''
</P>
<P>
   They also want to gain order flow at a time when more and more
trading activity is taking place outside the purview of major Wall
Street brokerage firms or even the major stock exchanges, such as
the Nasdaq stock market. Electronic communications networks are
gobbling up a growing share of the marketplace, and firms want to
make sure they do not miss out. The firms say they have technology
that works with ECNs to hunt for the best price.
</P>
<P>
   In turning to day-trading firms, the major Wall Street firms are
imitating a model developed by Datek Online, which got its start as
a day-trading firm and later developed fast execution and
trade-routing technology that spawned the Island ECN, which is
heavily used by Broadway Trading, Tradescape and Heartland
Securities, a day-trading unit that was spun off of Datek in 1998
amid regulatory questions and investigations of its trading
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Datek is considered a pioneer in developing technology
for day trading and transferring that technology to more mainstream
applications, a knack that has made it one of the nation's
fastest-growing online brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading, which has been driven by the opportunity of
fantastic profits during a stunning bull market, now appears to be
evolving again. Wall Street analysts and day-trading officials say
many former professional traders, brokers and financial services
professionals are quitting their jobs to work full-time as day
traders or money managers from home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Most people with online accounts now e-mail an order to the
online broker, who then routs the order, often selling it to Wall
Street wholesalers, who execute the trades. The future lies in
faster, cheaper, quicker access to the markets, which will create a
bulge in online brokers. Perhaps, the technology visionaries say,
online brokerage firms will then hire sales forces and money
managers, who can work from home offices trading accounts for their
customers. It would be a virtual retail brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The whole concept of direct access to the markets is coming out
of day trading, said James H. Lee, head of the Electronic Traders
Association and president of Momentum Securities. ``That's why we
see some of this hysteria,'' he said. ``It rocks right to the core
of the Wall Street establishment.''

 &HT;    Dodgers' disarray: From big plans to big flop
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Chavez Ravine, where you can't tell your crises
without a scorecard, the catcher still can't throw. The right
fielder wants the next plane out. The first baseman sounds like
he's right behind him. The second baseman is on rehab assignment
but doesn't sound so keen about coming back.
</P>
<P>
   The second and third starters have given up 50 home runs. The
rookie third baseman can't field. The team can't win. The city
can't understand. The manager can't wait for this season to end so
he can start working on the next, which is just what Davey Johnson
implied about the wreck that Los Angeles' 1999 has become when he
announced that he will start playing the whole roster from now on,
for scouting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go into a meeting this winter,'' Johnson said,
``and have someone say, 'This guy can't do this,' or, 'This guy
can't do that,' because I didn't give him the opportunity to show
us, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves open a three-game series tonight in L.A.,
where the baseball landscape is so blighted that all that's missing
are the locusts. New general manager Kevin Malone, who shouted all
winter that the Dodgers had re-invented the diamond, found himself
saying this during the week, ``Anyone who isn't on the same page
isn't going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   That came after right fielder Raul Mondesi demanded a trade,
saying, ``They try to put all of our problems on me. They're trying
to say that all this is my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't true. There is a bumper crop of blame here. Catcher
Todd Hundley's elbow is so bad he has thrown out only 18.4 percent
of stolen-base attempts and also leads all catchers with 14 errors.
First baseman Eric Karros grew so worried about his name flying
through trade rumors that he said, ``Get me out of here or shut it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Eric Young, on rehab assignment, might rejoin the
Dodgers for the Braves series, but he groused when his bad ankle
landed him on the DL that he was tired of being Johnson's
scapegoat. Ismael Valdes and Chan Ho Park have given up 50 homers,
tied with Florida's Brian Meadows and Dennis Springer for most by
an NL teammates. Rookie Adrian Beltre's 19 errors are
second-highest among NL third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Demigod Tommy Lasorda has called them ``an embarrassment.'' The
Fox Group has dispatched a suit named Rick Welts, a division
president, to assess the mess. Someone surely is going to get fired
during the winter, quite possibly team president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Malone was thought an odd fit in baseball circles
when Fox brought him on board as GM. His previous primary
accomplishment was running the excellent 1994 Montreal Expos, a
team that he inherited from the departed Dan Duquette _ and which
had put together by departed super-scout Gary Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   All Malone really did for the Expos was dismantle them under
orders after the 1994-95 strike, before bouncing to an assistant's
job in Baltimore and then in September becoming just the sixth
Dodger general manager. iThe man who hired him, Graziano, is a
certified public accountant who had worked in the Dodgers business
office for 11 years until the Fox Group elevated him.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was simply Rotisserie baseball. Malone's first
experience with real money was the $105 million contract lavished
on pitcher Kevin Brown. It was part of a winter re-tooling that
also included Hundley, outfielder Devon White and reliever Alan
Mills. Imported during the 1998 season had been pitchers Dave
Mlicki and Mel Rojas, both since traded, and pitcher Jeff Shaw,
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek and outfielder Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was a complete change from the Lasorda-Fred Claire
regime. Just nine players remain on the current roster from Opening
Day 1998. And when Malone delivered his now infamous ``new sheriff
in town'' comments during the spring, when he proclaimed the
Dodgers primed for the World Series, it was not difficult to
believe him. Los Angeles became a consensus pick to win the
division, and front offices in both San Diego and San Francisco
were incensed by Malone's braggadocio.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also became a favored team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a marked team,'' Hundley said. ``We've been a
marked team since Opening Day. The Mets were a hated team when I
was here, but my God _ I haven't seen a team marked like this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hoped that Brown could pull the same levitation act with
the Dodgers' rotation that he did so well the previous season with
the Padres. But Brown also had hard-case pitching coach Dave
Stewart behind him in San Diego as a stern ally. And Brown is so
expensive that the Dodgers will have to move out some of the
pitchers he was supposed to have helped.
</P>
<P>
   But foremost in their rush to fill out a new lineup card, a
basic component of leadership was neglected, which has led to a
whole new inspection of the Mike Piazza trade of last May. Piazza
might not have emoted in public and rarely seemed deflated by
defeat, but he meant more to L.A.'s clubhouse than the current
regime wants to admit. Since he left the organization, the Dodgers
are 118-120.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old question of what comes first, winning or
chemistry,'' said Texas third baseman Todd Zeile, also jettisoned
last year in the first Fox trading frenzy. ``I do know that Fred
Claire may have been criticized for not making a big trade, but
Fred knew people, and he knew how they related.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight is 20-20,'' Zeile said, ``but we had everything we
needed to be a contending club. There were a lot of people who said
the (Piazza) trade made the Dodgers a better team. I wonder if
those people would still say that.''

GOP LAWMAKERS TOUT REPUBLICAN TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Taking the battle over a proposed $792
billion tax cut to the public, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
said Thursday that the GOP plan will benefit everyone and give back
money to those who deserve it most: the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech to the Kiwanis Club of Fort Worth, Hutchison
held up a chart indicating that the 10-year package _ based on
using $1.4 trillion of the projected budget surplus _ will cut
income tax rates by 1 percentage point, purge the ``marriage
penalty'' and slash capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that two-thirds of that should go to the people who
have overpaid their taxes. We have collected too much, and we want
to give it back,'' Hutchison said. ``That's why we want to give a
refund ...''
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the package last week along largely partisan
lines; President Clinton has said he will veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore attacked the plan this week as ``reckless
and wrong.'' Democrats are touting a plan to use part of the
federal budget surplus to reduce the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, are on
the road promoting the GOP agenda. They say taxpayers should be
allowed to decide how to spend those dollars, whether it be on
college, in a business or on a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats want to spend the money, not save it, Hutchison
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think taking care of Social Security, paying down the debt _
and our program pays down the debt by half _ and giving the people
25 cents on the dollar back is the responsible thing to do,''
Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill is becoming a defining issue between Republicans
and Democrats in the 2000 fight for control of Congress and the
race for the White House. Both parties have agreed to set aside
about $2 trillion for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would provide the largest tax cut since 1981,
would trim the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14 percent in
2003 and reduce the other rates by 1 percentage point in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Under a provision championed by Hutchison, relief from the
marriage penalty that affects millions of two-income couples would
begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax would be repealed gradually starting in 2003, and
capital gains taxes would be cut from 20 percent to 18 percent for
most investors reaching back to Jan. 1, 1999. The bill also
includes tax breaks for education and health care, expanded IRAs,
pensions and business.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that Americans appear to be somewhat ambivalent
about tax cuts. A recent Gallup Poll reported that 61 percent of
Americans would prefer to boost spending for education, defense or
Medicare rather than cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burford, president of the Fort Worth Kiwanis Club, said
that if the GOP tax cut plan gives back even a little money, the
precedent it sets would be worth it. Government needs to break its
tax-and-spend cycle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't go far enough, but it's a step in the right
direction. The idea of reducing taxes and letting hard-working and
struggling Americans keep more of their money is very, very
healthy,'' Burford said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, gave a Washington update at the
Downtown Arlington Rotary Club meeting Thursday, where he briefly
discussed the tax cut the House passed in late July.
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation had a ``lockbox'' requirement that would
keep it from going into effect if the national debt wasn't at the
level it was supposed to be at the time.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with a senior citizens group in Arlington on
Tuesday, Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said that 14 percent of the
annual federal budget goes to pay off government debts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic plan, as much as $1 trillion of the
national debt would be paid off within 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like a credit card. I personally hate having a
credit card bill at the end of the month and not being able to pay
it off and carry over that big interest,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really be nice to pay down some of this debt.''

PLAN TO ENRICH IOWA'S GOPTURNS CRITICAL FOR CANDIDATES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ From the pork producers tent at the state
fair here to an ice cream shop in Marshalltown to the northeast,
nine Republican presidential candidates scoured this state for
votes on Thursday. Campaign workers toiled furiously into the night
offering free transportation (in luxuriously appointed buses) to
deliver people to the polls. Several campaigns' telephone banks
worked overtime, prodding people to participate. And they drowned
potential voters in a closing blizzard of television commercials
and glossy mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one dead giveaway _ the absence of snow _ Iowa seemed
as frenzied as it does on the eve of the state's vaunted
presidential caucuses in February.
</P>
<P>
   The hyper activity has been set off by something that,
technically, has no direct bearing on who will capture the
nomination: a straw poll at Iowa State University in nearby Ames on
Saturday that was designed as a scheme for the Iowa Republican
Party to enrich itself. Not once in its two-decade history has the
event predicted a presidential victor. And because the candidates
pay the $25-a-head entry fee for voters, it is not even an
impartial indication of voter sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   But, like it or not, the straw poll has transformed into what
most presidential campaigns agree is the most consequential
political event thus far in the unusually fast-paced run up to
2000. Because the primary season has begun far earlier than usual,
with several states moving up the dates of their contests, the
straw poll could supplant the Iowa caucuses _ which do not occur
for nearly six months _ in weeding out the 10-candidate field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is like a primary!'' Luke Roth, the state director
for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, blurted as he stood, arms
outstretched, in his campaign's headquarters as aides scurried
about taking calls on a ``bus hotline'' to encourage supporters to
get to the event from more than 100 bus departure locations across
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Marlys Popma, who runs the operation here for Gary Bauer, the
former head of the Family Research Council, said she was astonished
at how the straw poll was taking on outsized importance. ``It's a
fund-raiser, for Pete's sake,'' she said. Yet in the next breath,
she touted its significance, saying, ``More important than who
finishes at the top of this thing is who finishes at the bottom. If
you're sixth, seventh or eighth, it's going to be very difficult to
raise money.'' Ms. Popma said stumping has been so frenetic that
people are confusing the poll with an actual binding election. ``We
get mail in every day asking for absentee ballots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders themselves have raised the stakes, and the
expectations, by proclaiming the gravity of the event. After an
energetic debate among his advisers over whether he should
jeopardize his dominant status by participating, or risk
antagonizing Iowans, Bush proclaimed in late June that ``We not
only ought to compete _ I think we ought to win the Ames straw
poll.'' Even campaigns that are struggling, notably that of former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have for months portrayed the
event as a critical test of a campaign's organizational mettle. An
estimated 600 journalists and pundits are only amplifying the
perception that this event is important by converging upon Ames and
covering it with an intensity they would normally reserve for a
pivotal primary or caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pouring millions into this as an insurance policy,''
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said of the candidates. Turning to a
reporter, he said, ``People like you are building up expectations
that they have to meet. If you guys figure out that George Bush
ought to get 70 percent and he only gets 50 percent you could
declare him a loser. That's sad. But that's the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns' success largely hinges on how many thousands of
loyalists they can entice and then transport _ with celebrities and
barbecue dinners _ to a sleepy town in Iowa on a summer afternoon
to vote. Iowa residents of any political affiliation can vote. It
is easier to participate in the actual caucuses than in the straw
poll because the caucuses take place throughout the state;
participants on Saturday have to travel to Ames.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grassley said the event is ``much more meaningful this
time'' than in past years, when out-of-state people could
participate and some campaigns chartered planes to fly in the
faithful. State party officials said they were planning for
possibly more than 15,000 participants on Saturday; more than
10,000 took part four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After rampant cheating in 1995 _ voters would get their hand
stamped, wash off the ink and vote again and again _ state party
officials have found an indelible ink that will show under
ultraviolet lights. They also plan to install monitors at the
voting sites (and in the bathrooms) to forestall cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence of how seriously the campaigns are taking the
event is that, collectively, they are spending millions of dollars.
While no financial records are available, Steve Forbes, the
multimillionaire publisher, appears to be pumping in the most
resources, followed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush operation, in fact, outbid the others and lavished
$43,500 to rent 60,000 square feet of grass outside the event site,
giving the governor a prime spot to schmooze participants before
they vote. The Bush campaign headquarters here has decorated its
walls with color photographs of the parcel at different angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very big deal,'' Kayne Robinson, the state
party chairman, said at a recent dinner of the Iowa Federation of
Republican Women. ``We're going to get a lot of money out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush said privately they were supremely confident that
he would triumph. But publicly, they have sought to tamp down
already monumental expectations. Roth, who said weeks ago that his
goal was to draw 5,000 Bush supporters to Ames (double the previous
record), has since been largely kept clear of reporters. The wisdom
among many political professionals is that Forbes, who appears to
be spending the most by far, will place second.
</P>
<P>
   The most active speculation is whether someone will emerge
decisively as a third-place finisher _ or whether several
contenders will split the remaining votes. Many campaigns report
that Bauer's grassroots drive seems to be coming on strong; there
is also much curiosity about Elizabeth Dole, and whether the women
and young people who flock to her events will take the next step
and travel to Ames. Alexander has an aggressive organization in
this state and has put significant resources into the event.
</P>
<P>
   Others who hope to make an impressive showing are former Vice
President Dan Quayle; Patrick Buchanan, the conservative
commentator; Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who recently entered the
race, and Alan Keyes, a radio talk show host. Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who is essentially bypassing the Iowa caucuses, opted not
to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have been cautious about how they characterize
the importance of the straw poll: They do not want to diminish the
event and offend the state party, particularly in case they do
well. But they do not want to overestimate its import should they
have a lousy showing.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, for one, keeps saying the event is ``not do or die.''
Quayle, perhaps sensing an uphill battle, derided the event as
``almost like the old Daley machine _ when you buy votes.'' And
Hatch, while careful to commend the state party, accused his rivals
of spending so much money that they are making ``a mockery of the
straw poll.''
</P>
<P>
   While straw polls are notoriously unreliable predictors of who
will win the nomination _ or even the subsequent caucuses _ they
can demonstrate a candidates' early organizational potency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Bush's father, former President Bush, triumphed in the
straw poll here but did not win his party's nomination. In 1987,
Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, won the straw poll, but
Bush became the nominee. In 1995, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas tied
with Bob Dole, who had been the front-runner. The result exposed
weaknesses in the Dole operation, but Dole went on to win the
nomination. A little known governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter, made
the most of a straw poll here in 1975 that helped vault him from
obscurity to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole other world,'' said Jody Powell, President
Carter's press secretary, in comparing the current straw poll to
the one nearly 25 years ago. ``We didn't have very much money. I
don't think we could provide any transportation. We just encouraged
people to go.''

 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At rural schoolhouses and sprawling urban campuses
across the country, millions of students returning to class in the
next few weeks will encounter a steely array of new security
measures. In many schools, lockers are being removed, cameras are
being installed as hallway monitors, and students will have to
swipe a computerized ID card just to get in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Even as new statistics show that school violence is actually on
the decline, the lurid images from armed assaults by students this
year have prompted most school districts to take some kind of
forceful action to instill a sense of greater security. That
inclination can only be strengthened by the shooting at a Jewish
community center in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many districts are forging close new relationships with local
police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school
grounds. In dozens of locales as disparate as Pittsburgh and Palm
Beach County, Fla., SWAT teams have spent the summer learning the
layouts of high schools and conducting drills involving mock
hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
   And in towns as small as Allen, Texas, many students returning
to school will find metal detectors and armed security guards at
the door, while others will have to trade their battered canvas
backpacks for see-through bags designed to make it harder to
conceal a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts, by contrast, have rejected the idea of detection
systems, finding them an affront to educational openness, and are
concentrating instead on a drumbeat of programs to make students
feel more responsible for their school's safety and less reluctant
to report violations.
</P>
<P>
   The new policies vary widely, but virtually all are a direct
reaction to the shootings this spring at high schools in Littleton,
Colo., and here in Georgia, in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers. Many
administrators who say they have never received a threat of bombing
or gunfire have nonetheless felt obliged to reassure parents and
students that steps have been taken to reduce the chances that
their school is the next to be encircled by news helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone feels the need to do something, even though no one
agrees on what that should be,'' said Joe Schneider, deputy
executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators, which represents superintendents. ``You can't just
tell parents that you're doing more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications, however, that security measures and
counseling programs gradually undertaken before the shootings this
spring have proved increasingly effective. In a report issued this
week, the U.S. Department of Education, having compiled statistics
from each of the states, found that gun-related expulsions in the
last school year dropped by nearly a third from the previous year.
Another study, issued last week by researchers at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, determined that violence committed
by teen-agers had declined during the 1990s, along with the number
of weapons carried to school.
</P>
<P>
   But administrators know that such studies are of little comfort
to parents who have learned that violence can erupt anywhere, at
any moment. Indeed, taken as a whole the new policies seem intended
as much to instill peace of mind as to actually keep a student from
opening fire on his school, prevention of which many officials say
is probably impossible in any case. A doorway metal detector, for
example, can do little to forestall a blaze of gunfire in the
schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that districts are taking these steps solely to
reassure people, but there's often as much reassurance built into
them as actual effectiveness,'' said Dennis Lewis, director of
school public safety in Springfield, Mo., and vice president of the
National Association of School Safety and Law Enforcement Officers.
``Parents will call up and ask if a school has metal detectors. All
of us know that no metal detector is going to stop someone who
wants to shoot in a school. But a parent wants to hear that they're
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many districts conducted highly publicized drills over the
summer in which police SWAT teams entered schools to put down mock
shootings. Last month in Palm Beach County, Fla., for example,
drama students with fake wounds pretended to be casualties as
officers stormed a school and ``arrested'' police academy recruits
who were pretending to take hostages and plant bombs, all under the
gaze of television cameras. A similar drill at a Pittsburgh high
school on Wednesday, complete with helicopters and ersatz pipe
bombs, was so realistic that some summer students believed that
police were responding to an actual attack. The exercises provided
useful training to police in the unfamiliar territory of a school
building, while also sending a message of control to parents and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, of the superintendents' group, said the shaping of a
new relationship with the local police department was probably the
most common step adopted by the nation's school districts. After it
became known that the Littleton Police Department had been
unfamiliar with the layout of Columbine High School, where 12
students and a teacher were killed by two young gunmen on April 20,
many districts began distributing floor plans and computerized
blueprints of their schools to their police departments, which in
turn began touring the schools over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive districts are erecting virtual walls around
their schools, as if trying to keep the outside world at bay. In
Allen, Texas, a suburb of Dallas that cut back its class schedule
last spring after a series of bomb threats, officials are spending
$1 million to bring in metal detectors, surveillance cameras and a
new security force, and are requiring students to wear
identification badges. In Deltona, Fla., near Orlando, lockers have
been removed and book bags banned; students will get a duplicate
set of books to keep at home. Many schools are installing caller ID
on their telephones so they can trace bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Owensboro, Ky., all but the front doors of public schools
have been permanently locked, and visitors and latecomers must be
buzzed in with a new security system that alerts the office
whenever anyone approaches the door. Video cameras are being
installed on school buses in Clayton County, Ga., southeast of
Atlanta. Columbine High School itself will install emergency alarms
throughout the building, and will be employing dogs to search for
weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such measures consider them effective deterrents,
a tangible reflection of a school's insistence on safety. John
Coleman, director of safety and security for the public schools of
Kansas City, Mo., said his district had not had a single shooting
or knifing since it installed metal detectors in middle and high
schools seven years ago. Similar results are reported in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But support for the fortress approach to security is hardly
universal. Methods of security tend to vary as broadly as parenting
techniques, reflecting a lack of consensus on the best ways to
reduce violence. Most of the districts in the Los Angeles-Orange
County area, for example, have chosen not to spend money on new
electronic security systems or guards, relying instead on the
random checks with hand-held metal detectors that they have used
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Isaacs, assistant superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified
School District, said the city's schools were far too large to
check every student entering the building without cutting into
class time. But as a result of the Columbine shooting, he said, the
district will be putting up thousands of signs around its 670
schools that read: ``Making threats is no joke. All threats will be
taken seriously and will subject anyone making them to any and all
applicable criminal and civil penalties, as well as school
discipline, including expulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   Many administrators believe that increased physical security is
futile and counterproductive, noting that Columbine High had
security guards and that Heritage High, the school in Conyers where
a 15-year-old gunman wounded six other students on May 20, had
surveillance cameras. Instead, these administrators have begun
conducting intensive seminars to train students and teachers to
recognize and defuse threats before they lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to create an image of a police state, and we
don't want dogs sniffing around,'' said Dr. Francis Connor,
superintendent of the Dighton-Rehoboth regional schools, a small
district in southeastern Massachusetts. ``By addressing the
physical changes, you are only dealing with the symptom of the
problem.'' Walled-in students, Connor said, tend to begin feeling
isolated and outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Connor's district has prepared a guide to alert teachers to the
symptoms of students prone to violence. And many districts will
hold meetings with all students to impress on them a new
seriousness about security, and encourage them to report even
jocular-sounding threats made by other students. (Several students
at Heritage High School have said they knew that the teen-age
gunman there had talked of emulating the youths who opened fire at
Columbine High a month earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every time a kid brings a weapon to school, he winds up
showing it to someone else,'' said Jim Kelly, the chief of the
school police in Palm Beach, where a pipe bomb was discovered at a
senior prom in May. ``We're trying to help the kids understand that
if they see that, they're doing their friend a favor by reporting
it, maybe saving them from some prison time. We've got anonymous
hot lines set up, and we want them to feel like they're a part of
what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shrewsbury, a suburb of Worcester, Mass., school officials
are working with architects to design a new high school, scheduled
to open in three years, which will have fewer entrances than the
current building and a community liaison office where students and
members of the staff can meet with counselors and police officers
to talk about school security issues. The new building will not,
however, be equipped with any metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Gutekanst, the principal of Shrewsbury High School, said
anyone could evade a metal detector, but not necessarily a system
of adults and students working together to spot threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds a little corny,'' he said, ``but the issue is not
getting metal detectors, it's making sure you have mental
detectors.''

ELECTRICAL WIRING INSPECTIONS TO DELAY SHUTTLE MISSIONS, NASA SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shuttle missions planned for September and October will be
postponed so engineers can inspect Endeavour and Discovery for
damage to their electrical wiring, NASA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was prompted by the electrical short that occurred
several seconds after the July liftoff of the shuttle Columbia with
five astronauts and the $1.55 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The half-second short affected the computerlike controllers on
two of Columbia's three main rocket engines. Additional electrical
disruption would have shut down an engine, forcing commander Eileen
Collins and pilot Jeff Ashby to attempt an unprecedented emergency
landing.
</P>
<P>
   Post-flight inspections revealed the short was caused when a
wire with damaged insulation in the left rear area of Columbia's
cargo bay contacted a burred screw head. Using electron
microscopes, experts believe a small amount of insulation was torn
away when a technician inadvertently stepped or pressed the wire
against the burred fastener or dropped a tool on it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the space agency said it had found similar, though
not as severe, damage to the insulation on wiring in the right rear
of Columbia's cargo bay, challenging any contention that the July
short could be considered an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we had what you could call a close call,'' said Don
McMonagle, NASA's shuttle planning manager and the chairman of its
mission management team. ``We have an emphasis on safety, and our
decision to delay the launches is the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   McMonagle estimated 20- to 30-day delays in the next two
missions but did not rule out longer postponements and the
rescheduling of a third mission after the inspections get under
way.
</P>
<P>
   The first impact is on the launch of Endeavour and a crew of six
that planned to use a large radar apparatus in the shuttle's cargo
bay to produce a new three dimensional map of much of the Earth's
surface. Endeavour was set for a Sept. 16 launch.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour recently underwent work by technicians in the same
areas of Columbia where wire damage was found.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's mid-October launching with a crew of seven on a
10-day mission to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope also will be
delayed. The mission was added to shuttle mission planning early
this year so that teams of spacewalking astronauts could replace
failing gyroscopes aboard the space telescope, replace its flight
control computer and make other repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the delays is less certain on Atlantis, which is
tentatively scheduled for an early December flight to the new
international space station with a crew of seven and supplies for
the new outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Atlantis flight already depends on Russia's
ability to launch the station's initial crew module in November, a
flight that is 19 months behind schedule because of that country's
financial ills.
</P>
<P>
   McMonagle said the inspections will be limited primarily to the
wire bundles that run beneath the 60-foot payload bay floor of each
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Each shuttle has about 300 miles of wiring, though only a small
percentage of it traverses the cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   If major damage is encountered, shuttle technicians will splice
in new segments. Where damage is minor, technicians will use Teflon
tape to cover the area.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers believe the damage could have been caused when
workers mounted access platforms in the bottom of the payload bay
to scale the 15 foot high wall. The procedure is used as changes
are made to accommodate the shuttle's different payloads.

 &HT;    Pit stops, pitfalls
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NASCAR's big bucks have created big problems for
Winston Cup crew chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   With stock-car racing turning into a $2 billion-a-year industry
and with competition at an all-time high, crew chiefs have become
an endangered species. The 44 full-time teams on the circuit have
made 16 changes this season.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Sabates, owner of two Winston Cup teams, explained the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR is now big business,'' Sabates said. ``When I started
in it 14 years ago, it was big business, but nowhere compared to
today. And today, performance is everything. Sponsors sign with a
team that can do the job, and a driver that can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last piece of the puzzle is the crew chief. He gets blamed
for everything if the team does not perform well. For example, if a
driver wrecks nine times in a year, it's the crew chief's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Fenning, crew chief for Mark Martin, said, ``If you ain't
winning, life is tough for a crew chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the season-opening Daytona 500 on Feb. 14, more than a
third of the regular teams have switched crew chiefs at least once.
More changes are expected during the last 14 races.
</P>
<P>
   The pace has been uncommonly fast and furious in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed about it,'' said Robin Pemberton, crew
chief for Rusty Wallace. ``It's not something that is making any of
us happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chiefs are the managers, the behind-the-scene leaders, of
the race teams. They are in charge of everything from overseeing
the shop assignments and hiring crew members to developing race
strategy and making decisions in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication between the driver and the crew is really
crucial,'' Jeremy Mayfield said. ``Sometimes you see those deals,
like Jeff Gordon and Ray Evernham, where it's like the driver and
crew chief are one person. And those are usually the deals where
the cars are running really well.''
</P>
<P>
   In a performance-driven sport, crew chiefs often are used as
scapegoats. Sponsors spend millions to sign with a race team and to
promote the team's driver. When lofty goals are not met, the
fingers usually point to the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much marketing money is spent on advertising the driver, it
only makes sense to make a move first with the crew chief,'' said
Philippe Lopez, crew chief for Darrell Waltrip. ``It doesn't bother
me, though. It comes with the job and is part of the industry. No
one stays somewhere too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin, who drives the Sabates-owned No. 40 car, has
had three different crew chiefs this season.
</P>
<P>
   The driver-chief relationships are so brief that Pemberton, who
has been with Wallace since 1995, finds himself with one of
racing's longest tenures. Evernham is the dean, teaming with Gordon
to win three Winston Cup championships since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   However, the long hours and intense pressure of the job finally
seems to be wearing on Evernham. He is considering moving into a
managerial role with Hendricks Motorsports to spend more time with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Crew chiefs are paid base salaries ranging from $75,000 to
$350,000 annually, according to industry sources. Many contracts
contain incentives, with bonuses for such achievements as winning a
certain number of races or the series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the top crew chiefs, including Evernham and Todd
Parrott of Dale Jarrett's No. 88 team, reportedly can earn close to
seven figures with incentives.

 &HT;    Is Earnhardt racing's Ironman?
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Earnhardt will be starting his 600th consecutive
Winston Cup race, Sunday at Frontier at The Glen. Earnhardt, who
has decided to grow back his trademark mustache, trails only Terry
Labonte in NASCAR's streak of durability and longevity. Labonte has
started 622 consecutive races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a statement that you've been around for a while,''
Earnhardt, 48, said. ``I don't feel any older for sure. I'm excited
about racing. I feel good about racing. It's a pretty monumental
thing to see 600 starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, a Winston Cup rookie driver, is awed by the
600-club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Cal Ripken's streak for consecutive games,'' Stewart
said. ``It's very, very hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt missed a start in 1979, when he sat out four races

   FAST TRACKING . . .
</P>
<P>
   Concrete has been laid on three corners at Watkins Glen, site of
Sunday's race. It was added recently to the inside groove of the
turns because the asphalt was breaking up. ``Racers get a little
scared whenever the word 'concrete' is mentioned,'' said Paul
Andrews, crew chief for Steve Park. ``There were an awful lot of
bad experiences when they first put the concrete in at places like
Dover and Bristol. Concrete was rough on the tires, caused wrecks,
and it was hard for the teams and drivers to get a car to handle
it.''... From the ``who would have thunk it?'' department: Rookie
driver Tony Stewart, fifth in the standings, is one spot ahead of
three-time Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon. Stewart is cruising
toward one of the most prolific rookie seasons in the circuit's
history. No first-year driver has finished a season in the top 10
since 1980, and none has cracked the top five since '66. With 14
races to go, Stewart needs $83,052 to surpass the record for rookie
earnings, $1,459,967, set last season by Kenny Irwin. ... Speedway
Motorsports Inc. plans to hold World of Outlaws races at three of
its Winston Cup venues next year, with a fourth in Atlanta possible
in the future. Concord-based SMI is building dirt tracks of about
four-tenths of a mile in length at its flagship property, Lowe's
Motor Speedway at Charlotte, as well as at Texas Motor Speedway
near Dallas. The company already has a half-mile dirt track at Las
Vegas Motor Speedway and is considering building one at Atlanta
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S HOT
</P>
<P>
   Brickyard 400 winner and Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett
has finished 11th or better, including four victories, in 19 of the
season's 20 races. ... Bobby Labonte, who is third in the points
standings, has had top-five finishes in 10 of the last 12 races,
including three victories.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S NOT
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bodine, Darrell Waltrip, Robert Pressley, Ricky Rudd and
Kevin Lepage have not finished in the top 10 this season. ... Kyle
Petty has placed 16th or worse in eight of the last nine events.
... Jerry Nadeau, recently hired to drive the No. 25 car for
Hendrick Motorsports in 2000, has placed 31st or worse in the last
five races.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HE SAID
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be kind of a fake tour, a farce, if we call it a
victory tour and don't produce a victory. So our whole goal the
next 18 months is to win a race, at least one.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, explaining the reason for the naming of his
farewell tour, ``Victory Tour 2000.''

 &HT;    Bodine family reunion?
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Geoff and Brett Bodine have been the victims of name-calling in
recent weeks, with each brother being referred to as a
``bald-headed cue ball'' on separate occasions by Dale Earnhardt
Jr. and Chad Little, after incidents on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers might be ganging up on the brothers with receding hair
lines, but the numbers could get a little more even soon. Todd
Bodine, the youngest of the three racing brothers, could rejoin the
Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Todd, 35, has been thriving in the Busch Series since being
released from Winston Cup's No. 35 car at the beginning of the 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the right Winston Cup opportunity comes along, I'm going to
take it,'' he said. ``I enjoy the Busch Series. It's great
competition; it's good people. But at the same time, I want to be
in Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   In 22 Busch races this season, Todd Bodine has seven top-five
finishes, including second in the Kroger 200 last weekend. He is
fourth in the point standings and was the runner-up to champion
Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get the opportunity in Winston Cup, then I'll stay
in Busch and enjoy it,'' Bodine said. ``That's why right now I kind
of have the luxury of biding my time.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 28 car vacancy
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin, the driver of the No. 28 Ford since the beginning
of the '98 season, will not return to Robert Yates' race team next
season for two reasons: He was not producing, and there was
friction on the race team. Yates was critical of Irwin's focus last
year, when he was named Winston Cup rookie of the year. This
season, Irwin has struggled, with one pole and only two top-10
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH GRAND NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   Another Earnhardt
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Earnhardt, the eldest son of Dale Earnhardt, is returning
to the Busch series later this month after landing a sponsor.
Businessman Rick Rathburn said he intends to sponsor the 29-year
old driver in the Aug. 27 race at Bristol, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his brother, Dale Jr., who is threatening to repeat as
Busch Series champion this season, Kerry has a lot to prove to the
racing world. He has driven in only eight circuit races the past
two years, including a four-race stint this season which ended when
Doug Taylor Racing was sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a rough go so far in my Busch career, but the truth
of the matter is that I haven't really had a lot of time in a Busch
car to prove myself,'' Earnhardt said. ``A lot of people have
written me off, but I know I can get the job done if given the
right circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   20-year-old earns ride
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Walker, one of the top drivers in the World of Outlaws,
has signed on with Tyler Jet Motorsports for two Grand National
races, beginning at Phoenix on Nov. 6. ``We've been looking around
at a lot of different drivers for our new Busch team,'' owner Tim
Beverley said. ``Tyler's name kept coming up quite a bit. Despite
the fact he's only 20, Tyler has accomplished a lot in his racing
career. We wanted a young driver to grow with our young team, and
Tyler fit the bill perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs Racing may expand
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gibbs Racing, owned by the former coach of the NFL's
Washington Redskins, wants to expand its ever-growing NASCAR
empire. The team plans to add a second Grand National team in the
2000 season, if it can find sponsorship. Open-wheel star Jason
Lefler will drive the existing Grand National car next year. Joe
Gibbs Racing already runs the most successful two-car team in
Winston Cup. Drivers Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart are in the top
five of the points standings.

 By CLAIRE POOLE in Houston, with THIERRY OGIER in Sao Paulo 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Count Milton Passaro among the ranks of tens of
thousands of Latin Americans who are going online to take control
of their finances. Passaro used to put his savings in the bank. But
when the 27-year-old Brazilian quit his job to pursue a business
degree at Universidad Federal do Bahia in Salvador, he needed extra
income, so he started trading securities over the Internet. At any
one time, he has about US$17,000 dollars in the Sao Paulo market,
usually in two or three different stocks. Recent picks include
Brazilian telecommunications company Embratel, and Ceterp. His
goal: to earn returns of 6.8 percent every month. ``It's risky,''
he says. ``But it's fun.''
 &HT;    Warren Buffett wannabes in Latin America _ like Passaro _ now
have several trading services from which to choose. Over the last
year and a half, at least nine Latin American companies have
started offering stock trading over the web. Buenos Aires-based
Patagon.com was first out of the gate, completing the region's
first electronic transaction in June 1998, when a Chilean bought
shares in Argentine energy concern YPF. The broker now does 2,000
trades a day and racks up about $21 million in transactions a
month.
 &HT;    While information about the overall size of the business remains
sketchy, it seems a sure thing that the volume of trades and
transactions is still small. However, current traders are buying
and selling U.S. stocks _ made much easier through the Internet _
rather than securities from their home markets. And, like almost
everything net-related, the rate of growth is astronomical.
 &HT;    Charles Schwab, the granddaddy of the industry, which first
offered stock trading via computer back in 1985, plans to open
offices in all the major markets across the region over the next
year. ``Internet usage is growing at approximately four times the
rate of growth of all the other markets, and our growth within the
region will be a function of that,'' says Lionel Baugh, Schwab's
vice president and regional manager for Latin America and the
Caribbean.
 &HT;    Volume may increase if prognosticators prove to be right about
the growth of Internet penetration in the region. U.S. market
research firm Dataquest thinks the number of Latin American
Internet accounts will balloon from 5.2 million at the end of last
year to 32 million by the end of 2003. ``That's going to lead to
the growth of
 &HT;    e-commerce _ including online trading,'' says Luis Anavitarte,
Dataquest's senior analyst for Latin America.
 &HT;    In Brazil, brokers are opening 3,000 new Internet trading
accounts per month, on average. Brazilians jumped in after the Sao
Paulo Stock Exchange began offering a home trading system in
February. At Souza Barros, another recent startup, the number of
transactions has been doubling every month over the last our
months. ``It's been just spectacular,'' says Alberto Fonseca, one
of the firm's managing directors. There are now six brokerage firms
offering online trading, including Corretora Souza Barros Cambio e
Titulos, Banco Cidade CCVM, Hedging-Griffo Corretora de Valores,
Coinvalores, Novacao Corretora de Cambio e Valores and Sociedade
Corretora Paulista. Many more are expected to add electronic
trading to their offerings.
 &HT;    Patagon.com already has some competition in its home country:
Three months after it made its first transaction, Buenos Aires
brokerage firm Rava Sociedad de Bolsa launched its own online
trading service. In Chile, Santiago-based financial services firm
CB Capitales introduced that country's only Internet stock trading
service in March, called cb.cl. It's now clearing about 500
transactions a month. While growth across the region has been
impressive, the number of Latin Americans trading is still
relatively small. The Brazilian firms probably have the most, with
Souza Barros claiming 7,000 customers. Patagon.com and Schwab count
about 6,000 customers each, while cb.cl has only 750 and Rava, 500.
 &HT;    There are several barriers to mass popularity on par with eTrade
and other brokers in the United States. The first is cultural. Many
are suspicious of doing anything involving their finances online.
Most residents still keep what little savings they have in banks,
pension funds or under the mattress. There's also very little in
the way of consumer protection in many Latin American countries
when it comes to bank accounts and credit cards, leading to a
general mistrust of any new financial gimmick.
 &HT;    The second reason is monetary. Hit by one economic crisis after
another over the last 10 years, most Latin Americans don't have
extra cash lying around to buy a computer, much less the money to
invest with it.
 &HT;    The third reason is risk. Latin Americans are hesitant to bet
even part of their money on the stock market, which many equate
with the roulette wheel. Indeed, despite what they read in the U.S.
press about 20-somethings making a mint off trading stocks, many
are quickly finding out that investing in stocks is harder than it
looks. ``I just opened up an online-broker account and have learned
I have the lead touch,'' says one trader, who posted his lament
anonymously on the bulletin board of Latin American portal
quepasa.com. ``I bought Lycos, it goes down; I get Dell, it goes
down; I get the sure thing, Microsoft, it goes down. Then when I
get out of a stock, it goes up. My luck has to change. I do better
at Vegas.''
 &HT;    But some Latin Americans are becoming more accustomed to
investing over the Internet. John Freshel, 41, Brazilian father of
two and an executive at Seara, a subsidiary of Bunge International,
has been trading stocks on line since March. ``I feel comfortable
with this,'' he says. ``My brokerage firm [Coinvalores provides me
with charts, and I can also find quarterly balance sheets, analysis
and recommendations. And it's possible to work with this
information outside regular trading hours at the stock exchange.''
 &HT;    Some are trading to build up their savings. Juan Eduardo
Errazuriz D., 30, a civil engineer who works for Canal 13 in
Santiago, has put $10,000 into stocks like Intel, Copec and IBM
through cb.cl to build a nest egg for his future offspring. ``My
idea is to save money for the education of my children,'' he says.
 &HT;    Others are doing it purely as a diversion. Marcelo Pizzolo, 32,
who owns a construction firm in Buenos Aires, has been trading
stocks on line through Schwab since 1994. He started out buying
options, but when that got too risky, he moved into stocks. Lately
he's been buying into the turbulent technology industry, including
such companies as America Online, Compaq and Dell. ``It's a very
hard hobby,'' he says. ``I never make money.''
 &HT;    A small community of these financial cybernauts is slowly
forming in Latin America, leading to some lively discussions in the
chat rooms and on the bulletin boards of some of the online trading
firms, from economic commentary to stock picks to market gossip.
 &HT;    Developments such as these have the new brokerages plotting ways
to do more. Chile's cb.cl is looking to offer a diverse portfolio,
from mutual funds to U.S. stocks to home mortgages as executives
predict a sea change in the way their company does business.
``We're changing from a traditional company to a virtual company,''
says Juan Izcue Elgart, a 35-year-old marketing manager at CB
Capitales who initiated the idea a few years ago and is now running
the service.
 &HT;    Patagon.com also aims for a pan-regional reach, offering not
just stocks, but bonds, mutual funds and other financial
instruments. It's in the midst of opening offices in Sao Paulo and
Mexico City. ``We are trying to be a broad financial services
firm,'' says Constancio Larguia, the 24-year-old president of
Patagon.com, who founded the company with a friend while pursuing a
business degree at the Universidad de San Andres.
 &HT;    Investors are buying into Patagon's vision. Zsolt Agardy, a
wealthy investor in Argentina, gave Patagon.com its initial $1
million in funding for at 51 percent stake. Chase Capital Partners
and Flatiron Partners _ which have also invested in Latin American
portal StarMedia _ have since plopped down $4 million for an
undisclosed interest.
 &HT;    Back in Salvador, online trading pioneer Passaro's returns have
far exceeded anything he can get at the bank. He's now hooked:
After he finishes his MBA, he hopes to move to New York and become
an options trader. ``To invest in the stock market, you have to be
patient, and sometimes you must be a risk taker,'' he says. ``And I
like risk.''
 &HT;    He's not the only one.

BRAWL MAY ENSUE OVER TAKEOVER OF REYNOLDS METALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ALUMINUM-ALCOA) 
(yn) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The prospect of a takeover brawl for the Reynolds
Metals Co. arose Thursday when executives in the planned merger of
Canada's Alcan Aluminum and two European rivals suggested they
might try to outbid Alcoa Inc.'s $5.8 billion hostile offer.
</P>
<P>
   The hints dropped by Jacques Bougie, chief executive of Alcan,
and Jean-Pierre Rodier, chairman of France's Pechiney SA, reflected
the tumult in the global aluminum industry, where depressed prices
and plentiful supplies are forcing competitors to cut costs and
scramble for partners to remain profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Alcan, Pechiney and a third partner, Alusuisse Lonza Group AG of
Switzerland, shook up the industry on Tuesday when they confirmed
they were talking about a merger valued at about $9.2 billion that
would eclipse Alcoa as the biggest aluminum company. Alcoa
responded the next day by disclosing its unsolicited offer for
Reynolds, just as the Alcan-Pechiney-Alusuisse deal was officially
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news briefing at Alcan's Montreal headquarters,
Bougie said executives of the three companies to be merged had not
yet discussed whether they would try to top Alcoa's bid for
Reynolds. ``But you can't rule anything out,'' he said. ``Anything
is possible today.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Rodier said in an interview on French radio that
``nothing can be ruled out'' when asked whether the merged group
would consider making a bid for the Richmond-based Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Alcan considered Reynolds as a merger partner earlier this year
but decided to focus on expanding in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa's bid of $65 a share for Reynolds is considered to be low
by as much as $10 a share by several analysts and institutional
shareholders, heightening speculation about a competing bid or
revised offer from Alcoa. The Reynolds board of directors is
scheduled to meet on Sunday to consider Alcoa's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Reynolds, which rose $9.375, or nearly 17 percent, on
Wednesday to $65.25 on news of the Alcoa offer, rose a further
$1.125, or 1.7 percent, Thursday, to $66.375.
</P>
<P>
   Bougie said the apparently sudden proposal to Reynolds by Alcoa
executives was ``very flattering'' because it indicated the
three-way merger ``threatens their position.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Alcan had negotiated a ``merger of equals''
reflected in equal representation from the three companies on a new
12-member board. But Alcan will be the dominant partner because it
will have a 44 percent share of the equity in the new company,
which will be based in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   If both combinations proceed, the Pittsburgh-based Alcoa and the
Alcan group will be virtually tied as the leading aluminum
companies with revenue exceeding $21 billion a year each.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other companies in the business, such as Norsk Hydro of Norway,
Viag of Germany and Billiton of Britain, are less than a quarter
the size of two giants and are now under even more pressure to find
partners to help cut costs. Viag negotiated a merger with Alusuisse
in the spring but the deal collapsed over price.
</P>
<P>
   Bougie said he expected more consolidation in Europe, where
Norsk Hydro is expected to play a leading role. He said the Alcan
group's growth strategy will partly be determined by moves made by
other companies, and that adding a fourth partner remained a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the Alcan group's merger talks said that
the three companies were ``on the same page,'' although it was
unclear whether regulators and shareholders would approve. The
executive said officials at Alcan and Alusuisse were worried that
Pechiney stockholders might balk at supporting a deal that would
give control of the French company to foreigners.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    El brasileno Milton Passaro esta entre las decenas de miles de
latinoamericanos que controlan sus finanzas en linea. Passaro
colocaba sus ahorros en el banco, pero cuando dejo su trabajo para
estudiar Comercio en la Universidad Federal de Bahia, en Salvador,
necesitaba un ingreso extra, de modo que se dedico al corretaje de
valores en la Internet. En todo momento tiene unos US$17.000 en la
Bolsa de Sao Paulo, generalmente en dos o tres fondos.
Recientemente invirtio en las empresas brasilenas de
telecomunicaciones Embratel y Ceterp. Su meta es ganar un 6,8 por
ciento mensual. ``Es arriesgado pero divertido,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Los imitadores latinoamericanos de Warren Buffett, el guru
norteamericano de las inversiones a largo plazo, como Passaro,
ahora tienen varios servicios de corretaje para escoger. En el
ultimo ano y medio, por lo menos nueve companias latinoamericanas
han comenzado a ofrecer corretaje de valores en la Web.
Patagon.com, de Buenos Aires, fue la primera en realizar una
transaccion bursatil electronica de la region en junio de 1998,
cuando un chileno compro acciones en la argentina YPF. Patagon.com
realiza ahora 2.000 transacciones diarias, por un valor mensual del
US$21 millones.
 &HT;    Aunque no hay informacion completa sobre la envergadura de este
sector, se puede decir con seguridad que el volumen de corretaje y
transacciones aun es pequeno. Los que se dedican a esta actividad
hoy compran y venden titulos norteamericanos, lo que es mucho mas
facil a traves de la Internet, en vez de valores de los mercados de
sus paises. Y como pasa con casi todo lo que tiene que ver con la
Web, el indice de crecimiento es gigantesco.
 &HT;    Charles Schwab, la primera empresa en ofrecer corretaje de
acciones por computadora en 1985, planea abrir oficinas en los
principales mercados de la region el ano proximo. ``El uso de la
Internet crece unas cuatro veces mas rapido que otros mercados, y
nuestro crecimiento en la region estara en funcion de eso,'' dice
Lionel Baugh, vicepresidente y gerente regional de America Latina y
el Caribe en Schwab. El volumen puede aumentar si los pronosticos
se hacen realidad. La firma norteamericana de investigacion de
mercado Dataquest piensa que la cantidad de cuentas
latinoamericanas en la Internet se dispara de 5,2 millones a fines
del ano pasado a 32 millones al finalizar el 2003. ``Eso va a
llevar al crecimiento del comercio electronico, incluido el
corretaje en linea,'' dice Luis Anavitarte, analista de Dataquest
para America Latina.
 &HT;    En Brasil, los corredores abren 3.000 cuentas de corretaje en la
Internet al mes. Muchos brasilenos saltaron a la palestra cuando la
Bolsa de Sao Paulo comenzo a ofrecer un sistema de corretaje desde
la casa en febrero. En Souza Barros, otra nueva empresa del giro,
las transacciones han aumentado el doble cada mes desde febrero.
``Ha sido espectacular,'' dice Alberto Fonseca, uno de los
directores gerentes de la firma. Ya hay seis firmas que ofrecen
corretaje en linea: Corretora Souza Barros Cambio e Titulos, Banco
Cidade CCVM, Hedging-Griffo Corretora de Valores, Coinvalores,
Novacao Corretora de Cambio e Valores y Sociedade Corretora
Paulista. Se espera que muchas mas anadan el corretaje electronico
a sus ofertas.
 &HT;    Patagon.com ya tiene competencia en su pais: tres meses despues
de su primera transaccion, Rava Sociedad de Bolsa, de Buenos Aires,
lanzo su servicio de corretaje en linea. En Chile, CB Capitales,
firma de servicios financieros con sede en Santiago, inicio el
unico servicio de corretaje de valores en la Internet de ese pais
en marzo, llamado cb.cl. Ahora realiza unas 500 transacciones al
mes. Aunque el crecimiento ha sido impresionante en toda la region,
la cantidad de latinoamericanos que compran y venden acciones
todavia es relativamente pequena. Patagon.com y Schwab tienen unos
6.000 clientes cada uno, mientras cb.cl solo tiene 750 y Rava 500.
 &HT;    Hay varias barreras que impiden que el comercio electronico y
otros servicios de corretaje sean tan populares como en Estados
Unidos. La primera es cultural. Muchos no se sienten seguros con
las finanzas en linea. La mayoria guarda sus ahorros en bancos,
fondos de pension o debajo del colchon. Tampoco hay una gran
proteccion al consumidor en muchos paises latinoamericanos en lo
concerniente a cuentas bancarias y tarjetas de credito, lo cual
crea una desconfianza generalizada ante cualquier idea financiera
novedosa.
 &HT;    La segunda razon es de indole monetaria. La mayoria de los
latinoamericanos, golpeados por una crisis economica tras otra en
los ultimos 10 anos no tienen dinero para comprar una computadora,
y mucho menos para invertir.
 &HT;    La tercera razon es el riesgo. Los latinoamericanos sienten
renuencia a invertir siquiera parte de su dinero en la bolsa, a la
que muchos comparan con una ruleta. Pese a que en la prensa
norteamericana leen sobre jovenes de poco mas de 20 anos que ganan
una fortuna en el corretaje de valores, muchos no tardan en
descubrir que invertir en la bolsa es mas dificil de lo que parece.
``En cuanto abri una cuenta con un servicio de corretaje en linea,
descubri que tengo el toque de Midas al reves,'' dice un corredor,
que puso su lamento, sin dar su nombre, en el pizarron electronico
del portal latinoamericano quepasa.com. ``Compre acciones de Lycos,
y bajaron; compre de Dell, y bajaron; me fui por lo seguro,
Microsoft, y tambien bajaron. Entonces, cuando vendo las acciones,
suben. Mi suerte tiene que cambiar. Probablemente me iria mejor en
Las Vegas.''
 &HT;    Pero algunos latinoamericanos ya se acostumbran a invertir en la
Internet. John Freshel, un ejecutivo brasileno de Seara, filial de
Bunge International, invierte en linea desde marzo. ``Me siento
comodo con esto,'' dice. ``Mi firma de corretaje [Coinvalores me da
tablas, y tambien busco cuentas de resultados trimestrales,
analisis y recomendaciones. Y es posible trabajar con esta
informacion fuera de las horas normales de la bolsa.''
 &HT;    Algunos invierten para aumentar sus ahorros. Juan Eduardo
Errazuriz D., ingeniero civil que trabaja para el Canal 13 de
Santiago de Chile, ha invertido US$10.000 en acciones de Intel,
Copec y IBM a traves de cb.cl para su futura prole. ``Mi plan es
ahorrar dinero para los estudios de mis hijos,'' dice. Otros lo
hacen como diversion. Marcelo Pizzolo, dueno de una empresa de
construccion de Buenos Aires, invierte en linea a traves de Schwab
desde 1994. Comenzo comprando opciones, pero cuando el riesgo se
elevo demasiado, paso a los valores. Ultimamente ha invertido en el
agitado sector tecnologico, en companias como America Online,
Compaq y Dell. ``Fue una aficion muy dificil,'' dice. ``Nunca gane
dinero.''
 &HT;    En America Latina se forma lentamente una pequena comunidad de
estos cibernautas financieros, que ya da lugar a animadas
discusiones en las salas de conversacion y en los pizarrones
electronicos de varias firmas de corretaje en linea, desde
comentarios economicos hasta seleccion de acciones y rumores del
mercado.
 &HT;    Esto hace que las firmas de corretaje busquen maneras de ofrecer
mas cosas. La chilena cb.cl planea ofrecer una cartera diversa con
fondos de capital, valores norteamericanos, hipotecas de viviendas,
etc., mientras los ejecutivos pronostican un gran cambio en la
forma en que la compania hace negocios.
 &HT;    ``Estamos en el proceso de pasar de compania tradicional a
compania virtual,'' dice Juan Izcue Elgart, gerente de mercadeo de
CB Capitales, que concibio la idea hace unos anos y ahora dirige el
servicio. Patagon.com tambien apunta a toda la region. Ofrece
valores, deuda, fondos de capital y otros instrumentos financieros.
Planea abrir oficinas en Sao Paulo y Ciudad de Mexico. ``Queremos
ser una firma de servicios financieros completos,'' dice Constancio
Larguia, presidente de Patagon.com, que fundo la compania con un
amigo mientras estudiaba Comercio en la Universidad de San Andres.
 &HT;    Los inversionistas aceptan la vision de Patagon. Zsolt Agardy,
un acaudalado inversor de Argentina, le dio a Patagon.com su primer
millon de dolares en financiamiento por un interes del 51 por
ciento. Chase Capital Partners y Flatiron Partners, que tambien han
invertido en el portal latinoamericano StarMedia, han inyectado
US$4 millones por un interes que no se ha revelado.
 &HT;    De vuelta en Salvador de Bahia, los rendimientos de Passaro, el
pionero del corretaje en linea, han superado con creces el interes
que le ofrecen los bancos. El giro lo ha conquistado: cuando se
gradue de administracion de empresas, espera mudarse a Nueva York y
ser corredor de opciones. ``Para invertir en la bolsa, hay que ser
paciente y a veces hay que correr riesgos,'' dice. ``Y a mi me
gusta el riesgo.''
 &HT;    A otros, tambien.

 &HT;    LSU's DiNardo on hot seat
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Gerry DiNardo arrived as coach at LSU in 1995, he
promised to ``Bring the Magic Back'' to Tiger Stadium after six
losing seasons in a row. In 1998, the magic disappeared in a puff
of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran team, led by All-America running back Kevin Faulk, was
an overwhelming choice to win the SEC West and contend for the
national championship. The Tigers did start 3-0 and were ranked
sixth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in LSU's fourth game, No. 12 Georgia stunned the Tigers
28-27 at Tiger Stadium. That stumble led to a total collapse. LSU
lost seven of its last eight games to finish 4-7, matching
DiNardo's record in his first season at Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through something like that, it makes you examine
everything,'' DiNardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans did their own examination and asked for the head of
defensive coordinator Lou Tepper.
</P>
<P>
   One could not argue with the performance of the offense, which
averaged 30.6 points per game. Faulk averaged 191.7 all-purpose
yards, and quarterback Herb Tyler completed 61.2 percent of his
passes.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense's shortcomings were glaring:
</P>
<P>
   _ LSU gave up 463 total yards to Georgia and could not stop the
Bulldogs from running out the last five minutes to preserve the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kentucky had 573 total yards and got a field goal at the gun
to win 39-36 in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Against Mississippi, the Tigers rallied from a 21-point
deficit in the fourth quarter to tie the score, only to lose in
overtime, 37-31.
</P>
<P>
   _ LSU led Alabama 16-7 with less than three minutes left but
gave up two touchdown passes in the final 2:24 to lose 22-16.
</P>
<P>
   _ LSU led Notre Dame 34-20 midway through the third quarter only
to lose 39-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times we were so close, and we just let it slip
away,'' defensive tackle Johnny Mitchell said. ``Last season could
have been so different.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo stuck with Tepper even though the Tigers finished 11th
in the SEC in total defense. He did juggle the defensive coaching
staff, however. LSU also plans to be more aggressive on defense. It
moved All-SEC safety Mark Roman to cornerback, with the goal of
putting more pressure on the quarterback, something LSU did not do
well last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought the problem with our defense was just one guy, I
would have made the change, but it wasn't,'' DiNardo said. ``It was
a lot of little things. We feel like we've addressed those and are
looking forward to better results.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo needs to prove that last season was an abberration and
not a trend. Since Charlie McClendon left in 1979, LSU has had five
coaches _ Jerry Stovall, Bill Arnsparger, Mike Archer, Curley
Hallman and DiNardo. DiNardo is the only one to last more than four
years. Patience is not a byword on the bayou.
</P>
<P>
   After going to bowl games in 1995-97, LSU cannot afford another
losing season. Also, the school wants to expand Tiger Stadium to a
capacity of 91,600 by the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those seats are being added with the expectation that they
will be sold,'' DiNardo said with a grin. ``I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU has some talent. Nose tackle Anthony McFarland is gone, but
eight other starters return on defense. Faulk has left the offense,
but the Tigers have a veteran line. DiNardo must settle a three-way
race at quarterback among Craig Nall, Rohan Davey and Josh Booty.
</P>
<P>
   Booty, the former high school All-American who used to be
mentioned in the same breath as Peyton Manning, spent the past five
years playing professional baseball. The consensus is that the job
will be his at some point this season. If Booty comes through, he
could be the factor that puts the Tigers back into the win column.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule starts with three home games, followed by a big
Oct. 2 trip to Georgia. If LSU is going to be a contender in the
SEC West, that's when the Tigers will find out.

   A Higher (Tech) Calling &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New graduates of the Harvard Business School, traditionally able
to pick and choose in the job market, are increasingly drawn to
technology and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the old ways are gone. Consulting, the top career
choice for the school's new graduates since 1988, kept its place
this year. But only 22 percent chose it, compared with 38 percent
in 1995. And the new No. 2, superseding investment banking, was
high technology, up to 20 percent from 8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Many who chose it, according to the Aug. 2 issue of The Harbus,
the school's student newspaper, picked Internet-based businesses.
In 1995, no graduate went to such a company; this year, 12 percent
of the class did.
</P>
<P>
   One incentive is a new way of doing things, according to Tracy
Lawrence, a 1999 graduate who, with her classmate, Sasha
Novakovich, is setting up Shopforservice.com, which will help
consumers choose communications services.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a very young age,'' Ms. Lawrence said, ``you have the
opportunity to build or help shape a company from the ground up, to
revolutionize an industry or process.'' And there is another lure
in a field known for twenty-something millionaires _ ``a huge
potential financial upside,'' Ms. Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   _Barbara Ireland &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Business, Retirement and Taxes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The labor market may be tight, but 80 percent of the 7.6 million
United States companies with fewer than 100 employees lack
retirement plans, and 70 percent of those have no plans to start
them, according to the Spectrem Group, a consulting company in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But within two years, Spectrem found, 167,000 more small
companies do expect to start retirement plans, with 1.6 million
more workers likely to be covered.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes as congressional Republicans promote a $792
billion tax cut bill that would significantly increase the tax
benefits to business owners and their highest-paid workers in
retirement plans, while weakening rules that encourage offering
plans to lower-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has vowed to veto the bill. But Rep. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio, and others say that if he does, Congress will pass
a separate bill this fall containing only the pension rule changes.

SHARING A STAFF WITH A GHOST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mich.)  (af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You were recently brought in to replace the head of a department
who was let go because of conflict with upper management. Despite
your predecessor's rocky relations with her supervisors, she was
popular with her staff. Now you're faced with trying to motivate a
group of workers demoralized by the loss of their leader, one or
two of whom, you suspect, regard you as the enemy. Do you address
the problem or ignore it and hope everyone eventually adjusts? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people don't deal well with change under the best
circumstances. And the firing of a popular supervisor can leave
employees with a sense of loss as well as one of fear. The new
leader should address both.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people work closely with someone, they bond,'' said
Laurie Kalman, president of Performance First, a human resources
consulting firm in Branford, Conn. ``That's a relationship that
needs to be acknowledged. You need to give the staff permission to
go through a bit of a mourning process.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Guy, a partner with Crystal Clear Concepts, a management
consulting firm in St. Clair Shores, Mich., said that this process
can benefit both the employees and the new manager. ``Your job is
to maintain high empathy,'' Ms. Guy said. ``Listen. Try to
understand their feelings. Find out, if you can, what their fears
are. Find out what you need to do in their eyes to build trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guy said that staffers might be asking themselves: ```Am I
going to get it? Is the new manager going to come in with a new
broom?'''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are far from groundless, said Joe Buys, another
partner with Crystal Clear Concepts. ``In terms of any management
change, people frequently say, `We're not going to make any
changes,' then they come in and clean house,'' Buys said. ``So
people always have that trepidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Be careful not to make any promises, about job security or other
conditions, that you may not be able to keep, Ms. Guy warned. ``You
can't go in there and promise roses and sunshine, because you may
decide down the road that you need to make some staffing changes
based on performance,'' she said. Your focus should be to reduce
the fear that just because you're a new manager you're going to
make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Let the employees know where you stand on things and what you
expect of them, Buys suggested. Lay out your philosophy, your goals
for the group, how you like to receive information, some of the
things you plan to do.
</P>
<P>
   You should also solicit employees' suggestions. ``Find out as
much as you can in terms of what their feelings are, what their
goals are, what they feel their accomplishments have been, what
their ideas are for making improvements or moving ahead,'' Buys
said. Too often, new managers feel compelled to put their mark on a
department immediately, ``when really what they need to do is a lot
more listening,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's important to talk with employees about their
concerns, you don't want them to wallow in what has transpired, Ms.
Guy said. Acknowledge the past, but then try to get them to focus
on the future. &QL;

AS LAYOFFS LOOM, LOYALTIES ARE DIVIDED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Utah)  (af) 
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An employee asks your advice about whether to buy a house. You
know that the company is planning layoffs, and that he is likely to
lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   Do you keep quiet? Stall? Drop a hint? Or come right out and
warn him?
</P>
<P>
   The quandary is likely to keep coming up: even with unemployment
at 30-year lows, layoffs are occuring at a record pace, a result of
mergers and takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a problem that could test even the best managers. On the
one hand, the person sitting across the desk is about to make a
move that could turn into a colossal nightmare. Certainly, your
compassionate side is drawn to his plight. How could you not tell
him? Besides, can a company, a faceless institution, be harmed by
one tiny indiscretion?
</P>
<P>
   But hold on. What about your responsibility to the company?
Spilling the news may seem insignificant, but it carries risks. The
employee might spread the word, making other workers nervous or
even setting off an exodus. Furthermore, if the company is public
or is merging with a public company, letting an employee know
beforehand might run afoul of securities regulations.
</P>
<P>
   If those evils do not outweigh the potential harm of leaving an
employee in the dark, where do you draw the line? Would it be OK to
tell an employee who is low on cash about a pending merger, so she
could buy stock at the right time and get out of debt? Insider
trading laws make the answer a clear no. But when the issue is
ethical, rather than legal, judgment calls can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to stop a colleague from stepping off a financial cliff
is natural, said Rushworth M. Kidder, founder of the Institute for
Global Ethics in Camden, Maine. ``Here is a real live, breathing
person whose whole life is tied up in this thing.'' But, he added,
``you can't sacrifice the good of a great number of other people
simply because you want to tell someone a little bit ahead of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather J. Stone, the president of the Murdock Group, a career
training company in Salt Lake City, faced such a decision earlier
this year when she had to lay off half of her 52 employees,
including two who were house-hunting. She told one of them in
advance, but the other ``did not have much career maturity,'' Ms.
Stone said, and ``would have a hard time'' controlling the impulse
to talk to other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I opted not to tell this person,'' Ms. Stone added _ even
though she knew the employee had just made an offer on a house.
``No matter how much I want to share with the employee,'' she
reasoned, ``if the risk to the company is too high, I'm not going
to do it.'' Because Ms. Stone owns her company, she has more
latitude than most managers in making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution may be to tiptoe between the conflicting
principles of compassion and confidentiality, helping the employee
make the better choice even when full disclosure is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife's former employer was planning layoffs, for
example, she and many of her colleagues began searching for new
jobs. When she landed one and went to give notice, her manager
stopped her, saying, ``If you've gotten a new job, don't tell me.''
My wife took the hint. She was laid off a week later and received a
severance package that wouldn't have been available had she
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come to terms with how to approach issues like
this where you can't divulge all of the information, but to do it
without lying,'' Kidder said. He recalled a woman who once told
him, ```I really find that I don't ever have to lie; I have too big
a vocabulary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping hints may help abide by the letter of one's duty of
confidentiality, but it's hardly fair to limit disclosure to
employees whose personal situation you know. A better approach
might be to immunize the whole company against unpleasant surprises
by persuading top management to share information more widely.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a growing number of companies practice a more open
style of management, teaching employees how the company makes money
by sharing financial statements with them. Employees at such
companies ``can see there are troubles and know enough about the
business to understand when costs need to be cut,'' said John Case,
author of ``Open-Book Management'' (Harper Business, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   If everyone knew about looming layoffs, as they did at my wife's
company, rather than asking for advice about buying a house, an
employee could probably discern for himself whether the timing was
right. &QL;

 &HT;    Kanell's second shot comes via Falcons
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Atlanta Falcons quarterback Danny Kanell
often has found himself under a microscope. He was in the national
spotlight as a two-year starter at Florida State, and then he began
his NFL career in New York, where the media seems to undo
quarterbacks as much as interceptions do.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Kanell will be under close scrutiny again in Atlanta's
preseason opener against the Detroit Lions in the Georgia Dome.
Kanell, who could play as much as three quarters against the Lions,
is battling Tony Graziani for the backup role behind Chris
Chandler, who missed 11 games the past four seasons with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an extremely quick release; he sees the field well;
he's smart, and he's getting a better grasp of what we're doing,''
Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``But he's still having to forget
the system he was in for two years. But I do think he likes our
system, so that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's audition against the Lions will be just another in a
long line for Kanell. His first came in June 1979, when he was only
5 years old and under the watchful eyes of New York Yankees
outfielder Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell's father, Dan, was New York's team physician when the
Yankees had spring training near the family's home in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Jackson tore a calf muscle in a game and went to
Florida for surgery. Before he returned to New York, Jackson
attended one of Kanell's tee-ball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson kind of crashed at our house,'' Kanell said. ``He
wanted to stay in the car because it was in the prime of his
career, and he just would have been mobbed for autographs. But when
I hit a home run, he told my dad, `Doc, I've got to go congratulate
him.' Sure enough, I'm rounding third base, and there's Reggie
Jackson waiting to give me a high-five. It was something else. I
was the talk of the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell was the talk of the town in New York in 1997, when he
replaced woebegone starter Dave Brown in Week 6 and rallied the
Giants to a 20-17 upset of Dallas. In the final 10 games with
Kanell as the starter, New York had a 7-2-1 record and won the NFC
East.
</P>
<P>
   But it was nothing new for Kanell, who had enjoyed ultimate
success on the gridiron, never losing consecutive games as a
starter _ at any level _ until he arrived in New York.
Surprisingly, Kanell didn't start playing football until he was 16.
As a junior at tiny Westminster Academy in Fort Lauderdale, he led
his team to the state title in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play football growing up,'' he said. ``It was always
baseball and basketball. My dad really didn't want me to play,
because he thought it might hurt my chances of being a baseball
player if I got hurt. But my junior year in high school, a couple
of my buddies wanted me to go out for the team, so I said, 'Sure,
why not?' I never suspected it would become a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, a third baseman and pitcher, was drafted out of high
school by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 1992 amateur baseball draft.
He was picked again by the Yankees in 1995. By then, though, Kanell
says he realized that football might be his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about playing both sports,'' he said. ``But it
wasn't enough money to make me compromise my football
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell was a sophomore at FSU in 1993 when Charlie Ward, the
Seminoles' Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, bruised his shoulder
and couldn't play against Maryland. Kanell made his first career
start and threw for 499 yards and seven touchdowns against the
Terrapins, preserving the Seminoles' run to the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving FSU as the school's No. 2 career passer, Kanell
was a fourth-round draft choice of the Giants in 1996. He played
sparingly as a rookie and then made the surprising run in 1997.
Last season, however, he lost his job to Kent Graham after a 3-7
start.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Kanell got the scare of his life _ he found a
lump in his chest while jogging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it had bothered me for about two or three years,''
he said. ``(But) I was the typical guy who didn't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after a 34-7 victory over Arizona on Oct. 18, when
Kanell enjoyed perhaps the best game of his NFL career with 259
yards passing and three touchdowns, he underwent surgery to have a
peanut-sized lump removed from the left side of his chest.
Fortunately, tests confirmed that the lump was benign.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell returned to action less than two weeks after surgery, but
he struggled. The Giants lost three games in a row, and Kanell was
replaced by Graham against Philadelphia on Nov. 22. Kanell spent
the final six games as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to come back, and there were still stitches in there
and it was still pretty irritable,'' Kanell said. ``I might have
possibly tried to come back too quick, but I took a lot of pride in
not missing much time. I don't ever want to make any excuses for
what happened up in New York, but, sure, there are some things that
I might have done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   New York signed free-agent quarterback Kerry Collins in the
offseason and waived Kanell on Feb. 19. Kanell signed a two-year,
$2.5 millon contract with Atlanta a month later, after drawing
interest from several teams. He says the Falcons were his choice
because Reeves and quarterbacks coach Steve DeBerg were in New York
when the Giants drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard,'' Kanell said. ``I think it's a pretty
humbling experience to go from starter to a backup, because you've
been at the top spot and you know what it's like. But I'm trying to
get back there. I'm coming here to learn as much as I can, to
regroup mentally and physically and just get my confidence level
back up.''

FUND-RAISER PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Huang, the former Democratic National
Committee fund- raiser and Commerce Department official, pleaded
guilty Thursday to a single felony count of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   After Huang entered his plea, Judge Richard Paez of U.S.
District Court here sentenced him to a year of probation and fined
him $10,000. Huang has agreed in a plea accord to testify before
the House Committee on Government Reform, which is investigating
campaign finance abuses during the 1996 election, and to perform
500 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Huang, 54, was initially believed to be at the center of an
aggressive plan to raise millions from Asian-Americans to re-elect
Democrats. But law enforcement officials concluded that he was not
a major figure in campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying accusations to which Huang pleaded guilty were
unrelated to his Democratic Party work. Instead, they dealt with
Huang's earlier efforts to channel $2,500 in 1993 through a straw
donor to the campaign of a Los Angeles mayoral candidate, Michael
Woo, and $5,000 in 1994 to the election committee of Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif.

   New Sources for Initial Offerings &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, a brokerage firm in Arlington,
Va., plans to make shares of initial offerings it manages available
to brokerage clients of Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement bolsters Friedman Billings's ``ability to make
IPOs accessible to a broad range of customers,'' said Emanuel
Friedman, chief executive of Friedman, Billings.
</P>
<P>
   For the Boston-based Fidelity, the alliance provides another way
for its Fidelity Brokerage Services unit to give some of its
clients access to initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has a similar agreement with the New York-based Lehman
Brothers Holdings and said it also planned to offer brokerage
clients a chance to invest in offerings by W.R. Hambrecht, an
online investment bank.

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Free Index Fund: Ultimate Internet Giveaway &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free personal computers, free e-mail and even free Internet
access. Now, a financial Web site by the name of Stockjungle.com
may have hit upon the ultimate Internet giveaway. It plans to offer
a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fund that does not charge investors a
management or distribution fee or any other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Witz, 27, chief executive of Stockjungle.com of
Culver City, Calif., would not comment on the purpose behind the
no-cost fund because it is in registration. But a fund with zero
expenses would be likely to draw viewers to the Web site, and
potential customers to the three other funds that the company plans
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission these three funds will charge expenses of 1 percent of
assets annually.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the free offering, called the Stockjungle.com Free
S&AMP;P 500 Index fund, will have to make some sacrifices. All fund
reports, statements and prospectuses must be downloaded or viewed
electronically, according to the statement, and investors will
receive their account balance notifications electronically as well.
But shareholders will not have to buy or sell fund shares on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the Fund's no-cost feature, the investor has
the opportunity to realize a return on investment equivalent to the
return of the S&AMP;P 500 index as opposed to investing in other S&AMP;P
index funds, which charge investors for investment management,
brokerage commissions, transaction fees or other costs of investing
and which provide a return adversely affected by such fees and
expenses,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund carries a 2 percent redemption fee for shares held less
than 120 days. It has a minimum initial investment of $200 and
interestingly, a maximum investment of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other Stockjungle.com offerings are the Market Leaders Growth
fund, a concentrated fund that will acquire shares in companies
with strong competitive positions, and the Pure Play Internet fund,
which will buy shares of Internet companies with the largest market
capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth offering, the Community Intelligence fund, will invest
in companies that have been pitched by visitors to the
Stockjungle.com Web site, which is still in development. Part of
the site has been designated a ``community forum'' where visitors
will post investment ideas and short written analyses about
companies. The stocks will be screened by the adviser, a subsidiary
of Stockjungle.com. &QL;

`TALK' ARTICLE PAINTS UNFLATTERING PICTURE OF BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's foul-mouthed, oblivious to his own record
on abortion and derisive about his role in the execution of pickax
murderer Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   This is the unflattering picture of Gov. George W. Bush depicted
in the first issue of ``Talk'' magazine _ a portrayal that has
prompted criticism from Bush's rivals and a lengthy response from
the Bush for President campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush aide said writer Tucker Carlson ``misread'' the governor
but did not deny any specific quotation that Carlson recorded.
Carlson said he misread nothing and reported accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Devil May Care,'' the article describes Bush as an
independent-minded candidate who, unlike President Clinton, doesn't
seem to care whether people like him. Carlson's conclusion is that
Bush may be the ``one candidate who doesn't need to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   The story points out that Bush is not known as a ``detail man.''
Indeed, in one exchange, Bush could not say whether abortions had
increased or decreased since he took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably down,'' he is quoted as saying. ``Not because of
anything we've done, though. We haven't passed any laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, abortions declined by 7 percent between 1994 and 1998,
according to Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, who credits Bush
initiatives on issues such as abstinence and adoption.
</P>
<P>
   There's also some colorful language in the piece, most notably
the ``F-word,'' attributed to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Former talk show host Pat Buchanan, a candidate for the GOP
nomination, told Fox News he was ``mildly astonished'' at Bush's
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no saints in this business, but I would urge the
governor for his own good to clean up the language in these
interviews,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that neither Bush nor any staffers recalled Bush
using foul language but that it was inappropriate if he did.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial passage is the exchange about Tucker,
whose case sparked international pleas for mercy. Her execution in
February 1998 drew news crews from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carlson, Bush brought up the subject as the two
were riding in a car together after the governor delivered a speech
in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling Tucker's appearance on CNN's ``Larry King Live''
shortly before her execution, Bush is quoted as saying: King
``asked her real difficult questions, like `What would you say to
Governor Bush?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson wrote that Bush, imitating Tucker by whimpering with his
``lips pursed in mock desperation,'' responded: ``Please don't kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   No such exchange occurred between King and Tucker during the
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the Bush spokeswoman, said the Tucker case was
``difficult and emotional'' for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporter must have misread Governor Bush's reaction to his
question, because Governor Bush did not and would not ever make fun
of the serious and difficult responsibility of enforcing the death
penalty,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, who usually writes for the conservative ``Weekly
Standard,'' said he was not trying to comment on Bush's ``state of
mind at the time of execution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was merely recording his reaction to me in a car,'' Carlson
said. ``That's what I saw and I didn't misread it. I reported it
accurately.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you had to choose between a Mercedes E55 and a Jaguar XJR,
it's unlikely that you'd study the mileage or kick the tires,
especially since getting a solid toe onto an ultra-low-profile
sidewall could be painful.
</P>
<P>
   At this price level, around 70 Gs, the few thousands that
separate the Jag and the Merc are negligible, and lovers of
sophisticated power will find plenty in both. Top speed and 0-to-60
times on these luxury rockets are much the same _ both are
electronically limited to 155 miles an hour, and both reach 60 in
about 5 seconds, albeit in different ways. The Mercedes has a big
5.5-liter V8; the XJR bolts an intercooled supercharger onto
Jaguar's 4-liter V8.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, you could go crazy trying to chose. But I suspect
that a lot of those who buy one of these cars have very little
trouble deciding. Once you're prepared to spend this much money,
the criteria that count are probably not value or gas mileage or
even the number of cup holders. At this level, you decide who you
think you are, and which automotive philosophy best represents you.
</P>
<P>
   There are those for whom Connolly leathers, burled walnut and
the timeless beauty of the low Jaguar silhouette are the
fulfillment of automotive art, a celebration of tradition, charm
and elegance. They may opt for more power, or more technology, but
the package will be pronounced ``JAG-yew-are,'' and the color of
choice will be a rich, dark hew, like the deep maroon XJR test car.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to Syracuse scarcely put the 370 horses and 18-by-8-inch
wheels to the test, but the sheer delight of sinking into those
creamy seats, fondling the walnut steering wheel and catching the
admiring glances was pleasure enough. It was all so delightfully
British _ a bit quirky, in the tradition of the leather belt
holding down the bonnet of a Morgan; a bit archaic and cramped, but
impeccably polite and proper, even when charged with extraordinary
power. And above all, self-confidently distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   It may be risky in this age of transnational automotive mergers
to speak of national automotive philosophies, but they are hard to
deny. If the Jaguar demands a deep, dark color, the magnificant
German machines from Mercedes, BMW and Audi look most natural in
something approaching brushed aluminum. If Britain celebrates
classic beauty and rich tradition, Germany carries the banner of
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   I confess this is where my preference lies _ I have had German
cars as disparate as a Golf, a Passat and a Mercedes, and they have
all shared a sense of precision, purposefulness and the primacy of
function and technology over marketing. To my mind, the current
Audi sedans stand at the pinnacle of German auto making; when I see
one, I wonder how it will be improved upon.
</P>
<P>
   Having plunged this far into stereotyping, why stop? There are
the Swedish cars, cavernous, practical and glowing with
richeousness. France may have abandoned yellow headlights, but her
cars still coddle you with the most hedonistic seats and
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Italians worship style in their conveyance _ an Alfa Romeo may
not be the fastest thing on the Autostrada, but it will surely emit
the most sensuous sounds from the most sculptured bodies. As for
the Japanese, one can only marvel at how the Honda Accord and
Toyota Camry have come to be virtually indistinguishable in the
predictability of their design, in the perfection of their
execution and in the utter absence of anything objectionable or
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Whom have I failed to offend? Ah, yes, the Americans, who put
ill-fitting steel on their fantasies and called them cars, who made
automobiles look like spaceships and turned vans into psychedelic
motels, who put huge V8s into flimsy sedans and argue that safety
means crawling at 55 mph or screwing a third taillight into the
rear window.
</P>
<P>
   Now we travel around in truck-van hybrids on elephantine tires
with names that evoke high adventure, though most plunge into the
wilderness about as often as a '57 Plymouth Fury flew into space.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, a sport utility is what I drive. It ain't practical, it
guzzles gas, it's noisy and the ride is terrible, but it cost me
$50,000 less than an XJR and I don't crunch my teeth driving
through a pothole. &QL;

08-12 -- Andrea Zittel's ``A-Z Deserted Islands'' are spending the
summer floating in the Central Park Pond. What makes a tour of this

produced between art and the urban environment. (Librado Romero/New

 &HT;    Connecting through Ohio's Little Miami bike trail
 &HT;    By Jill Inkrott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Some of the sleepy village's 1,206 residents
gather on their porches, drinking lemonade, sitting on lawn chairs
and watching the waves of heat radiating from the asphalt. The
narrow houses, built in another time, sit close together and push
almost onto the street. Morrow, where it seems that the hands on
the clock have frozen, hardly looks like an international tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But in a small ice-cream and refreshment shop in the lower level
of one of the homes, there sits a book on a stand. It is about as
thick as the ``M'' encyclopedia, and the pages have begun to
yellow. On the pages, there are thousands of signatures of visitors
to Morrow _ visitors from Australia, Russia, Spain, England,
Ireland, Kenya and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come specifically to use the bike trail,'' said Jenny
Lykins, the co-owner of Capricorn's Refresh Stop, a welcome break
along the Little Miami Scenic Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Miami Scenic Trail, the longest of its kind in Ohio,
stretches just less than 70 miles from Milford, near Cincinnati,
north to Springfield in Clark County.
</P>
<P>
   The southern portion of the fully paved trail extends under an
almost full canopy of leaves. Even in the blistering heat of late,
only patches of sunlight manage to filter through the foliage of
the trees, creating small pools of yellow on the blacktop.
</P>
<P>
   Shrieks of joy from teen-agers tipping one another's canoes or
families splashing in the river can occasionally be heard among the
songs of birds and wings of insects. North through Corwin, a small
dot on the map in northern Warren County, the river is almost
always visible. It's a sickly green color in spots, but soothing
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   After Corwin and into Greene County, the trail travels through
farmland and through town in Xenia, but the remainder of the trail
is sheltered on at least one side by a wall of trees before ending
in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone's benefit
</P>
<P>
   In Greene County alone, an estimated 265,000 people use the
Little Miami Scenic Trail annually, said Jim Schneider, trail
manager and assistant director of Greene County Parks, and usage is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly buying enough toilet paper for the public
restrooms,'' said David Heckler, village manager of Yellow Springs,
where a new station has been built to provide bike-trail users
water fountains and restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   During weekdays, the trail is fairly deserted and calm. Every
four miles or so, one may encounter a die-hard biker, dressed in a
yellow jersey and dreaming of the Tour de France. In the evenings
and on weekends, a more diverse crowd assembles. Rollerbladers,
whether struggling for balance or straining to increase speed,
weave around groups of walkers gossiping, families biking and
loners running. Along the way, one might pass a grandmother slowing
pedaling with a basket hanging from her handlebar, and then, a mile
later, a musclebound man bulging out of his tank top and pumping
ferociously on a bike that looks like it will buckle under his
weight. An occasional member of the Cincinnati Cyclones might skate
past on rollerblades, training for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The bike trail's fans come for a variety of reasons, from the
beauty of the surroundings to the health benefits of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. I don't know why I didn't start sooner,'' said
Linda Skinner of Xenia, a real-estate agent who just started biking
on the trail. ``When you come out here, you don't think about
work.''
</P>
<P>
   And bikers and bladers don't have to think too much about
traffic either, because motorized vehicles are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety is the biggest factor,'' said Bill Landefeld of
Bellbrook, who has biked and rollerbladed on the trail for seven
years. ``If I had to watch for cars, I wouldn't rollerblade.''
</P>
<P>
   That safety is key for families, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to ride in the city with kids,'' said Billie Huffman
of Northridge, who was joined by her husband, two daughters and two
nephews visiting from Oklahoma. The youngest, Courtney, 8, was
thrilled to see cows, a deer, and rabbits along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost ran over three chipmunks,'' said Ryan Stott of
Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature can sometimes provide other obstacles, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we got stuck in a thunderstorm, and there were
like four tornadoes in the area, and we took shelter under a piece
of cardboard that we found,'' Stott said. ``And a month ago, we got
caught in another storm, and we waited it out under some lady's
porch.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not every homeowner provides a porch when needed,
friendliness is commonplace along the trail. Almost everyone offers
a hello, a nod or a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's business
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nice little stops along the way, like the Corwin
Peddler and and Capricorn's for ice cream,'' said David Stott,
Ryan's father.
</P>
<P>
   The trail, which follows the path of abandoned railroad tracks,
was designed to run through those small towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of trails are more remote,'' Schneider said. ``Ours
connects people and places in parks, towns, schools and shopping
areas. It's a means of transport and recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   With that connection has come economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done a lot of wonders for Yellow Springs,'' said Stephan
Penny, while repairing a rollerblader's skate at the Caboose Bike &AMP;
Skate Rental.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it in the small things, a new sign there or a new coat
of paint here,'' said Dan Young, co-owner of Young's Jersey Dairy,
which sits just off the trail outside Yellow Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The Village Cyclery, also in Yellow Springs, was in business for
27 years, but when the bike trail was built from Xenia to Yellow
Springs in 1990, sales increased about 50 percent and have stayed
up, said co-owner Marcia Spariosu.
</P>
<P>
   But businesses not directly related to athletics have seen an
increase, too.
</P>
<P>
   Young has needed to add bike racks to service those coming for
treat after sweaty hours on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Several businesses have sprouted because of the bike trail. The
Corwin Peddler is now serving Young's ice cream for its fourth
year, said Celeste Ryan, part owner. The few hundred residents of
Corwin could not support the shop alone, but with the bike trail,
business is good.
</P>
<P>
   Lykins, with her husband and co-owner Clarence Coffinberger,
decided to open Capricorn's 10 years ago to take advantage of the
bike trail, which at that time ran only from Loveland to Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most businesses only last three or four years, and we've been
here for nine,'' said Lykins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trail is our business,'' Coffinberger added.
</P>
<P>
   Building on success
</P>
<P>
   More towns are looking to benefit from the trail. The next
expected expansion will be north to Urbana, although that is
several years away, said Sharon Todd, assistant coordinator of the
Bicycle/Pedestrian Program for the Ohio Department of
Transportation. Eventually, though, the trail might connect with
others like it to form the Ohio-Erie Trail, extending from
Cincinnati to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of the Little Miami Scenic Trail, 12.6 miles from
Loveland to Morrow, was built in 1983, and the longest stretch,
from Morrow to Hedges Road, was completed in 1994. The latest
addition was the 10 miles connecting Yellow Springs to Springfield,
finished in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for replacing the old abandoned railroad tracks with
bike trails expanded in 1986 with the birth of the Rails-to-Trails
Conservancy, a national program that provides communities with
technical and promotional support in building bike trails. To keep
the history of the railroads alive, the water and restroom stops,
including the newly opened Xenia and Yellow Springs stations, are
designed as old-fashioned railroad stations. Xenia Station, too,
has displays of historic memorabilia and a caboose outside.
</P>
<P>
   County park districts and individual municipalities are
responsible for the upkeep of trails, but in Ohio, the Department
of Transportation provides 80 percent of the initial building costs
through a federal match grant program called the Transportation
Equity Act for the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   TEA21, a six-year funding program, developed from increased
demand for bike trails, said Jim Deming, the director of the Ohio
Rails-to-Trails field office in Worthington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity has increased as towns and cities have begun to
understand how beneficial the trails really are,'' said Deming.
``Vying for money to build the trails has become competitive.
Everyone wants to have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has seen growth in the trails, with new ones popping up in
Mansfield and the Columbus area, but paved bike trails, especially
one as long as the Little Miami, are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved to North Carolina six years ago, and they have nothing
like this,'' said Bryan Waid, a visiting Charlotte resident and
competitive cyclist.
</P>
<P>
   Spariosu, of the Village Cyclery, is one who would like to see
the biking trend continue, not only to help her business, but to
bring people back to cycling and a healthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't put a dollar value on how the trail enhances the
community and quality of life.''

   A new academic study may finally put to rest the notion, once
widely held, that the financial markets efficiently price all
securities, all the time. Given the recent carnage in
Internet-related stocks, it seems appropriate that the study's case
rests on the behavior of a group of stocks whose issuers may have
tried too hard to take advantage of Internet mania.
</P>
<P>
   It was not so many years ago that the doctrine of market
efficiency, the so-called efficient-markets hypothesis, was the
prevailing orthodoxy among this country's finance professors.
Accepting the hypothesis means accepting that all money managers'
attempts to beat the markets are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Though many people have grown skeptical of the theory, a
surprising number of believers still devote a lot of energy to
explaining away any evidence of market inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   But this new study, ``A Rose.com by Any Other Name,'' by Michael
J. Cooper and P. Raghavendra Rau, assistant professors of finance
at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and one of their
graduate students, Orlin Dimitrov, provides evidence of
inefficiency that even the most die-hard believers in efficient
markets should find hard to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and his co-authors studied 63 companies that from the
beginning of 1998 to March 26 of this year changed their names to
include Web-oriented designations like ``.com,'' ``.net'' or the
word ``Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, over the two weeks after their name changes were
announced, the companies saw their shares gain 125 percent more
than those of their peers, the study said. The authors were careful
to filter out companies whose gain could be attributed to other
causes, like a good earnings report or merger rumors.
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult to explain away this result. A name change
has nothing to do with the profitability of the company. But
believers in market efficiency are not likely to give up without a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The main argument Cooper anticipates is that the new names may
in fact reflect a major shift in business _ that the companies were
becoming more involved with the Internet. The rise in their stock
prices thus would have nothing to do with the name changes per se
but would instead reflect the market's judgment about the
profitability of their future Internet business. Because this
judgment is not obviously wrong on its face, the market's behavior
cannot be used to prove market inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But the study _ available on the Web at
www.mgmt.purdue.edu/mcooper/newpapers/dotcom.pdf _ was designed to
pre-empt this argument. It isolated companies in the group whose
core businesses have nothing to do with the Internet and then
compared their performances with those of the companies in the
group whose core businesses were Web-related.
</P>
<P>
   If the market was efficient in setting the prices of Internet
stocks, the companies with no Internet association should have
experienced smaller gains after their name changes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper found no such pattern. On the contrary, there was no
difference in the performances of these two groups of rechristened
companies. The only possible explanation is that investors have
been willing to throw their money at almost anything that claimed
an Internet link.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that markets are inefficient, however, doesn't mean
that beating them is easy. From the fact that the market is
sometimes inefficient, you can't conclude that it is always so. In
fact, the markets remain quite efficient, especially for the stocks
and bonds of the biggest and best-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stocks in the study were relatively little known and
had small market capitalizations, the kind of stocks for which one
would expect the market to be least efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Internet examples, though extraordinary, are not
unique. The study's authors found examples of the phenomenon dating
back several centuries. Because beating the market requires
identifying pockets of inefficiency, it is heartening to receive
rigorous statistical evidence that such pockets exist. &QL;

ENERGY CHIEF URGES SANCTIONS AGAINST SOME LAB OFFICIALS AFTER
ESPIONAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has recommended
disciplinary action against a former director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory and two other current or former officials there
for failing to handle properly the espionage investigation at the
lab, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson acted in response to a critical new report by the
department's inspector general that focused on the actions of 19
current or former officials at Los Alamos and at Energy Department
headquarters who were involved in investigating evidence that China
may have stolen nuclear secrets from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the report's findings, Richardson recommended
disciplinary action against Siegfried Hecker, director of Los
Alamos from 1986 to 1997, who still works there as a scientist. He
also recommended to the current lab director, John Brown, that
disciplinary action be taken against Terry Craig, until recently a
counterintelligence team leader at the lab, and Robert Vrooman,
former chief of counterintelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Craig is still employed at the lab; Vrooman has retired but
continues to work for a lab contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Hecker did not return telephone calls; Vrooman could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The form of discipline is up to Brown, but officials say Craig
could be fired and Vrooman's relationship with the lab could be
ended. It is unclear what Hecker faces.
</P>
<P>
   The full report is classified and does not assign specific blame
to any of the 19 people cited. But it does include ``implied
criticism'' of the actions of former Energy Secretary Federico Pena
and former Deputy Energy Secretary Elizabeth Moler for not being
more aggressive in handling the investigation, officials familiar
with the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of mounting criticism of the government's
investigation into the espionage case, Richardson had vowed to take
action against Energy Department officials who contributed to the
debacle, but he decided to wait and base his actions on the
inspector general's review.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report points out problems all around in the handling of
this investigation,'' he said in an interview Thursday. ``It shows
that there was a lack of accountability, unclear communication and
dysfunctional reporting relationships within the department. I'm
frustrated that there are not clearer answers to the problems, but
I'm confident that our report is as hard-hitting as we can get on
this very sorry chapter of the performance of the United States
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he would act soon on the recommendations, but
cautioned: ``I must ensure fairness in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, a Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, the FBI's chief
suspect in the espionage investigation was fired for security
violations at the lab. He has not been charged with any crime, and
he has denied that he spied for China. After he was fired,
government investigators found that he had conducted unauthorized
transfers of nuclear secrets from a classified computer system at
Los Alamos into an unclassified network.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in New Mexico has been considering whether to
seek an indictment against Lee for the mishandling of classified
information based on the computer transfers. Lee has stated that he
conducted those transfers to protect the data as part of his job at
Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report focuses on the handling of the
investigation of Lee, and particularly the failure of senior
officials to restrict his access to classified material or to
monitor his computer use long after he came under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hecker was cited for failing to follow through on ``an express
request by senior management to develop a plan for limiting the
suspect's access, for failing to inform department's management
that the plan had failed, and for failing to take alternative
actions to limit the suspect's access,'' according to a statement
issued by Richardson. It did not identify Hecker by name, but
officials did.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman was cited for allowing Lee access to nuclear secrets
after he was told in October 1997 that the FBI did not have enough
evidence to arrest Lee, so there was no investigative reason to
keep Lee in his sensitive job.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who was not identified in the statement, was cited for
failing to carry out an adequate search of Los Alamos records to
determine whether Lee had signed a waiver allowing government
officials to search and monitor his office computer. Lee signed the
waiver in April 1995. The Justice Department had determined the
waiver was needed before the FBI could seek court authorization to
electronically monitor Lee's computer.

REWORKING EDUCATION IN A VIRTUAL SCHOOLHOUSE

   Back in 1972, when he was a social studies teacher-in-training
at Concordia University in Seward, Neb., Brian Mueller envisioned a
life of mentoring eager adolescents, coaching their basketball
team, grading papers and issuing lavatory passes. And there would
be those long, lazy days of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents emphasized education,'' he recalled. ``Out of eight
children, seven of us became teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   But since then, it's been Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and hello,
education dot-com. Instead of running a classroom of 20 teen-agers,
Mueller oversees the education of 10,000 online students, all
adults, of the for-profit University of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, 45, exemplifies the professionals in many fields whose
work objectives have remained constant while the way they work has
been transformed by technology. He still considers himself an
educator, but for him, few of the verities of his teacher-training
days still apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed in the more than two decades since I
went to college,'' Mueller said. ``People need to attend classes
while traveling for business. And they don't want to wait for a new
semester to start or to worry about not being able to get into the
classes they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Correspondence courses have been around since the 1800s, when
rural students used them to cobble together makeshift education
through the mails. More recently, some were known for
advertisements in the backs of magazines and inside matchbooks, and
the reputation of the field was dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Though some diploma mills still operate, the Internet has made
distance learning downright trendy and has drawn more and more
legitimate schools into the field. Studies of whether it is as
effective as traditional classroom instruction have been
inconclusive, but for students with families and busy lives are
grateful for its convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller spent seven years as a high school teacher and then four
teaching education courses back at Concordia. In 1987 he became the
enrollment director at the University of Phoenix and moved his
family to Arizona. He and his wife, Paula, have four sons, ages 10
to 16.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, he liked the atmosphere of his new
workplace. Because professional managers make decisions for the
school that are the subject of faculty debate at other
universities, he said, decision-making and implementation are
speedier, and there is a greater appetite for innovation and risk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mueller was promoted to campus director at the Phoenix
campus of the university. He became the manager of the burgeoning
online degree program in 1997. ``It's hard-driving and lots of
hours, but I feel creative, and it's also a fun place to work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his program, students and teachers interact by fax, e-mail,
World Wide Web, one- and two-way satellite and video.
Appropriately, many of the students are pursuing degrees in data
base management, business systems analysis and Web management.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Phoenix, founded in 1976, is a subsidiary of
Apollo Group Inc., a publicly held company also based in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The university is accredited and has 13 campuses around the
country, most of them in rented space, where it serves 55,000
students who attend class in person. It specializes in adult
education, admitting no one under 23 or without work experience.
</P>
<P>
   Though it will not suit someone looking for an Ivy League
education. online learning has its niche. Donald H. (Skip) Albee,
38, the owner of an insurance agency in Trachy, Calif., just earned
an online MBA through the University of Phoenix. He would have
faced a long drive to a campus offering the global-management
classes he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he logged on at home early in the morning to do his
schoolwork before the family _ a wife and two young daughters _
woke up. An added benefit came from fellow students around the
globe e-mailing their international perspectives back to the
virtual classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy was a FedEx manager working down in Caracas and
contributed fantastic information about doing business in Venezuela
and other Latin American countries,'' Albee said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mueller, doesn't he long for the occasional apple on his
desk and the long summer vacations? ``The only Apples I see now are
computers,'' he said. As for summers off, those are also a thing of
the past. At his online university, the school year never ends.

JOHNSON: MONDESI IN NO-WIN SITUATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The day after Raul Mondesi's blowup, Los Angeles
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson downplayed the incident but made one
thing clear.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Mondesi needs to mature and that it's
pointless to confront him because he will win all confrontations
with players.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi _ who started in right field Thursday and went 1 for 5 _
didn't talk to reporters after the team's 10-5 victory over the
Montreal Expos, which wrapped up a 10-game, three-city road trip.
Instead, he issued a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, though, had plenty to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe everything happens for a reason, so this probably
had to come to a head where there was a couple of wills clashing
together,'' Johnson said. ``I'm going to win. You either accept
that, and accept the responsibility that goes with that, and if you
don't, then it's a failure. We finally understand each other, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy way is to say, `No, you're outta here.' But that
means I haven't gotten him to understand the way we have to be to
win. I'm easygoing and protect my players, to a certain degree, and
then I draw the line. If we're going to be anything, we have to be
on the same page. Just because somebody badmouthed me doesn't mean
I have to resort to a senseless bashing of him. Because I know him.
He got some bad advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers teammates attempted to keep Mondesi from going public
with his profanity-laced comments but to no avail. On Wednesday
Mondesi did not start for the second consecutive day as punishment
for arriving late for the team's stretch on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want me here, bring in somebody else and let me
go someplace,'' Mondesi said Wednesday. ``I told my agent, `Get me
the (expletive) out of here as soon as possible.' I can't take this
(expletive) any more. I can't deal with it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mondesi `asked' for forgiveness in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want apologize to (general manager) Kevin Malone, Davey
Johnson, my teammates, and most importantly, to Dodger fans for the
comments I made (Wednesday),'' the statement said. ``In what has
been a frustrating season, I let my emotions get the best of me. I
am thankful the fans in Los Angeles have stood behind me throughout
my career and I will continue to play hard for the Dodgers. I am
truly sorry this has been a distraction for my teammates and the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a series of incidents involving the team's
talented right fielder, who has incurred fines for numerous
violations of team rules. Johnson has downplayed Mondesi's
displeasure with being moved in the batting order and barely
discussed Mondesi's visit to the bullpen instead of the bench
during a half-inning in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably gotten away with some things in the past,''
Johnson said. ``It's time to mature because he's a hell of a
ballplayer. He knows how to play the game. A little more
preparation, a little more preparedness, and then he can lead by
example, but he wasn't going to do it the way it was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said Mondesi is having to deal with his frustrations
publicly for the first time because the Dodgers system coddles
younger players. Mondesi entered this season with a career batting
average of .295 but is hitting .247 after a prolonged slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spring training was my first with the Dodgers and it's
like a luxury, having steak and lobster for the spread,'' Dodgers
left fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``All guys should struggle early.
I came in the same time as (Ken) Griffey (Jr.), and we both
struggled. It prepared us for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson expected Mondesi, a Gold Glover and All-Star, to serve
as an example for Angel Pena and Adrian Beltre. Instead, Mondesi
scoffed at rules and has been upset since being removed from the
third spot in the batting order before the team even left spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get across to him things I wanted to do, leadership
I wanted him to provide,'' Johnson said. ``Hopefully, this is a big
learning experience for him, and maybe for this he'll be a better
player. . . My job with the player is to kind of educate them on
the reality of your role. If I can accomplish that in a blow-up,
then I accomplished what I needed to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gloves came off and all the coddling you do is over, which
probably makes everyone breathe easier.''

 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Europe, the Mercedes is sometimes called ``the world's best
taxicab.'' That's tongue-in-cheek, of course, like calling ``War
and Peace'' a nice yarn, but not without substance.
</P>
<P>
   Long before ``German sedan'' came to evoke images of magnificent
machines hurtling down the Autobahn, the quintessential Teutonic
vehicle, at least in most of the world outside these United States,
was a vault on wheels with ``Taxi'' on the roof, a clattering
diesel over the front wheels and a three-pointed star on the hood.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the E55, a car obviously intended to push the taxi image
far to the back of the cranial cavity _ or to give a totally new
meaning to the concept of ``world's best.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's likely that any cabbie would fork over the
$70,000-odd required to displace the diesel with 5,439 cubic
centimeters of fire-breathing muscle under that star, but such is
the conservatism of the people in Stuttgart that if it was yellow
and had a taxi sign, most passers-by would not immediately suspect
that they were ambling past something very, very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   If they're into such things, the sweet burble of eight straining
pistons and the suspiciously large pair of oval tailpipes peeping
from under the bumper might raise some suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there would be the way the car disappears once the light
changes. And if the driver had disabled the stability-control
system, they might find themselves in a cloud of freshly
incinerated Pirelli rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Raw power, of course, is no great shakes these days. What makes
the E55 such a delight is that the 349 horses and 391 foot-pounds
of torque do not come at the expense of what a Mercedes is all
about. I drove an E-Class for more than eight years in Germany and
Russia, with half the pistons and significantly less than half the
displacement of the E55, equipped the way Germans prefer _ with
manual transmission, manual windows and a manual seat.
</P>
<P>
   (In Germany, a driver exists to serve the Machine, and there is
still a segment of the population that bridles at the notion that a
car should be made to shift gears or open windows.)
</P>
<P>
   I learned to love the rock-hard seats, especially after hours on
a Russian ``highway'' requiring total concentration; to have the
gauges, pedals and headlight switch so perfectly placed. I came to
tolerate the oversized steering wheel, knowing that although I
could never understand it, there was probably a solid reason,
achieved after a million hours of testing, for exactly that radius.
</P>
<P>
   Though woefully underpowered, the old 230E was as reliable on a
dash from Bonn to Frankfurt at 110 mph as it was sunk to its door
handles in Russian mud, not a gooey drop of which oozed through the
doors.
</P>
<P>
   All right, I did lose an oil pan on a country road. But it
wasn't the car's fault.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to my Spartan 230E, or perhaps in compensation for
it, the magnificant black E55 test car had every contemporary bell
and whistle a carriage of this price range must have, including a
Smartkey locking system, an electric rear window sunshade, black
maple trim and an automatic speed-sensitive volume control for the
numerous Bose speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To their great credit, however, the Germans still believe that a
driver is perfectly capable of deciding when to turn on the
headlights, which is especially nice because switching on these
xenon-gas lanterns gives an inkling of what the Creator might have
felt when He created light out of darkness. It's as if the car is
preceded by a perfect rectangle of daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the huge difference in power, sophistication and
convenience, I felt a strong blast from the past as soon as the
heavy door closed with that unmistakable Mercedes finality. To be
sure, driving these ultra-low-profile Z-rated tires onto raw
Russian roads would be as wise as wearing Cinderella's glass
slipper on the Appalachian Trail, but there was no mistaking that
Mercedes feel of extravagant overengineering.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Germans expect when they pay more _ not more
gadgets, but more engineering. And if a crew of engineers was set
loose on an E-Class sedan _ as they were at AMG, the in-house
customizers at Mercedes _ they'd put 90 percent of their effort
into things like a magnesium two-stage resonance intake manifold.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the stuff Americans like to hear: What happens when you
mash the pedal to the floor. Before I got the car, I had been
forewarned to make sure the street ahead was clear before nudging
the accelerator the first time. Unlike so many of its siblings,
which take forever off the line, this thing generates peak torque
at 3,000 r.p.m., and the speedometer needle is zipping past 60 in
about 5 seconds. Not that I timed it.
</P>
<P>
   But I did do some pedal-stomping up in the Adirondacks.
Something akin to a war erupts as the brains of the Electronic
Stability Program struggle to restrain the engine's cast-alloy
pistons. Disarm the thing, and it huffily lights a huge orange
``ESP'' on the dash to remind you that you're on your own. Stomp!
The glorious squeal of automotive adolescence goes on and on.
Through the silly grin of a baby-boomer, I found myself murmuring,
``Not bad, Fritz, not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   After this first display of irresponsibility, my wife and I
slipped off the Northway and onto a twisty stretch of old Route 9.
I took the curves faster, faster, faster, building admiration and
confidence with every turn. I never did figure out whether I went
fast enough to get the ESP involved, but I suspect my nerves called
it quits long before the sensors felt it necessary to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is still a Mercedes, not a sports car. Despite some
modest add-ons at front, side and rear, the AMG steering wheel is
still a bit too big; the gray-on-black-leather sport seats are
sporty, but not really snug, and with me and my wife aboard, the
car weighs more than two tons. That's not criticism. People who buy
Mercedeses, whether taxicabs or AMG-massaged rockets, expect to get
Mercedeses, with everything that entails, from the humbling
``thunk'' of the doors to the depth of the paint.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a Mercedes brochure in the 1980s that explained that
the guiding philosophy was to build a car that did not encourage
savage driving, but was capable of taking it in stride. After
breaking the law repeatedly and extensively in the E55, I would
argue that Mercedes has wandered a bit from its 1980s thinking, but
this is a car you will not mistake for a Porsche. And if you
mistake it for a taxicab, it won't be for long. &QL;

   SHARES OF CLOROX PLUNGE ON WARNING OF LOWER PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Clorox, the maker of bleach, Pine Sol cleaners and SOS scrubbing
pads, surprised investors with an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter
revenue and warnings of huge charges and lower profits ahead.
Stunned stockholders made their disappointment clear, sending the
company's shares down $16.8125, or 16.3 percent, to $86.4375 on
heavy volume. The stock dropped despite fourth-quarter earnings
that were in line with analysts' expectations.

   UNUSUAL ALLIES CHALLENGING AT&AMP;T
</P>
<P>
   Unusual alliances are being formed in the dispute over which

   REYNOLDS TAKEOVER BATTLE EMERGES
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a takeover battle for Reynolds Metals arose when
executives in the planned merger of Alcan Aluminum of Canada and
two European rivals suggested they might try to outbid Alcoa's $5.6
billion hostile offer. The hints dropped by Jacques Bougie, chief
executive of Alcan, and Jean-Pierre Rodier, chairman of Pechiney of
France, further roiled the aluminum industry.
</P>
<P>
   Paul H. O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, is often described as
``maverick,'' ``stickler,'' even ``ruthless.'' But rarely does
``poker player'' enter the vocabulary. Still, that may just be the
role O'Neill is playing as he waits to see what Reynolds Metals'

PLAYERS APPROVE OF MEDINAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Hey! There's a golf tournament going on out
here. Remember?
</P>
<P>
   It's not all about the Great Ryder Cup Debate. Some people
actually came here to play for the 81st PGA championship, and some
of those people are pretty good. This is, you might be surprised to
know, a better overall field than you'll find at the Masters, US
Open, or British Open. Ninety-two of the top 100 players in the
world are here, which makes it the most potent field in the history
of golfkind. But it's the PGA and even if they had 100 out of 100
in attendance it would not have the cachet of the other majors.
It's the ugly stepsister of the majors, and probably always will
be.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm going to call this edition the ``Happy Major.'' We have
all gotten accustomed to the perpetual moaning and groaning
attendant to every major. More and more it seems the story of a
modern major is the ``tricked up'' course that most people deem to
be ``unfair.'' You don't hear any of that at Medinah, and never
mind that at 7,401 yards it is the longest sea level course in the
history of majors.
</P>
<P>
   These guys actually like this place. What fun is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intriguing in the fact that a lot of the holes out there
are doglegged,'' says Tiger Woods, who Thursday began his pursuit
of career major No. 2 with a satisfactory 2-under-par 70. ``I
thoroughly enjoy that. I enjoy shaping my ball both ways (i.e. left
to right and right to left) and working it, and I think that's part
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   All Tiger asks _ all any of them ask _ is that a course
submitting itself for their perusal at a major be ``fair.'' They
want to be challenged, but not too challenged. Of course, not
everyone knows, or can agree upon, just exactly what ``fair'' is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the definition of fair is,'' admits Justin
Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion, who checked in with a
first-round 73. ``There's always going to be luck involved in the
game, and two guys miss a fairway, one by a yard and has no shot,
and the other by 5 yards and has a decent lie. Is that fair? I
think (fair is) providing a test that challenges every shot and at
the same time is within certain boundaries. But I don't know. It's
hard for me to say what's fair and what's not.''
</P>
<P>
   A universal definition of what was most decidedly not fair can
be summed up in one word, a word that has the ring of an obscenity
when emitted from the lips of the pros. That word is
``Carnoustie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard wonderful compliments about it being the toughest of
all British Open golf courses,'' says Greg Norman. ``And we really
didn't get to play it under the way Carnoustie should have been
played. By putting in bunkering on a par 5 and putting in a new tee
on a couple of other holes, they changed the characteristics of how
the golf course should be played. I'm not a believer in making
players tee off with a 2-iron off a par 5 just to keep it in
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The fairways were absurdly narrow and the rough was fiendishly
thick. ``I don't think we'll ever see fairways that narrow as long
as we live,'' says Davis Love, who got off to an acceptable start
here with a 1-under 71. ``It was unfortunate the golf course played
that way, but I don't think it will ever happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   What really aggravated most people was that they felt they had
been duped. As Norman implies, this wasn't the Carnoustie they had
always heard about. ``I'm going back to play the real Carnoustie as
soon as I can,'' insists Phil Mickelson (an opening-round 72).
</P>
<P>
   Medinah No. 3 was designed back in the '20s by Tom Bendelow. It
has been given a face lift by Roger Rulewich, whose big feat was to
redesign the par-3 17th into a completely new hole. But the
essentials remain, and the distinguishing characteristic of this
lengthy layout is its rolling terrain. If you ever want to see a
golf course undulate, then just perambulate yourself around
Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   It's long, but sheer length doesn't faze too many of these
people. Nothing bothered 19-year-old Sergio Garcia (6-under 66).
That's quite clear. It pretty much played its enormous length
Thursday, because it was a wet day. In drier circumstances the
7,401 can shrink in a hurry. I mean, Tiger says that with a little
downwind and a little luck he might be able to drive the first
hole. The first hole is a 388-yard par 4.
</P>
<P>
   There were many good scores here Thursday, but that doesn't mean
there will continue to be good scores in the remaining three
rounds. It is supposed to get sunnier, for one thing. And it just
isn't going to happen, for another thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every major championship that I've seen on TV,'' says
Tiger, ``there's always an inordinate amount of low rounds early in
the first day. After that, you start to see it spread out a little
bit. It just starts to thin out, I think, when the golf course
becomes more difficult, as well as the pressure playing in a major
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The players like Medinah because it has a strong, identifiable
personality without being a circus. ``Here is a golf course that's
not excessively long but keeps the philosophy of its playability,''
Norman points out. ``I like to see the philosophy of the golf
course, the integrity of the golf course, and the playability of
the golf course maintained. I don't like to see interference by
man.''
</P>
<P>
   At the last big championship waged at Medinah, locals clucked a
bit because the winning scores logged by 72-hole leaders Hale Irwin
and Mike Donald were 8 under. But the wind kicked up _ a factor no
one is talking about very much, even though it's a Medinah
trademark _ and the two staggered home with 2-over 74s in their
Monday playoff (Irwin won on a 19th hole). Medinah has its ways.
</P>
<P>
   And they are fair ways. ``The neatest thing I see about the golf
course is that as the ball goes into the trees, the further off
into the rough and into the trees we get, the rough is less,
allowing guys the opportunity, if they want, to take a risky shot
and possibly recover out of the trees,'' says Mickelson (Exhibit A:
Stuart Appleby eagling from behind a tree). ``I think it should
make for good spectating.''
</P>
<P>
   It should also make for good listening. We don't have to worry
about listening to these guys whine.
</P>
<P>
   About the course, anyway.

TEEN JUST WANTED TO PROTECT NEPHEWS FROM CARJACKER 

</HEADLINE>

and ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three little boys and their 15-year-old aunt, who were
kidnapped and taken on a wild ride with police in hot pursuit
Wednesday, were doing fine Thursday _ physically, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the teen, Roxana Lopez, said she is still in shock over the
death of the kidnapper in what may have been a suicidal leap from
the speeding truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified,'' she said. ``I just really wanted to protect
my nephews, they were really scared and crying. I wasn't thinking
about anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The carjacker was identified Thursday as Noel Gil, 31, who also
went by the name Rudy Ramos and had a criminal record dating back
at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   That record includes convictions for robbery, car theft,
criminal mischief and assault with bodily injury. He also was
arrested for resisting arrest and several traffic offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Thursday that Gil had jumped from the vehicle
deliberately. Initially, they thought he was thrown from the
speeding truck by the impact of a crash into a guardrail.
</P>
<P>
   They said it is unclear whether Gil was committing suicide or
believed he could survive the jump and escape. The chase, and its
grisly end, was shown live on several Houston television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the initial collision with the guardrail had caused
her to hit her head and faint, but before blacking out she saw Gil
continuing to drive. Lopez said she did not awaken until officers
were pulling the children from the truck.
</P>
<P>
   The carjacking began about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday in the parking
lot of an HEB store in east Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Aguilar, 21, and her mother-in-law got out of Aguilar's
GMC pickup truck to fill water bottles at a vending machine outside
the store. They left the truck engine running.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gil jumped in the truck and drove away with Lopez
and Aguilar's three sons _ Christopher, 5, Jesus, 2, and Brian, 1.
Gil told Lopez he needed a ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he lived not far from the grocery store. A woman who
answered the phone at Gil's home Thursday declined to speak to a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said when Gil jumped in, her first reaction was to open
the passenger-side door and call out to Aguilar, who was running
behind the truck as it pulled out. But, she said, Gil slammed the
door and pushed her back into the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said, ``He told me not to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Lopez said, she grabbed a cellular phone in the
front seat, but Gil swatted it out of her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then she tried to get Gil to stop and let her and the children
out near their house, less than two miles from the grocery.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gil started to do that, but Lopez's father spotted the
truck and she screamed for him. So, Gil sped off.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris County sheriff's deputy spotted the truck minutes later
and began the 35-minute chase that wound through southeast Houston.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the chase, Lopez said, she tried to calm the
crying children in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `Tell the kids to calm down' or he was going to
hurt them, '' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gil never brandished a weapon during the chase, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said that as Gil drove onto the Ship Channel bridge he
told her that he planned to jump out and wanted her to drive _ but
she can't drive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lopez hovered over her nephews, huddled on the truck's
rear-seat floorboard.
</P>
<P>
   The truck then veered into the bridge's concrete-and-wire
railing. Gil's body came out of the passenger-side window into the
barrier and down to the roadway, where it was run over by a small
tank truck.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies said Lopez's action not only kept the boys from being
hurt, it prevented all four from seeing what happened to Gil, who
was dismembered by the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar said all her eldest son knows is, ``The truck was hit,
and the man fell.'' The other two, she said, are too young to
understand much about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar said she will seek counseling for Christopher, who
starts school next week, and for Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my hero,'' Aguilar said. ``I just thank God for my
children. I hug them every moment. I'm just letting them get away
with anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with them last night, and I told them, `Yes, there
are bad people out there, but they're not all bad.' Some good, good
people helped me get them back safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar had messages for all Thursday. The first was, ``Be
careful. I never thought this would happen to me. Once it happens,
you see it could happen to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Her second: ``Millions and millions of thank-yous'' to all the
law enforcement officers involved and to the people who helped her,
first in the parking lot, in the store and later at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar, her voice hoarse from crying, said she especially
wanted to thank ``the officers who held my babies'' after the
ordeal ended.

SPORTS COLUMN:   THEY ARE NOT YANKS OR BRAVES, BUT METS ARE
PLAYERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Ill., Texas)   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Veteran that he is of many a windy, chilly San
Francisco night, Orel Hershiser had some sound advice for Octavio
Dotel late Thursday afternoon in the Mets' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pack your long underwear,'' Hershiser told the rookie pitcher.
``It could be cold.''
</P>
<P>
   At opposite ends of their baseball careers, Hershiser and Dotel
represent two of the five reasons many people still believe the
Mets are bound to stumble over the next seven weeks and wind up out
in the postseason freeze. Hershiser is considered a little too
gray, Dotel too green, and the rest of the rotation has no one
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, there may be some worry about our starters,'' Al Leiter,
10-game winner and ace by default, said after he four-hit the
Padres over seven innings and belted a three-run double in a 9-3
victory at Shea Stadium. ``But with the way our defense has been
and our hitting, we're going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching can be in large part relative to who's behind you,
Leiter was trying to say, and, he might have added, to who's in
front of you, too. Following the weekend alarms that were sounded
in three straight losses to the Dodgers, the joy of fiscal reality
returned to Queens this week, not coincidentally along with the
charred remains of the defending National League champs.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons have been made between the Padres and the Marlins,
who tore apart their 1997 World Series team almost before the last
car was out of the parking lot, but there is one important
difference. Unlike the Marlins, the Padres were able to trade on
their sudden success for the guarantee of a new ball park.
</P>
<P>
   John Moores, the team's Texas-bred owner, who had the gall to
trash Yankee Stadium when he was riding high last October, turned
around and stiffed his benefactors and fans by letting several core
players take a free-agent hike. With rare exceptions, the Padres
have become a bunch of well-paid bodyguards for Tony Gwynn as he
crossed the finish line to 3,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Their starter on getaway day, Woody Williams, allowed a bunt
single to Roger Cedeno leading off the home first inning. Edgardo
Alfonzo's hot smash found a hole when the wrong man, shortstop
Chris Gomez, covered second on the hit-and-run. Then Ruben Rivera
missed the cutoff man on his throw from left-center, allowing
Alfonzo to take second. The Mets pushed across both runs, then a
third on Darryl Hamilton's home run, and were well on their way to
a three-game sweep, their 70th victory of the season and a share of
first in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Friday night in San Francisco with the first of three
remaining trips west, their schedule is about to get tougher, but
look at it this way: if the Mets even go 25-21 in their remaining
46 games, that's 95 victories, which should put them right there at
the finish, for a wild card at least. Quibble about their starters
all you want, but remember that the Cubs made the playoffs last
season with a pitching staff held together by clips and glue from
the Tribune Co.'s composing room. The Cleveland Indians have been
regulars in the postseason the last few years with a starting
rotation that has not quite introduced itself with Koufax and
Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different kinds of players than the Cleveland team I
pitched for,'' Hershiser said. ``But, like them, we have a lot of
very good players, and that usually affords you not having long
slumps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets may not be throwing a formidable starter out there
every day, but how many, exactly, are they going to face? How many
teams are not pitching diluted, if they are even competitive in the
first place? How many teams can sit a red-hot leadoff hitter
(Rickey Henderson) and their best home run hitter (Mike Piazza) and
score nine runs, after ringing up 12 the night before?
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse these Mets with underdogs, or with upstarts,
because the Braves play in their division and the Yankees rule from
across the river. The Mets' payroll of $65 million is among
baseball's largest. If their reported potential sale to Charles
Dolan and Cablevision goes through, the Mets will instantly become
one of the most powerful teams in professional sports. Forget Derek
Jeter and Alex Rodriguez _ when it comes to fraternization with the
so-called enemy, the poster-boy shortstops won't even be in the
league with Dolan and his power partner at Madison Square Garden,
Rupert Murdoch, who also happens to own the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for the Mets, with the playoffs there for
the taking and a rich corporation stepping up in the bidding.
Wherever they go these next seven weeks, they've already come a
long way these last two years.

ILLEGAL BOTTLE REFUNDING GROWING ALONG MASS.-R.I. BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAWTUCKET, R.I. _ The Ro-Jack's Supermarket here is just over
the border from Massachusetts, but its beverage aisle might as well
be in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Because of regional distribution patterns, nearly every beverage
sold here, from Coca-Cola to sparkling Poland Spring water, carries
the Massachusetts 5-cent deposit stamp. Since Rhode Island has no
bottle deposit law, it's a situation ripe for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of Coke can be bought here without paying the nickel
deposit, but by just crossing the border and returning the empty
container to a Massachusetts retailer the customer can recover a
nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is illegal, but it's almost impossible to detect.
Even containers that don't have the Massachusetts deposit stamp can
be easily redeemed if the redeemer uses a reverse vending machine,
which can't distinguish between a Coke can purchased in
Massachusetts and one purchased in a non-bottle-deposit state like
Rhode Island or New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nickels involved, running a bottle deposit scam sounds
like the type of venture only ``Seinfeld'' stalwarts Kramer and
Newman would try, as they did in a vintage episode of the TV
sitcom. But there are indications that it's not so wacky after all.
A new study done for the state indicates bottle deposit fraud may
be costing Massachusetts beverage distributors and taxpayers
millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report by DSM Environmental Services of Ascutney, Vt., said
the failure of reverse vending machines to distinguish a can sold
in Massachusetts from one sold elsewhere may be costing the state
anywhere from $453,000, if the fraud is minimal, to $6.8 million a
year, if the fraud is more extensive. The cost to beverage
distributors ranges from a low of $204,000 to a high of $3 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The DSM report indicated the higher ranges are more likely,
given the rate of fraud documented in New York and Michigan,
bottle-deposit states grappling with the same problem. In
Massachusetts, the state loses money when fraud eats into the
bottle and can deposits that normally would go unclaimed and revert
to the state. Beverage distributors lose when they have to pay for
the processing of more bottles and cans than they should.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Shanley, president of the Massachusetts Soft Drink
Association, said his members report taking in far more bottles and
cans along the Rhode Island border than they are selling there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation would be that containers are coming in
from over the border,'' he said. ``We think it's a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the DSM report, surveys by two major soda
distributors in New York found that between 25 and 40 percent of
soda containers and as many as 70 to 75 percent of beer containers
accepted by reverse vending machines did not carry the New York
deposit stamp. In Michigan, a similar survey indicated between 7
and 30 percent of containers redeemed at reverse vending machines
were being redeemed fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   The DSM report suggested the best way to combat this fraud would
be to require beverage distributors to alter their bar codes in
bottle-deposit states so reverse vending machines could detect
bottles and cans from out of state. Beverage distributors say this
approach is costly, but Pepsi-Cola is already trying it in the
Greater Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's nearly impossible to detect, no one knows how many
bottles and cans sold in New Hampshire and Rhode Island with the
Massachusetts deposit stamp are being redeemed in Massachusetts.
The DSM report, however, noted that recycling groups in New
Hampshire and Rhode Island are separating out cans and bottles with
the Massachusetts deposit stamp and returning them in Massachusetts
to raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of fraud are also taking place, according to the DSM
report. Redemption centers are shortchanging beverage distributors
by not filling return bags and cases fully and including bottles
and cans from out of state. And beverage distributors are scamming
the system by inflating their returns or failing to turn over
unclaimed deposits to the state.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are trying to clamp down on the fraud, just as
they are trying to figure out a way to make the bottle deposit
system work more smoothly. The system has shown signs of strain
recently, as research has indicated redemption centers and
retailers, whose processing of containers makes the law work, on
average are spending more money to do the job than they are being
paid. The state is being urged to allow redemption centers to pay
consumers 4 cents for returned bottles and cans rather than the
full 5-cent deposit.

DISNEY TO SELL MAGAZINE DIVISION; HEARST, CONDE NAST MAKE BIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to focus on its studio and theme park divisions, Walt
Disney Co. has decided to sell Fairchild Publications, the magazine
division that includes W, Women's Wear Daily, Los Angeles and Jane
magazines as well as many trade publications, executives involved
in the deal said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Disney executive, there are two bidders for the
titles: the rival magazine publishers Conde Nast Publications and
Hearst Magazines. They have been making offers and countering each
other for the last three months, the executive said. The chairman
of Conde Nast, S.I. Newhouse Jr., has offered $650 million for the
Fairchild group, said the Disney executive, who also noted that a
team of Hearst accountants had been working on the deal with
particular zeal for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast is the publisher of Vogue, Allure and Glamour, among
other titles; Hearst publishes Harper's Bazaar and Town &AMP; Country.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has wrestled with the issue of whether or not to sell
Fairchild since 1995, when Disney _ which has never been a
traditional magazine publisher _ acquired Capital Cities/ABC, then
the longtime parent company of Fairchild Publications. In 1997,
Disney even announced a decision to sell the division, then
retracted it a week later.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney has been under pressure recently from Wall Street to
sell non-strategic assets and revive its core business. The company
has already sold some non-core assets acquired in the Capital
Cities deal. In April 1997, Disney sold four newspapers, including
The Kansas City Star and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, that it had
acquired in the deal to Knight-Ridder for $1.65 billion. Also in
1997, Disney sold the trade publisher Chilton to the British-Dutch
company Reed Elsevier for $447 million and Institutional Investor
Inc. to Euromoney Publications for $142 million.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, The Los Angeles Times reported that there were
rumors that Disney was considering a sale of its Anaheim Angels
baseball team and its Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   Fairchild Publications, in addition to its mainstream titles,
also has a stable of trade magazines, including Women's Wear Daily,
Supermarket News, Brand Technology, Footwear News and Children's
Business. It is not clear how Conde Nast or Hearst would use these
titles if either company acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the acquisition for either Hearst or Conde Nast
would be W magazine, an oversized glossy fashion monthly that has
evolved from a narrow trade title to a mainstream general-interest
magazine over the last four years, passing the Hearst-owned
Harper's Bazaar in advertising pages and revenue in 1998 by a huge
margin. W has taken apparel advertising from magazines at both
Hearst and Conde Nast, advertising revenue that both companies
would prefer to have on their own bottom line. In 1998, W had 2,005
advertising pages, while Harper's Bazaar had only 1,542. Vogue,
which is owned by Conde Nast, led the field with 2,681 pages of
advertising last year; in second place was Elle, with 2,068 pages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, W generated $33,450,420 in advertising revenue for
Fairchild, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, but by
1998 that figure had increased to $87,558,440.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines clearly wants to make the acquisition, said an
executive involved in the negotiations. The magazine division
recently announced that Sports Afield and Motor Boating &AMP; Sailing
are for sale, because the company is shifting toward less
niche-oriented and more popular titles. It has recently announced a
deal to publish Oprah, a lifestyle magazine with Oprah Winfrey as
brand spokeswoman. Hearst Magazines also partnered earlier this
year with a division of Disney, Miramax Films, to publish Talk, the
magazine edited by Tina Brown. The first issue arrived on
newsstands last week.
</P>
<P>
   David Londoner, an analyst at Schroder Securities who follows
Disney, said that the sale made sense because Fairchild does not
fit in with Disney's corporate strategy. ``And virtually everything
Disney does reinforces everything else they do,'' he said. ``And
Fairchild is kind of out in left field.'' Londoner said that
because Disney's earnings are down, ``the company is refocusing,
and will undoubtedly go through some organizational changes over
the next year or so. This could well be part of it.'' Disney stock
for the year to date has fallen by 12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst already has several affiliations with Disney. Hearst's
television stations are ABC affiliates, and it owns 20 percent of
ESPN, of which ABC owns the balance. Hearst also owns a small piece
of ESPN magazine. And ABC and Hearst are investors in two cable
services: Lifetime and Arts and Entertainment. Hearst Corp.'s chief
financial officer, Ronald Doerfler, was formerly the chief
financial officer of Capital Cities and is intimately acquainted
with the Fairchild properties.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Castro, a spokeswoman for Disney, and Deborah Shriver, a
spokeswoman for Hearst, both had no comment. Michael Coady, the
president and chief executive of Fairchild Publications, did not
return phone calls seeking comment. Steven Florio, the chief
executive of Conde Nast, did not return phone calls, but Maurie
Perl, a spokeswoman for Conde Nast, said: ``We have no comment on
acquisitions.''

RHUMBLINE TRADER AGREES TO FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Harvard PhD, once hailed for his brilliant investment
theories, agreed Thursday to pay a $50,000 fine and accept a
lifetime ban from the investment advisory business in exchange for
settling federal charges that he concealed $162 million in pension
fund losses.
</P>
<P>
   Bing Sung, 52, a native of China, was chief investment officer
at Boston-based RhumbLine Advisers in 1998, when the Securities and
Exchange Commission charged he made unauthorized trades and hid a
$150 million loss from AT&AMP;T Corp.'s pension fund and a $12 million
loss from the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Based on complex and highly technical investment formulas, Sung
made huge, risky bets on stock market movements and the technology
industry in 1995 and 1996, against the wishes of clients, and
failed to tell them about the losses, the SEC alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been three years and I just want to get on with it,''
Sung said of the settlement Thursday. In agreeing to the
settlement, Sung did not admit or deny the SEC charges. He said he
now manages his own money and is a part-time wrestling coach at
Phillips Academy in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Marcelino, district administrator of the SEC's Boston
office, said Sung's $50,000 penalty is ``a very significant fine''
that serves as a sufficient deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Sung received a doctoral degree in statistics from Harvard
University at age 23, and later helped manage it's endowment fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC's complaint, Sung approached RhumbLine in
1991 saying he had developed a quantitative trading strategy that
involved writing options on stock indexes, such as the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed that RhumbLine, one of only 50 minority- or
women-owned money management firms in the country, start an
investment program using the strategy. In return for future equity
in the firm, Sung agreed to work for a year without pay.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, all seemed to go well with Sung's strategy, the
complaint alleged. But it worked only as long as US markets
remained stable. In 1995, the markets swung wildly, and the AT&AMP;T
account began to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to make up for losses, Sung began making riskier and
riskier trades without telling his clients about the losses or the
trades he was making, the complaint said. ``His theory crumbled and
then he got over his head,'' Grant Ward, assistant district
administrator in the SEC's Boston office, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the April issue of Institutional Investor
magazine, Sung acknowledged losing clients' money and said he made
mathematical errors, but denied deceiving AT&AMP;T or the Massachusetts
fund. Sung said he had an oral agreement with an AT&AMP;T senior
executive who knew about his trading strategies.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the trades, AT&AMP;T had about $47 billion in assets
in one of the country's largest corporate pension funds. AT&AMP;T said
its pension funds ultimately absorbed the $150 million loss because
the funds made money in other investments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, RhumbLine paid a $50,000 fine, and its founder and
then chief executive, John D. Nelson, paid $10,000 to settle SEC
charges that they failed to adequately supervise Sung. Nelson was
suspended from serving as RhumbLine's chief executive for nine
months. Nelson, who still works at the firm, said he will will
regain his CEO position in October, replacing interim chief
executive Ronald Golz.

CLOROX REVENUE DROPS, AND SHARES TUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clorox Co., the maker of bleach, Pine Sol cleaners and SOS
scrubbing pads, surprised investors Thursday with an unexpected
drop in fourth-quarter revenue and warnings of huge charges and
lower profits ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned shareholders made their disappointment clear, sending
the company's shares down $16.8125, or 16.3 percent, to $86.4375 on
heavy volume.
</P>
<P>
   The stock dropped despite fourth-quarter earnings that were in
line with analysts' expectations. Earnings before charges related
to an acquisition and reorganization rose 5.8 percent, to $115.3
million, or 96 cents a diluted share, compared with net income of
$109 million, or 91 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the fourth quarter was $50 million, or 42 cents a
share. The operating results matched analysts' estimates, according
to the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, though, reacted to a 2.6 percent drop in revenue _ to
$1.1 billion from $1.13 billion _ and the announcement that the
company would take $23 million in charges in the current fiscal
year in addition to the $79 million in charges it took in the
quarter ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The charges and the drop in sales are related to a
reorganization and the weaker-than-expected performance of the
company's recently acquired First Brands products.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox bought First Brands, whose products include Glad bags,
Scoop Away cat litter and STP automotive products, in January for
about $2 billion. Sales have slowed as retailers work through $125
million in surplus inventory caused by excessive promotions begun
by previous management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really such a well-run company that this is the last
thing you expected out of them,'' said Robert Izmirlian, an analyst
with Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity Group.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox said during a conference call with analysts that earnings
per share in the current quarter would fall by the low single
digits and would rise by about that amount in the second quarter.
Analysts had expected profits to rise by 8.4 percent this quarter
and 9.7 percent in the second quarter, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated a short-term negative impact associated with
changing the marketing and sales practices for First Brands
products,'' said G. Craig Sullivan, Clorox's chairman and chief
executive. ``We're currently making investments in research and
development and marketing research to spur future sales growth on
these new brands.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company had strong results in many key product
categories. Clorox's Tilex bathroom cleanser, Clorox toilet bowl
cleaner and Armor All car care products all had growth in unit
volume, the company said. For the full year, profits from
operations rose 11 percent, to $390 million, or $3.25 a share.
Revenue increased 3 percent, to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts and investors had expected the company, which
had been known for a stellar management team, to more swiftly
integrate First Brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly does make you leery going forward about whether
they are going to be able to get the top-line synergies they
wanted,'' Izmirlian said. He said the acquisition was still a good
strategic fit, but, ``it will take a few quarters for people to get
their confidence back.''

ILLEGAL BOTTLE REFUNDING GROWING ALONG MASS.-R.I. BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAWTUCKET, R.I. _ The Ro-Jack's Supermarket here is just over
the border from Massachusetts, but its beverage aisle might as well
be in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Because of regional distribution patterns, nearly every beverage
sold here, from Coca-Cola to sparkling Poland Spring water, carries
the Massachusetts 5-cent deposit stamp. Since Rhode Island has no
bottle deposit law, it's a situation ripe for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of Coke can be bought here without paying the nickel
deposit, but by just crossing the border and returning the empty
container to a Massachusetts retailer the customer can recover a
nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is illegal, but it's almost impossible to detect.
Even containers that don't have the Massachusetts deposit stamp can
be easily redeemed if the redeemer uses a reverse vending machine,
which can't distinguish between a Coke can purchased in
Massachusetts and one purchased in a non-bottle-deposit state like
Rhode Island or New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nickels involved, running a bottle deposit scam sounds
like the type of venture only ``Seinfeld'' stalwarts Kramer and
Newman would try, as they did in a vintage episode of the TV
sitcom. But there are indications that it's not so wacky after all.
A new study done for the state indicates bottle deposit fraud may
be costing Massachusetts beverage distributors and taxpayers
millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report by DSM Environmental Services of Ascutney, Vt., said
the failure of reverse vending machines to distinguish a can sold
in Massachusetts from one sold elsewhere may be costing the state
anywhere from $453,000, if the fraud is minimal, to $6.8 million a
year, if the fraud is more extensive. The cost to beverage
distributors ranges from a low of $204,000 to a high of $3 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The DSM report indicated the higher ranges are more likely,
given the rate of fraud documented in New York and Michigan,
bottle-deposit states grappling with the same problem. In
Massachusetts, the state loses money when fraud eats into the
bottle and can deposits that normally would go unclaimed and revert
to the state. Beverage distributors lose when they have to pay for
the processing of more bottles and cans than they should.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Shanley, president of the Massachusetts Soft Drink
Association, said his members report taking in far more bottles and
cans along the Rhode Island border than they are selling there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation would be that containers are coming in
from over the border,'' he said. ``We think it's a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the DSM report, surveys by two major soda
distributors in New York found that between 25 and 40 percent of
soda containers and as many as 70 to 75 percent of beer containers
accepted by reverse vending machines did not carry the New York
deposit stamp. In Michigan, a similar survey indicated between 7
and 30 percent of containers redeemed at reverse vending machines
were being redeemed fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   The DSM report suggested the best way to combat this fraud would
be to require beverage distributors to alter their bar codes in
bottle-deposit states so reverse vending machines could detect
bottles and cans from out of state. Beverage distributors say this
approach is costly, but Pepsi-Cola is already trying it in the
Greater Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's nearly impossible to detect, no one knows how many
bottles and cans sold in New Hampshire and Rhode Island with the
Massachusetts deposit stamp are being redeemed in Massachusetts.
The DSM report, however, noted that recycling groups in New
Hampshire and Rhode Island are separating out cans and bottles with
the Massachusetts deposit stamp and returning them in Massachusetts
to raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of fraud are also taking place, according to the DSM
report. Redemption centers are shortchanging beverage distributors
by not filling return bags and cases fully and including bottles
and cans from out of state. And beverage distributors are scamming
the system by inflating their returns or failing to turn over
unclaimed deposits to the state.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are trying to clamp down on the fraud, just as
they are trying to figure out a way to make the bottle deposit
system work more smoothly. The system has shown signs of strain
recently, as research has indicated redemption centers and
retailers, whose processing of containers makes the law work, on
average are spending more money to do the job than they are being
paid. The state is being urged to allow redemption centers to pay
consumers 4 cents for returned bottles and cans rather than the
full 5-cent deposit.

 &HT;    Club pros, including Keppler, turn heads
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Playing in his third PGA Championship, Summit
Chase's Stephen Keppler admittedly has not always felt comfortable
as one of 25 club pros in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we kind of feel like we're an afterthought,''
Keppler said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not this year. It's been three years since a club pro made
the cut in the PGA, but after Thursday's first round, some of the
best players in the world were envious of their scores.
</P>
<P>
   Keppler, the 38-year-old four-time Georgia PGA player of the
year, opened with a 1-over-par 73 at Medinah Country Club despite
playing most of the front nine in heavy rains. Bruce Zabriski, the
1997 National Club Pro champion, shot 2-under 70 to stand two shots
off the lead. Seven additional club pros shot 76 or better.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a practice round Tuesday with Ernie Els and Tom Watson,
perhaps Keppler absorbed some of their major championship
expertise. After turning the front nine in 2-over 38 _ highlighted
by a 20-yard chip-in for birdie at No. 5 _ Keppler sank a 50-foot
putt for birdie at the 10th hole and an 8-footer at the 11th to
reach even par.
</P>
<P>
   After three-putting the par-3 13th for bogey, Keppler parred in
solidly. A nifty up-and-down at the par-3 17th came after a tee
shot into the gunch behind the green. At the dogleg-left 18th,
Keppler caught the trees with his tee shot, then hooked a 225-yard
3-iron around some big oaks to find the green for a 2-putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Keppler said. ``Now I've got a real shot at
making the cut. If I can get a little more confidence off the tee,
I'll be fine. We almost gave that driver away today on the 12th
tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorable day
</P>
<P>
   Jay Haas son, Jay Jr., is on his bag this week, making dad's
first-round 68 all that more cherishable Thursday. Set to attend
Augusta State next week, Jay Jr. carries a 1-handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a magical today to have him out there on the
bag,'' said the elder Haas, who will give his son a percentage of
his winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got it in the past and I've played well with him on the
bag before. He really has a good demeanor on the golf course. He's
very level-headed, very low-key, doesn't get excited, and I think
that rubs off on me a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington's caddie ill
</P>
<P>
   Steve Elkington, the 1995 PGA champion, withdrew Thursday after
his caddie, Joe ``Gypsy'' Grillo suffered heart problems. He was
replaced by Bob Friend, who shot 71. ... Jerry Kelly took dvantage
of his late opportunity, shooting 69 after replacing Frank Minoza
of the Philippines, who withdrew because of a knee sprain.

ITALY INVESTIGATION FINDS COKE ABUSED MARKET DOMINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (yn) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a 14-month investigation into the business practices of
Coca-Cola Co., Italian competition authorities will issue a report
Friday that accuses the soft-drink giant of using its market
dominance to try to drive out smaller competitors, including
Pepsico Inc., its chief rival around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a translated copy of which was provided to The New
York Times, all but completes the investigation that resulted from
complaints made in 1997 and last year by Pepsico and an Italian
supermarket chain called Esselunga SpA. A similar inquiry, led by
officials of the European Union, is under way in Austria, Denmark
and Germany. That investigation, which began July 20 with
early-morning raids on Coke offices as well as the offices of its
bottlers for those countries, was also prompted by complaints from
Pepsico as well as other Coke rivals, including Virgin Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes a plan by Coke that began in 1997 to block
Pepsi from new accounts and ``to expel Pepsi'' from wholesalers
handling fountain accounts, among others. The report cites internal
documents that detail an ``attack plan'' against Pepsi in Greece
and Italy that were seized from Coke as part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited other issues, including ``abusive'' discounts
offered by Coke in exchange for exclusivity, particularly for
fountain accounts; discounts for expanding display areas, and
year-end bonuses, which the report said ``are only paid if a
wholesaler has not distributed products which compete with
Coca-Cola in relation to one or more flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   The report details how Esselunga, when it wanted to sell Coke
products, was told by the soft-drink maker that it had to meet
minimum requirements for displays, refrigerator cases and other
selling techniques, which Esselunga said would prevent it from
making a profit. A decision on whether the company will be fined is
expected Dec. 15. The fine could be as high as 10 percent of Coke's
revenues in Italy during the period covered by the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, a Coca-Cola spokesman said: ``We believe Pepsi's
poor performance in Italy is due to their lack of commitment and
investment there. As a result, they are attempting to compete in
the courtroom instead of the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the report centers around Coke's practices in the highly
lucrative fountain business, which includes soft drinks served at
movie theaters, sports arenas, restaurants and other large forums.
The fountain business is a sore point for Pepsico in the United
States as well, where the company filed a lawsuit last year in
federal court contending that Coke unfairly blocked it from many
fountain accounts by putting pressure on food-distribution
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one market in a series of markets where Coca-Cola's
system practices are being analyzed very closely,'' said Andrew M.
Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley. ``If there is a
significant penalty, that has ramifications for additional markets
around Europe.'' At issue is a practice that is common in the
United States: offering retailers incentives like discounts for
selling large quantities of Coke products. Under European Union
law, as well as the laws of some other countries, a company that
has a dominant position cannot engage in such practices because
they are believed to unfairly inhibit smaller players.
</P>
<P>
   Carsten Gromotke, a lawyer in the Frankfurt office of Jones,
Day, said Coke clearly was the dominant soft-drink company across
Europe, with market shares of at least 40 percent in individual
countries. That status means it cannot use price rebates and
bonuses for retailers as part of its marketing strategy, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern to European Union regulators is the
so-called loyalty rebate, Gromotke said. ``There is longstanding
European case law against this,'' he said. ``You can't give certain
incentives to a customer that precludes them from distributing
other products.''  &QL;

PENTAGON TO ISSUE NEW GUIDELINES CONCERNING GAYS IN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon has decided to issue broad new
guidelines intended to end abuses of the ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy, including limits on investigations of people in uniform who
are suspected of being gay, administration officials said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, they said, will be issued as early as Friday and
will require that troops receive anti-gay harassment training
throughout their careers, beginning with boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines will also require that when an investigation is
opened into the sexual orientation of a soldier, it will be handled
at a senior level of the military justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Abuses in the past have often been attributed to low-level,
poorly trained investigators who have turned their investigations
into virtual witch hunts for homosexuals in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the Pentagon felt the need to
announce the new guidelines as quickly as possible, given the
uproar over the death last month of a gay soldier at Fort Campbell,
Ky., who was beaten with a baseball bat, reportedly by another
soldier in his unit.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not clear if the new guidelines will satisfy gay
rights and other civil rights groups, administration officials
insisted on Thursday that the new rules will be tough and will end
some of the worst abuses of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy
that went into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was supposed to have made it easier for homosexuals
to serve in the military, but Pentagon figures show that gay and
lesbian troops are being discharged from the military at a far
higher rate than before the policy went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Openly gay people are still barred from serving in the military.
But under a compromise plan developed early in the Clinton
administration, homosexuals can remain in the service as long as
they do not discuss their sexual orientation publicly. And
investigators are barred from asking troops about their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But carrying out of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, as it
came to be known, has produced frequent abuses, notably when
commanders have pursued investigations of the sexual orientation of
their troops based only on suspicion or rumor.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are intended to make certain that such inquiries
in the future will be handled only by well-trained investigators
responding to solid evidence, and that all members of the military
services receive anti-harassment training throughout their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they realize at the Pentagon that this can't just be
swept under the rug,'' said a senior administration official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There's a recognition there
that this problem of gay harassment is worse than they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michelle M. Benecke of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network,
a Washington group that helps troops who are prosecuted over their
sexual orientation, said, ``We're very anxious to see what comes
out of the Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pressed for guidelines for several years now, warning
Pentagon officials that steps were needed to stop harassment and
illegal investigations,'' Ms. Benecke said. ``And until I read
them, I can't tell whether the guidelines are a good first step or
a minimal response to a very serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines were prepared in response to a Defense
Department report last year that found that while the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy was working well, it should be revised to avoid
the small number of abuses that the Pentagon identified.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested new rules requiring that commanders consult
with senior military lawyers before opening an investigation of a
soldier's sexual orientation to make sure that proper procedures
were followed. It said that there should be better protection for
the privacy of gay troops during the period after they acknowledge
their homosexuality and before they leave the military.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended that the department reissue a
directive intended to prevent people who complain of being taunted
over their alleged homosexuality from actually becoming targets of
investigations of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases identified by gay-rights groups, soldiers who have
complained to commanders about being harassed have found themselves
_ and not their harassers _ under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said all of those recommendations in
the 1998 report were addressed by the new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made a good faith effort to meet all of the
concerns,'' said a senior administration official. The new Pentagon
guidelines, he said, ``track the report _ this is an honest and
straightforward effort to implement the results of the report.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration came up with the ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy after Clinton was forced to back away from the blanket
moratorium on discrimination against homosexuals that he tried to
introduce shortly after taking office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It proved an awkward compromise and has never fostered the
live-and-let-live attitude within the military that the authors of
the policy had sought. The numbers would suggest, in fact, that gay
troops are being ousted from the military at higher rates than
before.
</P>
<P>
   According to last year's report, 67 percent more gay and lesbian
troops were discharged in 1997 _ a total of 997 military personnel
_ than in 1994, the first full year that the policy was in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates see the figures as evidence of their
contention that the policy has backfired and subjected gay and
lesbian soldiers to new harassment. Pentagon officials say,
however, that the increase is due instead to voluntary declarations
of homosexuality by men and women who wanted to get out of the
military.

   &UR; TIVO  &LR;  _ Five of the world's largest media companies are
threatening to sue TiVo Inc., Replay Networks Inc. and other makers
of so-called TV replay devices unless they agree to obtain licenses
to use network programming. Time Warner Inc., Walt Disney Co., News
Corp., CBS Corp. and Discovery Communications Inc. said they formed
a coalition to protect TV copyrights by forcing the device makers
to negotiate and acquire program licenses. The personal video
recorders let users create a lineup of their favorite shows that
can be digitally recorded and then viewed anytime. Viewers also can
rewind and fast-forward through programs, skipping commercials. The
media companies are concerned that the devices could cut audience
levels. By Dan Fost

 _ SF CHRON  
 TV Firms Threaten to Sue TiVo, Replay  &HT;     By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some new devices from Silicon Valley promise to change TV
viewing as we know it _ allowing viewers to pick what shows they
want to watch and when, to pause live broadcasts and to zap through
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of those devices received a stern warning yesterday
from leading television companies, including the owners of the CBS,
ABC and Fox TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   A new consortium of companies _ CBS Corp., Discovery
Communications Inc., the Walt Disney Co., News Corp. and Time
Warner Inc. _ say they're prepared to sue companies that make the
new recorders unless they license the broadcasters' copyrighted
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The leading makers of the new technology, which just hit the
market this spring, are Replay Networks of Mountain View and TiVo
Inc. of Sunnyvale. Microsoft Corp.'s WebTV unit makes a similar
device, but it only works with the EchoStar satellite television
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who make the programming are saying, `You're not
going to offer the services using my content, without me getting a
piece of it,''' said Ted Pine, an analyst with Infotech, a Vermont
research firm specializing in digital media.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, most of the firms in the consortium either have
investments in Replay and TiVo or plan to announce such investments
by next week.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington, D.C., attorney representing the consortium struck
a conciliatory note in an interview, saying the networks only want
to make certain their content is protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole goal is to not have a lawsuit,'' said Bert Carp,
speaking on behalf of the Advanced Television Copyright Coalition.
``I would almost be willing to predict there won't be one, but
we've got to make our position clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Replay director of marketing Jim Plant said the company is
working with the firms in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our goal to violate somebody's copyrights. If we were
going to use somebody's content, we would do it with permission,''
Plant said.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo declined to comment. The company last month filed to sell
stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are digital devices that analysts predict will take the
place of the videocassette recorder. Unlike VCRs with their
cumbersome tapes that need rewinding and forwarding, a personal
video recorder, or PVR, records television content onto a hard
drive. Viewers could skip through shows like CD listeners move
through songs on a disc. The devices cost $500 or more, plus a
monthly fee, but prices are expected to drop as more people buy
them.
</P>
<P>
   Pine, the analyst, said that when he saw the devices
demonstrated in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas, ``I remember just being speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple idea, he said, with the potential to
revolutionize television.
</P>
<P>
   He was not surprised that Disney, which owns ABC; Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp., which owns Fox; and other programmers would
both invest in the technology companies and threaten them with
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is saber rattling,'' he said. ``The broadcasters look at
this technology and say, `We can fight it, or we can own it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Replay's leading investors are the venture capital firm Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures and the
Tribune Co. TiVo has a broad range of investors, including some of
the companies in the consortium: CBS, Disney and Discovery.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Window Washers Are on Top of the World  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The scaffold slowly slides over the edge of the Bank of America
Building's roof, 53 stories above California Street in the
Financial District. Amid the thick fog, it's like slipping into a
cloud.
<P>
   ``I had a guy once, on his first day, who was so scared he
wouldn't let go of the roof,'' says Andy Price, heading up the crew
of three window washers. ``Never saw him again.''
</P>
<P>
   One can sympathize with that fellow. Even with the ground
invisible below, the sight of the building's facade receding into
oblivion beneath your feet is enough to give anyone a chill.
Speaking of which, it's cold up on the rig at 6:30 in the morning.
Darn cold. And wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cold?'' Price asks. ``This is nothing. One time, I was
doing a building in Detroit, it was 47 below. You couldn't even
talk. Your face froze.''
</P>
<P>
   Window washing, it quickly becomes apparent, is not for weenies,
even in downtown San Francisco, where it's a balmy 50 degrees, give
or take.
</P>
<P>
   Price, 55, and his cohorts on the rig _ Sergio Negrete, 28, and
Rigo Herrera, 39 _ keep a wary eye on their ride-along visitor, who
has admitted to a deep-rooted discomfort with high places. They
watch him check the nylon harness that all window washers wear with
a big metal clip attached to the scaffold in the event of sudden
gusts of wind.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Hold On Tight
</P>
<P>
   The tools of the trade are all tied down. ``You hit a piece of
caulking, it will knock the squeegee right out of your hand,''
Price points out.
</P>
<P>
   Price is using a 20-inch squeegee. Most washers favor 18-inch
blades for their maneuverability, but the windows are big on the
BofA Building _ 104 by 98 inches _ and Price can cover more
territory with the larger implement.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple enough routine: Soap down the surface with a
cloth-covered wand, then squeegee dry, using the wand to catch any
runoff. Most washers use both hands, so a single window can be
cleaned in about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   A quick wipe of the sills with a sponge, and then the rig is
lowered to the next floor.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a full day to make a single drop down the side of the
city's second-tallest building _ the Transamerica Pyramid is No.1,
although there aren't any offices up top _ and 24 drops in all to
clean the entire facade. This is done three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000-pound, 40-foot-long scaffold rides down the building
in special tracks and dangles from the roof by six steel cables
just over a half-inch thick each. They say there has never been an
accident involving the rig.
</P>
<P>
   The scaffold, like the building, is about 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Cadillac of scaffolds,'' says said  &LR; mechanic Frank
Amick while making a visual inspection of the machinery prior to
this morning's drop. There are so many moving parts, he notes,
noted,  &LR; that you have to check it out each and every day.
</P>
<P>
   It's a surprisingly smooth ride. We pass the sumptuous Carnelian
Room on the 52nd floor _ no one's there for an early breakfast _
and start peering into the corner offices of some of the most
influential businesspeople in the city.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overlook the voyeuristic appeal of window washing.
Price says that when he used to clean the windows of apartment
buildings back in Detroit, where he lived prior to moving to the
Bay Area in 1991, he would see ``everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you can imagine,'' he replies, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like that today. Instead, we gaze upon mostly empty
offices, some neat and tidy, some betraying less organized work
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Documents are visible on the desks and credenzas in a number of
rooms, and some are plainly legible from our side of the glass.
(Price says he has never gotten any stock tips this way.)
</P>
<P>
   One especially spacious room, with a vast, football field of a
desk and an Oriental carpet, has an embroidered cushion on the
couch. It reads: ``We only finance the highest bidder.'' Must be a
banker's joke.
</P>
<P>
   Another office contains a fancy telescope, facing downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holiday Inn,'' Price explains, pointing over his shoulder
to the hotel's swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   It's noted that this angle is roughly identical to the one used
by the sniper in ``Dirty Harry'' to kill a swimmer in that same
pool. ``Hell of a shot,'' Price observes. He adds with a touch of
pride that the very rig we're riding on made a cameo appearance in
the Chuck Norris film ``An Eye for an Eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Price is the 11th member of his family to clean windows for a
living. It's what he has done practically all his life.
</P>
<P>
   The freedom is clearly a big part of it, along with a healthy
appreciation for working outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' Price says as he wipes. On the other side of the
glass, a man in a striped shirt sips his coffee and watches the
washers do their thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy inside, he has a boss,'' Price observes. ``I'm my own
boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he's asked whether he ever has misgivings about
being so high up, clinging to the side of a building.
</P>
<P>
   Price shrugs. ``People always want to know if I ever look
down,'' he says. ``Of course I do. I have to see where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   We begin exiting the fog around the 40th floor. The morning
traffic becomes visible hundreds of feet below. Price and his two
partners decide this is a good time for a quick break.
</P>
<P>
   They work for Capital Building Maintenance Services, which
cleans the windows on about half the buildings downtown. As union
members, they make between $16 and $18 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   There are three levels of window washing _ ground, chair and
scaffold. Chair work, requiring a measure of rappelling skills, is
toughest and pays the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a young man's thing,'' Price says, a smile creasing his
craggy face. ``I usually stick to the scaffold.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the scaffold, some jobs are tougher than others. While
the BofA Building requires plenty of elbow grease, Price singles
out the tower at 101 California St. as being perhaps the hardest
gig on his roster. ``It's all glass,'' he observes. ``You just keep
working.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there hasn't been any shortage of people looking to
become window washers. Dennis DeBattista, president of Capital
Building Maintenance Services, said earlier that he has 24 washers
in San Francisco and 40 others throughout the Bay Area _ a number
that has steadily increased over the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   But finding experienced hands isn't easy. For this reason,
DeBattista provides training for all new hires, even when they say
they've been up on a scaffold before.
</P>
<P>
   Price is gazing out over the city as an eerie sight emerges
across the way, on the rooftop of 580 California. Ghostly, faceless
figures surround the building's crown, spooky women in hooded white
robes. From street level, the 12-foot-tall statues are all but
unseen.
</P>
<P>
   They're the creation of New York artist Muriel Castanis, who was
specially commissioned to create the figures for the 23-story
building. She has described her work as ``corporate goddesses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The view is best from here,'' Price says, gazing down on the
statues. ``They used to put Santa Claus hats on them at
Christmastime. They don't do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Work resumes, and the three window washers fall back into the
steady rhythm of soap, squeegee, sponge ... soap, squeegee, sponge.
</P>
<P>
   A blond woman in a gray jacket looks up from her desk as the
scaffold halts outside her window. She watches intently as Price
polishes the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times,'' he says, ``people will smile and wave at you,
or they'll come over and point out a spot on the window. Usually
it's on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes about six hours for the scaffold to finally reach the
end of the line, the third floor. The window washers stow their
gear and get comfortable for the long ride back up to the roof. The
return trip takes nearly 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Price savors the view as the scaffold slowly ascends back into
the fog. ``This is what I like,'' he says. ``I've tried a few other
things, all inside.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head, as if dismissing a bad memory. ``I like it
out here.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Free Access to Net Offered By Web Company  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
For the first time, a leading Internet company is promising to get
users online free of charge. AltaVista, the No. 10 destination on
the Web, said it is now offering free Internet access, becoming the
first brand-name Web company to do so. Today, Americans typically
pay about $20 per month for dial-up Internet access that gives them
unlimited time online. The most popular provider of Internet
service is America Online, with about 18 million customers who pay
$21.95 a month. Faster Internet access, via options such as cable
or DSL lines, usually costs double or triple that.
<P>
   AltaVista believes that it can lure consumers away from AOL _ as
well as from other top Internet service providers, such as
Microsoft's MSN, Earthlink and Mindspring _ with its free offering.
</P>
<P>
   But the service, called AltaVista FreeAccess, still comes with a
price: sharing personal information and accepting a barrage of ads.
</P>
<P>
   To sign up, potential users must provide AltaVista with
demographic information, such as their age, sex and ZIP code, and
reveal their shopping preferences, such as whether they have bought
alcohol, books or flowers online, and which Web sites they
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista said it will use this information to send
advertisements to its customers. A constant stream of ads, as well
as news and other content, will appear in a small screen that is
always visible when FreeAccess users are online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research showed that people like to get personalized ads
on things they are interested in,'' said &UR;  &LR; Charles Rashall, vice
president of sales and marketing at AltaVista in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Current advertisers on AltaVista's Web site include Waterhouse
Securities and Amazon.com. Rashall declined to say what new
advertisers have signed up for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why continue to pay $240 a year when you can get a perfectly
good service for free that meets your needs?'' Rashall said.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers _ and competitors _ can think of reasons
why not. They argue that free Internet access will result in a
lower level of customer service. They also say that consumers will
not like an endless procession of ads on their computer screens _
in addition to the many ads already visible on Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``With free access, you still have to pay in the sense that you
are forced to look at advertisements,'' said Hany Nada, a financial
analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ``If I could pay an extra 10
bucks a month to avoid watching commercials on TV, then I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Free access is gaining steam in Europe, where banks, retailers
and even telephone companies offer no-subscription online services.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept has been a bust in America. Of the approximately
63 million people in the United States who have Internet access,
only about 1 million get it for no charge, usually from smaller
ISPs that finance their services with advertising. One early
pioneer in free Internet access, Bigger.net, has already gone out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   But AltaVista says it is ideally positioned to execute the
strategy. ``We are not one of these little startups with zero brand
recognition,'' said Rashall. ``We are a brand that people know and
trust. There are 3.5 million users who come to our site every
day.``
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Keith Benjamin, an Internet analyst with
BancBoston Robertson Stephens, said AltaVista may be making the
offer because it is losing ground to market leaders like Yahoo,
Excite and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``AltaVista is a good name, but it's an old name,'' he said.
``It has not been very active lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp., which owned AltaVista, sold it to the
Internet investment firm CMGI for $2.3 billion in June. That deal
has not yet closed.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista attracts nearly 10 million visitors a month, according
to MediaMetrix. During the past year, it has turned itself into a
``portal'' or Internet gateway that combines search, free e-mail,
news, chat and other features. But other portals overshadow it.
Yahoo, the No. 2 site after AOL, draws 37 million visitors a month;
Lycos has 30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin said giving away free Net access is not a sustainable
business model. He said advertisers will not sign up because
AltaVista will inevitably fail to garner enough users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price doesn't matter to consumers,'' he said. ``What they care
about is quality of service.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some news reports have said Microsoft is toying with
the idea of making MSN cheap or free, other Internet providers like
AOL and Mindspring are unwilling to budge on price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free Net model may work for some companies, but the level
of service our customers demand cannot be supported by a revenue
stream based solely on advertising,'' said Ed Hansen, a spokesman
for Mindspring in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, it will be the consumer who has the final say.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL will just have to find some other way to make money,
because I want Internet access for free,'' said Jill Sagner, a
Menlo Park resident who has used AOL for many years and now plans
to switch to a free service. ``The ads won't really bug me, and
frankly, I don't think AOL's service is so great anyway. I tried to
get on AOL all last weekend and couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   To sign up for the FreeAccess service, users can visit the
AltaVista Web site at www.altavista.com. The service operates on
Windows 95 and Windows 98 and works with any Web browser. AltaVista
said it would offer a version for Macintosh users soon.

 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never mind that it was supposed to be Manhattan's
answer to Hollywood's sidewalk of the stars, touched by
once-glittering screen goddesses like Gloria Swanson (shoe prints
and signature), Joan Crawford (both hands and partial signature)
and Myrna Loy (one hand and signature).
</P>
<P>
   To a sharp-minded city inspector surveying St. Marks Place near
First Avenue, it was just another derelict sidewalk. It was uneven,
cratered, flawed _ a craggy municipal eyesore that needed the
road-crew equivalent of an all-over facelift. It needed to be paved
over, the inspector decided _ smoothed out at the expense of the
theater that had screened those actresses' films long after gossip
columnists had stopped speculating about such matters as whether
they had had a facelift or two themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, more than a year after the Department of
Transportation inspector looked at Joan Blondell's shoe prints and
saw a safety hazard, there was an unexpected plot twist, a
bureaucratic Catch-22 that could keep a potboiler going for a reel
or two. The department said the sidewalk violated city regulations
for lack of a permit from the Department of Buildings. But a
Department of Buildings spokeswoman said that she had never heard
of that type of permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly, it's sad, it's devastating,'' said Florence Otway,
who, as the owner of the theater at 80 St. Marks Place, is
responsible for the 28-year-old sidewalk. ``That sidewalk, it's
part of the history of Off Broadway. Several times a week, when I
go out, there are groups of people putting their hands in and their
feet and comparing them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Patterson, a spokesman for the Transportation
Department, said it was alien to New York. ``I've never heard
anything of this other than me being a tourist going to L.A., and
going, `Wow, this is neat,''' he said, adding that as far as the
agency was concerned, the sidewalk had been defaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. Putting the stars' signatures and foot
or hand prints was a violation of city regulations, he said,
because they made the surface uneven. ``Somebody might trip,'' he
said. A moment later, he added, ``We don't want people to trip and
fall. The city might be liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Otway said that she had received the Transportation
Department's notice of violation last year, which gave her 45 days
to do something about the sidewalk. The notice mentioned repair or
removal. The notice also said that if she did nothing, the agency
would assign a contractor to pave over the sidewalk and would send
her the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Otway said that instead of having the sidewalk repaved
or hauling the sidewalk into the theater and turning it into a
display, she called the Landmarks Preservation Commission, hoping
it could be saved as a city landmark, right where it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very interested, thought they could do something,''
she said. Her next call was to the Transportation Department, she
said, and when she relayed the news about the possibility of making
it a landmark, the person on the telephone ``said they would
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait they did, longer than a three-hankie tear-jerker. The next
time she called the Landmarks Commission, ``They said the person I
had talked with had retired and the sidewalk was not old enough.''
(Terri Rosen Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the commission, agreed that
it was not old enough because it was not yet 30 years old.)
</P>
<P>
   The confusion continued Thursday when Patterson of the
Transportation Department said that Mrs. Otway lacked a permit
called a ``distinctive sidewalk agreement'' from the Buildings
Department, something that Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for that
agency, said she had never heard of in more than 10 years on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Later Patterson said that such a permit was not applicable in
this case. Then, another plot twist: he said that his agency
planned to meet with Mrs. Otway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to come in with the contractor and rip it up,''
he said. ``We've also been getting pressure from the community to
come in and look at the sidewalk and issue violations. We're damned
if we do and damned if we don't. We're going to sit down and try to
work that out and try to come up with some kind of plan to make
everyone happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was pretty much what Mrs. Otway's husband, Howard, had in
mind when he started inviting box-office magnets like Ruby Keeler
(shoes and a signature) and Fifi D'Orsay (one hand and a
signature). And Joan Crawford. ``I remember, we went into the
theater and there was a Joan Crawford movie _ I believe it was
`Dancing Lady,''' said John Springer, a longtime Broadway press
agent who claims credit for suggesting the sidewalk. ``Joan was
thrilled. Suddenly somebody recognized her and put on the lights.
First she was upset they were putting on the lights. Then she was
every inch the movie star. It was really quite a thing. They never
did get to see the end of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   And the sidewalk? ``The whole audience poured out to watch her''
use chopsticks to sign the wet cement, Springer said. Everything
about her was larger than life, including her signature. She got as
far as ``Joan Crawf'' and ran out of room _ she finished her name
with an indecipherable squiggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in movie star heaven,'' Springer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never mind that it was supposed to be Manhattan's
answer to Hollywood's sidewalk of the stars, touched by
once-glittering screen goddesses like Gloria Swanson (shoe prints
and signature), Joan Crawford (both hands and partial signature)
and Myrna Loy (one hand and signature).
</P>
<P>
   To a sharp-minded city inspector surveying St. Marks Place near
First Avenue, it was just another derelict sidewalk. It was uneven,
cratered, flawed _ a craggy municipal eyesore that needed the
road-crew equivalent of an all-over facelift. It needed to be paved
over, the inspector decided _ smoothed out at the expense of the
theater that had screened those actresses' films long after gossip
columnists had stopped speculating about such matters as whether
they had had a facelift or two themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, more than a year after the Department of
Transportation inspector looked at Joan Blondell's shoe prints and
saw a safety hazard, there was an unexpected plot twist, a
bureaucratic Catch-22 that could keep a potboiler going for a reel
or two. The department said the sidewalk violated city regulations
for lack of a permit from the Department of Buildings. But a
Department of Buildings spokeswoman said that she had never heard
of that type of permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly, it's sad, it's devastating,'' said Florence Otway,
who, as the owner of the theater at 80 St. Marks Place, is
responsible for the 28-year-old sidewalk. ``That sidewalk, it's
part of the history of Off Broadway. Several times a week, when I
go out, there are groups of people putting their hands in and their
feet and comparing them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Patterson, a spokesman for the Transportation
Department, said it was alien to New York. ``I've never heard
anything of this other than me being a tourist going to L.A., and
going, `Wow, this is neat,''' he said, adding that as far as the
agency was concerned, the sidewalk had been defaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. Putting the stars' signatures and foot
or hand prints was a violation of city regulations, he said,
because they made the surface uneven. ``Somebody might trip,'' he
said. A moment later, he added, ``We don't want people to trip and
fall. The city might be liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Otway said that she had received the Transportation
Department's notice of violation last year, which gave her 45 days
to do something about the sidewalk. The notice mentioned repair or
removal. The notice also said that if she did nothing, the agency
would assign a contractor to pave over the sidewalk and would send
her the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Otway said that instead of having the sidewalk repaved
or hauling the sidewalk into the theater and turning it into a
display, she called the Landmarks Preservation Commission, hoping
it could be saved as a city landmark, right where it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very interested, thought they could do something,''
she said. Her next call was to the Transportation Department, she
said, and when she relayed the news about the possibility of making
it a landmark, the person on the telephone ``said they would
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait they did, longer than a three-hankie tear-jerker. The next
time she called the Landmarks Commission, ``They said the person I
had talked with had retired and the sidewalk was not old enough.''
(Terri Rosen Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the commission, agreed that
it was not old enough because it was not yet 30 years old.)
</P>
<P>
   The confusion continued Thursday when Patterson of the
Transportation Department said that Mrs. Otway lacked a permit
called a ``distinctive sidewalk agreement'' from the Buildings
Department, something that Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for that
agency, said she had never heard of in more than 10 years on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Later Patterson said that such a permit was not applicable in
this case. Then, another plot twist: he said that his agency
planned to meet with Mrs. Otway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to come in with the contractor and rip it up,''
he said. ``We've also been getting pressure from the community to
come in and look at the sidewalk and issue violations. We're damned
if we do and damned if we don't. We're going to sit down and try to
work that out and try to come up with some kind of plan to make
everyone happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was pretty much what Mrs. Otway's husband, Howard, had in
mind when he started inviting box-office magnets like Ruby Keeler
(shoes and a signature) and Fifi D'Orsay (one hand and a
signature). And Joan Crawford. ``I remember, we went into the
theater and there was a Joan Crawford movie _ I believe it was
`Dancing Lady,''' said John Springer, a longtime Broadway press

ORANGE COUNTY'S LAWYERS ASK HUGE BONUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The law firm that battled Merrill Lynch and other
securities companies on behalf of Orange County, Calif., is now
preparing to go to court against the county itself, demanding
nearly $50 million in extra payments for its work following the
county's 1994 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, Hennigan, Mercer &AMP; Bennett, is seeking a bonus of
$48.7 million on top of the $26.3 million it earned in hourly fees,
according to officials on both sides of the matter. But the county
has rejected any bonus.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Hennigan, a partner in the firm, said the firm
deserved a bonus because it recovered $865 million for the county
and its municipalities from lawsuits against nearly 20 securities
companies, as well as some law firms and accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
   More than $400 million came from a settlement with Merrill
Lynch, the Wall Street firm most heavily involved the county's
finances. The county lost more than $1.6 billion because of risky
investments made by its former treasurer, Robert Citron, resulting
in the biggest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unimaginable as it might have seemed a year ago,
President Clinton's top private lawyer and the former senior aide
to Kenneth Starr in the impeachment battle recently joined to argue
on the same side of one of the biggest legal fights in years.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, David Kendall and Brett Kavanaugh, are but one
example of the unusual alliances being forged in the dispute over
which companies will end up dominating high-speed Internet service
delivered through cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, representing America Online, and Kavanaugh, whose firm
represents GTE, are among a legion of advisers who are quickly
finding business in the dispute, which has turned into the latest
full employment act for lawyers and lobbyists here and in many
cities around the nation. (When Kendall and Kavanaugh found
themselves in a room together, meeting with the Federal
Communications Commission's general counsel on the issue, ``their
eyes were like saucers,'' recalled William Barr, the general
counsel at GTE and former U.S. attorney general, who also was at
the meeting.)
</P>
<P>
   Their common adversary in the fight is AT&AMP;T, which is rapidly
acquiring cable systems and offers high-speed Internet access over
those lines exclusively through a company, Excite(at)Home, in which
it owns a major stake. Led by America Online and GTE, a coalition
of Internet service providers and other telephone companies have
mounted a nationwide campaign to force AT&AMP;T to let cable customers
use Internet providers other than Excite(at)Home without additional
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T opponents have several business interests with billions
of dollars in future revenues at stake. GTE is developing a rival
high-speed Internet service, and many smaller providers believe
that if AT&AMP;T's system proves popular, they will be doomed if they
are shut out. Some of the other telephone companies in the fray are
either competitors of AT&AMP;T or are using the issue to press for
greater deregulation and the ability to compete with the company's
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T contends it would have little incentive to upgrade its
cable systems to provide high-speed Internet service if it must
serve as a carrier for all providers, and that in any case,
comparable telephone- and satellite-based services will insure
competition.
</P>
<P>
   While a precise figure on spending on the lawyers and lobbyists
and for campaign contributions is not available, executives and
lawyers involved in the case estimate that it is already in the
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a field where exaggeration is common, it is fair to say
that this issue is regarded as the most important public policy
question in telecommunications for the decade,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of Media Access Project, which promotes
consumer rights and diversity on the airwaves and has taken sides
against AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term,'' Schwartzman said, ``there's billions of
dollars in revenue at stake. Over the longer term, the outcome of
this fight will play a large role in determining who will be the
dominant telecommunications and Internet players for the next
decade. As a consequence, the bedfellows are stranger than
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, for example, have joined the anti-AT&AMP;T side but
acknowledge they are in an awkward position, allied with telephone
companies that they have sharply criticized in the past. The
consumer advocates have also criticized William Kennard, the
chairman of the FCC, after lobbying fiercely to get him appointed
two years ago. Kennard has in essence sided with AT&AMP;T by
formulating a policy that only the federal government, and not
local authorities, has jurisdiction, but ruling out intervention
for now.
</P>
<P>
   There have been high-stakes struggles over telecommunications
policy in the past, but perhaps never one fought on so many fronts,
including a number of localities where approval is needed _ and
conditions on the Internet issue can be attached _ if AT&AMP;T is to
assume the franchises of the cable companies it is acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   One reason cable has become a focus of the Internet battle is
that it is expected to be a dominant source of high-speed service,
at least in the near term. Today fewer than 1 million homes have
such connections, offering speeds 10 to 80 times those of
conventional phone lines. But by 2002 the number of high-speed
customers is expected to reach 10 million to 16 million, industry
analysts say, with 60 percent to 85 percent using cable
connections.
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute is also notable because it involves a
convergence of technology that has far outpaced laws, court
opinions and regulatory decisions, all of which treat cable and
telephones differently and for better or worse, have said little
explicitly about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one front where AT&AMP;T's opponents have scored their biggest
gains, the issue is heading to a federal appeals court. It will
hear oral arguments in October over a decision by local authorities
in Portland, Ore., to require AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines there to
any Internet company on the same terms as Excite(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also is moving to a new group of cities that are
considering whether to permit AT&AMP;T to acquire the cable franchises
controlled by Media One. Among other places, new skirmishing is
expected in the suburbs of Boston and in other parts of
Massachusetts, where a drive to get the issue on a statewide ballot
in 2000 began this week, as well as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Richmond
and major parts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and cities around the nation, both sides have
retained battalions of advocates. This week, for instance, the
anti-AT&AMP;T forces announced that in addition to Kendall, they had
retained Lloyd Cutler, the former White House counsel, and Bruce
Ennis, a leading Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T and the cable industry have retained many of
Washington's lobbyists, including Vin Weber, the former Republican
representative from Minnesota, and the lobbying firm founded by the
late Dan Dutko, a major Democratic fund-raiser who died in an
accident two weeks ago. More than 50 lobbyists for AT&AMP;T and the
cable companies showed up at an organizational meeting last
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have told me that they owe me thank-you
notes,'' said Gregory Simon, a former top aide to Gore, who is
collaborating with Richard Bond, a former chairman of the
Republican National Committee, in directing the anti-AT&AMP;T
coalition. ``They were retained just so I couldn't hire them. In
Washington it took weeks to find somebody who was not lobbying for
AT&AMP;T I could not find three firms that had not been retained on
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the regional Bell telephone companies have managed
to retain some well-known Washington figures for the fight,
including Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican
National Committee; Mike McCurry, the former White House press
secretary, and Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman
from Staten Island, N.Y. They maintain that Congress and federal
regulators should eliminate restrictions on their clients to make
it easier to offer high-speed Internet services to compete against
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The experience in Florida alone is illustrative of the magnitude
and fervor of the struggle. According to local records, AT&AMP;T and
the cable companies have retained more than 40 lobbyists in the
state. GTE responded by persuading officials in Broward County to
adopt an ordinance requiring AT&AMP;T to open its cable system to other
Internet service providers _ and by agreeing to pay the county's
legal costs if AT&AMP;T sued over the issue. AT&AMP;T lawyers say they are
preparing to challenge GTE's legal assistance to the county.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been Potemkin-like attempts at local organizing,
a process known by some consumer advocates as Astroturf campaigns,
in contrast to grass roots. Contrived rallies were staged in front
of San Francisco's City Hall, for instance, and both sides have
made extensive use of telephone banks to gin up support by asking
loaded questions and making alarmist predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and lobbyists from all sides are pouring campaign
contributions into the coffers of the major presidential
contenders, though none of the candidates have stated a clear
preference. (The issues have transcended party politics, although
some of the major players have been identified with particular
candidates. For instance, James Cicconi, general counsel of AT&AMP;T
and a former aide to President George Bush, was recently a
co-chairman of a fund-raiser in Washington for George W. Bush.
George Vradenberg, the general counsel of America Online, is a top
adviser and fund-raiser for John McCain. And Simon has been raising
money for his former boss, Vice President Gore.)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides say that the candidates are not likely to
take a position that could jeopardize more donations.
</P>
<P>
   While competing legislation over the issue has been introduced
in recent weeks in Congress, both sides acknowledge that there is
nothing that the lawmakers will likely do any time soon. As a
result, the anti-AT&AMP;T forces have embarked on a strategy of trying
to find support in states and municipalities, hoping the issue may
then begin to resonate with more force in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensity of the fight, there is widespread
assumption that it will be settled either at the corporate
bargaining table or by a Supreme Court decision, which could be
years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a business motivation here and everybody likes
cloaking their arguments in terms like open access, but what's
really going on here is AOL has a business plan and wants the
government to put its thumb on the scale to tip the balance in its
favor,'' said Cicconi, general counsel and head of government
relations at AT&AMP;T. He said the opposition has been ``going in at
the local level and hiring as many people as possible who have
connections with city commissioners and local officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and AT&AMP;T's corporate rivals say the battle
is as much over principle as it is over business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe of the magnitude and money involved,'' said Donna
N. Lampert, who had to leave her law firm, which represents major
cable companies, to continue her work for America Online. ``But at
its core this is really about an important principle. This involves
a lot more than whose garage the Mercedes will be parked in, as the
saying goes about big money cases. It involves who will control the
Internet.''

CARRY-ON BAG WON'T DO JOB FOR JUDD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Pitcher Mike Judd packed enough clothes for a few
days and nothing more. The right-hander will need some more after
``wowing'' Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson in a 10-5 win
against Montreal on Thursday in his first major-league start.
</P>
<P>
   Judd, recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque before the game,
allowed four runs in 61/3 innings. He allowed one run on five hits
through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing, I'm keeping Judd and he's going to throw
against Florida (Tuesday),'' Johnson said. ``I like the way he
threw. I saw some things, like the way he was working. He was smart
and reading the hitters pretty well. What I saw, he deserves
another start. I'm happy to give it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd, a washout in seven games last season with the Dodgers
(15.09 ERA),showed the form that caused the team to protect him in
the last expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to come here and pitch and not worry about if
I'm going to be with the team or not,'' Judd said. ``It's only one
game. I've been here before and had some good ones and bad ones.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of Judd's previous appearances were like this. He's
always been regarded as a prospect, but a 5-7 mark and 4.56 ERA at
Albuquerque last season, coupled with his Dodgers disaster, knocked
some of his luster away. He hasn't been stellar this season, going
8-7 with a 6.67 ERA at Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca, who caught Judd a few times in the
minors this season, said he's seen improved velocity, command and
confidence from the 24-year-old Judd.
</P>
<P>
   The four runs he gave up against Montreal came on a Vladamir
Guerrero solo home run and a three-run homer to Shane Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball, then he got a little tired,'' said LoDuca,
who had a career-high three RBI. ``The whole game was getting the
double play on Andrews with the bases loaded (in the second
inning). That set the whole tone.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Freeway series extinct? The schedule needs approval during
the September owners meetings, but from the way it's set up, the
Freeway Series with the Angels is finished.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the Dodgers will begin the 2000 season
with three games in Montreal, travel to New York for a series and
then head to San Francisco to open Pac Bell Park with a series
against the rival Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dodgers are remaining at Dodgertown in Vero Beach,
Fla., for at least one more spring, it wouldn't make sense for them
to fly back to Los Angeles for exhibition games and then fly back
to Montreal to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers will look for an exhibition game, or two,
in either Baltimore or Cleveland before heading to Canada for the
season opener, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Young's back: Johnson said second baseman Eric Young will be
activated and bat leadoff today when the Dodgers host the Atlanta
Braves. Young's been on the disabled list since July 28
(retroactive to July 24) with a sprained left ankle, and concluded
a three-game rehab with Class A San Bernardino on Wednesday before
taking Thursday off.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's plan is to rest Young frequently to keep him fresh so
he's not slowed by injuries. Also, the Dodgers want to enhance
Young's trade value if he can play well over the last 47 games.
Young went 3 for 12 with two walks and committed two errors with
the Stampede.
</P>
<P>
   __ This and that: To make room for Young, the Dodgers sent
pitcher Matt Herges back to Triple-A Albuquerque. . . . Dodgers
right-hander Jamie Arnold finished serving his five-game suspension
for his part in the July 11 fight with Seattle and is available
today. . . . The Dodgers finished the 10-game road trip 6-4. . . .
Gary Sheffield hit a two-run homer in the seventh and also stole
two bases.

 &HT;    IntelliQuest sold for at least $42.5 million
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A London conglomerate is buying IntelliQuest
Information Group Inc. of Austin in a deal worth at least $42.5
million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   IntelliQuest, which does market research for high-tech
companies, reached a definitive agreement on the sale with London's
giant Kantar Group, which owns market and media research companies,
late Thursday afternoon after several weeks of negotiations. The
deal is expected to be closed before the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would complete the sale of all of IntelliQuest's
business operations. The company announced it plans to sell its
IQ2.net database subsidiary in July to Naviant Technology Solutions
of Newtown Square, Pa., for $46.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale price to Kantar will be increased by $2.5 million if
IntelliQuest meets third-quarter financial goals. In addition,
IntelliQuest shareholders will receive the company's cash on hand
at closing. IntelliQuest had cash and short-term investment
securities totaling $29.5 million on June 30, compared with total
liabilities of $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Company President and Chief Executive Brian Sharples said the
cumulative sales price for all the company's assets, including cash
on hand and other factors, will amount to $104 million to $110
million, or between $12.25 and $13 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed at $9.25 a share, unchanged, in
Nasdaq trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharples said the deal makes sense for IntelliQuest's workers,
its clients and its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders will receive a premium over the current market
price. The company will continue to be known as IntelliQuest and
based in Austin, but it will be able to tap Kantar's resources and
its international contacts to expand its business, he said. Its
work force, which currently includes about 180 employees in Austin,
should grow after the acquisition Sharples said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a real positive for the company and for
Austin,'' Sharples said.
</P>
<P>
   IntelliQuest put itself on the sales block in February after the
board of directors decided it needed to improve its return to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which lost $1.2 million on revenue of $16.2 million
in the first half of 1999, is shifting toward doing more of its
market research over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sharples said he will remain with IntelliQuest during a
transition period, but he expects to leave the company within a
year of the completion of the deal. Marianne Grogan, president of
IntelliQuest's market research arm, will run the company under the
new owners.
</P>
<P>
   IntelliQuest was founded in 1985 by entrepreneur Peter Zandan,
who remains chairman of the company, but is no longer actively
involved in daily operations. Sharples joined as president of the
company in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The company raised $39.1 million when it went public in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kantar is the information and consulting division of WPP Group,
which also owns the J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
advertising agencies.

FURROW PAID CABBIE TWICE GOING FARE FOR L.A.-VEGAS RIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine hours after his violent rampage began, Buford
Furrow hailed a taxi in Hollywood and paid $800 _ nearly twice the
going rate _ for the cabbie to drive him to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   For L.A. taxi drivers, a fare to Las Vegas means a lucky day,
coming once or twice a year and bringing in as much as $500 _ two
to three times a normal day's take.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbie Hovik Garibyan told interviewers Thursday that he felt it
was his lucky day when a balding, middle-aged man pulled out eight
$100 bills about 8 p.m. Tuesday after saying he wanted to go to Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ride to Vegas is like a dream. Something falling from the
sky,'' Garibyan, 31, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think now I'm lucky 'cause he don't kill me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While police were searching an L.A. hotel Tuesday evening,
Garibyan said he saw the 37-year-old white supremacist walking down
Cherokee Avenue in the heart of Hollywood. He said he had no idea
who his fare was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he just come for me and he say to give him a ride,'' the
cabbie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First he say to LAX. Then he changed his mind. Then he told
me, `You know what? Can you drive me to Las Vegas?' because he said
that he don't like to fly on an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The 270-mile trip usually costs anywhere from $250 to $500.
Garibyan said he asked for $800 and was shocked when Furrow agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Garibyan, a driver with Independent Cab Co., said they stopped
at a fast-food restaurant about 70 miles from Las Vegas to get an
iced tea and Furrow slept part of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, he said he dropped Furrow in front of
the Statue of Liberty replica at the New York New York casino.
</P>
<P>
   He then drove back to Los Angeles and went to bed, only to be
awakened in the morning by a phone call from his boss.
</P>
<P>
   When Garibyan told his boss he had been to Vegas, the boss said:
``I want you to turn the TV on and see is that the guy that you go
to Vegas?''
</P>
<P>
   Other cab drivers interviewed Thursday at
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport said a fare to Las Vegas or other
faraway destinations is a rare but welcome opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pay me, I go anywhere,'' said Peter Agasyan, a driver
for City Cab Co. in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for me, long trip. We like money.''
</P>
<P>
   Agasyan and his colleagues agreed that, for the right price, any
long-distance destination is good, whether the fare takes them to
Las Vegas, Sacramento, Santa Barbara or Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   At $1.60 a mile, that ride could easily fetch more than $400.
Drivers tack on additional fees for their time, said taxi
coordinator Edwin Zaroukian, who oversees rides for Burbank's
Yellow Cab, Checker Cab Co. and City Cab.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 drivers under his supervision, Zaroukian said a
handful will get one or two Las Vegas fares a year and aren't
likely to ask a lot of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be killer. I don't ask,'' he said. ``Sometimes I ask
to see the money up front, but if you can pay the fare, we'll take
you.''

ALCOA'S COST-CONSCIOUS O'NEILL BIDS FOR REYNOLDS. NOW THE BLUFFING
BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Ga.)  (Eds: See also ALUMINUM-MERGERS) 
(DW) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk to industry insiders about Paul H. O'Neill, Alcoa's
chairman, and words like ``maverick,'' ``stickler,'' even
``ruthless,'' crop up all the time. But rarely does ``poker
player'' enter the vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that may just be the role O'Neill is playing, as he waits
to see what Reynolds Metals Co.'s board will do when it meets on
Sunday to discuss Alcoa's $5.8 billion bid to buy their company.
Most everyone paying attention to the deal expects the board to say
that the price, which comes out to about $65 a share, is just too
low, and that Alcoa will have to sweeten the pot or Reynolds will
go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry observers believe, however, that Reynolds has
nowhere else to go. Alcan, Pechiney SA and Alusuisse Lonza Group
AG, the three big aluminum companies that Reynolds has talked to in
the past, are busy combining their own operations. Although Jacques
Bougie, Alcan's chief executive and the man who will head the
merged mega-company, said Thursday that ``we will rule out no
options,'' few expect him to seriously entertain a Reynolds bid.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds might be bluffing, and most expect O'Neill to call that
bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Alcoa to offer more money would be like bidding against
itself, and why would it want to do that?'' said a person close to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In his 12-year tenure as Alcoa's chief, O'Neill has certainly
not made a name for wasting money. He is often credited with
keeping costs so low and management systems so lean that Alcoa
could reap more profit from the metal than any other company in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In personality, he's not all that distinguishable from the
other suits, but in vision, this man is truly innovative,'' said
James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill has been full of surprises from the day he joined Alcoa
in 1987. That was the year that Alcoa's board, concluding that
aluminum was a dead-end business, decided that only an outsider
could get it into more lucrative fields. It plucked O'Neill, who
had been an outside director of Alcoa for a year, from the
presidency of International Paper to be Alcoa's new chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill proceeded to do the opposite of what the board had
expected. He scuttled a budding diversification program, instead
snapping up aluminum assets in the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa had been treating its overseas operations as ancillary.
O'Neill treated them as pivotal to Alcoa's becoming a global
presence. He formed a joint venture with Japan's Kobe Steel. When
Alcoa executives advised him to shut down Alcoa's ailing Brazilian
operations, he instead coordinated with local management to turn
them around _ and groomed a Brazilian executive, Alain J.P. Belda,
to be his successor. (Belda was recently named chief executive, and
will become chairman when O'Neill retires in December 2000).
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, many American executives had grown leery of
bloated staffs and endless meetings, but O'Neill was allergic to
them. Armed with degrees in economics and public administration, he
had spent 16 years working for the government, culminating with a
stint as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget
from 1974 through 1977.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined Alcoa, he began slashing. Early on, he wiped out
two layers of management jobs, shuttered under-productive plants
and reorganized the company in about 25 businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He forced executives to fly to Alcoa operations in other parts
of the country, and even overseas, to try to glean best practices.
If one plant had great accounting practices, he wanted everyone to
adopt them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he confine the benchmarking activity to internal
operations. He adopted many quality control techniques from a
joint-venture partner, Kobe. He studied the Toyota Corp.'s
``just-in-time'' inventory control and adapted it to Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa's plants are now the smoothest running, lowest cost in the
industry. They also have one of the best safety records _ a fact
that O'Neill recites like a mantra, quoting safety statistics at
the beginning of every analysts' conference call. ``It's his way of
showing that he cares about people, and that he pays attention to
details and quality,'' Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill has avoided adding to the already ample capacity of
aluminum. Instead, he has purchased existing assets _ most
recently, Alumix of Italy, Inespal of Spain and Atlanta-based
Alumax _ and then used Alcoa's efficiency techniques to wring costs
out. His acquisitions, analysts said, have added to earnings from
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He has also taken a hard line with major customers. Four years
ago, he insisted that even powerful customers like Coca-Cola and
Pepsi agree to long-term contracts that guaranteed Alcoa a certain
degree of mark-up over whatever aluminum was selling for on the
London Metals Exchange. Other aluminum producers followed suit,
bringing an end to short-term, fixed price contracts for canned
sheet. Prices soon rose.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill is one of the industry's best-paid executives. Last year
his base salary was $850,000, he netted $3.8 million from
exercising options, and the board gave him a $1.6 million bonus.
This year his salary has been increased to $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, O'Neill introduced what is probably the most visible
symbol of the made-over Alcoa. He moved the company's 400
headquarters employees _ down from 2,000 when he first took over _
into a sparkling new six-story building in Pittsburgh. It has no
elevators, no long corridors and no doors on offices. Escalators
link the floors. No one's office is bigger than 9 feet by 9 feet,
not even O'Neill's.

MONDESI LEADING BY BAD EXAMPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ My, oh, my. Now we've all seen the full Mondy.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi bared his bitterness in the starkest of ways on
Wednesday. Goodness knows he let it all hang out, letting loose an
expletive-laced tirade against his Los Angeles Dodgers bosses that
would have done Tom Lasorda proud.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of jaw-dropping exhibition that made those
around him want to cover their ears if not their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Raul. It's tough being him. Imagine punching the clock four
or five hours a day for some 200 days a year and carrying the hopes
and expectations of an adoring Latin community and doing all of
this and more on a shoestring salary of $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the right fielder is prone to pouting and sulking
spells. No wonder he blows off a batting practice here and a
mandatory practice there. No wonder he hid out in the bullpen that
day in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi was speaking for oppressed people everywhere when he
hissed, ``(Expletive) Davey. (Expletive) Malone. (Expletive) both
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson, he has some nerve fining Mondesi for
missing a workout and benching him for not bothering to show up
until minutes before a recent game.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Mondesi's insubordination is a cancer that can _ and
has _ spread to other players in the clubhouse. Doesn't Johnson
know who Mondesi is?
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi is the first Dodgers player in Brooklyn and L.A. history
to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season. We're talking
about a player who led the Dodgers in nine offensive categories in
1998, who has won two Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mondesi is as temperamental as he is talented. But why do
wondrous athletes exist, if not to be coddled?
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, 28, has been handled like a Ming vase since Ralph Avila
signed him in his native Dominican Republic as a callow
17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Dodgers' previous ownership, every Mondesi temper
tantrum was forgiven, every misstep swept under the lush green
carpet of the diamond. His excellence and ethnicity, after all, was
made-to-order for a franchise with a visible, devoted Hispanic fan
base.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi never faced consequences, no matter how badly he
behaved. So when Johnson took over as manager this season, of
course Mondesi assumed the new skipper's rules didn't apply to him.
Who's to tell the King of Chavez Ravine anything? Mondesi has been
all that and less for the past two seasons, since signing what was
then the richest deal in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Piazza, the other fan favorite, was none too
pleased with the money thrown at Mondesi, not after the Dodgers had
deigned not to lock him into a long-term deal a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's pride was punctured. His ego seriously wounded, he
lashed out at the Dodgers. If Mondesi was worth as much as $60
million, he would ask for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza did and got himself shipped out. That left Mondesi as The
Man in the clubhouse. If he has failed miserably in that role,
well, don't blame him (not that anyone ever does).
</P>
<P>
   Of all the things the Dodgers groomed Mondesi to be, a leader
was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's ego is easily as big as Piazza's and it got its
comeuppance this past November when Malone, who had just stepped in
as general manager, took one look at the motley crew he had
inherited and declared that only pitcher Chan Ho Park was
untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove he was serious, Malone proceeded to shop Mondesi
and Mark Grudzielanek to the Cincinnati Reds. In return he wanted
the Reds' franchise player, infielder Barry Larkin, and outfielder
Reggie Sanders. The deal fell through but the die had been cast.
Mondesi no longer was loved unconditionally. He felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what Mondesi's agent, Jeff Moorad, said at the time?
``We would consider this a breach of faith if the Dodgers turned
their back on Raul and sent him to any other team at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorad also said, ``Raul doesn't want to play anywhere else.''
The truth was, Mondesi, in his mind, already had begun to disengage
himself from the only major-league team he has known. Thus, all his
acting out these past few months.
</P>
<P>
   What, you expected Mondesi to work at making this relationship
work? If his new bosses weren't going to let Mondesi be wild and
free, why shouldn't he give them no choice but to trade him to a
team that will?
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, after all, has a reputation to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership? Loyalty? Responsibility? No. No. Of course not.
Mondesi is a professional baseball player, not an Eagle Scout.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers made a significant financial investment in him, but
he obviously never made an emotional investment in them.
</P>
<P>
   Mired in the Mondesi mess is a lesson Dodgers these days seem to
learn fast: 'Tis far easier to blame your shortcomings on somebody
else than own up to them.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to grow up, Mondesi has made a mockery of the
Dodgers. By forcing the Dodgers' hand, Mondesi has weakened it. Not
since Wayne Huizenga has one man done so much to tear apart a team.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi doesn't care, of course. His naked antipathy made that
all too clear. &QL;

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C. Bogle was tough enough to survive a heart transplant
three years ago, but now he cannot overcome the policies of the
Vanguard Group, the mutual fund company he founded a
quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle, who almost single-handedly created the index-fund
phenomenon, confirmed Thursday that he will most likely have to
leave the Vanguard board at the end of this year, in keeping with a
longstanding policy that requires directors to resign at the end of
the calendar year in which they turn 70.
</P>
<P>
   Since he stepped down as Vanguard's chief executive in 1996 and
as chairman last year, Bogle has held the title of senior chairman
and remained on the nine-member board. In recent months, he has
lobbied Vanguard's other directors to waive the age rule in this
one case, but that now appears unlikely to happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle said he had mixed emotions about remaining a director of
the fund company, but he said ``it would have been nice if it were
my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I would have made it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rule in the world that can't be waived,'' Bogle
added. ``I'm the firm's only founder. It would hardly set a
precedent for other creators of Vanguard. I'm going to guess the
directors are not going to waive the retirement age for the founder
of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Though both Bogle and Vanguard officials say they expect him to
stay on in some capacity at the fund company, Bogle acknowledges
that he would operate Vanguard somewhat differently than his
successor and longtime protege, John J. Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   He has no major disagreements with Brennan, but he said ``the
emphasis is not quite where it would be if I was there.'' He
declined to specify what he might do differently, but said ``it
would be impossible to find anyone with the missionary zeal I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that while he thought the firm's expansion of its
mutual-fund ``supermarket'' and its discount brokerage firm had
been done in keeping with Vanguard's founding purpose, those were
``not issues I'd want to crusade on.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk for some time of disagreements between Bogle
and Brennan, but Vanguard officials have denied that any rift
exists. Asked whether there is any tension in their relationship,
Bogle said: ``I don't know if tension is the right word. Life is
complicated and relationships are even more complicated.'' He also
said he had not spoken to Brennan about staying on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard officials said directors had never granted an exception
to the retirement-age rule. One board member added: ``That's the
retirement age. That's the policy. That's the way it has always
been. When I reach age 70, I will retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, reached at his vacation home Thursday, reiterated that
there was no rift with Bogle, but he declined to say anything more.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to all Vanguard employees Thursday morning,
he said: ``It is important to clarify that the Vanguard board is
not asking Jack to retire. His pending retirement follows his
attainment of age 70 this year, which under a longstanding policy
set by the nomination committee of the Vanguard board is the
retirement age for board members. When Jack steps down in December,
he will leave a lasting legacy that is ours to cherish and,
importantly, perpetuate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials of the fund group, which is based in Malvern,
Pa., also play down talk of a serious rift, which was reported in
Institutional Investor. Such talk is ``much ado about nothing,''
said Michael Miller, Vanguard's managing director of planning and
development.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller added that he could not say there had been no
disagreements. ``I wouldn't sit here and tell you it hasn't
happened,'' he said. ``Any two individuals involved in a company as
large as Vanguard occasionally are going to see some things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of Vanguard, which oversees a half-trillion
dollars of investors' money and ranks as the No. 2 mutual fund
company, behind Fidelity Investments, Bogle had a bully pulpit that
he used effectively as an outspoken evangelist of mutual-fund
investing. Yet he was a harsh critic of the industry itself, which,
in his view, charges excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle said Thursday that he did not plan to slow down. Details
of what job he may have at Vanguard after this year are still being
worked out with the board, but he said he did not expect to fully
retire for at least five more years. He also plans to continue his
schedule of speeches and other public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Greenwald, a longtime fund industry consultant in
Philadelphia, said: ``I don't think you can underestimate Bogle's
importance, not only to Vanguard but the entire industry. His
fierce integrity and depth of intellect have set the bar. He is a
towering presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogle's departure from the board should not mean any changes for
Vanguard shareholders, analysts said. ``I think this is more of a
public relations problem for Vanguard than it is an operational
problem,'' said Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser
for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter that tracks the mutual fund
company.

<P>
   From the balcony of his hotel room in Vero Beach, Fla., Arturo
Gatti pointed to a spot on the beach where he said a foot washed up
on shore when he was training last year. Shark attack.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Gatti said recently, he was running down the beach
and he saw a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to out too far,'' Gatti said. ``I only go out
where the water is up to my waist.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti should not have any fear. If a shark were to attack him,
it would be in for quite a fight. And if the shark did manage to
eat him, it would spit him out. Gatti is too tough.
</P>
<P>
   In the sport of boxing, where the ability to absorb punishment
is in direct proportion to the ability to dish it out, Arturo Gatti
is an anomaly. In most of his bouts he seems to take punches with a
masochistic glee. His threshold for pain starts at the top of the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   And just when it looks as though he is going to get knocked out,
Gatti rallies and opens up a barrage that is more devastating than
the one just inflicted on him.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti (29-4 with 24 knockouts) returns to the ring Saturday
night in a 10-round junior welterweight bout against Reyes Munoz
(21-3) at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. The bout is on
the undercard of the lightweight championship fight between Stevie
Johnston and Angel Manfredy.
</P>
<P>
   The bouts will be broadcast as part of HBO's ``Boxing After
Dark'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti, a former International Boxing Federation lightweight
champion, is not a household name, but he is popular on the HBO
program. Gatti has the good looks of Oscar De La Hoya, but lacks De
La Hoya's mass appeal _ and bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core boxing fans recognize Gatti as a breathing action
figure. Outside the ring, he likes to live life on the edge as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People view him as a throwback, like a Tony Zale,'' said Lou
DiBella, senior vice president of programming for HBO/TVKO,
referring to the legendary middleweight brawler from the '40s.
``He's a nicer version of Jake LaMotta, the Raging Bull. He's
untamed. His life style is fairly wild outside the ring, too. If
there wasn't prize fighting, he'd be in trouble, because he'd be
fighting anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBella added: ``Arturo has always scared me, because Arturo is
reckless. He's into having a good time. But sometimes he doesn't
think. I don't think Arturo will hurt anyone but himself. He just
has a sixth sense for a beef. And he's a real ladies' man to a
ridiculous degree. He lives fast. I just hope he lives a long and
happy life.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gatti, who has an apartment in Miami Beach, was
arrested in Miami for punching a man in the head twice during an
argument over a woman. While being arrested, Gatti threatened a
police officer. He settled the case by entering a diversion
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something that was really stupid,'' Gatti said. ``I
shouldn't have done it. I wasn't thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The scars on his forehead and nose mark Gatti as a brawler. But
the tattoo on the back of his neck, a pair of boxing gloves
dripping with blood with the label ``Victory'' above them, says
everything about him. Gatti said it means he is a warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Brawlers like Gatti have a short career span. And Gatti, at age
26, is already beginning to show the effects of his numerous wars.
His face swells easily, particularly around his eyes. He frequently
gets cuts around the eyes. And he has had to take a greater amount
of time off between bouts in his last three fights. His last fight
_ another war _ was against Ivan Robinson last Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame the way he swells and cuts,'' said Pat Lynch,
Gatti's manager. ``The kid is always fighting out of desperation.
That means all the game planning goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gatti recently went through a grueling workout in a
sweltering gym called the House of Champions in Vero Beach,
including eight rounds of sparring, his skills were obvious. He
puts together punches off the jab. His defensive prowess is above
average. He is adroit at slipping punches.
</P>
<P>
   It all vanishes when the bell rings on fight night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start slugging with me, I want to retaliate,'' Gatti
said. ``Then, the longer the fight goes, my eyes start to shut and
I start to think that I have to keep fighting or the referee will
stop the fight. At that point, I'm looking for a knockout.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He would rather brawl, because he believes it pleases the crowd.
But it is a maddening and frightening sight for his trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to fight with his hands down; it's an old habit,''
said Ronnie Shields, Gatti's trainer in his last two fights. ``You
scream and holler at him, but it doesn't do any good. He doesn't
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   In his fight against Robinson, Shields worked with Gatti on his
defense. Gatti's idea of defense against Robinson was to stick his
head out and let Robinson take his best shots. Shields has trained
Gatti to box against Munoz, but doesn't know what will happen when
the bell rings.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Gatti, a second cousin who is six years older than Gatti
and lives in Boca Raton, Fla., drove to Vero Beach recently to
watch Gatti work out. As the sweat poured off his cousin, Lorenzo
Gatti tried to distill the essence of Arturo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Gatti has heart,'' said Lorenzo Gatti, a police officer
in Lake Worth, Fla. ``We don't give up. We don't know how to give
up. That's what makes him what he is. That's how he made his mark.
He might go down, but he gets up and he usually knocks the other
guy out. Plus, he's got a head like a brick.''
</P>
<P>
   Their families left San Pietro Infini, Italy, about 60 miles
south of Rome, in 1950 on a ship headed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Immigration into the United States had been stemmed, and the
families settled in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   According to family members, Arturo's father, Giovanni, was an
electrician with forearms like steel cables and fists like
sledgehammers. He was something of a legend in San Pietro Infini
for having once knocked out a mule with a single punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I get my punching power,'' Arturo Gatti said.
</P>
<P>
   And his toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Gatti died eight years ago at age 46 after falling from
a ladder. He had gone by a job site where some of the workers from
his electrical company were having trouble pulling a wire through a
spot in the ceiling. Giovanni climbed up and pulled the wire
through, but fell to the floor on his back. He refused to get
medical treatment for a week. When he did seek treatment, it was
too late. He died from internal bleeding. Arturo was 18 at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Gatti doesn't know if he would have become a professional
boxer or followed his brother, Joseph, a once-promising junior
middleweight, to the United States if his father was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very strict,'' Gatti said. ``He wouldn't have allowed
me to leave home at 19, especially to come to America. I know I
wouldn't have been a boxer. I would have been the hardest punching
electrician in Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times in bouts when it looks as if Gatti will not last
until the next round. Gabriel Ruelas had him out on his feet in the
fourth round of their fight. In the fifth round, Gatti knocked
Ruelas out.
</P>
<P>
   When Gatti is getting battered and sagging on the ropes, his
mind and body are waging a battle of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind is saying, `Do you want to quit?' I'm taking punches
and it seems like a good idea. But then I say, `Heck no, I'm not
quitting.' And I start to throw punches.''
</P>
<P>
   This entire internal argument and resolution take place in a
nanosecond.
</P>
<P>
   DiBella said that Gatti is one of the top boxing draws on
television mainly because of his ``kill or be killed style.'' Gatti
has been involved in some of the highest-rated matches on ``Boxing
After Dark.'' But DiBella said he does not want to help Gatti
destroy himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's involved in World War III with Reyes Munoz, maybe it's
time for Arturo to hang 'em up,'' DiBella said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is hoping that Gatti does not brawl with Munoz, who, with
only nine knockouts, is not noted as a heavy hitter. But the
manager is not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Arturo, there are no easy fights,'' Lynch said. ``He is
in a battle when he shadow boxes.''

POLICE DEPT MAY HAVE LINK TO PISTOL IN L.A. SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Calif., Maine, Wash.) 
(sw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after five people were shot at a Jewish community center
in Los Angeles, federal authorities called a police department in
Washington state to confirm that a pistol recovered from the
confessed gunman, Buford O. Furrow Jr., apparently had originally
been bought by the department.
</P>
<P>
   The pistol, a Glock 9 mm semiautomatic, was apparently the gun
that the authorities believe Furrow used to kill a letter carrier
after the attack on the center.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday, Chief Gary Eisenhower of the police
department in Cosmopolis, Wash., a town of 1,600 near the port city
of Aberdeen, said an agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms had called on Wednesday to ask about a gun
involved in a ``high-profile'' case.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower said he had confirmed that the Glock model 26 with
the serial number cited by the agent had been bought by his
five-person department in 1996 from the manufacturer, Glock Inc.,
test-fired and soon after traded to a local firearms dealer for a
larger Glock model.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Los Angeles County district attorney, Gil
Garcetti, charged that Furrow, a white supremacist, had used an Uzi
assault-style submachine gun to attack the center on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven guns and stockpiles of ammunition were recovered from a
Toyota that Furrow reportedly hijacked after the community center
shooting, an investigator said. While some of those guns were
apparently acquired by Furrow recently, he had been a federally
licensed firearms dealer from 1992 to 1995, Jeff Roehm, a spokesman
for the firearms bureau, said.
</P>
<P>
   While Furrow purportedly used the Uzi at the community center, a
short time after, a Glock 9 mm semiautomatic pistol was apparently
used to kill Joseph Ileto, a letter carrier, the U.S. Aatorney in
Los Angeles, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, said at a news conference on
Thursday. A Glock pistol was recovered from the car that had been
hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower said he told the ATF agent that his department had
traded the Glock to a local licensed firearms dealer after finding
it unsatisfactory for police work. That dealer, who has since
closed his store in Cosmopolis, has said that he later sold the
weapon to a local resident, Eisenhower said. ``I am going to assume
that the local resident sold the gun through a gun show or someone
locally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One weapon recovered from the Toyota was an AR-15 assault-style
rifle produced by a Maine company owned by a businessman who until
recently was that state's finance chairman for the Republican
presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shootings, agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, which regulates the sale of guns, have
contacted gun manufacturers and others in an effort to learn how
Furrow, who is barred from buying guns because of a criminal
record, got his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The indication that weapons like the Glock seized from Furrow
may have changed hands several times before he acquired them will
complicate the investigation. While licensed dealers must retain
the name of the first retail purchaser of a gun, private
transactions between individuals and sales of used weapons at gun
shows are not regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Roehm said Action Arms, a company in Philadelphia that had
imported the Israeli-made Uzi, had gone out of business a number of
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The AR-15 semiautomatic rifle recovered from the Toyota had
apparently not been fired by Furrow. But it has attracted attention
because its firing mechanism and other working parts are produced
by Bushmaster Firearms, a Maine company owned by Richard E. Dyke,
who resigned last month as Bush's chief fund-raiser in Maine after
an Associated Press reporter contacted him about his firearms
business. Dyke said at the time that he did not want his activities
to become an issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bushmaster Firearms sells a section of some semiautomatic
rifles. Buyers of the section, a receiver, which contains a gun's
trigger, firing chamber and other working parts, complete the
weapon by adding a stock and barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Dyke did not return a telephone call on Thursday. But in an
interview Wednesday with The Los Angeles Times, he said that he had
been contacted by officials of the firearms bureau after the
shootings and that he said his company had sold the unit in
question to a gun dealer in the Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has taken a stand against additional federal gun control
and recently signed state legislation that would bar lawsuits
against the firearms industry.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Dyke has also contributed to the campaigns of
Republican candidates including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine,
campaign finance records show. In 1995, he donated $265,000 to
Husson College in Bangor, Maine, to establish the Richard E. Dyke
Center on Family Business, which focuses on the operations of small
and family-run businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Before her election to the Senate, Ms. Collins was the center's
first executive director. Last year, both she and Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, voted against a federal bill to require trigger
safety locks though both lawmakers backed a similar bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Abbott, Ms. Collins' chief of staff, said that Dyke was a
``well-known Republican activist'' in Maine and that his business
interests also included restaurants and other companies.

EARLEM. JORGENSEN, REAGAN ADVISOR AND STEEL DISTRIBUTOR, DIES AT
101  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Earle M. Jorgensen, who built one of the nation's
largest steel distribution companies and helped persuade actor
Ronald Reagan to go into politics, died Wednesday of natural causes
at his home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He was 101 and until weeks before his death went to the work
nearly every day at the business he founded, the Earle M. Jorgensen
Co. in Brea, Calif., which has annual sales of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen served on Reagan's ``Kitchen Cabinet,'' an informal
network of businessmen who advised Reagan and urged him to run for
governor of California in 1966 and later for president. But
Jorgensen declined to take any job in Washington, saying that he
wanted to stick with his business.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wilson, a California businessman who served as ambassador
to the Vatican in the Reagan administration, said Jorgensen's
personal success story ``had a lot to do with influencing''
Reagan's economic policies in support of free enterprise.
``Everyone had appreciated the fact that Earle had started with
nothing and built himself a nice fortune,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Thursday, Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
said: ``Earle Jorgensen was one of our oldest and dearest friends,
and we will miss him terribly. However, he has left us with many
wonderful memories of a man who was unquestionably one of the
nicest and most generous we have ever known. He had a deep love for
his country and supported numerous worthwhile causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen was a former chairman of the Los Angeles chapter of
the American Red Cross and was the largest individual contributor
to the chapter over the years. He donated to many universities and
was a trustee of the California Institute of Technology for 42
years, despite having never gone to college, or even finishing high
school. He was also a founder of the Los Angeles Music Center and
the Los Angeles Art Museum and involved in many other civic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen was born in San Francisco on June 22, 1898, the son of
Danish immigrants. His father, a sea captain, died when Jorgensen
was in high school, which forced him to drop out and get a job,
according to Wilson, a close friend who has known him since 1936.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army Tank Corps in World War I, Jorgensen
came to Los Angeles in 1920 and, the next year, at the age of 23,
began trudging over sand dunes to sell steel to oilmen working on
the beach. The business eventually prospered as a supplier to
California's growing aerospace and construction industries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Jorgensen's son John, who had become president of the
steel company, died from cancer at the age of 64, forcing
Jorgensen, at age 91, to resume a more active role in the business.
Jorgensen sold the company to Kelso &AMP; Co., a New York leveraged
buyout firm, in 1990 for $264 million, with his 32 percent stake
worth $84 million. He remained chairman until 1994 and since then
had been chairman emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   His slogan, written on a sign on his office wall, was ``Hustle!
_ That's All.'' In his desk he kept stacks of a book called ``The
Go-Getter: A Story That Tells You How to Be One,'' about a scrappy
kid who becomes a successful salesman. Jorgensen had stumbled upon
the book, written by Peter B. Kyne in 1921, in a bookstore and
liked it so much he bought the publishing rights and would give
away signed copies to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen apparently was introduced to the Hollywood scene,
leading to his friendship with Reagan, through his wife of 47
years, Marion, who had previously been married to Milton Bren, a
Hollywood producer. Jorgensen became the stepfather of his wife's
two sons, Donald and Peter Bren. Donald Bren is now a billionaire
real estate developer as owner of the Irvine Co. in Orange County,
outside of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and stepsons, Jorgensen is survived by
two children from his first marriage, Maren Long of Ojai, Calif.,
and Earle M. Jorgensen Jr. of Mariposa, Calif. His son John and a
daughter from that marriage, which ended in divorce, pre-deceased
him. He also had 17 grandchildren, 21 great-grandchildren and one
great-great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen did not take up sports until learning to ski at age
59, according to Wilson. He then moved to tennis and golf. Even in
his 100th year, he was getting up at 5 a.m. three days a week to
work with a personal trainer. But work was always paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always worked,'' he told Forbes magazine last year. ``I'm
too busy to die.''

DONALD E. JOHNSON, FORMER HEAD OF VA, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., S.C., Iowa, Ore., Colo., Wis.)   By NICK RAVO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald E. Johnson, who headed the Veterans Administration under
President Nixon but resigned under pressure from Congress and
veterans' groups, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Fredericksburg,
Va. He was 75 and lived in Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, said his son, Robert Johnson of
North Myrtle Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   During his five years at the Veterans Administration, from 1969
to 1974, Johnson had been asked to reduce the agency's budget and,
at the same time, provide benefits to an increasing number of
veterans because of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1974, several members of Congress met at the White
House and urged Nixon to ask for Johnson's resignation. They
accused Johnson of mismanaging veterans' health, education and
other benefits; cutting payments imprudently to appease the U.S.
Office of Management and Budget; encouraging employees to
contribute to the president's re-election campaign and loading his
staff with Nixon campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson defended his record, and some in Congress felt that he
had been made a scapegoat for the retrenchment policies imposed by
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Johnson resigned shortly after the White House meeting
and before Senate hearings were held on the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   He later served as a deputy assistant secretary at the Commerce
Department and as chief of staff to Sen. Roger Jepsen, R-Iowa. He
also worked as executive director of the National Credit Union
Administration from 1985 until he retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Edward Johnson was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on June 5,
1924. He attended Iowa State University. During World War II, he
was a sergeant in the 89th Division of Gen. George Patton's 3d Army
in Europe. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Before his appointment in 1969 as administrator of the Veterans
Administration, Johnson was a seed and fertilizer dealer from West
Branch, Iowa, and a former national commander of the American
Legion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Robert, Johnson is survived by his wife, Mary
Jean Johnson; five other sons, Alan Johnson of Portland, Ore.,
David Johnson of Ocheyedan, Iowa, Brian Johnson of Adel, Iowa,
Kevin Johnson of Des Moines, Iowa, and Kurt Johnson of Rochester,
Iowa; four daughters, Julie Johnson of Alexandria, Va., Joan
Johnson of Ouray, Colo., Beth Johnson Buck of Fort Collins, Colo.,
and Susan Johnson Vega of Milwaukee; 16 grandchildren and a
great-grandson.

ADVERTISING: FORD HOPES TO HOOK YOUNG CONSUMERS WITH LIVE
COMMERCIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (dal) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to cast a spell on skeptical younger car buyers, Ford
Motor Co. will center one of its largest recent product
introductions on a ploy that could be called the Blaring Gurwitch
Project.
</P>
<P>
   That's Annabelle Gurwitch, a co-host of ``Dinner and a Movie,''
a popular series on the TBS Superstation cable television channel.
The perky 30-something Ms. Gurwitch will be featured in more than
60 live TV commercials on four networks, which will begin Sept. 9,
to pitch the 2000 Ford Focus, intended to be the mainstay of the
small-car offerings by the Ford division.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not since the 1950s, when Ford peddled Fords, Mercurys,
Lincolns and even Edsels live during programs like ``The Ed
Sullivan Show'' has that company _ or any auto maker _ scheduled so
many live spots. While live commercials were a staple in the early
days of television, interrupting many live programs, they are now
mostly revived for their novelty value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're living in focus, you're living in the moment,'' said
Jan Klug, marketing communications manager for the Ford division in
Dearborn, Mich. ``Live TV is a fantastic way to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the goal is for younger viewers to perceive
the live spots as more real than taped ones, though scripts and
rehearsals will be part of the Gurwitch shtick, devoted to a
cross-country drive in a Focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's live like a symphony concert,'' Ms. Klug said. ``You
rehearse, but anything can happen. You can break a string.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not unlike the idea behind the sleeper hit film ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' whose creators heightened the apparent
authenticity of their fictional tale by mixing improvised and
planned elements. That is being cited as one big reason the movie
has been so successful with younger consumers, who are increasingly
disdainful of marketing campaigns they perceive to be pushed on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the riskiness, the spontaneity of being live,''
said Bruce Rooke, executive vice president and executive creative
director for the Ford domestic business at J. Walter Thompson
Detroit, part of the J. Walter Thompson Co. unit of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get you involved in experiencing it, connecting
with you on multiple levels,'' he added. Among the potential
calamities that could disrupt the spots, Rooke listed Ms.
Gurwitch's ``having a panic attack'' or ``breaking out in hives.''
Then he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The live commercials are the, well, focus of an 18-month
multimedia campaign being aimed by the Ford division at drivers 18
to 29, the members of the so-called Generations X and Y. Those
consumers are considered crucial to the success of the Focus, an
``entry level'' model in the Ford division lineup; the sedans,
hatchbacks and wagons will go on sale next month at prices between
$12,280 and $15,580.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the media choices include nontraditional aspects
like Focus' sponsorship of ``tattoo tents'' at concerts and a Web
site that is to start next month at www.focus247.com, as in
``24/7,'' the youthful lingo for ``nonstop.'' Another ``Blair
Witch''-like wrinkle will come when film students using hand-held
video cameras put on the site the backstage pre- and
post-production work for the live Gurwitch spots, which will start
appearing during the 1999 MTV Music Video Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual promotion, 120 Focuses will be given for two- to
three-month tests to emerging younger achievers in five cities, Ms.
Klug said, like disc jockeys, athletes and ``concierges at hot
hotels.'' There will also be ads for Focus affixed to construction
sites, known as wild postings; postcard ads; transit posters in
markets including Chicago and New York, and radio commercials with
a soulful, urban sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer in this case is very diverse, very open to
different types of communications,'' said John Church, associate
creative director for the Ford account at Uniworld Group in New
York, particularly those ``that say `If you get this, you're part
of the cool group.'''
</P>
<P>
   Uniworld, which handles Ford ads aimed at black car buyers,
produced the Focus radio spots and posters. Ms. Klug described the
campaign as a ``collaborative effort'' between Uniworld and
Thompson Detroit, which conceived and developed the overall
campaign, carrying the theme ``Focus live.'' Zubi Advertising
Services in Coral Gables, Fla., is creating a separate campaign
aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about the car challenges the status quo in the
small-car market,'' Ms. Klug asserted. ``We had to take the same
approach in the marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns for new car lines usually cost $50 million to $100
million. The trade publication Automotive News estimated that Ford
would spend $100 million on advertising and other promotions for
Focus, which was introduced in Europe last year. Ford division
executives expect to sell more than 300,000 Focus models a year in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If all the youth-oriented ads are not a sufficient signal as to
the market the Focus is aimed at, perhaps the names of the car
line's colors will assist the clueless. They include Sangria Red,
CD Silver, Rainforest Green, Infra-Red and Pitch Black.
</P>
<P>
   So, like, where's Whatever White?

YOUTH LEADS EXPERIENCE AFTER PGA'S FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Everyone else in the PGA Championship is older
than Sergio Garcia. Yet Thursday, nobody was better.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Garcia is displaying the tremendous talent that should
make him one of golf's biggest stars for the next 20 years. Garcia
came to the century's final major at Medinah Country Club not just
to compete, but to win. And after Thursday's superb round, the
teenager from Spain had the lead, as well as everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a six-under-par 66, and tying the course record shared
by three others, Garcia held a two-stroke lead after Thursday's
rainy first round. Jay Haas, J.P. Hayes and Mike Weir were tied for
second place at 68, while four players were tied for fifth place at
69 _ Stewart Cink, Brandt Jobe, Jerry Kelly and Brian Watts. Corey
Pavin was at three-under-par through 16 holes when play was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, at 19 years 7 months, is the second-youngest competitor
in PGA Championship history (Gene Sarazen was a month younger when
he competed in 1921) and the youngest player ever to lead the
tournament. Since turning professional after the Masters in April,
Garcia has won the Murphy's Irish Open on the European Tour, and he
has quickly risen to 12th in the European Ryder Cup standings. But
after missing the cut at last month's British Open, which included
his opening-round 89, some questioned whether Garcia was ready to
win a major.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Garcia believed he answered his doubters. ``It seemed
like I had something to prove, because in every press conference
since the British Open, there was the big question: `What happened
at the British Open?''' Garcia said. ``I think I proved myself
today. The British Open is done, so I don't want to hear any more
questions about that. The difference was that here, I played well,
everything went the right way, and I made putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing bothered Garcia Thursday, not even the off-and-on rain
that made the 7,401-yard layout play even longer. During a
47-minute weather delay that came while Garcia was on the 15th
green, he returned to the locker room and calmly ate half a ham
sandwich, then returned to the course and picked up where he had
left off.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia set the tone for his round by chipping in for birdie from
just off the green on the second hole. Then he used his short game
to birdie the par-5 No. 5, getting up and down from a bunker. On
the back nine, Garcia turned to his iron play and his putter. He
hit a 9-iron approach shot to within a foot for a birdie at No. 11,
made a 7-footer for birdie at No. 14, made a 30-foot putt for
birdie at No. 16, then hit a 9-iron approach shot at No. 18 to
within 6 feet, setting up his final birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he is not surprised by what he has accomplished in
his brief pro career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was ready to win, but I didn't know I was going to do
it so soon,'' said Garcia, who was mentored by two of Spain's great
players, Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that there is a long way to go in the
tournament. ``I'd always rather be two strokes ahead,'' he said.
``And if I can be four strokes ahead tomorrow, I'll be happy. You
have to realize it's only the first day. I'm very happy to be
leading a major even for the first time, but I believe I can stay
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   While Garcia will have many more opportunities to win majors,
Haas, at 45, does not have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock may be ticking for me, but the clock is ticking for
all of us,'' said Haas, who has been a steady player for years.
``You only get to play four majors a year, and there have been some
years when I only got to play two or three. If I continue to hit
fairways and avoid the rough, I feel I can stay in contention. But
I can't worry about my age. I just have to play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many prominent players, including Tiger Woods (70) and
David Duval (70), lurked in contention, they were all chasing
Garcia. Imagine the scene if Garcia battles Woods and Duval on
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who played a practice round with Woods on Wednesday, did
not seem fazed by that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to play with great players,'' Garcia said.
``But when I turned pro, I believed I was ready because I was
playing well enough. Today was one of my better rounds. But I'm
looking forward to tomorrow.''

LOS ANGELES: ``Glock with him.'' Furrow then drove to the 7-Star Suites Hotel in the Los Angeles
suburb of Chatsworth, which was across the street from the postal
facility where Ileto reported for duty, and left the gun in the
1999 Toyota Corolla he had carjacked, the U.S. Attorney said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mayorkas said the federal charges, which also carry the death
penalty, are for the murder of a federal worker in the course of
his duty and for a felon carrying a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's filed one count of murder against Furrow
with two special-circumstance allegations _ hate-crime motivation
and fleeing from a crime _ which makes him eligible for the death
penalty under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow also was accused of five counts of attempted murder in
the shooting of receptionist Isabelle Shalometh, 68; camp counselor
Mindy Finkelstein, 16; and three boys, Benjamin Kadish, Joshua
Stepakoff and James Zidell.
</P>
<P>
   The charges accuse Furrow of committing the crimes because of
the victims' religion or ancestry.In addition, he was accused of
hijacking a waitress' car and using a weapon during the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this was a hate crime,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were still working out which office
would prosecute first or if there would be a joint prosecution
based on which would stand the better chance of resulting in the
most severe sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It also was not known how Furrow would eventually plead since he
has been providing so many details to authorities about the crime
and his past involvement with a white supremacist organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes is something my office has been working hard on,
trying to eradicate for years,'' Garcetti said. ``This has to
double our efforts. We have to understand the lasting pain this
brings. We will ensure justice in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayorkas and Garcetti said they would provide no further details
on Furrow's motivation in selecting the community center rather
than a more visible target, how he decided on Los Angeles as the
site for the rampage or on the shootings at the community center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all evidence that is being developed,'' Mayorkas said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mayorkas said he wanted the prosecution to
send a message to the public and others about the seriousness with
which the government considered the matter.
</P>
<P>
   George Baliban, owner of the Desert Cab company in Las Vegas,
said one of his drivers took Furrow to the office where he
surrendered to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Furrow called for a pickup at a motel about 8:30 a.m.
(Wednesday) and he asked to go 700 East Charleston, that's the FBI
office. He seemed just like a regular, courteous customer. He was
really nice to the cab driver and didn't say much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know it was him. The cab driver even said he was a
good tipper. The cab driver said he was very nice. He was surprised
to find out who this guy was and the cab driver told me, `I guess
you just never can tell.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The driver declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow had attended Rancho High School in North Las Vegas
between 1975 and 1977 in his freshman and sophomore years but
passed through school with virtual anonymity, said Rick Kraske, a
former classmate who said he was not acquainted with Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken with a whole bunch of friends and nobody seems to
remember this guy,'' Kraske said. ``We've all looked in our
yearbooks. He wasn't involved in any of the clubs or in sports. He
just seemed to be a real low-key guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraske said he was surprised to learn that the gunman in the
shooting rampage has been identified as a former classmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, it was pretty harmonious and real racially
diverse,'' he said. ``Back then, North Las Vegas was a
working-class and in some parts, impoverished neighborhood. But you
also had some kids that were sons and daughters of people stationed
at Nellis Air Force Base. It was a solid-working class neighborhood
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Monaco, 71, a former principal of Rancho High School, also
said the school was a melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember him but I can't believe he picked up any
racist attitudes at the high school. There so many different
cultures there and everyone seemed to get along OK,'' Monaco said.
``We had our problems, of course, but they were the same kinds of
problems that any other school had at the time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., the confessed murderer
and white supremacist, has been formally charged with the
cold-blooded murder of postal worker Joseph Santos Ileto and faces
other charges that could lead to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow told investigators he shot five people at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center and, less than an hour later, killed
letter carrier Joseph Santos Ileto because he was a nonwhite
``target of opportunity,'' U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crimes that were committed on Tuesday appeared to be
targeted at members of a particular minority group,'' Mayorkas
said. ``It is not, however, only the members of those groups who
are the victims of these crimes. It is all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes with racial motives tear at the heart of our nation and
are an assault against our foundation of liberty. The federal
government is committed to protecting and vindicating the civil
rights of all our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office also filed
death penalty charges Thursday against Furrow for murder, attempted
murder of the five children and staff members wounded at the Jewish
Community Center and carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all victims, everyone in Los Angeles County and
everyone in this country is a victim,'' District Attorney Gil
Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, surrendered to the FBI in Las Vegas on Wednesday and
confessed to the shootings. He was arraigned in Los Angeles federal
court Thursday amid tight security.
</P>
<P>
   Handcuffed and shackled, Furrow was led into the federal
courtroom. He looked at the crowd, approached Deputy Federal Public
Defender Sean Kennedy, grinned and said: ``They all like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, in Las Vegas as he was being transported to
Los Angeles, someone in a crowd called him a coward. Furrow
replied: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was formally notified of the federal charges against him
and ordered held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Furrow fired nine rounds at Ileto _ including
several shots in his back as he tried to run away _ and left him
lying in the driveway of a home on Valley Circle Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was dressed in his full postal uniform and his clothing was
covered with blood,'' Michael P. Delaney, a U.S. postal inspector,
stated in a federal affidavit. An autopsy indicated that five of
the 9 mm rounds were fatal, according to Delaney's sworn statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mayorkas provided a detailed account of what Furrow told
authorities on the events leading up to the death of the
39-year-old Filipino immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stated that the postal worker was a good target of
opportunity to kill, because he was `nonwhite' and worked for the
federal government,'' Mayorkas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He further stated that he exited his car and approached the
mail carrier. He was carrying a loaded Glock, model 26 (handgun) in
his back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if the mail carrier could mail a letter for him. When
the mail carrier agreed, Furrow pulled out the Glock and shot the
mail carrier two times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mail carrier bent over and attempted to run away. Furrow
stated that he then shot the mail carrier a few times in the back,
until he saw the mail carrier fall to the ground face-down. At that
point, Furrow got back into the Toyota and drove away. He stated
that he had the Glock with him.''

SUSPECT IN COMMUNITY CENTER SHOOTING CONFESSES TO POSTMAN'S
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite information re taxi ride in 16th and 17th
grafs.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In chilling detail, Buford O. Furrow Jr., the
suspect in a shooting on Tuesday at a Jewish Community Center here,
has confessed that he shot a Filipino-American letter carrier the
same day because he was a nonwhite ``target of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He told investigators that he was driving down a quiet
residential street in a Toyota he had hijacked when he spotted the
letter carrier, 39-year-old Joseph Santos Ileto, in his uniform,
stuffing letters into a mailbox next to his mail truck.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow said he thought Ileto was Hispanic or Asian, so he
stopped his car and asked Ileto if he would mail a letter. Ileto
agreed. Furrow then pulled a Glock Model 26 pistol from his back
pocket and shot Ileto twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stated that the mail carrier bent over and attempted to run
away,'' said a criminal complaint filed on Wednesday but unsealed
Thursday morning. ``He then shot the mail carrier a few times in
the back until he saw the mail carrier fall to the ground face
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ileto was shot at point-blank range nine times.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint added that five of the nine shots that hit Ileto
were considered fatal by the coroner. Both the federal and the
state charges filed Thursday for that murder could bring the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state prosecutors on Thursday charged Furrow, a
white supremacist, with capital murder and other felony counts.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, made an initial appearance before a federal
magistrate Thursday and was denied bail, but the relaxed-looking,
heavyset man in prison blues, handcuffs and manacles stood in
stunning contrast to the cold-blooded, racist murderer described by
both the U.S. attorney and the Los Angeles district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with close-cropped hair, a
mustache and wire-rimmed, aviator-style glasses sliding down his
nose, shuffled into the courtroom so quietly at precisely 11 a.m.
that few of the several dozen reporters present seemed to notice
him initially. He tersely answered a few procedural questions posed
by the federal magistrate, Carolyn Turchin, and spoke up only once
during the seven-minute hearing, to correct her when she read his
name, adding ``Junior'' after she had said Buford Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to fill in details of Furrow's violent rampage
here on Tuesday, the authorities only deepened the mystery of how
Furrow, a well-known member of white supremacist groups and a
convicted felon, could have amassed the huge arsenal of weapons he
brought here and how he financed his murderous expedition to Los
Angeles from his home in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   He was believed to be unemployed with a history of losing jobs,
but he used at least $4,000 to buy a van last Saturday. He then
spent $800 on a taxi ride to Las Vegas. Law enforcement officials
said they would not comment on whether they have evidence that he
received financial or other kinds of assistance from anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings began at about 10:49 a.m. Tuesday, when Furrow,
according to charges, entered the North Valley Jewish Community
Center in the Granada Hills section of Los Angeles and fired at
least 70 shots with an Uzi submachine gun, hitting five people,
including three children at a day camp. All five are now
recovering, although one 5-year-old boy was still listed in
critical condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Burford then fled in his van, parked it and then carjacked the
Toyota, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that the murder was racially motivated,''
said Alejandro Mayorkas, the U.S. attorney here.
</P>
<P>
   Another puzzling element was added Thursday when the taxi
company whose driver transported Furrow to Las Vegas after the
shootings said here that Furrow had hailed the taxi near the heart
of Hollywood, some 15 miles from where he had abandoned the stolen
Toyota after shooting Ileto. Somehow he managed to cover that
distance in spite of a massive police dragnet near the scene of the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Konopov of Independent Taxi Co. said that a driver,
Hovik Garibyan, had picked up Furrow near the corner of Sunset Blvd
and Cherokee St. Furrow initially asked to be taken to the airport,
Konopov said, then said he was afraid of flying and asked instead
to be taken to Las Vegas. A price of $800 was negotiated. Furrow
paid with $100 and $50 bills, and then slept most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising serious concerns about a broader
conspiracy, the shootings intensified the debate over gun control.
Furrow had such a large arsenal _ it included handguns, an assault
rifle, hand grenades and thousands of rounds of ammunition _ that
police had said earlier that they felt lucky more people had not
been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton commented on the shootings on Thursday,
calling them ``another compelling argument for the passage of hate
crimes legislation and the common-sense gun legislation.'' Law
enforcement officials have not yet said how they believe Furrow
obtained the weapons or announced the results of any tracing they
may have done of the origins of the guns.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint unsealed Thursday listed two charges, the
premeditated murder of a federal employee in the performance of his
duties, and the illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon. Furrow had been convicted of assault in Washington state.
Mayorkas said Furrow could face other federal charges later. His
next hearing on the federal charges is scheduled for Aug. 24.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A press conference Thursday morning was held jointly by Mayorkas
and the district attorney, Gil Garcetti, who separately filed a
seven-count complaint against Furrow, including the hate-motivated
murder of Ileto, the attempted murder of the five people at the
Jewish community center, and carjacking. The state murder charge
could also bring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials did their best to present a unified
front, since there had been a behind-the-scenes struggle between
the U.S. attorney's office and the district attorney over who would
charge and try Furrow first. Those issues remained unresolved
Thursday, but at the press conference Garcetti said a joint task
force had been formed to continue the investigation and to
determine when and where Furrow would ultimately be tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to continue working together to insure that justice
is served,'' said Garcetti, who added that he expected Furrow to be
arraigned on the state charges within the next few days.

BUSH SAYS STRAW POLL WILL SHOW STRENGTH OF HIS GRASS-ROOTS
ORGANIZATION IN IOWA 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa _ To the strains of ``Deep in the Heart of
Texas`` from a Dixieland band, Gov. George W. Bush arrived Thursday
in Iowa for the first non-money test of his presidential campaign _
the Ames straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 350 people, Bush said the poll Saturday will
show the strength of his grass-roots political organization in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can get people from all across your great state
to take time out from their weekend to say for one moment: We want
George W. Bush to be the nominee of the Republican Party,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day in Springfield, Ill., Bush said finishing
anything less than first Saturday would just be a disappointing
step on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (coming less than first) means you're going to write a
story that says George W., as his daughter says, is not as cool as
he thinks he is,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been the party's front-runner in public opinion polls,
and this spring set a record for a presidential primary candidate
by raising $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout for Bush's recent events in Iowa would indicate a
show of strength going into the straw poll. But many attendees
interviewed said they were there because they liked his father,
former President Bush, and wanted to see if the governor would live
up to their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the son of George Bush is the first recommendation for
him,'' said Paul Carroll, 83, of Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he hopes people are showing up because they want him
to be president. He believes they are coming to his events because
he is running a different style of campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party wants a candidate who will campaign in a
little different manner ... somebody who will pledge as we head
into the 21st century to abandon trash-mouth politics,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he also understands that it will be difficult to
keep enthusiasm for his campaign through the primaries and general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible in a marathon to keep up a pretty good pace?
That's just something we're going to have to figure out how to deal
with,'' Bush said. ``I've never run for president before, and I've
got a lot of work to do to maintain the sense of enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said part of his strategy to maintain that enthusiasm will
be to lay out policy messages over the next several months and to
visit states outside of Iowa and New Hampshire that have primaries
early in the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to Iowa, Bush stopped in Cape Girardeau, Mo., to talk
about farm policy and to have a private meeting with conservative
talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh was in town visiting his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush stopped in the Springfield to pick up the endorsement
of one current and two previous Republican governors of Illinois:
Gov. George Ryan, James R. Thompson and Jim Edgar.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the Ames straw poll, the Bush campaign has
sent out 150,000 mailings, arranged for 100 buses to bring
supporters to the event and set up an automatic dialer to leave
telephone messages from Bush and his mother, Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Karen Hughes said the campaign has a maximum
budget for the straw poll of $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is measuring his potential for success by the
crowds he is drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect the crowd here today was huge because they want me
to be president, not because of how much money I've raised,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rands of DeWitt, Iowa, said he does not know much about
Bush but is attracted to his candidacy because he liked his father
as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all the Republican candidates, he appeals to me as best
for the party,'' Rands said. ``Part of it is name recognition, and
I know from reading the paper that the people of Texas are happy
with him as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   People attending Bush events in Clear Lake and West Des Moines
last week expressed similar feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for his dad. I liked his dad's policies and
principles. So I'll be happy if he's kind of the same,'' Garrett
Nyman, 55, a Des Moines schoolteacher said before Thursday's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Les Osterander of Buffalo Gap said Bush being his father's son
was enough to get his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked his dad. So if he's a sprout off the main twig, then I
hope he's our next president. At least I know he's honest,''
Osterander said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a ``Grandmas for Education Candidate George Bush'' sign
taped to her hat, grandmother-of-10 Rosanne Freeburg of Cedar
Rapids showed up at Bush's Clear Lake rally to support a candidate
who has made charter schools a top priority. She said she is
recruiting other grandmothers for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any grandma who comes to the straw poll is going to get a kiss
from Gov. Bush,'' said Freeburg, 72. ``And I'm getting a kiss for
every grandma I sign up. I got my 12th kiss tonight.''

NISSAN RE VAMPS MAX IMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Updated with an all new body, chassis and suspension,
and upgraded with more engine power, Nissan has improved its
flagship without losing its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, the Maxima is faster, handles better and provides more
driving fun than one should expect from a mainstream sedan. The
styling could be a bit more imaginative, but all that's quickly
forgotten once behind the wheel and into the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   Since its arrival in 1981, Maxima has provided a sporty
alternative to bland midsize sedans while competing to some degree
with the costly sport sedans from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good formula, providing a value-laden midsize car with
the performance and comfort of sedans costing much more. Maxima has
been a strong seller for Nissan all along, and has helped keep
Nissan on a even keel through its recent lean years.
</P>
<P>
   But although Maxima has sold consistently in the
100,000-per-year range, it always has been overshadowed in the
numbers game by Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Taurus. Nissan
is hoping to tap into more of the huge midsize market with the
stronger presence of its new sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Maxima is part of a total revamping of Nissan's product line,
which includes revised Pathfinders, Quests and Altimas, and such
new products as the Xterra sport-utility vehicle and Crew Cab
pickup, both spinoffs of the Frontier pickup.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to swim farther upstream, the all-new Infiniti I30
is pretty much the mechanical twin of the Maxima, though with
different styling and more luxury features.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior of the fifth-generation Maxima is completely new
but carries over the theme of the old model. The rear aspect is
interesting, particularly in the sporty SE model we drove, but the
rest of the shape seems generic and uninspired. Really, the
California designers might have tried something new and exciting,
more befitting Maxima's level of performance.
</P>
<P>
   The new Maxima is marginally bigger than the last one, including
an added 2 inches to the wheelbase, especially noticeable in the
interior space. Part of the commodious effect is due to the dash
and windshield being moved forward substantially. Back-seat
passengers will find plenty of legroom and headroom.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel, which Nissan touts as a new ``wave''
design because of how it flows together, is slanted forward,
looking sporty and providing some real extra space for the driver
and front-seat passenger. But it's really nothing new, reminiscent
of similar treatments by Honda, among others.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of the center console that really bugged me was the
adjustable armrest that pops up and forward with the push of a
button. I really didn't want the thing popped up, but my elbow
would hit that darn button while shifting gears and the arm rest
would spring into action.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting gears was one of the things I liked about the Maxima.
The smooth-shifting five-speed, standard on the SE, feels quick and
precise, with the gears well-spaced for active driving.
</P>
<P>
   And shifting is even more enjoyable now that the revised 3-liter
puts out a slick 222 horsepower, up from 190. Credit some
re-engineered intake and exhaust manifolds, less-restrictive
muffler and some Space Age materials for the boost in power.
</P>
<P>
   This is an engine I've always appreciated for its quiet
composure as well as its sparkling power delivery. Now, it's
better. The new Maxima has gained about 125 pounds, but the
additional ponies more than make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 comes standard, and Maxima is one of the few remaining
sedans that offers a stick shift with a V-6 _ a major selling
point, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor European cars will appreciate the Maxima's
steering and handling. The chassis is stiffer and the suspension
has been tweaked and revised for better response and reactions. The
only complaint here is that the steering could use a bit less power
boost and a bit more road feel.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is strong and effective, with discs on all four wheels,
and an anti-lock system is standard.
</P>
<P>
   The SE also includes a tighter suspension system, some sporty
body cues, and bigger 16-inch alloy wheels and performance tires,
with 17-inchers optional. Major options on the test car were a
$1,600 package that included a power sunroof, power driver's seat,
intermittent wipers and an integrated garage-door opener; a $1,349
leather trim package, which included climate control and a power
front-passenger seat; and a super 200-watt Bose audio system for
$900.
</P>
<P>
   Standard safety features in the Maxima are fairly complete, but
side-impact airbags are optional. For this level of automobile,
they should be standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima is not an inexpensive car, with the low-end GXE
starting at around $23,000, but it is a solid, even somewhat
luxurious machine that is well-equipped and seems
well-screwed-together.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar-value compares somewhere in the middle with the wide
range of V-6-powered midsize cars, although Maxima's sporty driving
attitude is a definite bonus. &QL;

CHINA WARNS OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story replaces CLINTON-DEFENSE) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese government officials have warned the
Clinton administration that Beijing may be compelled to take
military action against Taiwan to ``punish'' Taiwan for what
Beijing sees as moves toward independence, administration officials
and China experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Washington has warned the Beijing officials that
action by the Chinese against Taiwan would bring retaliation by the
United States, officials said. In the last week, the administration
has also publicly and privately urged the two sides to resolve the
situation between themselves. The message from the Chinese has not
come from the very top of the government but from Chinese officials
in meetings with administration officials. It was not clear,
administration officials said, whether a firm decision had been
made by Beijing what precise action would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   If military action was taken it could range, they said, from
striking at Taiwan to seizing an unpopulated island belonging to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Military action against Taiwan itself appeared to be the most
unlikely course for Beijing, several administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But an administration official said the military situation in
the Taiwan Strait was ``dangerous'' and ``very delicate.'' For more
than a week military aircraft from China and Taiwan have been
flying close to each other over the 100-mile-wide waterway, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are very real for inadvertent things or something
more ominous,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was preparing for ``contingencies'' in the
Taiwan Strait, another official said. But he declined to elaborate
what those preparations were.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the United States came to the closest to a military
confrontation with China since the Eisenhower era after the Chinese
fired a ballistic missile toward Taiwan and the Clinton
administration moved two aircraft carriers into the area of the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the government in Beijing, whose top officials have
just returned from an annual conference, appeared to be divided on
how to respond to the statements by Taiwan in the last month. ``The
hardliners want to be tough, others are saying let's wait,'' an
administration official said. He added that overall, China appeared
to be ``waiting to see if Taiwan could be put back into the box.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge d'affair at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu
Xiao-Min, was summoned to the office of assistant secretary of
state for East Asia, Stanley Roth, last week.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony the following day before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Roth said that the Chinese and the Taiwanese
had been given six demarches by the United States urging them to
restrain their military activities in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government may also be sending their warnings about
taking military action to test the United States, several China
experts said. The government has used the South China Morning Post,
a Hong Kong newspaper, to float stories about pending action.
Thursday's edition of the paper said that 500,000 troops of the
People's Liberation Army were being mobilized in a southern
province.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials have said in the last several days that
they have seen no sign of such massive mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to take a smaller island belonging to Taiwan would not
need such a large mobilization, however.

A LOOK BACK AT A SWIM TO GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer of 1969 was a memorable summer, a bittersweet time of
joy, tragedy and historic breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a summer when Neil Armstrong took a few small steps for
humankind on the moon, but it also was a summer when a
Massachusetts senator named Ted Kennedy ruined his presidential
hopes forever by driving his car into a river in Chappaquiddick
Island in an accident that resulted in a passenger, Mary Joe
Kopechne, drowning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a summer when an unpopular war raged in Southeast Asia,
but it also was a summer when the unsuspecting New York Mets were
writing a storybook script that climaxed with a World Series
triumph over the mighty Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   It was a summer when a bunch of foul-smelling, pot-smoking,
hedonist-purveying youngsters gathered at Woodstock for a music
marathon, but it also was a summer when a spartan-living,
diligent-training 16-year-old Long Beach girl named Susie Atwood
was establishing her niche in the swimming orbit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was 30 years ago Saturday that Atwood established a
world record in the 200 meter backstroke with a 2:21.5 clocking at
the U.S. Swimming Nationals in Louisville, a mark that lasted three
years.
</P>
<P>
   She would go on to set two more world records and 20 national
records during her extraordinary career in which, at 15, she was
the youngest American participant at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico
City and in which she won a silver medal at the 1972 Olympics in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to become a successful swimming coach at Ohio State,
and was inducted into the United States Swimming Hall of Fame in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   She did promotional work for a time for a swim wear company, but
she got tired of the traveling and returned to her hometown to open
a State Farm agency which she now operates in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   She no longer swims, and has channeled her considerable energies
into her work and into social activities, and she and her
boyfriend, Dave Butler, a former Secret Service agent who did
security chores for presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, are
familiar figures at local civic events and charity banquets.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Atwood is an attractive, pleasant, down-to-earth woman
liked by everyone who knows her, and it is a reflection of her
personality that she never brings up her past achievements unless
asked about them.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a lady on the planet who could beat her in the
backstroke 30 years ago, one of many compelling reasons for Susie
Atwood being considered the greatest female swimmer in Long Beach
history. ...
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone says he won't tolerate the obscenity-laced outburst
spewed by Raul Mondesi the other day, but he better not be too rash
and hold a fire-sale with Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have an unsavory recent history of getting rid of
players they're mad at without getting equal value in return or
have you forgotten the unforgivable folly they committed with Mike
Piazza?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line with Raul Mondesi is that he's a talented player
with ample skills, and shouldn't be discarded hastily just because
of an infantile eruption.
</P>
<P>
   The guy might cuss too much, and his behavior off the field has
been questioned. But unless Malone is able to secure a package from
another team commensurate to Mondesi, the beleaguered Dodger GM
should forgot Mondesi's tantrum and keep the moody outfielder on
his roster. ...
</P>
<P>
   .What's the big deal about a Dodger employee using salty
language? No one could cuss up a blue streak better than Tom
Lasorda, so help me Dave Kingman. ...
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the Dodgers have been this summer, where would they be
without Eric Karros, who they were implausibly trying to trade?.
...
</P>
<P>
   Oh, please, Scott Pippen, shut your mouth! You're scheduled to
earn $14 million from the Houston Rockets this season, and I doubt
Jerry Buss is anxious to pay you that much for the Lakers. ...
</P>
<P>
   Honest John Beyrooty, now fomenting flack for the millionaire PR
mogul, Steve Brener, says of this weekend's historic BattleBots
event at the Pyramid, ``Let's get ready to kick some serious
robot!''. ...
</P>
<P>
   Will someone please explain to me how Tony LaRussa keeps his job
with the St. Louis Cardinals? My memory isn't good enough to recall
the last time LaRussa had a winning season. ...
</P>
<P>
   The boxing guru/actor/radio personality/author/lothario Johnny
(The Downey Flash) Ortiz will be a guest Saturday night on the
sports talk show of Fred Wallin and Peter Vent on KRLA (1110 AM).
...
</P>
<P>
   The great promoter, Bob Arum, says there have been many
memorable welterweight showdowns across the decades Rocky
Graziano-Tony Zale, Carmen Basilio-Tony DeMarco, Emile
Griffith-Luis Rodriguez, Sugar Ray Leonard-Robert Duran,
Leonard-Thomas Hearns, etc. but none ever was staged in which the
participants were both undefeated like Oscar De La Hoya and Felix
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought that both Leonard and Hearns were
unbeaten when they met each other the first time in September of
1981,'' says Arum, who's staging the De La Hoya-Trinidad match on
Sept. 18 at Mandalay Bay. ``But Leonard had been beaten the
previous year in Montreal by Roberto Duran. What you have in De La
Hoya and Trinidad are two undefeated fighters meeting each other at
the peak of their skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is an unusual phenomenon for a sport in which in recent
years so many fighters like Prince Naseem stay cautiously away from
meeting opponents of similar abilities. ...
</P>
<P>
   Top Rank publicist Bill (Bozo) Caplan reports that Oscar De La
Hoya weighs a mere 149 pounds these days as he trains furiously at
his Big Bear camp. Trinidad is doing the same at a sanctuary near
San Juan, P.R., and he reportedly is already down to the 147-pound
limit. ...
</P>
<P>
   If WBF junior middleweight champion David Reid is able to get
past Keith Mullings on August 28 at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las
Vegas no cinch there is speculation that he will then meet the IBF
champion, Fernando Vargas, in a unification match.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum thinks that would be a mistake because it would deprive
at least one of the men if not both of a possible lucrative fight
against De La Hoya, providing De La Hoya is able to get past
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``De La Hoya and Reid would be an easy sell because both won
Olympic gold medals for America,'' says Arum. ``And De La Hoya and
Vargas, forget about it! It would be off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But De La Hoya says he never would fight Vargas,'' I reminded
Arum.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to learn that in boxing one never says never,''
remarked Arum, sly as ever. ...
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations to Bill Husak, who's just become the new
president of the Century Club and who also is the father of
Stanford's starting quarterback, Todd Husak. ...
</P>
<P>
   I keep thinking the Angels can't get worse and they keep proving
me wrong. ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't envision the NFL ever sticking an expansion franchise
into the Coliseum, but, remember, I never envisioned Al Davis
departing L.A., either. ...
</P>
<P>
   I get tired of celebrating birthdays, but I suspect it beats the
alternative.

LEITER AND METS RIDE A WAVE TO TIE FOR FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Leiter was like a surfer atop his board Thursday. With each
move, he was teetering between narrowly escaping and taking a
head-first tumble. In the sun and haze of a humid afternoon, he was
struggling to find the right groove between a slider that wasn't
moving enough at first to fool hitters and a curve that could put
him ahead in the count.
</P>
<P>
   He walked four in the first four innings, which helped
contribute to a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, as the Mets'
high-powered offense was spotting him to a 6-0 lead after three.
But he did not walk another batter in the fifth, sixth or seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up no hits until the fifth _ Leiter admitted he had
already been thinking about a no-hitter because catcher Todd Pratt
mentioned it to him _ but then almost took a tumble by yielding
three quick runs. He regained his footing again, though, even
padding the 6-3 lead with a fifth-inning double that drove in three
more runs. He had found his balance, much as his team has done in
its brilliant post-All-Star game run, and the Mets rode to a 9-3
victory over the Padres and a tie with the idle Braves atop the
National League East.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who allowed three runs on four hits while walking four
and striking out four in seven innings, has become emblematic of
the Mets. He and the Mets survived a head-scratching start only to
emerge _ after three of manager Bobby Valentine's coaches were
fired after the first 55 games _ as the competitors they were
expected to be. Their mutual turnaround began the day after the
staff bloodletting, when Leiter beat the Yankees at Yankee Stadium.
Since that night, he is 8-2 with a 3.00 earned run average in 13
starts, and 10-7 with a 4.38 ERA overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my season since that Sunday night,'' Leiter said
Thursday, referring to the Yankee game. ``That was the night Bobby
said, `Judge me by our next 55 games.' Last year we missed the
playoffs by one game and this team is a lot better than one game
better than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are not; they are a decimated version of the team
that was swept by the Yankees in last year's World Series, and
Thursday they were without Tony Gwynn, who was rested because of a
sore knee. But the Mets' three-game sweep, regardless of the
quality of the competition, has quieted the shivers of panic that
passed through Shea Stadium after three straight losses to the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' record since the All-Star game is 20-7. Heading into a
six-game West Coast swing against the Giants and Padres that begins
tonight _ the first of four road trips in the last seven weeks of
the season _ the Mets have won 16 of their last 21. They continue
to count on a powerful offense to create breathing room until the
pitching settles in.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, with Rickey Henderson and Mike Piazza given a day off
after Wednesday's rain-delayed marathon, the first six Mets in the
shuffled lineup were still batting over .300. And they were willing
to improvise. Roger Cedeno had a bunt single to lead off the first
inning and eventually scored on a grounder. Darryl Hamilton, who
has five multihit games in his first nine starts as a Met since
coming over from the Rockies, slugged a homer to make the score
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows this is a good baseball team,'' Hamilton said, ``if
you've got a guy on second base, no out and you find a way to get
him over. Those are the things that make a season. In Colorado, it
was tough because they didn't do that. Here, I think they know the
game a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added three more runs in the third inning, including a
solo homer by Cedeno. It was only Cedeno's third home run this
season. By the time Leiter, with his off-kilter stance and ugly
swing, hit a fastball to left center to drive in three runs in the
fifth, the Mets were letting another wave of victories wash over
them. Leiter, who brought his season and career batting average to
.103 with the double, had helped his cause at the plate. And the
Mets continue, even unconventionally, to help themselves in the
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that gets into a team is for it to think it's
got it all figured out,'' Valentine said. ``They think, `This is
the only way we can score,' and when that isn't working, the game
is over before it's over. This way, we can play the entire nine
innings, waiting for something good to happen.''

MAP PUTS US ON SPACE NEE DLE AND PINS IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE - The streets were getting darker, and it wasn't my
imagination. &QL; 
I suddenly realized how quickly situations can change.
</P>
<P>
   A mere eight minutes before, we had been jolly, happy tourists
in Seattle, heading back to our hotel after eating dinner with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we were lost at 11:07 p.m. in a strange city, and I was
angry. Don't get me wrong. I love Seattle. It's a beautiful place,
though I can't help but feel suspicious of a city that can't be
troubled to mark the exits of their freeways. They just pop up.
There are no signs, no warning, and, what's even worse, the exit
can be on either side of you, right or left. You never know.
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely where we as navigators _ armed with three maps
and directions delivered by our aforementioned friends _ messed up
as firm believers in logic.
</P>
<P>
   It happened like this: We passed the Space Needle, and then, two
seconds later, we were in a deserted railroad yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What . . .,'' I said to my husband, who was commanding the
wheel as I looked around at our blackened, barely lighted
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How . . . when . . . ``where'' are we? Did I miss something?
Weren't we just on the freeway?! Where is the freeway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check the map,'' my husband said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did we end up here?'' I questioned, searching the distance
for the lights of downtown. ``Do you think we just experienced . .
. missing time?''
</P>
<P>
   ```Honey, just check the map,'' my husband repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The map won't help us,'' I announced. ``We've been abducted.
That is the only logical explanation. Freeways don't just END. What
if I've been implanted with alien embryos? It's a good tax
deduction, but ``still.'' Are you OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just check the MAP!'' he said sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK if they messed with your butt, honey,'' I said as
gently as I could. ``I think I can love you anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait!'' he said, pointing off to the distance. ``Is that the
Space Needle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive toward it!'' I yelled, as my husband took a right turn,
which suddenly, and without explanation, took us right back onto
the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath and sank back into the seat of the rental
car. We were about to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid,'' my husband said boldly. ``Let them try to
catch me. I am The Bandit!''
</P>
<P>
   ``As in ``Smokey and .'' . .?'' I asked, to which he nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you say, Mr. Magoo,'' I replied, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   We continued on the freeway with the Space Needle fully in view
and were getting closer to it, closer, closer, closer, almost
there, when suddenly, the freeway dipped and turned and our view
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Space Needle had evaporated precisely at 11:18 p.m. without
so much as a hint.
</P>
<P>
   And, with just as much warning, we suddenly learned that we were
a couple of tourists discovering the sights and pleasures of the
seedier side of Seattle which made the railroad yard look like a
Comfort Inn.
</P>
<P>
   As we rolled down the streets in our rented car, my mouth fell
open as I stared out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks just like the opening scenes from ``Welcome Back,
Kotter'','' I said quietly, as we passed a burned-out car sitting
in a vacant lot. ``And I can tell you right now that there's no
place on that map that's marked `The Big Dirty Ghetto.' ''
</P>
<P>
   We were targets, I knew that. I knew that because we were
driving the bull's eye. At the rental car counter, I jumped at the
chance to get a sport utility vehicle over a Dodge Neon for an
extra five bucks a day. That was my decision, a genius idea from
Miss Fancy Pants. And now, driving in the middle of Shantytown,
people grouped on corners were looking at us as if it was gonna
cost us a whole lot more.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit it. I was scared. Really, really scared. Of all the
stupid ways to die, I thought to myself, by getting lost in a
brand-new Isuzu Rodeo that's costing me $40.95 a day, plus 18
percent tourist tax to finance Seattle's new sports stadium that
has already killed more construction workers than the Bank One
Ballpark did.
</P>
<P>
   I can't even be murdered for something that I own. I'm going to
die as a yuppie poseur, an affluent wannabe, and that's almost
worse than dying naked. There is simply no dignity in dying for a
rental car, and there aren't very many more ways to die that are
dumber. I mean ``really''.``''
</P>
<P>
   I once knew a guy who killed a bicyclist by stopping too short
at an intersection and whacking the bike rider on the back of the
head with the passenger-side mirror. Talk about senseless. I always
figured that's the way I would go, in a moronic freak accident in
which my husband drops his electric razor on the floor, it comes in
contact with my pinkie toe that happens to be in a dime-sized
puddle of water and my fat immediately liquefies and fries me like
a pork rind.
</P>
<P>
   At least I won't die alone, I guess there's some solace in that.
Mr. Magoo will be with me. I always prayed that I wouldn't die
alone at home, not because that's sad, but because our maniacal
puppy is the kind of dog who wouldn't wait until I exhaled my last
breath before she took the first chunk out of my calf, and there
I'd be, eaten alive by a dog that barks at her own doody.
</P>
<P>
   For five dollars less a day, we'd be fine right now. No one
would be pointing at us, staring at us or yelling at us. You'd feel
too sorry for someone who drove a Neon to kill them. And, if we die
here, at least I've beat the predictions of my mother, who swore
that I'd perish while vigorously picking my nose and subsequently
puncturing my brain with something sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always kind of liked being Mrs. Magoo,'' I confided to my
husband, figuring that in our final moments, I should come clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what you don't realize about The Bandit and Mr. Magoo,''
he replied, keeping his eyes on the road, ``is that, in the end,
they both always come out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded patronizingly, but just as I looked up, as we sped
forward and the valley of old, tall buildings began to open, I saw
the unmistakable red neon light of our hotel right in front of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' I said in amazement. ``That was pretty smooth, even for
The Bandit.'' &QL;

EXPERT CONVICTED IN SCHEME TO SELL TIFFANY GLASS STOLEN FROM TOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An erudite expert on Tiffany stained glass was
convicted Thursday of conspiring with a Queens grave robber and a
Bronx antique dealer to pilfer rare stained-glass windows from
cemetery mausoleums and resell them overseas at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   Alastair Duncan, 57, who is considered one of the world's
leading experts on Tiffany stained glass, stood visibly stunned
Thursday afternoon after a jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
pronounced him guilty of participating in a macabre scheme that at
first dented, and has now destroyed, his once sterling reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, a former consultant to Christie's auction house who now
trades in the windows and other items from an office on Lexington
Avenue, has written numerous books and articles on Tiffany stained
glass. He has also worked as an adviser to the FBI to prevent such
thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Now facing up to 35 years in prison, Duncan was released on bail
and declined to speak with reporters Thursday. He is to be
sentenced by Judge Thomas Griesa on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrated the growing problem of thefts of expensive
artworks used to decorate mausoleums. Rare Tiffany stained-glass
windows, which were primarily installed in churches and cemeteries,
have been particularly coveted by criminals since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the case was a 9-foot-tall Tiffany window
stolen from the Salem Fields cemetery on the border of Brooklyn and
Queens in 1992 or 1993 by Anthony Casamassina, an admitted career
grave thief. Casamassina said that in 1998 he offered to sell the
window to the Bronx antique dealer, Lawrence Zinzi, who contacted
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   After Duncan verified the window's quality, he and Zinzi bought
it for $60,000 from the grave robber, federal prosecutors said. The
two men then sold it to a buyer in Japan for $219,980 and split the
profits, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan then told Casamassina to canvass cemeteries for another
window for a foreign buyer, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his nine-day trial, Duncan maintained that he was not
aware that the windows he bought or examined were stolen. But FBI
agents had Casamassina and Zinzi secretly tape-record conversations
with Duncan that included discussions about stolen windows.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he was ``bitterly
disappointed'' with the verdict and vowed to appeal. Brafman
accused Casamassina and Zinzi of duping his client into buying the
stolen windows and then blaming Duncan after their arrests to
receive leniency from prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duncan was in my judgment the victim of several highly skilled
career criminals who were able to manipulate several conversations
that on their face appeared to incriminate him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Casamassina and Zinzi have pleaded guilty in the case, but
neither has been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Casamassina, 40, a high school dropout who lives with his
father, regaled jurors with tales of a 15-year nocturnal career of
robbing cemeteries in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Westchester
and on Long Island. He admitted stealing mausoleum windows, statues
and even cremation urns still filled with ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Zinzi, the antiques dealer, testified that he repeatedly told
Duncan that the windows involved in the scheme were stolen, and
prosecutors played the secret recordings to support his account.
</P>
<P>
   Along with convictions for transporting stolen property,
conspiracy and making an illegal bank transaction, Duncan was also
convicted of witness tampering for urging Zinzi to deny that they
knew the windows were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   After the scheme involving the window shipped to Japan,
Casamassina scoured graveyards in the New York area for another
stained-glass window suitable for a foreign buyer. Casamassina
testified that he took pictures of a window in the Kensico Cemetery
in Valhalla, N.Y., in Westchester County, but Duncan complained
that the window was too small and needed to depict more trees.
</P>
<P>
   After both Zinzi and Casamassina were arrested by the FBI this
spring, they began to secretly record their conversations with
Duncan. The tapes include one conversation in which Duncan seems to
be admitting that he knew the window from the Salem Fields cemetery
was stolen, and another discussion in which he apparently
encourages Zinzi to say Casamassina lied to them about the window's
true origin.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were by far the most powerful evidence against Duncan,
but an assistant U.S. attorney, Stephanos Bibas, also argued that
phone and bank records supported the two men's account.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Brafman portrayed Duncan as a naive expert
badgered and tricked into saying things that were not true by two
seasoned criminals. He accused FBI agents, who never told Duncan he
was under investigation, of encouraging Zinzi and Casamassina to
entrap the high-profile expert as a way to receive more lenient
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Brafman predicted that Duncan would win on appeal, but conceded
that his reputation was already in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating,'' Brafman said. ``We will continue to fight
to clear Alastair's name and the reputation he spent a lifetime
building.''

RYDER CUP RUMBLINGS STIR UP THE PGA FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ A heated debate continued Thursday regarding the
Ryder Cup next month and how revenue should be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, players left the 18th green of the PGA Championship
Thursday voicing strong opinions. Many supported Ben Crenshaw, this
year's U.S. captain.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw has been angered by comments from several players who
have been campaigning to have significant money from the Ryder Cup
allocated to the charities of their choice. Those players include
David Duval, Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson; they are
four of the 16 players who attended a meeting Tuesday with Jim
Awtrey, chief executive of the PGA of America; Tim Finchem,
commissioner of the PGA Tour, and Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference on Wednesday, Crenshaw admitted that
he was disappointed with some players. Meanwhile, other players
believe that the continued discussion leading up to the Ryder Cup
at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., Sept. 24-26, will only
hurt golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be ashamed of ourselves, bringing this up now,''
said Tom Lehman, currently 11th in the Ryder Cup points standing,
who hopes to make his third Ryder Cup team with a strong showing
this weekend. ``This could have been handled quietly, behind closed
doors, a long time ago, and it wasn't. The last thing the tour
needs is a label put on it like greedy, wimpy, whiny brats.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon, who has played on two Ryder Cup teams, suggested
that Duval should not be so outspoken, considering he has yet to
play in the biennial event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rips me apart, and I know it rips Ben apart,'' Faxon said.
``Out here every week, we're handed a car, a place to stay, free
equipment. The minute you think you're worth the money you're
getting, you're in trouble out here. It's a shame, when you've got
other people teaching our kids making $20,000 a year. It's terrible
for the perception of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods and other players who share his viewpoint have
insisted that any money directed to them from the Ryder Cup will go
directly to charity. Woods believes that is a noble cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Presidents Cup, we get $50,000 to be able to donate to
charity,'' Woods said. ``Well, the Presidents Cup is not on the
same level, financially, as the Ryder Cup. The Ryder Cup is an
enormous money-maker. I think it is our right to be given funds to
help our community. I work with a target house in Memphis for some
cancer kids I want to donate money to, and a few other things back
in Southern California. It's not about being paid. It's about being
able to allocate funds.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Faxon respond to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enough money to give to charity,'' Faxon said. ``He
wants it in his pocket. I talked to Davis Love 3d yesterday. He was
in the meeting; I wasn't. Davis is the guy I respect out here more
than any other player, because he stands by his word. He got up and
said: `Let's get this out on the table. This isn't about money
going to charity.' It's not. And I think a lot of people would tell
you that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get really upset thinking about it. There are too many guys
who want to play on the Ryder Cup team to have a handful of guys
who think they don't need the Ryder Cup. I know Tiger has been a
huge part of our success and our contracts, and there's nobody in
the game who has had a bigger impact than he has. But golf will go
on, and the Ryder Cup's not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Crenshaw was not as angry after his round Thursday, he
did not back away from his statements. Meanwhile, Crenshaw was left
with six weeks to restore team unity before the United States faces
Europe, which has won the last two Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we have to work out,'' Crenshaw said. ``They
know I'm from a different generation, and I'm trying to understand
their side, too. But we've got to be focused as a team. I want our
players to be unified. To be real honest, I haven't seen it in the
last four team events, including Presidents Cups and Ryder Cups.
We'll continue to talk. We must get focused as a team.''

 JOHN D. LEWIS, 84, WAR PILOT   WHO ACHIEVED `THE GREAT ESCAPE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Dortch Lewis, whose exploits as a prisoner of war in
Germany provided the basis for the character played by Steve
McQueen in the 1963 film ``The Great Escape,'' died of pancreatic
cancer Sunday at his home in Goldsboro, N.C. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Price, a friend and the former editor of The Goldsboro
News-Argus, described Lewis, a partner in an insurance agency, as a
reclusive man who kept his wartime memories largely to himself. But
several years ago Price prevailed on him to attend a showing of the
film and answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, directed by John Sturges, Lewis was transposed into
an American flyer named Hilts, who singlemindedly keeps trying to
escape from Stalag Luft No. 3, where the Germans held 600 Allied
prisoners. Many spent a year secretly building three escape tunnels
they called Tom, Dick and Harry.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Lewis crawled, climbed and conned his way out of
the camp three times, only to be caught, returned and punished. He
was successful on his fourth try.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night they showed the movie,'' Price recalled, ``John said
they had Hollywooded his character a bit: he never rode a
motorcycle out of the camp and he never had a baseball glove in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis was asked what led him to keep trying to escape
despite punishment, he answered, ``I just wanted to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Price asked him what role fear had played in his
actions, his friend replied: ``None at all. I knew from the start
that it would be a long war and that I probably wouldn't come out
of it alive, so I just wanted to run up the best score that I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his son, John Lewis Jr., Lewis started thinking of
escape even before he was brought to Stalag Luft No. 3, in Polish
Silesia.
</P>
<P>
   His P-39 Bell Air Cobra had been shot down over North Africa and
for several weeks Lewis avoided capture in the desert by darkening
his skin with clay and wearing Arab dress. When he was caught and
taken to the camp in 1943, he began scavenging items that might aid
him in escaping, first using some items to make moonshine liquor.
</P>
<P>
   As represented in the book from which the film was adapted, also
called ``The Great Escape,'' most of the airmen were also
preoccupied with escape. The author, Paul Brickhill of Australia,
wrote from his experiences as a captured pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Brickhill, who knew Lewis, described how the prisoners planned
and built not only escape tunnels but also dummy passages intended
to befuddle the Nazis. For their part, the Germans had a unit
called ferrets who constantly kept probing for underground
passages.
</P>
<P>
   After one of Lewis' escapes, he was brought back to face the
German commandant, who asked him to give his word that he would not
try to escape again. If he promised that, the commandant said,
after the war he would make Lewis the police commissioner of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis replied that he could not give such assurances and that,
in any case, he was planning on becoming the mayor of Berlin. He
was sent to the isolation cells and put on a diet of bread and
water.
</P>
<P>
   On his final _ successful _ escape, Lewis, an accomplished
hunter and outdoorsman, bolted from a train carrying prisoners and
made his way across much of Europe to the advancing Allied lines.
This occurred during the last stages of the war, not long after the
night when 76 British airmen escaped through the tunnel called
Harry, the incident that is the central theme of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 76 airmen who emerged on the other side of the barbed
wire, only three made it safely to Britain. Within a few days, 50
were captured after an extensive Nazi manhunt and were shot to
death on the orders of the high command. The rest were caught and
returned to prison camps.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a graduate of the University of North Carolina, had gone
off to fight in World war II more than a year before the United
States entered the conflict. He told his friend, Price, that he
felt strongly that ``Hitler had to be stopped,'' and enlisted in
the Royal Canadian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   In the desperate months after France fell, he flew
canvas-covered Hawker Hurricane fighters across the British
Channel, and he flew in the raid on Dieppe in August of 1942, where
Canadian forces suffered great casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, on a mission over France, his plane was disabled by
enemy fire. He managed to bring it back over the English Channel,
where he crash-landed in the countryside. His Canadian superiors
ordered him to stop flying because of his injuries but, eager for
more adventure, he transferred to the U.S. Air Corps.

<P>
   In addition to his son, Lewis is survived by his wife, Carolyn
Stenhouse Lewis; two daughters, Millie Rostan, of Pinehurst, N.C.,
and Caroline Miles, of Pittsboro, N.C.; two sisters, Ellen O'Berry
and Elizabeth Lewis, of Southern Pines, N.C., and nine
grandchildren.

A RYDER SOLUTION: NO WIN, NO MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be unseemly, of course, to beg forbearance for this
subject of millionaires fighting over still more millions.
</P>
<P>
   But because this is golf, the self-professed ``gentleman's
game,'' and because this is the PGA of America, whose greedy rump
is squirming on the hot seat, we'll make an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Go get 'em, Tiger. Make them pay.
</P>
<P>
   The flap over the Ryder Cup and the price of waving the American
flag continued Thursday to be a spicy item at the PGA Championship
in Medinah, Ill. Ben Crenshaw, captain of the U.S. team, is steamed
that some players _ notably Tiger Woods, David Duval and Mark
O'Meara _ have asked for a share of the PGA pie in exchange for
their participation.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Ben talk, what Woods and Duval are thinking is
anti-golf, anti-Hogan and, above all, anti-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick of issues like this in the sports world,''
Crenshaw said, when his temperature had cooled to a respectable
three digits. ``When you can't just show up and play for your
country, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not reward enough, then my heart bleeds for the game
of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, please get Ben a tourniquet. It's going to get
bloodier before it gets any better.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's reaction is not surprising. He is one of the most
genuine sportsmen who ever graced the planet. He would be an
excellent choice, were the U.S. Ryder Cup suits ever to name a
permanent captain.
</P>
<P>
   In his somewhat toned-down remarks Thursday, Crenshaw conceded
that he comes from another generation. The pre-Nike generation,
perhaps. The golfers who read golfing history books, not the stock
market quotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from a different generation, where the Ryder Cup means a
lot to us,'' Ben said. ``I'm upset that people aren't jumping over
the moon about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw is right. But so are Duval and Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf Digest'' speculated last week that the 1999 Ryder Cup
should net a profit of $63 million. The organizing arm of the Ryder
Cup event, PGA of America, gets a clear $23 million of that.
</P>
<P>
   The days are gone, in other words _ shanked far off the fairway
_ when the Ryder Cup was a rah-rah novelty for touring pros,
relegated to the back pages of sports sections in the middle of
football season. The PGA once had to beg the USA Network to put the
event on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But as we learned here in Fort Worth last fall, the Ryder Cup
has become too rich for its pastel britches. Colonial Country Club
spent $250,000 trying to woo the PGA into awarding it the 2003
Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the PGA awarded packages of future Ryder Cups and PGA
Championships to Valhalla in Louisville, Ky., Oakland Hills, Mich.,
and Medinah, Ill., where this week's tournament is being played.
The reasons, as announced at the time by PGA chief Jim Awtrey, were
not sentimental. The Fort Worth bid had included a videotaped pitch
by the soon-to-be-late Ben Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   No, the reasons were largely financial. The new Ryder Cup
courses could fit more corporate tents and had the stately lawns
for the PGA's burgeoning image. The figure being bandied about last
October was $40 million to $60 million, straight to the PGA. At the
time, the PGA itself owned 54 percent of Valhalla; it now owns it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Awtrey talked last year about a financial impact to the Ryder
Cup host of ``50 to 70 million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he's surprised that Duval and Woods want more than their
$5,000 in travel money?
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, where flag and country stand above wallet
and Mercedes payment, a true sportsman would be proud just to play
golf for the U.S. of A. But I thought that thinking got buried with
Avery Brundage. Even Olympians, most of them, get paid nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   To me, it seems far more immoral for the PGA to horde its $23
million in profits than for the Ryder Cup golfers to expect a small
share. Awtrey talked Wednesday about the $12.5 million that goes
from the profits to the Ryder Cup Outreach Program.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers still don't add up. If the Ryder Cup is generating
$63 million in net profit, asking for remuneration is nothing more
than the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's bad manners, of course, for the rich to ask to get
richer. The request seems even more awkward in the light of our
lads having won only two of the previous seven Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I propose the quintessential American solution.
</P>
<P>
   Give them what they want, and then some. Each Ryder Cup golfer
should receive $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Provided his team wins. Losers get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Play ball, gentlemen. nn

RYDER CUP REACTION RUNNETH OVER AT PGA
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ One day after scolding the highest-profile
members of his Ryder Cup team for selfish attitudes, U.S. captain
Ben Crenshaw began the process of rebuilding team unity among the
12-member squad that will compete Sept. 24-26 in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw termed it a ``mistake'' for him to lash out at players
who have been proponents of receiving paychecks, or at least an
increased say in directing the event's charitable donations, in
exchange for their Ryder Cup participation. But he also made it
clear Thursday at the site of the PGA Championship that he expects
players to set aside the compensation issue and not let it divide
the U.S. team, which seeks to recapture the Ryder Cup for the first
time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While Crenshaw was making his point, Sergio Garcia made his
statement by taking the first-round lead with a record-tying
6-under-par 66 on a rain-soaked Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Spanish sensation, the youngest player in the
PGA Championship since Gene Sarazen in 1921, played as though he
had something to prove after rounds of 89-83 for the worst score in
the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I proved myself today,'' Garcia said. ``I think the
British Open is done. I don't want to hear any more questions about
the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Crenshaw didn't want to hear any more questions
about the Ryder Cup
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want at this point, and I'm sure that I'm going to get
it, is 12 committed players going to Boston,'' Crenshaw said.
``It's as simple as that. We've got to be focused as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I haven't seen that in the last four team events
(1995 and 1997 Ryder Cups, 1996 and 1998 President's Cups). I've
lived with it for two years now, and I'm a little stressed out
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said his frustration led him to express disappointment
in the attitudes of Tiger Woods and David Duval, the world's two
top-ranked players, as well as Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson.
Crenshaw confirmed that those four players were the subject of
Wednesday's criticism, when he said it ``burns the hell out of me
to listen to their viewpoints'' about players deserving something
more than a $5,000 travel stipend to represent the U.S. at the
Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated (Wednesday). My mistake. And if that became
personal, that's it,'' said Crenshaw, who fielded a call from an
angry Duval on Wednesday night after Duval saw a tape of Crenshaw's
news conference from the PGA Championship. Duval confirmed making
the call, but declined to elaborate on what was said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference of opinion there,'' said Duval, who
stressed that he is not interested in being paid to play in the
Ryder Cup, but would like a say in directing charitable
contributions made by the PGA of America, which is expected to reap
a $23 million profit from the event. ``Does that mean I need to
change my opinion or he needs to change his? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson said he was ``sorry Ben chose to use the media as a
forum'' to air his grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the things we said were confidential,'' Mickelson
said. ``I'm disappointed something leaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, Ryder Cup members interviewed Thursday predicted the
compensation issue would not divide the team. But Woods, the most
vocal proponent of increased player input in distributing Ryder Cup
proceeds, said he understood Crenshaw's concerns and was not
bothered by Wednesday's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he meant them maliciously,'' Woods said. ``He's
a concerned captain. If I was the captain, I'd be concerned, too.
I'd be concerned that we weren't focused on going back to Brookline
to win back the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, Woods and O'Meara pointed to a situation similar to the
1998 President's Cup, where players were allowed to direct $100,000
in contributions to local charities of their choosing. As a
satisfactory solution to appease players. Jim Awtrey, chief
executive officer of the PGA of America, said his organization is
studying options to give the players greater input, but is unsure
if a change in policy could be implemented by the 1999 Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see in the next few weeks what we can do, and how
soon,'' Awtrey said. nn

NO SIGNS OF HATE GROUPS IN NEW YORK, MAYOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (dal) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to allay concerns prompted by the shootings
at a Jewish community center in Los Angles, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and his police commissioner, Howard Safir, said Thursday that the
Police Department had no evidence of any organized hate groups
operating in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The officials did say, however, that the city was increasing
security in some Jewish neighborhoods, at synagogues, yeshivas and
other gathering places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no indication that there are any organized neo-Nazi
groups operating in the area, in New York City,'' Safir said at a
news conference in Brooklyn. Later in the day, the commissioner and
the mayor repeated that assertion at a City Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But it was disputed by numerous organizations that track
neo-Nazi and hate groups as well as some federal law-enforcement
officials. They said a number of hate groups had presences in New
York, including the Knights of Freedom, a white supremacy group
that has chapters across the country, and the World Church of the
Creator. Members of the World Church were linked this year to arson
at three California synagogues and shooting attacks in July in
which two people were killed in Illinois and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well known that there are hate groups and small neo-Nazi
cells operating in New York City,'' said Chip Berlet, the president
of Political Research Associates, a company based in Somerville,
Mass., that tracks extremist groups. ``They may not be as visible
or large, but it does not mean they are not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, the deputy police commissioner for public
information, said isolated supremacy-oriented hate groups or
isolated individuals with those views could be operating in the
city. But, she added, ``there is no evidence that we are aware of,
or that the FBI is aware of, of one of these supremacy-type groups
operating in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, called for a
city-financed center that would track hate crimes and the people
who commit them.
</P>
<P>
   Berlet said hate groups might be less visible in New York City
and on Long Island, partly because of the diversity in the
metropolitan area as well as a reluctance to admit publicly to
racist views.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sedarbaum, the associate director of the Anti-Defamation
League's regional office in New York City, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let ourselves be reassured just because we don't see
large armies in New York City,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sedarbaum said that last year, fliers were distributed by the
World Church of the Creator in Greenwich Village and by the Ku Klux
Klan in Brooklyn. In the last three years, he said, fliers from the
National Alliance, another white supremacist organization, were
found in all five of the city's boroughs, and the group also hung a
white supremacist banner on a Staten Island overpass last year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks
hate groups, said that of the 13 extremist groups now operating in
New York state, six were operating in the five boroughs, up from
three in the city at this time last year. In New Jersey and
Connecticut, the law center said, there are 13 active extremist
groups, up from 11 in the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the center said, there is a cell from the
World Church of the Creator; a chapter of the Anglo-European
American Society, a white supremacist group; a chapter of the House
of David, a black separatist group; the National Association for
the Advancement of White People, which is based in Brooklyn, and
the Knights of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Although swastikas were discovered on buildings in Brooklyn and
Manhattan on Thursday, police said that bias crimes in general were
down 19 percent so far this year and that anti-Semitic bias crimes
were down 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Safir said senior police officials from the
intelligence division have met with officials from the FBI, and so
far, they have been unable to find any connections between the
suspected Los Angeles gunman, Buford O. Furrow Jr., and any
individuals in the city.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, the mayor and other lawmakers called on the state
Legislature to pass a hate crime bill that would prescribe harsher
penalties for bias-related offenses. The state Assembly, which is
controlled by Democrats, approved such a bill in January, but the
Republican-led Senate let the legislation die, as it has done every
year for the last decade.

EDITORIAL: WILLFUL IGNORANCE ON EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATT: Kan.) 
(af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Aug. 13: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deep sadness is the most sensible response to this week's
decision by the Kansas Board of Education to downgrade the teaching
of evolution in the state's public schools. Religious and cultural
conservatives on the board may have thought they were taking a bold
stand against a scientific theory they regard as a threat to
``creationist beliefs'' in the origins of the universe and all life
within it. But the real losers here will be the very schoolchildren
the board members thought they were protecting. If local school
boards follow the state board's lead, bright students who might be
inclined to pursue scientific careers may now reach college age
with little or no exposure to the fundamental organizing principle
of modern biology, and all students will be the poorer for lacking
scientific literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas school board did not explicitly ban the teaching of
evolution, but it did its best to discourage it. The board adopted
new statewide science standards _ the basis for statewide testing
of students _ that eliminate biological evolution as a way to
explain the emergence of one species from another. That action
makes it likely that many schools and teachers will spend less time
on evolution and more time on concepts that will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   That seems a tragedy, given that evolution has become one of the
best established of all scientific theories. The central concept of
biological evolution _ that all organisms have evolved from common
ancestors through a process of ``natural selection'' in which those
best able to reproduce themselves survived _ is even more firmly
supported today than in the time of Charles Darwin. The revolution
in modern genetics has only deepened our understanding of how
evolution works by providing a mechanism by which species can
change. Yes, there are still arguments and controversies. Critics
rightly note that scientists have not yet been able to explain how
natural selection could produce the enormously complex machinery
inside a human cell, for example. But that may be a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas action is a victory for creationists. Blocked by the
courts from forcing creation theory into science curriculums, they
are now working to drive references to evolution out of the schools
and textbooks. They will be repelled only when the advocates of
sound science mount an equally vigorous campaign to keep evolution
in the curriculum.

EDITORIAL: THE BRUCE BABBITT CASE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Aug. 13: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone may agree with the reported decision to clear
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in a case that grew out of the
1996 campaign finance abuses. But at least the conclusion that
there is insufficient evidence to indict Babbitt or Harold Ickes,
one of President Clinton's top campaign operatives, was made by an
impartial, independent prosecutor. Unfortunately, that was not so
for other abuses in Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. A serious
failure of this administration was the stubborn and misguided
refusal of Attorney General Janet Reno to allow any other
independent counsel to investigate the array of sordid campaign
practices, especially the donations from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has been an effective defender of the environment, and
if officially cleared of potential wrongdoing on this matter, he
should remain at work through the end of the Clinton presidency.
But his performance in an Indian casino deal that was at the core
of the independent counsel's investigation was suspicious and
merited a thorough inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the Interior Department's rejection of a casino
application by a group of impoverished Wisconsin Indian tribes, and
whether it was influenced by $350,000 in donations to the Democrats
from other tribes that opposed the casino. A lobbyist for the
casino project testified that Babbitt had told him of political
pressure from the White House to stop it. Babbitt testified that
the casino rejection was made on the merits and that he had
referred to pressure just to get the lobbyist out of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Reno appointed Carol Elder Bruce as independent
counsel to investigate. It has taken her only 17 months to reach a
conclusion. Her performance demonstrates that an independent
investigation of top federal officials can be conducted in a timely
and professional manner. It also shows that it was a mistake to let
the independent counsel statute expire, as it did earlier this
summer. Both Louis Freeh, the FBI director, and Charles La Bella,
former head of the campaign fund-raising inquiry, urged Reno to
appoint an independent counsel to oversee the investigation of
other aspects of the fund-raising mess.
</P>
<P>
   Because she rejected their advice, Americans can never be
confident that every lead was followed in examining Vice President
Gore's fund-raising phone calls from the White House and the
evidence of a conspiracy by Clinton and others to evade campaign
laws by using ``soft money'' to finance a Democratic Party
advertising campaign. Even worse is the broken trail of leads
regarding the foreign money funneled into the campaign by John
Huang, Charlie Trie and others who have admitted to violating the
law. They have apparently not implicated any senior people in the
White House or the campaign, and Rep. Dan Burton has failed so far
to get Huang and Trie to testify before his committee in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the timely investigation of Babbitt, Kenneth
Starr recently spoke of lumbering to the end of his five-year
inquiry into the finances of the president and the First Lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, possibly
issuing a final report during Mrs. Clinton's likely Senate campaign
in New York. Starr said on NBC's ``Today'' show that he would not
``trash'' anyone but simply lay out the facts. That is all the more
reason for him to move faster. &QL;

MARK BROOKS LIKES MEDINAH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Nine years later, Medinah Country Club still
brings out the best in the golf game of Mark Brooks, a resident of
Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who finished fifth at the 1990 U.S. Open played at
Medinah, turned in his best start since 1997 at a major
championship with a 2-under 70 in Thursday's opening round of the
PGA Championship. Brooks, 38, stands four shots behind leader
Sergio Garcia after birdies on three of his last four holes during
a daylong mist at Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's anything special about this place
other than it's a pretty traditional layout and that allows me to
hit driver quite a bit,'' said Brooks, who hit 11 drivers during
Thursday's round and split 12 of 14 fairways. ``I like this course.
I just hope the rain goes away and I can sink enough putts to keep
my momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks finished his round by draining consecutive birdie putts
from 4 and 14 feet on Nos. 17 and 18, respectively. He also buried
a 15-footer at No. 15. JOBE SEEKS CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   Brandt Jobe, a Southlake, Texas, resident who competes on the
Japanese Tour, fired an opening 69 that put him in a tie for fifth
place. If he can finish in that position Sunday, Jobe would be
close to reaching his primary goal for 1999: make enough money to
earn a PGA Tour card for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe ranks 193rd on the PGA Tour season money list, with
$70,000. To earn full-time playing privileges in the United States
in 2000, he needs to finish in the top 125. Toward that end, Jobe
will play in the next three PGA Tour events in hopes of adding to
his total _ all of which came from a 14th-place finish at the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like nothing more than to make enough money to come
play out here,'' said Jobe, who is exempt in Japan through the 2009
season and has no interest in going to the PGA Tour qualifying
school. ``You'd always like to play on your home turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe, a UCLA graduate, moved to Southlake from Denver during the
spring to simplify his commute to Japanese Tour events and to live
in a climate with year-round golfing opportunities. GROUP PRACTICE
</P>

EDITORIAL: A STRONGER CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Aug. 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York City's police commissioner, Howard Safir, is
considering a modest step that could increase confidence in the
Police Department by assuring ordinary citizens that their
complaints about police behavior will receive a fair and full
hearing. The plan would end the department's policy of
``reinvestigating'' charges of police brutality that have already
been investigated and referred to police for disciplinary action by
the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Although the details are sketchy, Safir's proposal could give
the complaint board more authority and independence. Last year the
board investigated 2,500 citizens' complaints and recommended
police action on about 400. Typically, after the Police Department
reinvestigates the referred cases, only about half result in
disciplinary action. Complaints usually involve excessive force,
discourtesy, abuse of authority or offensive language, which is
usually defined as an ethnic slur.
</P>
<P>
   The Safir proposal, while a good first step, will work only if
the city continues to make a solid commitment to the civilian
board. At present, there are about 100 investigators working full
time on complaints. If Safir's change requires additional
investigation by the board, as expected, the board will need more
investigators since complaints must be completed and referred to
the Police Department within 18 months after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   It matters little whether the proposal was prompted by the
uproar over police tactics this year or whether it simply
percolated to the top of Safir's priority list. What is important
is that the commissioner appears to be acknowledging the necessity
and investigative skill of the board. However, his idea should not
be seen as a way to deflect other useful proposals that could
emerge from a continuing federal investigation of police brutality
in New York. That investigation might yield other ways of insuring
that a charge of police abuse gets a fair hearing, not only for the
accused officer but also for the citizen accuser.

   The New York Times saidin an editorial on Friday, Aug. 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to go bankrupt in America, the best places to
do it are in Florida and Texas. Both states have unlimited
homestead exemptions, meaning that bankrupts can protect their
homes from creditors no matter how much they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with little public debate, Texas is on the verge of making
its bankruptcy protections even more generous. Currently a bankrupt
person can shelter from creditors a home and no more than one acre
of land in an urban area. But a proposed amendment to the Texas
Constitution would raise that limit to 10 acres. The limit would
remain at 200 acres in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Even more generously, the amendment, which has passed the Texas
Legislature and goes to the voters in November, provides that if
you operate your business from your home, the business property is
also protected. Advocates say that would protect small family
businesses, but it is written so broadly that it could allow a
Houston property developer to shelter a huge office building, so
long as he lived in an apartment in it.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Senate is expected to consider a bankruptcy
reform bill next month. Like a bill that passed the House, it would
do nothing to limit the ways that the formerly wealthy have of
stiffing creditors, of which the unlimited homestead exemption is
only the best known. But the bill would be a boon to the credit
card companies, which have pushed hard to get it enacted. It would
help them by making it much harder for bankrupts to get out from
under credit card debt. That would primarily affect middle-income
and poor people forced into bankruptcy by a job loss or large
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   The bill deserves to be defeated, but if it is to be passed, it
should at least be amended to keep Texas and Florida from providing
such blatant protection to once-wealthy deadbeats.

TAX CUT POSES MORE DANGER TO GIULIANI THAN TO MRS. CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Across the nation, congressional Republicans fanned
out this week to rally support for the $792 billion tax cut _ the
cornerstone of their 2000 election effort _ that President Clinton
has pledged to veto. Across New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
advocating the Democratic line as she prepares for a probable run
for Senate, denounced the same bill as a threat to Medicare, Social
Security and the nation's financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Those conflicting political views have now converged at the feet
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the New York Republican who, like Mrs.
Clinton, is considering a race for the Senate next year. Suddenly,
Giuliani is finding himself squeezed on one side by Mrs. Clinton
and on the other by conservative Republicans who are pressing him
to take a position on a piece of legislation that he would,
presumably, like to avoid discussing for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ronald Reagan came to Washington in 1981, reducing taxes
and government spending have been the defining issues for
Republican officeholders in this nation. That philosophy shaped the
nearly $800 billion tax cut that Congress passed earlier this
summer, the largest since Reagan was in office, and it is the
program that Congressional leaders hope to run on next year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence, pollsters and political consultants
said Thursday, that New York voters of either party share quite the
passion of congressional Republicans on tax cuts, particularly
during flush economic times. That is particularly true when cuts
are presented as coming at the cost of spending on programs that
are relatively popular, like Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Rudy Giuliani will have a difficult time mobilizing the
New York electorate using tax cuts as his message,'' said Jonathan
W. Siegel, director of the Harris Poll Election 2000 unit.
``Barring a change in the political or economic environment, they
are simply not that compelling an issue to most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Giuliani, while reiterating his own support for more
federal tax cuts, declined to say how he would have voted on the
tax cut bill, saying he had not had an opportunity to study it. By
Thursday, under attack by Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the state
Democratic Party, and Rep. Rick A. Lazio, the conservative
Republican who had threatened to challenge Giuliani for the
senatorial nomination, the mayor offered a slightly more expansive
view on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that he backed large tax cuts, but not as large as
those that had been legislated by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not say whether he would actually have bucked his
party's leadership had he been in Washington to vote against the
bill; Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly said she would have voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the debate on the Republican tax cut has presented
New Yorkers with a sharp and early contrast between the two
probable major party candidates for Senate. Over the last few
weeks, Mrs. Clinton has been talking first about assuring the
viability of two of the nation's largest spending programs,
Medicare and Social Security. By contrast, Giuliani has talked
mainly about cutting taxes, particularly the capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Giuliani's predicament suggests that Mrs. Clinton
is not alone in confronting some fairly tricky ground in the year
ahead, as each seeks to please the diverse political agendas of
supporters. In Mrs. Clinton's case, the main complication is her
husband's administration; for Giuliani, it is the Republican
leadership in Congress, as well as conservative voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the Republican Party, intense in its
devotion to defeating Mrs. Clinton, will give Giuliani some room to
move as he seeks office in a state where Democratic voters hold the
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of endorsing Al Gore, Rudy Giuliani can do anything he
wants, and the Beltway GOP will tolerate it,'' said Nelson
Warfield, a Republican consultant. ``Rudy Giuliani has cheated on
the national party repeatedly, and on issues like the tax cut,
he'll stray again. But the GOP leadership is married to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is only so far that this Republican in particular can
go in defying the Republican leadership in Congress, should he
choose to do so. Giuliani is already viewed suspiciously in
Republican circles, given his moderate position on such issues as
abortion rights and gay rights, and for endorsing Gov. Mario M.
Cuomo, a Democrat, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts are a particularly central issue for the party, as has
become clear this year on Capitol Hill. And Washington politics
notwithstanding, Giuliani has to take care not to take positions
that discourage Republican voters from turning out. And he
presumably needs to make sure that the Conservative Party, which
has made no secret of its concerns about Giuliani's opinions, does
not abandon him in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   That is what explains Mrs. Clinton's decision to attack the tax
bill at her recent listening seminars; though she never mentions
Giuliani's name, she is trying to force him to deal with the issue.
Mrs. Clinton found herself in a curious lock step with Lazio when
he criticized Giuliani for not taking a position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in New York, tax cuts are not a cut-and-dried issue,
and for all of Giuliani's difficulties, Mrs. Clinton may not have
an easy time using it against him.
</P>
<P>
   Because income in the Northeast is so high, New York residents
are apt to get back a disproportionate amount of any federal tax
cuts. And because living costs in that region are so high, a tax
cut that might be attacked by Democrats in other parts of the
nation as benefiting the upper-class will in fact be of interest to
many New Yorkers who consider themselves middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the
chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, voted for the
initial Republican version of the tax cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a caution I'm giving to Hillary,'' Torricelli said
Thursday. ``What may have looked like a significant income tax cut
in Arkansas is decidedly middle-class in New York and New Jersey.''

U.S. SEEKING TO EXTRADITE COLOMBIAN IN DRUG CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United States is seeking the extradition of a
Colombian man accused of smuggling large quantities of cocaine into
New York City and other East Coast cities, often packaging the
drugs in boxes of mustard or cough medicine to mask the odor, the
authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Alberto Orlandez-Gamboa, who has been jailed in
Colombia since June 1998 on charges of murder, kidnapping and
illicit enrichment, was notified Wednesday that he faces additional
charges in the United States of importing cocaine and money
laundering, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamboa is one of the most powerful and ruthless of the
Colombian north coast drug traffickers,'' said Lewis Rice Jr., the
special agent in charge of the New York office of the Drug
Enforcement Agency, which, along with the U.S. attorney, announced
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Orlandez-Gamboa is one of a number of suspected Colombian drug
traffickers whom the United States is seeking under changes in the
Colombian constitution made in December 1997 that lifted a 1991 ban
on extraditions, officials said. The United States has 60 days to
file the formal extradition request with Colombian authorities, and
if it is granted, Orlandez-Gamboa could become the first Colombian
citizen extradited under the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Orlandez-Gamboa, 43, had faced extradition to the United States
as early as 1989 on similar charges but was released at that time
for lack of sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they suspected that even from prison,
Orlandez-Gamboa ran an international drug trafficking and money
laundering operation known as the Caracol Organization and that he
often used the name Caracol, which means snail in Spanish, as his
nickname. The organization's headquarters were in Barranquilla,
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Colombian drug enforcement officials accuse him of
smuggling more than 2,000 kilograms from Colombia into Puerto Rico,
Yonkers, N.Y., and New York City. Since cocaine often sells for
$20,000 to $25,000 per kilogram, the shipments were worth tens of
millions of dollars, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine, often forwarded via Puerto Rico, was shipped on
commercial cargo ships, speed boats, private airplanes and through
parcel delivery services, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine was concealed in many ways, the indictment said: It
was packed in boxes containing sawdust, mustard and cough medicine
to disguise the drug's odor; it was also sent in crates containing
Mazola corn oil, engine parts and cement, or disguised as bananas
or other fruit. Some was packaged inside ceramic tiles or sealed in
cans and suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Orlandez-Gamboa is also accused of laundering at least $2.1
million by transferring cash to various bank accounts around the
world, buying property or businesses with the proceeds and using
the money to buy money orders in small denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the indictment says Orlandez-Gamboa had ordered his
foot soldiers to carry out assassinations or kidnappings of rival
drug dealers, and to bribe corrupt officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The center of the world for the many surprising millions of
dollars that Bill Bradley is raising for his presidential campaign
is here on a blah stretch of suburban road in West Orange, N.J.,
where a sign announces that ``Fund-Raising is the First Primary''
and an avid clutch of underpaid young staff members work on future
$1,000-a-person parties in Minneapolis, Louisville and the Upper
East Side home of the director Spike Lee. Overseeing it all is one
of the few grown-ups in evidence: Richard L. Wright, 56, Bradley's
national finance director and his former basketball teammate at
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe how young everyone looks?'' Wright said. He
added that he brought certain disadvantages and advantages to the
campaign: ``I can't stay up all night, but I think I know more. If
I can remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, along with Betty Sapoch, Bradley's longtime fund-raiser
with a near-photographic memory, is one of the people responsible
for the $11.8 million that Bradley had raised by June, sending out
the message that Bradley had enough money to keep after Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, through the early
primaries next year.
</P>
<P>
   True, a lot of people say that Bradley's fund-raising success is
largely due to Gore, whose candidacy has bored many Democrats,
although in Wright's view the person responsible is naturally
Bradley. ``Our main fund-raiser is obviously Bill,'' he said. ``He
goes to every one of these things. And he's unbelievable on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing his old teammate to harvest $1,000 checks for his
campaign, Bradley has selected not a professional fund-raiser _
least of all one tainted by the 1996 Democratic fund-raising
scandals _ but a schmoozy, savvy and trusted friend of nearly four
decades, now on leave from his solar-energy business, who has been
everything from chief of staff to Jim Florio when he was New Jersey
governor, to an official in President Jimmy Carter's Department of
Energy, to (at present) an owner of LaFollette Vineyard near
Princeton, which produces about 20,000 bottles of Seyval Blanc a
year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting things about Wright is that his
great-great-uncle was Sen. Robert M. LaFollette Sr. of Wisconsin,
the Progressive leader, but more important to the Bradley campaign
is, of course, Wright's closeness to the candidate. For years the
Bradley and Wright families vacationed together on the Jersey
Shore; Wright has known Bradley since Bradley was 17. Ms. Sapoch
says the two are like brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen Bill during this campaign?'' Wright asked over
lunch last week at Rascal's, the funky joint next door to the
Bradley headquarters, a low-lying suburban office building that
looks as if there might be a podiatrist inside. ``He's got that
same look in his eye that he had in the game when it was 10 minutes
to go and we knew we were going to win.'' Wright paused, then
smiled: ``Even though we were down by five.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wright's fund-raising success does not seem the result
of any revolutionary techniques, just a dogged and aggressive
search for millions in what will undoubtedly be the most expensive
presidential campaign in history. Wright is constantly on a plane
to America's money reservoirs _ California, Texas, Chicago,
Florida, up and down the East Coast, and now the Midwest _ meeting
with local Democrats and making arrangements for dinner after
$1,000-a-plate dinner. A huge map of the United States in his
office marks some of the upcoming fund-raisers: Cincinnati and
Detroit on Sept. 14, Kansas City and Wichita, Kan., on Sept. 21.
(Although offsetting all the purposefulness is a replica of Edvard
Munch's ``The Scream.'' on Wright's desk.)
</P>
<P>
   Wright talks weekly to the fund-raising-marquee names on
Bradley's national finance committee, like Leonard Riggio, the
chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble, and Thomas G. Labrecque, the
president of the Chase Manhattan Corp. He also revels in the
ability of Bradley, the former New York Knicks star, to attract
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, the ex-Chicago Bulls coach and Bradley's teammate
on the Knicks, for example, was at a San Francisco dinner in April
that raised more than $1 million _ from a mix of old money, Silicon
Valley entrepreneurs, sports fans and Republicans. ``It really set
the stage for the rest of the fund raising,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright grew up in Menlo Park, Calif., where his father ran a
real estate company and his mother, among other things, had an
interview program on an early San Francisco public television
station. ``She was one of the really crazy early women,'' Wright
said. ( Wright remembers her asking the Stanford football coach
something like, ``What do they do when they stand in the circle
with their heads kind of down?'')
</P>
<P>
   Wright met Bradley in 1961 at Princeton, where he played forward
on the basketball team. ``I was a good high school player who did
OK in college,'' Wright said. As for Bradley, ``He could shoot,''
Wright said, chuckling at the understatement. ``He could really
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright lives in Princeton, is married with two sons and, despite
his year in politics and LaFollette ancestry, has never been
interested in running for office. ``Guys like Bill are better,'' he
said.

EVOLUTION AND FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas Board of Education's decision against evolution is
only a small step backward, but it is disheartening that any
governmental entity would discourage the teaching of one of the
most effective scientific theories in history.
</P>
<P>
   The decision would not ban the teaching of evolution but would
remove some of the key elements of the theory from statewide
assessment tests. Scott Hill, one of the board members who voted
for the new plan, said biological evolution and natural selection
would still be included but not questions about the origin of
humankind. ``One of the greatest unsolved mysteries,'' he called
it.
</P>
<P>
   But is it really? Evolution theory, first propounded in detail
by Charles Darwin in 1859, provided a powerful theoretical
framework for scientific examination of fossils hidden in
sedimentary layers around the world. It stimulated research that
uncovered a progression from fish to amphibians, reptiles, then
mammals, on to the origins of humans on the savannas of Africa and
their slow spread across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas schools can still teach these topics, and will have to if
they want to prepare students for the national Scholastic
Assessment Test on biology. Local school boards will be under
pressure, however, to eliminate evolution for casual students of
biology. American students as a whole are weak in scientific
knowledge. There is no need to discourage them from gaining a
well-rounded education.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the Kansas decision comes from fundamentalist
Christians who cling to the Genesis account of creation, a powerful
statement of God's purpose in the world that reflects the ancient
world's scant scientific knowledge. Fundamentalists have devised
their own theory of creation science, but it lacks the elegance and
durability of evolution. Students deserve to be instructed in the
best available body of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   That applies especially to fundamentalist young people. They
will confront Darwin and his heirs eventually as they make their
way in the 21st century. Why not start in high school, where they
can test the usefulness of evolution against the verities of faith?

   AMES, Iowa _ Aboard his high-tech bus, watching the cornfields
whiz by, Steve Forbes is wheeling into town squares all over Iowa
these days in search of respect as a presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, politician and patrician is a blur of nonstop
motion, rolling around the rural landscape at the rate of four to
six cities a day, 180 events in four weeks. He is seeking enough
support _ and spending whatever it takes _ to make a respectable
showing in Saturday's Republican straw poll, a prize that confers
headline status even though it is no real test of voter sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by an entourage in two big shiny buses equipped with
the latest satellite and digital gear, Forbes is banking on a
decent enough showing to justify the $10 million he has spent so
far on his message of conservative morals, politics and economics _
themes his advisers believe resonate best in rural America.
</P>
<P>
   For all his money, in fact, Forbes is often seen here as being a
regular guy, as he travels the byways from Grundy Center to
Marengo, from Pella to Monona. ``I back everything he said,'' said
William Baretich, a retired high school principal who showed up at
a Forbes event this week in Eagle Grove. ``So far as I am
concerned, his wealth is a plus. I have no idea how he got it, but
he's got a good business sense, and we need someone with his
expertise to run the government because it's probably the biggest
corporation of them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the presidential candidates in footing his own bill,
Forbes, whose net worth is estimated to be between $440 million and
$500 million, said he would spend whatever it takes to make him
competitive with Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Forbes spent over $35
million on his failed presidential bid in 1996. Bush has raised
more than $36 million so far, and both candidates have opted out of
the campaign finance system and its limits on spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be assured,'' Forbes said, without being specific, in a
back-of-the-bus interview, ``I will spend enough to be very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, what he is buying, besides lots of radio and television
ads, is organization, which is what really counts in the nearly
25-year-old Iowa contest. His campaign entourage has been pulling
up to American Legion and Elks halls in hundreds of quiet Iowa
towns, the sound system on the buses blaring Forbes' presence like
that of a political music man. While the scenes can be charmingly
old fashioned, the buses are anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, they look like something from a James Bond movie set. A
squadron of clean-cut young men, all dressed in identical khaki
pants and blue polo shirts emblazoned with the Forbes logo, operate
from a hidden high-tech world of laptops, digital laser printers
and satellite phones, and make use of three cell line connections
and two lines for modem use from any town square. Also in the
entourage are a bevy of young women in khaki skirts and white polo
shirts with the Forbes logo, as well as a separate crew in gray
polos with a Forbes Iowa logo.
</P>
<P>
   All the gadgetry is aimed at creating grassroots support. Names
and phone numbers written on cards handed out at the events are put
into the campaign databank before the bus hits the next town.
Anyone who wants a picture taken with the candidate gets a color
laser copy of the photo before the campaign event is over. And any
photos taken can be put instantaneously onto the Forbes campaign
Web site, which has received 35 million hits and drawn 25,000
volunteers, according to the Forbes staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using the Wal-Mart strategy,'' said K.B. Forbes, the
campaign's Iowa press secretary who is no relation to Forbes. ``We
are hitting the rural areas first. We're finding the activists who
are attracted to Forbes. All the other candidates are focusing on
the chiefs, the elites. We're focusing on the Indians, the
grassroots activists.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend will be the first test of whether Forbes' methods
and messages really do resonate here.
</P>
<P>
   In his endless stream of gatherings, typically attracting
between 40 and 80 people, Forbes offers a stump speech that rails
against abortion, Washington-as-usual politics and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent interest rate hike, while
extolling a flat 15 percent income tax, higher defense spending and
more choice in education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   He has loosened up his speaking style, and, while he still
appears to be more banker than politician, his words are received
with respectful interest and standing ovations in this politically
conservative region. His reference to the ``infernal revenue
service'' is a standard laugh-getter, along with his designation of
Washington officeholders as ``critters looking for the honey pot''
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Goodman liked what she heard when Forbes appeared in her
hometown of Gundy Center earlier this week. ``We need a leader to
carry on the Reagan policies,'' she said. ``His idea for a flat tax
is honest and simple, and he's not a Washington politician.''
</P>
<P>
   John Whalen of Eudora said, ``We're in a world of hurt here, and
we've got to get the government out of things whether it's farming
or Medicare. He's right on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa straw poll has been criticized as a way for the local
Republican Party to gather publicity and dollars _ everyone who
votes in it must pay a $25 entry fee and voting must be done in
person here in Ames. As a result, candidates like Forbes pick up
the $25 entry tab and try to get as many people as they can to come
to Ames on a hot summer's weekend to vote in a poll that is not
binding on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contest where money matters, and Forbes is pouring on
his resources: His aides say they have lined up 85 regular buses to
transport potential voters _ a total of around 4,000 people in a
contest where 10,000 to 15,000 are expected to vote. To lure
supporters, Forbes is offering them a big barbecue party in Ames
beneath two air-conditioned tents where country music entertainer
Ronnie Milsap and inspirational singer Debby Boone will entertain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' wealth, rather than being a political liability, seems
not to matter to some of those who have heard him here.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Broer of Iowa Falls, who said she typically votes
Democratic, said Forbes' wealth ``was one of the reasons why he
intrigues me. He's willing to risk his personal fortune in this
endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   And Keith Schwebke, also of Iowa Falls, said, ``His wealth does
give him the ability to compete with the Bushes. Yet he still comes
across as a common guy I could go up and talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes may be dismissed by some as indulging in the
political fantasies of a rich man, he sees himself as a man with a
message. He believes the party has failed when it offers candidates
who are long on image but short on policy substance. ``There can be
no victory without a message,'' said Forbes. ``Right now my party
is rallied around one candidate,'' he said, referring to Bush.
``But those who want real change will come more and more to this
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his slow start in 1996, Forbes came out early and
aggressively this time, and he is sustained by the belief that the
party establishment will no longer shrug off his candidacy if he
performs well in early party caucuses. Forbes is spending his money
on television, radio and newspaper ads and on direct mail and phone
banks in key early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona
and California. As a measure of how the candidate is doing, his
campaign likes to pull out a headline from The Fairfield, Iowa,
Daily Ledger, which said: ``Forbes, author of the flat tax, sings
to the choir in Fairfield.''

AMONG MATADORS, QUESTIONS REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sean Beard is angry. He's confused. But he knows
there's nothing he can do about the numerous descriptions of NCAA
and university policy violations contained in the Cal State
Northridge investigative report into the football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's water under the bridge,'' said Beard, a senior defensive
lineman who put in an appearance at the team office Thursday.
``It's time to play ball. We're ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The 130-page report, which has been forwarded to the NCAA for
further review, was a scathing review of former head coach Ron
Ponciano, who was accused of misappropriating funds and having a
general disregard for authority. Ponciano, who was fired July 16,
was popular with the players, especially Beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Ponciano) did that stuff,'' Beard said. ``A lot
of the stuff is above my head. (But) Coach Ponciano recruited
players that have pride in themselves and pride in the program.
We're going to play to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Flowers, the former Matadors All-American quarterback who
now coaches the position at CSUN, said he didn't have a strong
reaction to the release of the report, but he's happy it has
finally been released to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still sketchy as far as the details of what happened,''
Flowers said. ``(Ponciano) was always good to me. (The report) is
portraying him as having malice. There was a lot of stuff that
needs to be clarified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to move forward. We've got kids who want to win a
Big Sky championship.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Caught in the middle: D.J. Hackett, a freshman wide receiver
from San Dimas, was recruited to catch footballs for the Matadors,
not heat from the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   But two NCAA violations committed by Ponciano in the football
report involved Hackett, including an instance in February when
Ponciano saw Hackett play in a high school basketball playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about 10 seconds,'' Hackett remembered about meeting
Ponciano after the game, which was during the NCAA's ``quiet''
period in which coaches couldn't have contact with recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said his commitment to CSUN didn't waver during the
summer-long investigation into the program that cost Ponciano and
assistant coach Rob Phenicie their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still wanted to be at this school,'' said Hackett, a
6-foot-3, 180-pounder who was an All-Southern Section pick in
football last year. ``There was no way I was leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the way out: Anthony Ramos, a junior wide receiver who
caught 33 passes last year, has applied to attend Washington State
and isn't expected to report today with the other returnees.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is the only veteran not expected to return. Junior college
transfer Jay Marcus, whom CSUN signed in February, quit the team in
the spring and hasn't responded to head coach Jeff Kearin's phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable in saying they are not coming back,''
Kearin said. ``I hope I'm wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Proving himself: Freshman running back Marquis Brignac, the
Daily News' Offensive Player of the Year who helped lead Taft High
to the L.A. City Section championship last year, said he's
adjusting to life as a college athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting back in the flow of football,'' Brignac said. ``I
just wanted to come here and prove myself. I have something to
prove and so does this school.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Clarification: Pat Dagata, a CSUN football booster, was
quoted in Thursday's editions of the Daily News as saying she knew
about the NCAA rule against boosters providing illegal team
barbecues. In fact, Dagata did not know about the rule. Her quote
was taken out of context.

 &HT;    Anderson to have it easy until Monday
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn and
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ On Wednesday, Jamal Anderson ceased being a
businessman and agreed to return to his career as a football
player. About 3 p.m. Thursday, Anderson donned the tools of his
trade again and went on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of the Falcons' former holdout running back in uniform
was a moment to be treasured for all.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. First of all, players were not in pads for
Thursday's walk-through. And besides, undrafted rookie running back
Steve Hookfin thought the 14-day holdout was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying this is a business. Well, it's a business for
me, too,'' said Hookfin, from Ohio University, who got more
repetitions in practice because of Anderson's absence. ``He's not
putting any groceries on my table.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't participate in Thursday's session, instead
working on conditioning with injured players under the tutelage of
trainer Ron Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron's too easy on them,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``He'd have
to run a lot more if I was over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson reported at 236 pounds, the lightest in his career. But
just as he has struggled to swap a limousine for a golf cart, he
admitted that heat in the mid-90s and considerable humidity also
are nettlesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret missing two weeks of this,'' he said, ``but
something tells me Monday it's going to be like 120 (degrees).''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson signed autographs for fans after practice. He was to
ride in Reeves' golf cart back to the locker room, but first he had
to do a radio interview on his cell phone. Reeves ended up waiting
inside a nearby motor home.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson was finished, Reeves was told, ``Your highness is
summoning you.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson came out of the RV and said, ``I only have one
highness, and she'' _ his wife, Pam _ ``is in North Carolina with
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   On the serious side, Anderson said he's happy to be back with
his teammates, many of whom stand to become unrestricted free
agents after the season. He also is looking forward to the Sept. 12
opener against the Vikings, a rematch of the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to try to entice some of these other guys to sign (new
contracts),'' he said. ``I'm all about winning. That's the focus
right now, to get ready. Rematch. Week 1. The nation's waiting for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons travel by bus today to Atlanta for the preseason
opener against the Lions in the Georgia Dome. They return to Furman
University after the game. After a brief workout of running and
lifting on Saturday, the team will be off Sunday. The last day of
training camp at Furman will be Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain update
</P>
<P>
   General manager Harold Richardson returned to Suwanee on
Thursday night. Today, he will review the latest numbers regarding
potential corporate sponsorships to underwrite the $18 million to
$20 million construction of a new facility in Stone Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, although not definite, that a decision could be
reached today. Officials affiliated with the park are scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   If Stone Mountain doesn't work out, the team most likely would
expand its existing facility in Suwanee or opt for a site in Hall
County off Interstate 985, just a few miles from the current
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Comissioner visits
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue was in Greenville and had lunch
with Reeves and team president Taylor Smith in the dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go around the league, there's a lot of interest in what
the Falcons are doing,'' Tagliabue said. ``To go from 3-13 in two
years to the Super Bowl _ I think it shows how quickly a team can
become competitive in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue will arrive in Atlanta a couple days before the Oct. 3
game against Baltimore to review plans for Super Bowl XXXIV, which
will be Jan. 30 in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are beat up, and at least 10 players will miss the
game against the Lions. Missing practice Thursday were linebacker
Ruffin Hamilton (hyperextended knee), defensive ends Chuck Smith
(sprained right big toe) and Brett Williams (knee surgery
Thursday), wide receivers Tim Dwight (tight back) and Chris
Calloway (sprained ankle), cornerbacks Elijah Williams (sprained
knee) and Michael Booker (strained thigh), tight ends O.J. Santiago
(bruised left leg/sprained knee) and Reggie Kelly (sprained ankle),
defensive tackle Ben Huff (sprained foot), and center Todd McClure
(knee surgery Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Dwight is not necessarily ruled out of tonight's game. Wide
receiver Ronnie Harris, who has replaced Calloway at split end,
practiced Thursday but might miss the game with a groin pull.
</P>
<P>
   Even Reeves is lame. He had to have his left knee drained
Thursday because of fluid buildup.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler will start at quarterback, but he won't play
much. Danny Kanell, who was signed after the Giants let him go,
will get most of the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will depend on the number of plays,'' Reeves said. ``If
(Chandler) has a good first series, and we get the job done, he
might come out then. The guy we got to get a good feel for is Danny
Kanell. Next week, we'll look at Tony Graziani. That doesn't mean
Tony won't play (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson won't play. And if Harris and Dwight are both out,
fifth-round draft choice Eugene Baker from Kent University might
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, you almost never get a wide receiver a chance to work
in there with Chris because he's always working with the first
team,'' Reeves said. ``It's an opportunity for a lot of guys. A lot
of guys are in this league because of injuries (to other
players).''
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft choice Patrick Kerney will probably back up
both defensive end spots. Kerney had his head shaved Thursday by
starting defensive end Lester Archambeau. The top of his head is
almost bald, except for a patch of hair near his forehead. A racing
stripe was shaved from his neck to the top of his head.

 &HT;    Only 19, Garcia making PGA run
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Considering the possibility that this U.S. Ryder
Cup flap can only strengthen the Europeans? Well, the evidence
might be in already.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Sergio Garcia, 19, a likely member of the European team
that will play the U.S. team next month, shot 6-under-par 66
Thursday in his first PGA Championship, grabbing a two-stroke lead
in the 81st PGA Championship at Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for improvement at a young age? Garcia knocked 23
strokes off the first round of his last major, when he started the
British Open with an 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I proved myself today,'' Garcia said. ``I think the
British Open is done and I don't want to hear any more questions
about the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest player to lead the PGA, Garcia sank a birdie putt
of six feet at the 18th hole to widen his lead over Americans Jay
Haas and J.P. Hayes and Canada's Mike Weir, who came in with
4-under 68s.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Cink is three shots off the lead with a 69, joining
Brian Watts, last-minute replacement Jerry Kelly and Brandt Jobe.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval and Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1 and No. 2
players, each shot 2-under 70s, along with Tom Lehman, two-time
champion Nick Price, Ryder Cup-hopeful Chris Perry and England's
Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he can maintain the pace established Thursday, when a
47-minute delay complicated conditions, Garcia said, ``Of course.
Why not? I know it's difficult and I have to show it, but I think
I'm good enough to stay where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Making six birdies without a bogey on the 7,401-yard course,
which played long but offered rain-softened greens, Garcia tied the
Medinah course record in his 12th event as a professional. He is
attempting to become the youngest player to win a major. Garcia is
three months younger (19 years, 7 months), than Johnny McDermott
when he won the 1911 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness forced play to be suspended at 8:57 p.m with 15 players
left on the course. The first round will be completed this morning.

GARCIA SHOOTS 66 TO TAKE LEAD AT PGA CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Embarrassment can be a powerful motivator. Just
ask Sergio Garcia, the Spanish teen-ager who arrived at Medinah
Country Club Thursday with one goal in mind.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to make people quit talking about his dismal
performance at the British Open, the low point of his brief
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen holes later, Garcia found himself fielding questions
about how it felt to tie the course scoring record and lead his
first major championship. Garcia, 19, grinned as he reflected on
his 6-under-par 66 in the opening round of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I proved myself today,'' said Garcia, whose score was
23 strokes lower than his opening effort at last month's British
Open, where he shot 89-83 and missed the cut. ``Ever since I got
here, the big question has been, `What went wrong at the Open?' It
seemed like I had to prove something. And that's what I did. Now, I
don't want to hear any more questions about the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in his play at the two events, Garcia said, is
that ``everything went the right way'' in his opening round at
Medinah, from a chip-in birdie at No. 2 to a 30-foot bomb for one
of a dozen birdies recorded at No. 16. Garcia finished a bogey-free
tour of the 7,401-yard layout with a 9-iron approach to six feet at
No. 18, setting up his sixth and final birdie in his record-tying
round.
</P>
<P>
   He leads Jay Haas, Mike Weir and J.P. Hayes by two strokes and
is three ahead of a four-player group that includes Southlake
resident Brandt Jobe (3 under), a member of the Japanese Tour. Fort
Worth resident Mark Brooks (2 under) is four shots back after his
best start to a major championship since an opening 70 at the 1997
PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a 47-minute weather delay during a day marked by
intermittent showers, 15 players must return at 8:45 a.m. today to
complete suspended rounds. Among that group, Corey Pavin stands
3-under with two holes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who is 12th on the European Ryder Cup standings, can
clinch a spot on the team with a victory at Medinah. He said he
already is thinking in those terms after his opening 66.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed he could keep up his record-setting pace,
Garcia said: ``Of course. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm good enough to stay where I am,'' said Garcia, who
finished third at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic during his
professional debut at a PGA Tour event. ``I always like being two
strokes ahead. There's nothing better than that. And if, by
tomorrow, I can be four ahead, I can tell you I'm not going to feel
any pressure. I feel pretty confident.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he did just tie a course record. And he put a stop to
those pesky questions about the British Open. nn

   LOS ANGELES _ R. Jay Soward reported to USC's training camp
Thursday and it didn't take long for the flashy wide receiver to
make an impression.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, who worked out on his own this summer and avoided team
workouts, didn't exactly have a sterling debut. He stopped halfway
through the first official running test because his legs started to
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs just got heavy. I don't want to push myself to the
extreme. I'll do it again in the morning,'' Soward said. ``I went
halfway through and my legs started to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sign to me I should have been here. Even if I have
to do extra conditioning, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward is trying to start fresh this week and met with USC coach
Paul Hackett on Wednesday to discuss the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was concerned,'' said Hackett, who was
``disappointed'' Soward did not participate in USC's summer workout
program. ``I was making the assumption he was prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Soward passed his summer classes and will be
academically eligible this season.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that wasn't discussed were published comments last
week, in which Soward said if Hackett wanted to ``show some
animosity (over missing summer workouts). So be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he didn't feel he was in trouble over his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. Not in my mind. I don't feel I'm in any danger,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hackett: ``We didn't talk about it. I'm not going to react
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward also said he felt misquoted in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things were taken out of context. I said a lot. (But
the article) made it seem like I didn't care about my school or my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lacy's back: Junior safety Darnell Lacy, who was removed from
the team last spring for poor academic performance, has met with
Hackett and will re-enroll at USC for the fall semester but not
play football.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Lacy's summer academic performance at a junior
college has led him to consider giving Lacy another chance to play
for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he puts together another fall (academic) performance that
is satisfactory, I would consider bringing him back to the team,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy will not be on scholarship for the fall semester but could
participate in spring practice if he meets Hackett's academic
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   __ Name change: True freshman offensive lineman Lucas MacKay of
Hughson, Calif., is now spelling his name Lucais MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   __ Number change: Junior linebacker Zeke Moreno has gone back to
wearing No. 9, which he had his freshman season. Moreno wore 34
last season.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Venezuela's newly empowered
Constitutional Assembly approved Thursday a decree that gives the
body far-reaching authority to abolish government institutions and
dismiss officials, and strengthens the authority of President Hugo
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Citing what it called the ``exhaustion, collapse and loss of
legitimacy'' of the current political and administrative structure,
the assembly gave itself the right to ``decree measures pertaining
to the competency, functioning and organization of the public
powers of the state.'' No date was set for the relinquishment of
the special powers, with the decree stating that the edict would
remain in effect ``until the cessation of the situation that
justifies it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a 45-year-old former army paratrooper who in 1992 led an
unsuccessful coup attemp, took office in February vowing to carry
out a peaceful social revolution in his country, which in recent
years has become the principal source of imported oil for the
United States. But his critics maintain that his real aim is to
impose a left-wing military dictatorship on the South American
nation and its 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn in last week, the assembly has six months to write a new
constitution to replace the country's current charter, which dates
from 1961. Chavez, however, urged the representatives to speed up
their work so that a plebiscite can be held before year's end, and
submitted a draft constitution that would expand his term to six
years and permit him to succeed himself in office.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the decree formalized Thursday would allow the
assembly to dissolve the Congress and the Supreme Court, as Chavez
repeatedly threatened to do before the July 25 special election to
pick 131 assembly delegates. Seeking to avoid such a confrontation,
Congress has gone into recess until October and even offered to let
the new body hold its sessions in the capital building in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members have made it clear, however, that they intend
to resolve hundreds of cases involving lower-court judges accused
of taking or demanding bribes in return for favorable decisions.
They have also called for the dismissal of several
popularly-elected state governors and mayors, many of whom are
opponents of Chavez, that they maintain are corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Acting in accordance with his own argument that all other
government organs are subordinate to the new assembly, Chavez even
volunteered to resign as president if the body so desired. But, to
no one's surprise, his offer was rejected, and on Wednesday he took
his oath of office again before the body, delivering a speech in
which he spoke of a deepening economic crisis and denounced what he
called ``an international campaign against Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Chavez, including his wife, a brother and a half
dozen members of his Cabinet, occupy 120 of the 131 seats in the
all-powerful body. Three other seats are reserved for
representatives of the country's Indian tribes, meaning that
supporters of Venezuela's two traditional political parties and
other members of the opposition account for only eight seats.
</P>
<P>
   One of those critics, the lawyer Alan Brewer Carias, described
the special powers measure as too broadly drawn and likely to cause
alarm abroad, since ``at the level of international law, it is the
equivalent of declaring a state of siege.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaias Rodriguez, a vice president of the assembly, dismissed
such concerns, describing the document as merely ``a declaration of
competence to deal with national problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But the assembly decided to change the title of the decree from
a declaration of ``national emergency'' to one of ''national
reorganization.'' Rodriguez was contradicted by another pro-Chavez
delegate, Hermann Escarra, a constitutional law professor who
argued that the assembly's responsibility is not limited merely to
drawing up a new constitution. The new body, he said, has ``the
duty and mission to substitute existing powers that have been
gravely delegitimized.''

   LOS ANGELES _ This has to be Buford Furrow's worst nightmare _
being the catalyst for people of all races and religions in L.A.'s
San Fernando Valley coming together.
</P>
<P>
   Joining arms in solidarity on Sunday, Aug. 22 for a mile
unification march against hatred and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Against everything Furrow and people like him stand for.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be Jews joining arms with Christians, Islamics and
Hindus. They'll be African-Americans, Koreans, Latinos, and every
ethnic group that wants to join walking together at noon down
Fallbrook Avenue from Temple Em Habanim to the West Valley Jewish
Community Center for a planned rally.
</P>
<P>
   A rally to show the other side of the face of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it has to be a white supremacist's worst nightmare _
bringing together people of different colors and religions, instead
of tearing them apart.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what Furrow's rampage of violence is doing.
</P>
<P>
   This story starts in a trophy shop on Wednesday morning where a
father is telling his son it's a miracle none of the kids or adults
inside the Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a marksman who fires 70 times from 5 feet away with
the purpose of killing someone, and he doesn't?'' says Jacques Hay,
owner of Award Winners and a member of Temple Em Habanim in West
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else do you describe it but a miracle?''
</P>
<P>
   His teen-age son, Joshua, agrees, giving his father a smile. He
knows exactly what's coming next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do something, son,'' said Hay, who has made a habit
of doing something good for people in the Valley. He and his family
run a free summer camp for handicapped kids, and were instrumental
in helping former CSUN basketball recruit John Flowers after he
lost his legs in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   If Buford Furrow is the face of evil, Jacques Hay is the face of
good.
</P>
<P>
   Before the work day was over Wednesday, Hay had commitments of
help from Councilwoman Laura Chick; the Rev. Zedar Broadous,
president of the local chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People; Barry Smedberg, executive director
of the Valley Interfaith Council, which has representatives of 40
religions in its council; and dozens of Jewish leaders in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just started snowballing,'' Hay said Thursday. ``Everybody
I talked to wanted to do something. They just didn't know what.''
</P>
<P>
   The unification march is what.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what we need to do, answer back,'' Chick said.
``Every day, regular people in all our neighborhoods saying `no'
loud and clear to this violence, saying we won't allow it in our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick says she's making calls and sending out letters to
hundreds of clergy and ethnic groups in the city urging them to
participate in the Aug. 22 march.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Valley Interfaith Council, which networks with more
than 400 congregations throughout the San Fernando Valley, Smedberg
is doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to stand together,'' Smedberg said. ``We can't let
the Buford Furrows of the world paralyze us in fear. We need to
show solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he gets on the phone Thursday with the Christian Scientists,
the Islamics, the Hindus, the Buddhists and every religion under
his umbrella to let them know there's a march coming up, and we all
have to stand together because the Buford Furrows of the world are
trying to rip us apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have happened in a black church, a Korean church,
any church,'' said Broadous, president of the local NAACP chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day-camp center was clearly a place of nonviolence, but
that's where this man chose to take his violence, to a place of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a soldier, I go fight another soldier,'' Broadous said.
``He went straight to innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford Furrow's worst nightmare will begin at noon on Sunday,
Aug. 22, in front of Temple Em Habanim, 7533 Fallbrook Ave., West
Hills. It is approximately one mile to the West Valley Jewish
Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be knocking on every neighborhood door along the way
asking people to join us,'' Hay said.

COWBOYS RECEIVER ERNIE MILLS IS JUST HAPPY TO BE PLAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Ernie Mills
looks back at the play and wonders what the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it on film and it's really not that hard of a hit,''
Mills said. ``It was just in the right spot. I can't believe it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, a nine-year veteran, doesn't have to look far for a
reminder that it actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   He raises his football jersey to reveal a six-inch scar down his
midsection that speaks volumes about how ``lucky'' Mills is to
simply be alive _ let alone be back in training camp at Midwestern
State University preparing for the 1999 season. And he is back to
help revive a Cowboys offense that stalled without him.
</P>
<P>
   The crushing hit from Seattle safety Fred Thomas last November,
which doctors likened to the effects of a car wreck, had Mills in
the hospital ``hooked up to tubes'' for more than a week and not
eating solid foods for about 12 days. The crushing hit left Mills
with a perforated small intestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of concern when the doctors say the injury was
life threatening and that it's a blessing they found out what it
was as soon as they did,'' said Mills, who missed the final five
games and the playoffs. ``I never felt pain like that in my life.
There were a lot of things going on in my mind and football wasn't
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said football was the least of his
concerns when he visited the receiver in the hospital and saw the
anguish in Mills' mother's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Mills is particularly special to him because of the
bond they developed when they were with the Pittsburgh Steelers
from 1994-96. However, he said the gravity of the situation was
such that he'd be thankful for the recovery of anybody in that
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristic of Mills' career, his recovery and subsequent
comeback has been overshadowed by many Cowboys off-season
developments. Foremost of those is the free-agent addition of
speedy receiver Raghib Ismail, which has been billed as the key to
lifting the Cowboys offense from last season's late nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never mind being in the background,'' said Mills, who said
his comeback was driven by his desire for a Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like that my whole career, including high school and
college. My senior year in high school we had a running back that
scored 29 touchdowns and I had 10. And in college (at Florida)
there was (Cowboys running back) Emmitt (Smith) and we ran the ball
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills' pro career has been pretty much the same. He created a
niche as the Steelers' third receiver during the first six years of
his career. An ill-fated stint in Carolina in 1997 led him to the
Cowboys and a reunion with Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, however, his addition was initially painted as an
afterthought _ glorified mainly because of his knowledge of
Gailey's offense.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mills' familiarity with Gailey proved invaluable in
helping his fellow teammates learn the complex offense, his play is
what really drew attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was a little surprising about Ernie was last year going
through quarterback school he didn't do anything spectacular,''
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``He was just one of the
receivers. But once we got into training camp, he started making a
lot of big plays in practice all of a sudden. Then when the regular
season came, he got his opportunity and played really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of constant double-teaming of Michael Irvin, Mills
developed into the Cowboys' go-to guy through the first 10 games of
1997. He made teams pay for single covering him by hauling in 27
receptions for 476 yards and a team-high four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Cowboys' downslide coincidentally began
following that fateful catch for three yards against Seattle that
ended his season, Mills' return is thought to be just as important
to the Cowboys' success as the addition of Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers coach Dwain Painter said opponents will have
to set defensive priorities carefully; doubling Irvin and Ismail
and leaving Mills to single coverage would please the Cowboys
immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who acknowledges an affinity to receivers who run
precise routes and have reliable hands, said there's no question
that having Mills back will be an offensive catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very smart player,'' Aikman said. ``He really
understands how to set up routes and make them all look the same.
Ernie is probably the slowest receiver we got on the field yet he
gets open as much as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gailey and Painter describe Mills as ``dependable'' and
``a consummate professional,'' Irvin simply tags his soft-spoken
and unassuming teammate as ``smooth''.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the most underrated players in the league,''
Irvin said. ``I'm glad he's back. He's our general on the field and
he's smooth with his routes. Him being out there means a great deal
from a confidence standpoint for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That he's playing again is all that's important to Mills. nn
