<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed on Wednesday to submit to
questioning at the White House by federal prosecutors in the
Lewinsky investigation after the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, withdrew an unprecedented subpoena to compel his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be permitted the unusual courtesy of having his
lawyers at his side, unlike other grand jury witnesses, when he
gives his videotaped testimony on the agreed-upon date of Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was willing to agree to many of Clinton's conditions in
exchange for the president's decision not to challenge the subpoena
on constitutional grounds and further delay the lengthy
investigation, lawyers said. Clinton will be the first sitting
president to testify under oath in a grand jury investigation in
which he is a potential target.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrangement to secure Clinton's testimony was announced,
new details emerged about the testimony and evidence that Monica
Lewinsky is prepared to provide to grand jurors under the broad
immunity deal she reached with prosecutors on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky met with prosecutors on Wednesday and turned over
evidence, including a dress as well as several taped phone messages
from Clinton, lawyers familiar with Ms. Lewinsky's case said. They
said that the dress had been sought under subpoena since late last
year and that Ms. Lewinsky had shipped it to her mother for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The dress became a bargaining chip used by prosecutors to wield
pressure against Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, and
ultimately was part of the reason Ms. Lewis was granted immunity
along with her daughter, lawyers familiar with the immunity
agreement said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Ms. Lewinsky's account said that the
25-year-old former White House intern told prosecutors on Monday
that she had expressed concern to Clinton in December about a
number of gifts he had given her, including a T-shirt, a brooch and
a hat pin, that had been subpoenaed by lawyers in the sexual
misconduct case brought by Paula Jones against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president had made the hypothetical
suggestion to her that ``If you don't have them you can't turn them
over'' to Ms. Jones' lawyers, lawyers familiar with her immunity
deal said. Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie, retrieved
the gifts and gave them to investigators in January, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   That account closely tracks with Ms. Lewinsky's original
proposed testimony, or ``proffer,'' given to investigators last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's agreement to testify allows him to avoid the
humiliating spectacle of being led under subpoena into a federal
courthouse to appear personally before the 23-member grand jury and
becoming the first president to be compelled to do so. But it gives
Starr something important as well _ the chance to confront the
president in person and question him extensively on matters ranging
from his relationship to Ms. Lewinsky to alleged efforts to buy her
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now secured the testimony of the two central and final
witnesses in the Lewinsky inquiry, after Ms. Lewinsky accepted an
immunity agreement that requires her to provide ``full and
truthful'' testimony about her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that Clinton
did not intend to alter his earlier statements about the Lewinsky
matter. The president in January emphatically denied a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and said he did not tell her or
anyone else to lie.
</P>
<P>
   The president's account was contradicted this week by Ms.
Lewinsky, who told prosecutors that she and Clinton did have a
sexual relationship and they agreed to deny it, according to
lawyers. They discussed hypothetical explanations to try to keep it
private, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In turning over evidence on Wednesday, Ms. Lewinsky also
provided several taped messages left for her by the president on
her answering machine at her apartment at the Watergate, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky scheduled to tell their stories in
the next few weeks, the independent counsel will soon have the
final pieces of a complex mosaic that may or may not constitute
crimes or impeachable offenses. Starr is expected to quickly
conclude the Lewinsky investigation and prepare a report on his
findings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor has said he was investigating possible charges of
perjury, witness tampering and obstruction of justice arising from
accusations that Clinton carried on a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and directed a conspiracy to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, announced the
arrangement for the president's testimony in a brief statement in
the White House driveway on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire
matter,'' Kendall said, ``the president will voluntarily provide
his testimony on Aug. 17, 1998, to the office of independent
counsel as he has on prior occasions. The president's testimony
will be videotaped at the White House with lawyers present. No
further statement will be issued.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in a week of negotiations over Clinton's
testimony came Tuesday, when Starr agreed to withdraw the subpoena
that he issued on July 17, allowing Kendall to characterize the
President's prospective testimony as ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials acknowledged for the first time on
Wednesday that a subpoena had in fact been issued and served on
Kendall last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, had sought to delay the testimony until late September,
but the federal judge supervising the case, Norma Holloway Johnson,
admonished both sides to schedule it sooner.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the response to the subpoena was the subject of intense
debate within the White House and among the president's official
and private lawyers. Several of the president's political and media
advisers wanted Clinton to comply quickly to avoid the appearance
of stonewalling, but some members of the president's legal team
believed the subpoena was unenforceable and an affront to the
presidency and urged the president to resist it.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Clinton decided to make himself available for
questioning, but only under favorable conditions and not under
compulsion of a subpoena. In another of the odd twists that have
marked this investigation since it began in January, Linda Tripp
emerged from the federal courthouse 10 blocks from the White House
a few minutes after Kendall spoke and read a statement of her own.
She had just completed her eighth and final day before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp brought her former friend, Ms. Lewinsky, to the
attention of Starr's office on Jan. 12, saying that Ms. Lewinsky
had confided in her details of a long-running sexual relationship
with the president. She provided tape recordings of their
conversations and documents that appeared to point to a conspiracy
to obstruct justice involving the president and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation has never been, quote, `just about sex,'''
Mrs. Tripp said in a breaking voice under a sweltering sun. ``It
has been about telling the truth; the truth matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs the Judiciary Committee,
welcomed news of the president's impending testimony as a sign that
Starr's inquiry was in its ``closing throes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be more than just alleged sexual peccadilloes in
the White House,'' Hatch said at a news conference, ``and frankly
all of us would like to get this over with. I'd be surprised if Ken
Starr would allow this to go well into September.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, was more blunt, calling on Starr to conclude his
investigation and ``give us a report on what he's done to date. Let
the American people, let the Congress do it and let the Congress
act whichever way they want. But wrap this sucker up.''

A LITTLE HAM FOR BROOKLYN'S MORNING RUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hard to describe exactly what Roland Joseph does
every morning in the middle of Flatbush and Fourth avenues in
Brooklyn, a confluence of screaming traffic that seems as vast as
the Nile delta.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons are easy, though: sometimes he is like a
bullfighter, planting his legs and twisting his pelvis as a van
veers through a turn inches from his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Or a baseball pitcher, glancing over his shoulder as if toward
first base, making sure pedestrians don't crowd off the curb and
into the grille of a truck. Sam Schwartz, who writes the Gridlock
Sam column for The Daily News, calls him the Beethoven of traffic
cops.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests that Joseph, 51 years old and 5 feet 2 inches
tall, stands in one place. But during a shift last week that began
at 6:45 a.m. and ended for lunch 3 1/2 hours later, when the
temperature had already climbed to 87, he stopped moving for about
10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK! That's it. Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!'' he yelled, setting a
Manhattan-bound lane of Flatbush into motion. He whistled. He
pounded his chest with his white-gloved fists. He made a gesture
like tooting a horn. Sometimes he did a disco move or dropped to
one knee like an early-70s Elvis. When drivers heeded his commands,
he put his hands together and bowed his head in a kind of
respectful prayer pose.
</P>
<P>
   When traffic began to flow, Joseph acted as if it were a
personal victory. Bouncing on his toes, he yelled: ``Yes! Go, baby,
go!''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to a driver's excitement, he routinely keeps a sharp eye
out for tiny national flags dangling from rear-view mirrors and
tries to address drivers accordingly, as in ``Good mornin',
Jamaica!'' or ``Hello, countryman!'' when he sees the flag of his
native Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the obvious question for a man who has been doing
this around the city for 16 years and on Flatbush, at one of the
city's busiest intersections, for the last two, all for $31,000 a
year, is: why?
</P>
<P>
   Joseph shrugged his shoulders. ``I don't like to be bored,'' he
said during his lunch break. ``The day would never go by.'' He also
said he loves to keep in shape and often cannot believe he is being
paid to exercise and to practice his calypso dancing for the West
Indian Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also something of the relentless ham about Joseph.
He thrives on the attention he gets working the intersection, his
stage. ``The people need a little bit of me in the morning,'' he
said. ``I am making a donation to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The public eats it up. Bryan France, a 32-year-old van driver,
always rolls down his window so he can give Joseph a shout and a 20
mph tap on the hand. ``When he's not here, everybody wants to know
where he is,'' France said last week. ``It's like not having your
coffee.''

GAY POLICY IN SAN FRANCISCO DRAWS PENALTY IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Wednesday night narrowly passed a
measure that would deny federal housing money to San Francisco
because of that city's policies supporting live-in homosexual
partners.
</P>
<P>
   By a two-vote margin, the House unexpectedly adopted the measure
after an unusually pointed debate in which the author, Rep. Frank
Riggs, R-Calif., appeared to be virtually alone in his support.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was specifically intended for San Francisco, the
only city that requires the groups it does business with to provide
benefits to the unmarried partners of their employees. Riggs'
measure would deny San Francisco about $265 million in federal
housing money because of this policy, which he said forced the
private sector to adhere to a morally objectionable policy.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs said the policy wrongly elevated unmarried homosexuals to
the same status as married heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic opponents were aghast after the measure passed, 214
to 212. Twenty-five Democrats joined 189 Republicans in voting for
it, while 178 Democrats, 33 Republicans and 1 independent opposed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, one of two Democrats
representing San Francisco, said afterward that the measure
reflected the homophobia of House Republicans. She said Republicans
pretended that the issue was protecting the private sector, but
that she knew from conversations with colleagues that it was
motivated by anti-gay and anti-lesbian sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The House also passed another measure perceived as
anti-homosexual. Proposed by Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., it would
take away $21 million from housing programs for people with AIDS
and give it to veterans. The measure was adopted 231-200.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the Riggs measure was particularly pointed, with
virtually no one rising to advocate Riggs' cause except himself.
Many opponents said it violated the prerogatives of local autonomy.
But others were more harsh. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., branded
it a witch hunt and called it ``mean-spirited, bigoted, bigoted.''
Rep. Tom Lantos, the other Democrat representing San Francisco,
called it ``a poorly disguised assault on a persecuted minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pelosi said that the passage of the two measures added to
evidence of a crusade by conservatives against homosexuals. The
measures come as conservatives have coordinated a national
campaign, including newspaper advertisements encouraging gays to go
straight, geared toward drawing their supporters to the polls in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But one Republican lawmaker worried privately that the votes
could benefit the Democrats by painting the Republicans as
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The House is to consider within a week a measure that would deny
federal money for the implementation of an executive order by
President Clinton to bar discrimination against federal employees
based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The two measures that passed on Wednesday night were part of a
larger, $94 billion spending bill that would finance veterans
affairs and housing matters in the next fiscal year, which begins
Oct. 1. That bill, which contains a host of unrelated measures,
passed on Wednesday night by a vote of 259 to 164.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the two measures is uncertain. The Senate has no
corresponding legislation, and they could easily be dropped when
the House and Senate negotiate the final spending bill they send to
the President. Clinton, who has largely supported homosexuals, is
certain to oppose the measures.

EXCERPTS FROM SPEECH BY JUSTICE THOMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BC-THOMAS-SPEECH-NYT) 
 (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the speech on Wednesday by Justice
Clarence Thomas to the annual convention of the National Bar
Association in Memphis. The speech was made available by the C-Span
cable network on its Internet site and was recorded by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   As I think back on those years I find it interesting that many
people seem to have trouble with their identities as black men.
Having had to accept my blackness in the caldron of ridicule from
some of my black schoolmates under segregation then immediately
thereafter remain secure in that identity during my years in an
all-white seminary I had few racial identity problems. I knew who I
was and needed no gimmicks to affirm my identity. Nor, might I add,
do I need anyone telling me who I am today. This is especially true
of the psychosilliness about forgetting my roots or self-hatred. If
anything, this shows that some people have too much time on their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rush today to prescribe who is black, to prescribe
what our difference is, or to ignore what our differences are. Of
course those of us who came from the rural South were different
from the blacks who came from the large northern cities such as
Philadelphia and New York. We are all black but that similarity did
not mask the richness of our differences. Indeed, one of the
advantages of growing up in a black neighborhood was that we were
richly blessed with the ability to see the individuality of each
black person with all its fullness and complexity. We saw those
differences at school, at home, at church. And definitely at the
barber shop on Saturday morning. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, it is customary to collapse, if not overwrite,
our individual characteristics into new, but now acceptable,
stereotypes. It no longer matters whether one is from urban New
York City or rural Georgia. It doesn't matter whether we came from
a highly educated family or a barely literate one. It does not
matter if you are a Roman Catholic or a Southern Baptist. All of
these differences are canceled by race and a revised set of
acceptable stereotypes have been put in place. Long gone is a time
when we opposed the notion that we all looked alike and talked
alike. Somehow we have come to exalt the new black stereotype above
all and demand conformity to that norm. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Despite some of the nonsense that has been said about me by
those who should know better and so much nonsense _ or some of
which _ subtracts from the sum total of human knowledge, despite
this all, I am a black man, an American. And my history is not
unlike that of many blacks from the Deep South. And in many ways it
is not that much different from that of many other Americans. It
goes without saying that I understand the comforts and security of
racial solidarity _ defensive or otherwise. Only those who have not
been set upon by hatred and repelled by rejection fail to
understand its attraction. As I have suggested, I have been there.
</P>
<P>
   The inverse relationship between the bold promises and the
effectiveness of the proposed solutions, the frustrations with the
so-called system, the subtle and not-so-subtle bigotry and animus
toward members of my race made radicals and nationalists of many of
us. Yes, I understand the reasons why this is attractive, but it is
precisely this in its stark form, not its present day diluted form,
that I have rejected. My question was whether as an individual I
truly believed that I was the equal of individuals who were white.
This I had answered with a resounding yes in 1964 during my
sophomore year in the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   And that answer continues to be yes. Accordingly, my words and
my deeds are consistent with this answer. Any effort, policy or
program that has as a prerequisite the acceptance of the notion
that blacks are inferior is a nonstarter with me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   This approach is also consistent with the underlying principles
of this country and the guarantees of freedom through government by
consent. I, like Frederick Douglass, believe that whites and blacks
can live together and be blended into a common nationality. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I have come here today, not in anger or to anger, though my mere
presence has been sufficient, obviously, to anger some. Nor have I
come to defend my views, but rather to assert my right to think for
myself, to refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though I was
an intellectual slave because I'm black. I come to state that I am
a man, free to think for myself and do as I please. I have come to
assert that I am a judge and I will not be consigned the
unquestioned opinions of others.

BONILLA SEASON IN DOUBT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Bobby Bonilla is eligible to come off the
disabled list today, but the real issue is whether the Dodgers
third baseman/left-fielder will play again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is upset that the Dodgers keep asking about the
condition of his surgically repaired left wrist that put him on the
DL July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, they would let me go home, set up a rehab place and
let me get better,'' Bonilla said. ``That would be best for both
parties. That's not what I want to do, but what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, 35, will have the wrist examined Friday in New York by
Dr. Charles Malone, who repaired ligament damage in the wrist last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla took batting practice Wednesday but cut it short after
complaining of pain above the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew this was going to be a problem when they traded for
me,'' Bonilla said. ``Recovery time is one year. Believe me, I want
to be out there, but I can't. Maybe the doctor will say give it one
more try. But I'm not going to be the bad guy in here.''
</P>
<P>
   All this was news to general manager Tom Lasorda, who said he
was surprised by the comments, since Bonilla appeared to be making
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked great out there,'' Lasorda said. ``How are we
supposed to know how he is doing unless we ask him? We thought he
was getting better. He was great in BP. He didn't tell us anything
was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla also is hobbled by a tender left Achilles' tendon that
also required surgery last winter. Bonilla went on the DL earlier
this season with an intestinal obstruction and was checked for
colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lasorda's official title is interim GM, the future is now
and there really is no way he is going to let Bonilla go home.
Bonilla also is earning $5.9 million this year and will also make
that in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers want Bonilla around for his clubhouse presence and
if he can give them one game-winning home run in September, the
future will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't give them that,'' he said. ``There is no bat
speed. The way I'm feeling, I can't help anyone right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching sides: Lakers guard Eddie Jones, who attended nearby
Temple University, was in the Phillies dugout before the game,
which upset Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I go to a Lakers game, I'm going to sit on the
other team's bench,'' Lasorda said.

BRYAN LOSES TO REAL, LIVE HERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Bryan's first-round match at the Mercedes-Benz Cup was more
like a scene out of some kind of Disney children's fantasy. It was
as if he woke up one day in his Camarillo bedroom and a poster of
his idol, Andre Agassi, came to life and leaped off the wall to
play a couple of sets.
</P>
<P>
   But fantasy and reality merged for a while Tuesday night at the
Los Angeles Tennis Center, as Bryan faced his childhood hero on
Center Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really nervous,'' the 20-year-old Bryan said after
losing 6-4, 6-3. ``I didn't know what to expect. I couldn't believe
I was even on the same court with the guy.... I tried not to look
over there too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before, Bryan was sitting in ``the Agassi room'' _
his old bedroom at his parents' Camarillo home _ looking up at the
20-plus posters of Agassi, whom he's followed since age 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sitting in my room looking and I saw Andre Agassi
everywhere. So it's pretty weird,'' said Bryan, who turned pro,
along with brother and doubles partner Mike, in June.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Bryan played Agassi in singles (they faced
off in doubles last year), so you could forgive the tour rookie for
being a bit awestruck. But he actually held up well, breaking
Agassi's serve in the fourth game of the first set and generally
matching the veteran's energy throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan seemed to savor every point, pumping his fists at times
and firing up the exceedingly supportive crowd, which included
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome, all the support,'' he said. ``It was like a
circus out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had kind words for his opponent, whose game he called ``a
little deceptive'' and said, ``I enjoyed playing against him
tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Goran's pain: Third-seed Goran Ivanisevic, who left the court
frustrated after being upset Tuesday by Guillame Raoux, came back
to win his doubles match in the evening. He and partner Paul
Kilderry defeated Doug Flach and Michael Tebbutt.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ivanisevic acknowledged he'd only picked up a racket
a few days before the tournament after spending most of his
post-Wimbledon time on a boat. And he said the devastating loss to
Pete Sampras in the Wimbledon final was still on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me four years to get (over losing the Wimbledon final
in) 1994, and four years before that for (losing in) 92,'' he said.
This loss was the most painful, though, ``because it was the
closest one and the best tennis ever I have played.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver update: Rod Laver, the only tennis player to win two Grand
Slams, remained in serious condition, two days after a stroke that
impaired his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Laver, who turns 60 on Aug. 9, was in the intensive-care unit at
UCLA Medical Center, where he is expected to remain for a week to
10 days. The stroke caused Laver to become weak on his right side,
but he is not paralyzed.

YANKEES FEELING GREAT, PLAYING GREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is late on a sweltering afternoon, but the New York Yankees
coolly emerge from their Edison Field clubhouse and walk onto the
field to warm up for their pre-game batting and fielding drills.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is an unmistakable swagger to these Joe Torre
Yankees, who have been winning games at a pace not even matched by
the storied Yankees of Miller Huggins in the 1920s and of Joe
McCarthy in the 1930s and of Casey Stengel in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel great, great, great,'' says Darryl Strawberry, as he
shuffles past a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   There might not be a future Hall of Fame entrant among this
Yankee group, but there are a lot of exceptional players with
experience who know how to hit, run and field and a lot of pitchers
who know how to retire opposing batsmen.
</P>
<P>
   They are cool, these Yankees, even on a stiflingly hot Orange
County day, going through their calisthenics routine with a casual
haughtiness.
</P>
<P>
   They are tranquil, these Yankees, even though they draw their
paychecks from a notoriously meddlesome owner and Bronx Zoo curator
named George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   They are subdued, these Yankees, even though they've been
turning the summer of 1998 into an epic showcase of their wonderful
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``A throwback team,'' says the Yankees' venerable bench coach,
Don Zimmer, in his 50th year of professional baseball. ``They just
go out and do the job without making a big deal out of it. They
just do the job like teams from the past did.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, standing near the batting cage, takes a moment's
break from hitting infield fungoes to talk about a team that has
been winning games at a greater rate than any other in all the
summers of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely one of the best teams I've ever seen,'' says
Zimmer, a member of the world champion Dodgers in Brooklyn in 1955
and Los Angeles in 1959. ``And, believe me, I've seen a few over
the years. Our pitching has been terrific. We just don't give up
many runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our guys care about is winning. They're very unselfish.
They don't care about personal statistics. We get a runner on
second base with no outs, and a guy will give himself up to hit the
ball to the right side to get the runner over to third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys get along as well as any team I've ever seen. Spend
some time in our clubhouse. There's a great camaraderie on this
team. Of course, winning certainly helps create such an atmosphere.
But these guys really like one another. They root for one another.
Just a wonderful team to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, ol' Popeye, one-time manager of the Chicago Cubs,
Boston Red Sox, Texas Rangers and San Diego Padres, Joe Torre's top
lieutenant since 1996, a man who has seen, heard and lived baseball
his entire adult life, is shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really burns me when I hear people say what the team has
done so far doesn't mean a thing,'' says Zimmer. ``What're they
talking about? Here we are, what, 15 games ahead of the Boston Red
Sox in our division, and that doesn't count? What if we were behind
by 15 games? What this team has done so far has been absolutely
amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know anything can happen in a short playoff series. We can
catch some hot pitcher, and get shut out. I know we aren't a cinch
to make it to the World Series. There are no cinches in baseball.
I've been around long enough to realize that. But we're still
having an amazing season. And it's really been a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the Yankee dugout, Joe Torre is holding court
with reporters, telling them what a luxury it is to have five
quality starting pitchers, David Cone, David Wells, Andy Pettitte,
Hideki Irabu and Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez, to go with a
dependable reliever, Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry is now in the outfield shagging fly balls.
Derek Jeter is playing catch on the sidelines. Tino Martinez is
taking his batting practice swings. So is Tim Raines. So is Scott
Brosius. Paul O'Neill is stretching near the cage.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees go about their business quietly, efficiently and
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   No horeseplay.
</P>
<P>
   No loud banter.
</P>
<P>
   No goofing around.
</P>
<P>
   No frills.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys amaze me a little more every day,'' says Zimmer.
``We're down near where I live in Tampa Bay recently, and we wind
up winning four games and each night I'd go home to my house and
think to myself, `How'd we win that game?' Tampa Bay got some good
pitching, but somehow we won every game. This team just knows how
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would go on to win on this evening, too, as David
Cone's pitching and 14 New York hits would be enough to squelch the
Anaheim Angels by a 9-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer is right, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Anything can happen in a brief playoff series, and has across
the fickle seasons of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But at this juncture, these New York Yankees are on a merry romp
in a dream season of constant glory and applause.

CLARENCE THOMAS RESPONDS ANGRILY TO HIS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to fix quote and for rewriting) (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ In an explosion of pent-up resentment, Justice
Clarence Thomas on Wednesday vigorously attacked his critics, both
black and white, saying they had racist views because they had been
unable to accept the notion that he was able to think for himself.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ``refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as
though I was an intellectual slave because I'm black.'' He spoke to
an audience of nearly 2,000 black judges and lawyers. His critics,
he said, have subjected him to particularly ``bilious and venomous
assaults'' because his conservative views and judicial opinions
since he joined the Supreme Court in 1991 do not conform to what is
expected of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   His critics, Thomas said, have engaged in what he called silly
speculation that he must be taking his cues and ideas from other
conservative justices who are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could be the explanation when I fail to follow their
ideology or anti-intellectual prescription,'' he said. ``The stench
of racial inferiority still confounds my olfactory nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that such views were racist because they were based
on the idea that he would be unable to formulate such views for
himself and that he did not have a right to such opinions, because
he is black.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' deeply complicated and troubled relationship with his
fellow black Americans was on vivid public display in his
appearance before the annual convention of the National Bar
Association, the nation's largest group of black lawyers. It was an
event to which he had been invited months ago, only to have a large
and prominent group of members try to have the invitation
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end he accepted the invitation with alacrity, even though
he knew he would confront an audience with many critics.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Thomas generally confined his public speeches
to small and friendly audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience of nearly 2,000 that it had become a
wearisome ritual that when he is invited to speak publicly, people
seek to deny him that opportunity. But he suggested his acceptance
of Wednesday's invitation was like when he was younger and ``tired
of turning the other cheek.'' As for those who have said he has
forgotten his black roots, he said they were engaging in
``psychosilliness'' and probably had too much time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Although his delivery was calm, his words Wednesday were harsher
than ever before. At one point he said his critics were
``illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Thomas said, ``Despite some of the
nonsense that has been said about me, I am a man, I am a black man,
I am an American.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Isn't it time to move on? To be angry with me solves
no problems.'' About half of the audience applauded, some standing,
while the other half remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the speech, several hundred lawyers and judges
went into an adjoining room to hear Thomas' critics analyze his
work and compare him unfavorably to the man he replaced on the
court, Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, former chief judge of the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Philadelphia, and one of Thomas' most
consistent critics, said Thomas was deceptive in his speech
Wednesday. He had said his critics purposely misinterpreted his
dissent in a 1992 case in which he wrote that it was not a
violation of the Constitution's proscription against ``cruel and
unusual punishment'' when a black prisoner was beaten by guards. He
described the injuries as minor, but Higginbotham said the shackled
prisoner was beaten so badly his dental plate was broken, his lips
were burst and some teeth were loosened.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham had argued before Wednesday's event that it was a
mistake to have Thomas be the bar association's keynote speaker
because that would bestow an undeserved honor on someone whose
rulings on the court ``have done more to turn back the clock of
racial progress than any other African-American public official in
the history of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Bernette Johnson, a member of the Louisiana Supreme
Court and chairwoman of the association's judicial council, who had
first invited Thomas, said she knew the selection would be
controversial. But Ms. Johnson said she did not view extending the
invitation as an honor to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she said, ``it gives us a chance to interact with a
Supreme Court justice and dialogue is always good.''
</P>
<P>
   But like most of those who supported the invitation, Ms. Johnson
said she disagreed strongly with Thomas' views and his writings on
the Supreme Court. ``I'm not an apologist for him,'' she said.
``I'm just saying he has a right to say what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Bar Association opposed Thomas' confirmation to the
court when he was nominated in 1991, largely over his conservative
views and outspoken opposition to affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas offered a fervent defense of his views against
affirmative action programs Wednesday, saying such programs are
inevitably based on black inferiority and are ``non-starters in my
view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe kneeling is a position of strength,'' he
said, ``and I do not believe that begging is an effective tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' opponents have said his views on affirmative action are
particularly galling since he was a major beneficiary of such
programs, including his admission to Yale Law School under a
program in which a number of places were set aside for minority
students. Keith Watters, a Washington lawyer and a former president
of the National Bar Association, said he decided at the last minute
to picket the speech outside the hotel because he found Thomas'
views so hypocritical.

PHILLIES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Last season, Gary Sheffield watched the Florida
Marlins grow into a World Series champion. He's not quite sure what
he's seeing in this year's Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   One night after an impressive victory to open this long East
Coast road trip, Sheffield was left to count the Dodger mistakes
that led to Wednesday's 8-3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in
front of 20,127 at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, the team's only All-Star, wasn't so bothered that the
Dodgers had a chance to move ahead of the Phillies in the wild card
race. There still are two months left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   He is more concerned that the team on the field might not have
the character to make a late-season surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not something you build; that is something you have,''
said Sheffield, who hit his 19th homer in the fourth. ``I don't
know all the young guys that we have here. But tonight was a
frustrating loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield never mentioned them by name, but he was speaking
about rookie third baseman Adrian Beltre, second-year shortstop
Juan Castro and second-year second baseman Wilton Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, promoted from Double-A last month, had a single and
double in his first two at-bats, but also had three defensive
lapses that kept Phillies rallies alive.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero had two hits, but was thrown out at the plate in the
third inning when he failed to slide and touch home after being
blocked off by rookie catcher Bobby Estalella.
</P>
<P>
   Castro misplayed a third-inning grounder into the Phillies first
run.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero killed a Dodger rally and Beltre helped keep alive the
Phillies four-run fourth and three-run sixth that decided the game.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't help that the Dodgers were overmatched by rookie
right-hander Carlton Loewer (5-3), who has been in the big leagues
less than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Beltre, Castro and Guerrero raised the question whether the
team now is putting the kids in a position to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I don't know the youngsters here that well,''
Sheffield said. ``They have stepped up to help, but we seem to be
lacking the concentration in the middle of the game to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The job of getting to the post-season has been the focus of new
general manager Tom Lasorda, who continues to search for pitching
in the final days before Friday's trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The same Toronto media outlet that said Eric Young had been
traded to Toronto for right-hander Juan Guzman said Wednesday the
Dodgers had completed a deal for Montreal left-hander Carlos Perez.
That also didn't happen, but the clubs are still talking.
</P>
<P>
   But Lasorda also has to address the rest of the team. Beltre's
blunders came after the man he replaced, Bobby Bonilla, said early
Wednesday it might be best to take off the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is eligible to return from the disabled list today, but
his surgically repaired left wrist hurts more than it has in weeks.
(See related story.)
</P>
<P>
   In some corners of the clubhouse there are concerns the team is
rushing Beltre, who entered the game batting .202 (19 for 94) with
two homers and 10 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman met with Beltre before the game to
make sure the 20-year-old's confidence hasn't wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team still is pretty banged up, but we may be getting
some help,'' said Young, who will test his strained left thigh
today and hopes to come off the DL on Friday in New York. ``These
kids have gotten us back in this thing. But now we need to give
them some help.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get it from right-hander Dave Mlicki (5-5), who lost
for the first time as a Dodger. Bobby Abreu opened Mlicki's fourth
and final inning with a home run, and Doug Glanville later had a
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The inning was kept alive on a wild throw by Beltre on Gregg
Jefferies that the official scorer ruled a hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Beltre bobbled Estalella's grounder helping two
more runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a better job protecting these guys,'' Sheffield
said. ``Last year we had (Edgar) Renteria and (Craig) Counsell.
(Manager) Jim Leyland told them just to take care of the defense
and the older guys would do the rest. He drummed it into them so
much that when the season was on the line they were ready.''

IT'S TIME TO WHEEL AND DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They came in bragging about the left side of their infield. They
will leave talking about the right side.
</P>
<P>
   They came in comfortable with their top two starters. That duo -
Andy Benes and Willie Blair - has produced 26 losses in 46 starts.
</P>
<P>
   They came in with illusions of becoming the prototype for all
expansion teams. In the end, they will settle for baby steps.
</P>
<P>
   And that just about sums up the plight of the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever brings fans out to the ballpark, that's what's
important,`' Manager Buck Showalter said. ``As we grow as an
organization, hopefully we'll give them a little more to cheer
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. And because contention must wait until the next
millennium, because Rupert Murdoch will throw around crazy money to
win in Los Angeles, because the trading deadline is less than 48
hours away, some more unsolicited advice: Make some moves. Find
some kids who might blossom in a few years. Take advantage of
organizations that have spent decades stocking their farm systems.
</P>
<P>
   Trade Gregg Olson. The veteran has been a wonderful surprise,
converting 17 of 20 save opportunities. But his market value will
never be this high. Closers are in demand, especially in Atlanta,
where Mark Wohlers requires two catchers. Wohlers couldn't pitch
for the now-defunct Peppers, and the Braves are getting worried.
Deal Olson now or be like the Suns, a team that waited too long to
peddle Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Talk Benes out of his no-trade clause and trade him to the
Giants or the Cubs. Benes is a nice guy. Too nice, in fact. A guy
who often makes that one pitch to lose a game. The Cubs were
interested in Benes in the off-season, but only for a one-year
deal. Now, Jeremi Gonzalez is done for the season. The Cubs need
another quality starter if they're going anywhere. And Wednesday's
trade for Matt Karchner will be met with a yawn in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Trade Devon White. He's the perfect hired assassin, a guy who
collects World Series jewelry. He has three rings and is enjoying
his best season in seven years. Not many contending teams need a
center fielder, but someone has to be interested. Besides, he's
only keeping the grass warm until Bernie Williams arrives next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Trade Jorge Fabregas, if possible. Damian Miller and Kelly
Stinnett can get it done. Besides, a mysterious fungus has once
again eaten a hole in the bat of Fabregas, a guy who will earn $1.8
million next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're evaluating a lot of scenarios,'' Showalter said. ''I'll
leave that in Joe (Garagiola Jr.'s) hands. He's been pretty busy.
Obviously, since we haven't done anything so far, it hasn't been
anything that's been in our long-term interest. But we'll see what
the next two days bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't believe for a moment that the future of the
organization rests in the hands of Joe Junior. He, too, is a very
nice man, but a guy who has been out of the game for a long time, a
guy who is more general than manager.
</P>
<P>
   In all probability, Showalter is playing Whitey Herzog, an
arduous and dangerous task. As good a field boss as Showalter is -
easily among the top five in the game - no manager should serve as
his own GM.
</P>
<P>
   A manager needs a foil, someone to play devil's advocate,
someone to study other organizations on a daily basis. But that is
a story for another day.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of hope have emerged at BOB. If not the next Rusty Greer,
David Dellucci has become an overachieving fan favorite. Travis Lee
is a stud with training wheels. While currently enduring his first
freshman hazing, Danny Klassen will soon be a fixture at shortstop.
Matt Williams is a wonderful leader. Brian Anderson is a keeper.
Andy Fox might be the team's MVP. Even Karim Garcia is showing some
patience at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Time to add more pieces for the future. Which is the only thing
left to accomplish this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The rumors have been rampant, but the big
trades in baseball have not happened. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   The non-waiver trading deadline is 9 p.m. Friday, leaving teams
like the Angels only hours to get what they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around enough teams to know that on the night of the
31st, some things will happen that you don't expect,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``And there may be deals that fall
through. I don't worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a good example. Texas thought (Ivan) Rodriguez
was going to go and they needed a catcher. So we got Kenny Hill (in
exchange for Jim Leyritz). We had no idea that was going to happen,
it just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Angels need is a starting pitcher, and their best bets
now are the Cardinals' Todd Stottlemyre and the Royals' Tim
Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   Unexiting streak: Outfielder Garret Anderson broke Rod Carew's
club record for longest hitting streak, getting a double in the
second inning Wednesday night against the Yankees and extending his
streak to 26 games. Carew set the previous record of 25 in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said before the game he wasn't overly excited about
the streak.

   ``The only thing it says is that I'm more consistent,'' said
Anderson, who graduated from Kennedy High. ``But over a period of
time, you can hit the ball hard and they may not fall your way. Or
you can hit little chinks that fall in. You can't explain it, so I
try not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson admitted he didn't expect to have a streak go this
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time about a week, week-and-a-half ago that I
thought it would end sooner or later,'' he said. ``Now I'm at the
point where if it happens, it happens. It's nice to do some things
in your career. But for the most part it wears on you.''

<P>
   McDowell, Hill rehabs: Pitcher Jack McDowell (elbow) will make a
rehab start for Single-A Lake Elsinore at High Desert tonight. He
has been given a 60-pitch limit.
</P>
<P>
   Hill (elbow) will pitch two simulated games before making a
rehab assignment of his own sometime next week. If the Angels can't
make a deal for a starting pitcher, the return of Hill becomes
vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be big for us, a big lift,'' Collins said. ``We sit
here and talk about all the possibilities, and Kenny Hill would be
a good deal for us again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' condition: The Yankees' Chili Davis has begun a rehab
assignment in the minor leagues, and when he is ready to come back,
he'll get most of the at-bats at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   That means fewer at-bats for current DH Darryl Strawberry, who
hit his team-leading 17th homer in the second inning Wednesday.
Yankees manager Joe Torre said he anticipates no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Straw came here in '96, he's never been anything but
`When you need me, I'll be ready,' '' Torre said.

PLAYERS SIGN FOR TRUE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
 INDUSTRY-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On more than one occasion, New York Yankees shortstop Derek
Jeter has found himself darting in and out of traffic on the
heavily congested FDR Drive that loops around Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter does not fancy himself any kind of Speed Racer. It's just
that fans have been known to follow the star shortstop to his
Manhattan apartment, wanting to chase down an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can definitely be a scary situation,'' Jeter said. ``The
FDR is not an easy road to maneuver in and out of. But I have no
way of knowing what those people's intentions are. You have to be
careful, and that not only goes for New York but anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of autograph hunting is both impressive and scary.
</P>
<P>
   What could easily be described 25 years ago as a cute hobby for
children has evolved into a $100 million industry in which the
proverbial ugly head is rearing with more frequency.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon to see fans screaming, veins popping out in
their necks, as they try to get the attention of a player before
the start of any major league baseball game. Many players are
accommodating to many fans. But leave one out and the player is
likely to be called all sorts of names, most of them obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams signed autographs for
nearly 20 minutes before a recent game, putting his name on trading
cards, balls or slips of paper at least 100 times. But when
Williams had to walk away to warm up before the game, he left
several fans disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   One of those went so far as to send a terse letter up the
Diamondbacks' chain of command, starting with Manager Buck
Showalter and heading up the ladder to General Manager Joe
Garagiola Jr. and managing general partner Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players tend to feel like it's never enough,'' Showalter said.
``As a player, it's not a battle you can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' worst scenarios exist when their clubs are on the
road, leaving them more vulnerable. The autograph hounds somehow
find out which hotels house the visiting clubs in every city.
</P>
<P>
   Even though nearly all of the hotels now prohibit autograph
signing on the premises, they cannot stop the seekers from huddling
outside the hotel's doors, where sometimes hundreds camp out as
long as 16 hours a day waiting for the chance to get a player's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't always sign for everybody,'' Chicago Cubs All-Star
Sammy Sosa said. ``I do as much as possible. In situations that get
out of hand, I try to control them as much as possible. I sign for
everyone, especially if I know it's for a personal collection. You
can tell which ones want it for themselves and which ones want it
to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where one of the players' biggest problems lies. Almost
universally, they agree that they do not mind signing for the fan,
young or old, who truly wants to add the signature to a prized
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're older or more mature, they can ask me just as
easily as a kid can,'' Baltimore Orioles All-Star second baseman
Roberto Alomar said. ``I realize it's not only kids who collect
autographs. Young fans grow up to be old fans. They should be able
to ask for our autographs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I've always enjoyed meeting and talking to people,
so I don't mind signing for anyone. The only request I make is, if
I'm having dinner, they wait until after I finish. There's a time
for asking. The problem is, it hasn't always been polite fans who
ask. We're human beings, even though we are celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest objection players have is with the dealers who
deceive in trying to acquire an autograph. With the growing sales
in the autographed memorabilia business has come the obvious side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers, who can peddle superstar autographs for hundreds
and sometimes thousands of dollars, go to great lengths to get
players to sign. In a disturbingly growing trend, dealers now hire
children, as young as 7 or 8, to plead with a player for a
signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it where I sign a baseball card and see a kid walk
over to a grown-up and exchange it for a $5 or $10 bill,'' Anaheim
Angels closer Troy Percival said. ``It's really sad to see that
happen because I really enjoy signing for kids, especially the ones
who get really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are also the children who line up at a hotel's
doors at 3 or 4 in the morning, waiting for the incoming club to
check in after a late-night flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sign in hotels anymore,'' said San Diego's perennial
All-Star right fielder Tony Gwynn. ``I'll sign before and after
games at the stadium only. I get people knocking on my hotel doors,
sliding things under the door with a note to leave them at the
front desk. I've had people yell at me, `You fat so and so, who do
you think you are?' It's a no-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn recalled a scenario where a teenage boy wearing an old New
York Yankees cap got Gwynn's autograph on a card. Ten minutes
later, after a quick makeover that included flipping the cap
backwards and the addition of sunglasses, the boy was back asking
for another autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I already signed for you,' '' Gwynn said. ``He
insisted he hadn't gotten an autograph. I'm older, but I remember
faces, especially a old Yankees cap. You never see those.''
</P>
<P>
   Autograph hunting will not go away soon. If anything, it's
become much more aggressive. Where it's headed, no one knows for
sure, but it seems as if players have been forced to be on the
defensive more than at any other time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just have to say no,'' said Seattle center
fielder Ken Griffey Jr., whose autograph can command hundreds of
dollars. ``I hate to do it, but I'd be there forever if I started
signing while I'm out in public. You wouldn't believe the names
I've been called. I know you couldn't print them in a newspaper.'' &QL;

AGING STARS' STATISTICS FAR FROM GOLDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 By JEFF CADE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time for Cal Ripken to quit. And Wade Boggs, too, for that
matter. I wonder if they could even land a job in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   Both play third base, a position that teams rely on for home
runs and RBIs, or if not either of those, a very high batting
average. You have to bring something more than just your glove and
guile to the park. And they don't. They have outlived their
usefulness, and that is tarnishing their status as the
standard-bearers for that position that they once were.
</P>
<P>
   And if they do go, they can take Paul Molitor, Joe Carter and
Harold Baines with them. Since that bunch can't become left-handed
pitchers, then it's time for them to depart while they still enjoy
star status.
</P>
<P>
   As a fan, it almost hurts to say all this. But as a fantasy
owner, hey, it's good riddance. Nobody wants Ripken's 600 at-bats,
.250 average, 12 homers and 60 RBIs. And those marks will only
diminish next season _ except for the at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken has had his run. He's broken his records. Now, he should
step aside. &QL;  &QL; 
Don't believe 'em &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With everyone so involved in all the trade talk, it looks as if
somebody forgot to let the trade genie out of the lamp.
</P>
<P>
   If Estaban Loaiza, Doug Jones, Joe Carter and Jose Mesa are the
biggest and only deals to happen since the breakup of the Marlins,
then baseball insiders everywhere have been way off track. (I'm no
insider, I'm just off track.)
</P>
<P>
   And all that fretting over all those other future free agents
went for nothing, because nobody could pull the trigger. Either
that, or the insiders were wrong all along. (Imagine that.)
</P>
<P>
   There could be an 11th-hour trading frenzy. The Devil Rays would
be nuts not to find a new home for Boggs, Fred McGriff or David
Martinez, all of whom have some stretch-run value and are too old
to keep. Ditto for Todd Zeile and John Cangelosi in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn seems intent on being a Blue Jay next season. And get
a load of this reaction _ ``I can't see where he'd fit in, what
with (Carlos) Delgado, (Jose) Canseco and myself here,'' said
Toronto DH Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say, ``So long, Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   A few new blips on the trade radar screen has the Rangers
getting Royce Clayton and Todd Stottlemyre from the Cardinals.
Heaven knows what the Rangers have to deal in return. It'd take a
bit more than Darren Oliver, I'd say.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious place for Stottlemyre is with the Yankees, where he
could join his dad, Mel, who is the pitching coach. That could
allow the Yankees to put Orlando Hernandez into the setup role. But
Stottlemyre has not pitched effectively for weeks now. &QL;  &QL; 
Set in stone &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In any event, by now you have either made your move or you
haven't. The trade deadline is tomorrow in real baseball. Your
league's deadline may vary, but for the most part your team is set
in stone. &QL;  &QL; 
Love that loophole &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week passed its bill to ban betting on the
Internet but luckily left a little loophole for Rotisserie and
fantasy league players to take advantage of the stat services that
are available online. &QL;  &QL;

TEAM PATIENT WITH KLASSEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rookie second baseman, as baseball folks say, is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   And that might be putting it mildly, considering that Danny
Klassen has only four hits in his past 29 at bats and has struck
out in 11 straight games while committing two of his five errors in
21 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter is reluctant to sit him
down for a mental adjustment, although he did replace Klassen with
veteran Andy Stankiewicz on Wednesday night as part of a
sixth-inning double switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I told him in Houston when he first came up, this
isn't a tryout camp or something,'' Showalter said. ``He's someone
we think highly of and we're going to give him an opportunity. All
young players go through periods where they struggle and look bad
at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about resting him, but right now the advantages
of him playing, growing and seeing situations, ballparks and
pitchers outweigh it. If he started making the same mistakes over
and over, it's one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's overmatched at the plate. He's hit some
balls hard the last two or three nights, but right at people. It
takes a lot for a young player to get into the flow where he
relaxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for Showalter's patience is he wants to see how
Klassen handles the adversity. He hit .345 in his first 10 games
but has seen his average drop to .215 in the past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night he made an error and came back and turned a
tough double play on the next hitter,'' Showalter said. ``That's an
encouraging thing to see. A lot of young players will wallow around
in self-pity.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Setup man &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who are expected to finalize another trade today,
dealt promising minor league starter John Garland, 18, across town
to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for veteran relief pitcher
Matt Karchner.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, the Cubs' first selection in the 1997 draft, was 4-7
with a 5.03 ERA in 19 starts at Class-A Rockford this year, while
Karchner, 30, was 2-4 with 11 saves in 15 chances and a 5.15 ERA
for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably an area that was our Number 1 concern,
to get some help down there to set up (closer) Rod Beck,'' Cubs
Manager Jim Riggleman said. &QL; 
Extra bases &QL; 
Showalter said the Diamondbacks will be without reliever Bobby
Chouinard for today's series-ending game against Chicago. Chouinard
and his wife, Erica, were to have their first child after doctors
induced labor late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Relief pitcher Clint Sodowsky underwent a magnetic resonance
image Wednesday for possible tendinitis in the shoulder of his
throwing arm but will be available today.
</P>
<P>
   The team changed its rehabilitation timetable for third baseman
Matt Williams. Instead of playing in Tucson tonight and Friday, he
will workout with the Diamondbacks today and play in Tucson on
Friday and Saturday before rejoining the team Sunday in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   When Sammy Sosa hit the first grand slam of his career Monday
night, he dispatched a dugout attendant to the center-field seats
to negotiate the return of the ball. The price he paid was an
autographed bat. &QL;

LOS ANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICT CRITICIZED IN TAINTED LAND BUYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Deborah Sullivan contributed to this
story.) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Unified School District's practice
of building some new campuses on contaminated former industrial
sites has been sharply questioned by a state legislative audit.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a Joint Legislative Audit Committee investigation
released Wednesday, found that the district's environmental
analysis and cleanup at newly built Jefferson Middle School was
seriously deficient _ an issue of growing importance with 51 new
schools planned, some of them on toxic sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAUSD may be, in some cases, acquiring urban land for new
school construction based on political expedience, while
disregarding the environmental costs and health risks associated
with the cleanup of polluted land,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, who heads the audit
committee, said the district's history of failing to adequately
identify and sanitize contaminated property is particularly
troubling since L.A. Unified has embarked on a campaign to build 51
more schools within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is cause for major concern,'' Wildman said. ``Kids need
to be safe. If the LAUSD's internal problems of handling
environmental problems are not addressed, then they need to be
addressed by the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Niccum, the district's real estate and asset management
branch director, said there is contamination at two of the 10 sites
the district has bought or is acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   Niccum said that in a congested urban area, choices for new
school sites are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your options are sites where there are homes, apartments,
businesses or factories _ there aren't any strawberry fields or
orange groves as options,'' he said. ``You're left with the need to
build a school. You have to make one of those tough choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Niccum directed calls about environmental problems to the
district's environmental health and safety branch. Dianne Doi,
acting head of the division, said she could not answer questions
about the report's safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the audit committee bolsters allegations made by a
former environmental director for the district _ who was fired
Tuesday _ that the Los Angeles Unified School District does not
conduct adequate environmental studies on its properties and fails
to properly clean up the land.
</P>
<P>
   And the report said district officials did not tell the state
allocation board about toxic problems when they sought funding for
the Jefferson Middle School site, which is still undergoing an
intensive hazardous cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Land at the new sites for South Gate High School and Tweedy
Elementary School is highly toxic, containing chemicals, gasoline,
solvents, pesticides and metals, and will require ``meaningful
remediation,'' district officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education President Victoria Castro said environmental
problems were expected in South Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it's possible to clean the land,'' Castro said.
``As we proceed with the 51 schools, the public needs a much
clearer understanding of the process. We need to follow what's
happening and make sure they're clean and don't put children in
unhealthy situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But board member Barbara Boudreaux said the district should look
for other properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district should not buy contaminated land. There are
enough parcels out there. We shouldn't have to deal with this,''
said Boudreaux, whose district includes the environmentally
troubled Jefferson Middle School in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreaux said she didn't learn of the contamination problems
until this week. District documents show the board had been
apprised of the problems at Tweedy in August and South Gate in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Farleigh, campaign director of the environmental group
CalPIRG, said cleanup of toxic sites may be possible, depending on
the types of chemicals and level of contamination. However, she
said, a safer option would be to avoid them entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are systems in place that do result in safe cleanup of
toxic sites,'' Farleigh said. ``However, I feel that the LAUSD has
not done a sufficient job of looking at the chemicals that are
already at the site, and of looking at all the options for building
elsewhere. At some of them it may be possible to clean it up, but
why take that risk?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the funding for new schools will come from Proposition
BB, and members of a citizens oversight committee said using bond
money for toxic land is probably not cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remediation costs can often exceed land costs,'' said Steve
Soboroff, chairman of the committee. ``We need to stretch bond
dollars, and buying contaminated land isn't a great way to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit report included testimony from the San Diego Unified
School District's business services director, who said that
district has been able to build all of its new schools without
buying contaminated land or condemning property.
</P>
<P>
   Wildman began investigating the district last year, looking into
the district's construction of the controversial Belmont Learning
Complex, whose costs _ nearing $200 million _ make it the most
expensive high school in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation has expanded to include construction projects
districtwide, as well as real estate acquisition.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ A Cardinals fan showed up at training camp one day
carrying a life-size likeness of Troy Aikman. He lay the cardboard
cutout on the practice field, with written instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stomp Dallas,'' the sign read.
</P>
<P>
   Several Cardinals did, some with glee.
</P>
<P>
   Not Jake Plummer. When Jake saw Troy at his feet, smiling up at
him, he sidestepped the cardboard effigy. The courtesy spoke of his
respect for a fellow quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer knows how it feels to be flat on your back, outnumbered
by the enemy. Last year in Texas Stadium, the Cowboys sacked the
Cardinals rookie eight times.
</P>
<P>
   A week later against New York, he went down eight times again.
</P>
<P>
   But Plummer kept getting up, and if you ask him at what point
last season he realized he can do it _ when he told himself, ``I
can play in this league'' _ he will tell you that the dawning began
that gray November day in Giants Stadium when he kept pulling
himself off the turf and threw for 388 yards, an NFL rookie record.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, the critical letters stopped arriving at the
newspaper. The ones that said Plummer is a media creation. The ones
that said Plummer is overrated. The ones that argued Kent Graham
should be the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   I kept one letter. The author berated the Cardinals for putting
in a ``boy to do a man's job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals can be faulted. They should have played Jake
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he made mistakes. Plenty of them. ``For every good moment,
I'd make a bonehead play that brought me back to earth,'' Plummer
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Third down was an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head would be spinning sometimes,'' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had no running game. The offensive line leaked.
Often times, when the quarterback peered across the line, the
defenders looked like movie Indians on a ridge. Seven, eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers sacked him 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept getting up. If his psyche was bruised, he didn't
show it. Plummer looks relaxed and confident going into his second
season. Sounds confident, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about the sophomore jinx?'' a radio guy asked.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer fixed him with a flat gaze. ``You think that's a good
question?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't,'' Jake replied.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Trestman likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake has tremendous leadership qualities,'' said the new
offensive coordinator, who coached Bernie Kosar and Steve Young.
Trestman talks about his Young-like ``escapability'' and Kosar-like
intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   He is still learning the new offense. The other part of the job
_ public relations _ he has down pat.
</P>
<P>
   They wait for him, patiently, merchandise in hand. Practice
over, the crowd engulfs him. He begins signing whatever they hold
out to him.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man edged next to Plummer. Jake draped an arm around
him, as if they are old friends. They smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two best-looking guys on the field,'' the man's wife said, as
she snapped the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Is it like this every day?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day,'' Plummer said, patiently, head down, scribbling
away.
</P>
<P>
   Do you get tired of it? Of course he does. I asked the question
anyway, to see what he would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. The fans are great. We're glad they're here. We really
need their support.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches have left the field. His teammates are gone, headed
for the dining hall. No. 16 stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for him are high. Perhaps unrealistically high. But
it's fun watching him grow into the job. The Cardinals haven't had
a player this popular since they moved to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer looked up. ``More'' new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's biggest tourist attraction south of the Grand Canyon
gave a playful smile and asked, ``Is there a bus that keeps
dropping people off here?'' &QL;

LITTLE AL'S BACK AT INDY  
 FORMER 500 WINNER SETTLES FOR IROC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Little Al is not so little anymore. And not
nearly as young.
</P>
<P>
   At age 36, Al Unser Jr. no longer is the skinny pipsqueak that
20 years ago needed two telephone books to see over the hoods of
his midget and sprint cars.
</P>
<P>
   He is an adult. And he now sees things more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   What Unser sees most is a dream that may never come true again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Unser won his first Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he won again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, a year after Unser's second greatest triumph, he
unceremoniously failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the feud separating the Championship Auto Racing
Teams circuit and the rival Indy Racing League, formed three years
ago by Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony George, Unser
hasn't been back. Not in a race car, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In May, during qualifying for the Indy 500, Unser returned to
offer support to cousins Johnny and Robby Unser. When the crowd
near Gasoline Alley and along pit road spotted Little Al, they
roared, begging him to return.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly three months later, Unser has returned. He, along
with 11 other drivers, will compete Friday in the first-ever
International Race of Champions event at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway, which a day later will be the site of the NASCAR Winston
Cup Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   But the IROC series is not even close to what those Indy-car
fans in May had in mind when they stood and cheered for one of
racing's most heralded drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And, really, the IROC circuit is not what Unser had in mind,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was there in May, the overwhelming response the fans
gave me meant a lot,'' Unser said. ``It got me emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather be coming back in the open wheelers. The last
time I drove a race around that place, it was a long time ago. And
I missed the show. I just wish I could be going back in a champ
(Indy) car.''
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, it likely won't happen soon, thanks to the CART
vs. IRL rift, which keeps growing wider by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been rumors that Unser and his dad,
four-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser, who, ironically, is an IRL
driver coach, might form an IRL team, Little Al scoffs at the
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no validity to it,'' Unser said.
</P>
<P>
   So for the moment, Unser must be satisfied with driving a
Pontiac Firebird IROC car. And nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to Indianapolis, but I don't think I want
it as bad as say, Michael Andretti, who's never won, or Scott
Pruett or Jimmy Vasser,'' Unser said. ``These guys grew up in
America and their whole life dream was to get to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They earned the right to drive the top cars in the top series
in the nation and whammo, all of a sudden, they don't get to drive
in the Indy 500. It's a real shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I not won it, I'd be really heartbroken right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there remains an emptiness inside Unser. He believes the
Indy 500 has lost its lustre and its magic, denigrated to the point
where he almost pities what it's become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Mears put it really good,'' Unser said. ``He wears the
Indy 500 ring on his finger, and so do I. We're proud of it because
when we won the race. It was a race. It was something. Now it's
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something missing at the Speedway during the month of
May. It's Alex Zanardi, Jimmy Vasser, Bobby Rahal, Michael
(Andretti). All the teams and the big major sponsors weren't there.
You could definitely notice something was missing. It's a real
shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, we (raced in it) when it was a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Unser dare utter those words to George, a longtime friend?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to tell him,'' Unser said. ``He knows (what the
Indy 500 has become). He wants us back bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Unser, Little Al's wife, says it would be impossible for
her husband to let go of Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really does play on his mind an awful lot,'' said
Shelley, who attended Camelback High School and met her husband at
Manzanita Speedway. ``I think it's because the whole (Unser) family
heritage, aside from Pikes Peak (annual hill climb), came from
their success at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   `I mean, it's like you weren't anybody in the family unless you
won Indy. When Al finally won, it's like he finally got respect
from his Uncle Bobby (Unser, who won three times), who used to
tease him. All his childhood memories are about Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think it's been real hard for him because of that. And
it's like he's caught in the middle because he finally got a job
driving for the man (Roger Penske) he always wanted to drive for
and Tony being his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank, God, he won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley also believes her husband's return to Indy in the IROC
series won't be near the tonic some might think it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be emotional for him, but not as emotional as it would
be if he were in a champ car,'' she said. ``It's a different kind
of emotion. It's almost like it will make it worse. I think he
might feel awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Unser feels, it surely won't be near the emotion he
would feel should he one day again line up on the starting grid in
an Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Indianapolis 500 wants to have (CART's) top
drivers and their top sponsors,'' Unser said. ``It's the most
popular series in the world. Who wouldn't want to be part of that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Unser concedes it likely will be a long wait. Too long,
maybe. &QL;

RANGERS' OLIVER RECOVERS HIS FORM IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 JAYS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ General manager Doug Melvin acknowledged Wednesday
that his attempts to strengthen the Rangers' rotation appear to be
losing steam.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, left-hander Darren Oliver, the rotation's caboose and
subject of trade speculation with tomorrow's deadline approaching,
returned his off-the-tracks season between the rails.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who recorded an out in the seventh inning for only the
sixth time in 19 starts this season, helped the Rangers right their
four-game losing streak in Wednesday night's 9-6 victory against
the Toronto Blue Jays at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver (6-7) allowed only two earned runs in his 61/3 innings
and departed with an 8-3 lead after inducing a ground-ball
fielder's choice from Blue Jays center fielder Shannon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's there,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``There's no doubt in my mind about that. I've seen him do it
before, and I know he can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' expectations for an American League West title
demand it, and the left-hander responded to the challenge by
minimizing the Blue Jays' first-inning threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big inning there,'' said Oliver, who entered
Wednesday night's appearance with a 6.77 earned-run average. ``That
could have been a three-run inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart drew a one-out walk and advanced to second on the first
of the Blue Jays' three stolen bases in the inning. Stewart scored
the game's first run on a single by Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado advanced Canseco 90 feet with an infield single,
and both runners moved up another base through a successful double
steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my fault,'' Oliver said of the three first-inning
stolen bases, ``for not paying them enough attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, though, caught the attention of designated hitter Mike
Stanley by recording the first of only two strikeouts with a 3-2
fastball. Oliver later induced an inning-ending ground ball from
Tony Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and Oliver later overcame a second-inning throwing
error by shortstop Kevin Elster that led to two unearned runs and a
3-1 deficit. Blue Jays right-hander Chris Carpenter (6-5) issued
four walks in the third inning, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez made it
costly with a three-run double that made the score 4-3, giving the
Rangers a lead that never would be relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Dave Stieb, whom Melvin expressed interest in
before the Rangers purchased right-hander Todd Van Poppel from
Triple-A Oklahoma, replaced Carpenter for the fourth inning and
surrendered three consecutive run-scoring hits to Luis Alicea,
Rusty Greer and Roberto Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who responded to the five-run advantage by allowing only
two hits and two walks in the next four innings, utilized all three
pitches _ fastball, curveball and changeup _ effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched even better than his line,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates replaced Oliver after Stewart's seventh-inning at-bat with
Canseco scheduled to bat. Oliver's pitch count and the potential
matchup made it a wise choice. Oliver's pitch count stood at 121,
and Canseco entered the at-bat hitting .375 (6-for-16) with three
home runs against the left-hander during his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want Canseco hitting against a tired left-hander,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who expressed dissatisfaction about being removed after
42/3 innings during his previous start Thursday in Kansas City,
complained of nothing this evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a quality start,'' Oliver said, ``and a big win for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' AL West title hopes require more of those during
the season's remaining two months.

WOULD-BE CARDS PUNTERS TRY NOT TO BOOT CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ Scott Player was working as a dispatcher for a
trucking company last winter, the reluctant first step into a
second career that he really wasn't ready for.
</P>
<P>
   He hoped he'd hear from another NFL team that was looking for a
punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had some good camps,'' Player said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Williams clung to hope, too, that he somehow would get
into an NFL camp after an impressive collegiate punting career at
Arizona State. The NFL draft came and went. His name was not
called.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have had excellent punters. Rich Camarillo. Then
Valley native Jeff Feagles. Both were Pro Bowl players.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Cardinals are staking their hopes on these two young
candidates who, at this stage of their careers, are among the NFL
fringe at their craft.
</P>
<P>
   When Feagles' contract expired after last season, Seattle
Seahawks owner Paul Allen opened his sizable wallet. Feagles jumped
at his seven-figure offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals quickly were on the phone to Player, who has yet
to make an NFL roster, and later to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a call from the team in my hometown was like a dream
come true,'' said Williams, who grew up in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   The dream hasn't come true entirely, yet, for either.
</P>
<P>
   Both have had their moments in the rarefied air here, but
neither has shown consistently that he's ready to be the successor
to Feagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not completely satisfied,'' Coach Vince Tobin said.
``We're very, very inexperienced there. Scott Player is having a
good camp, with good hang time and distance on his punts. Marcus
Williams has a strong leg but he's more erratic. That goes with
being young.''
</P>
<P>
   If neither is dazzling in preseason games, the Cardinals'
opening-day punter might not be on the roster yet.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do NFL clubs use a draft pick on a punter, nor, until
Allen dug in, did they pay them highly, giving the perception that
punters are not critical.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a punter can change a game faster than almost any other
player. A well-placed punt can pin a foe in lousy field position.
Feagles was a master at placing punts inside the opponent's 20-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   Or a boomer that hangs long enough for the coverage to get
downfield can negate a return, leaving the offense with a long
field to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   But a bobbled snap or a blocked punt can put the defense in
horrible position.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how important the punter is,'' Player
said. ``You talk about field position, or losing field position,
it's a lot of responsibility, and only 30 guys in the world get to
do it in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Player calls the competition ``neck and neck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus is a good punter, with a strong leg,'' Player said.
</P>
<P>
   Player, who was in the Cardinals' camp two years ago and with
New York last year, has taken some razzing from teammates because
he has gone to a single-bar face mask, the kind old-timers wore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was developing bad habits looking through the old mask,
moving the ball over the bar where I could see it,'' Player said.
``That was too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Even through his conventional face mask, Williams, an excitable
lad, could see that he was succumbing to rookie jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time out here at this level, and I wasn't in
my rhythm,'' Williams said. ``It was typical rookie things. I was
taking too long to get it off. I talked to everyone for advice, and
the bottom line is I just had to calm myself down.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, also getting a look as the kickoff man, regained
confidence after blasting a few kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really striking it well, and that began to carry over to
my punts,'' Williams said. ``Scott is an excellent punter. He's
been in a lot of pro camps. I came in here and I was all over the
place. I didn't know what to expect. This is a great opportunity, a
great experience for my first year out. Now I'm getting a feel for
it. If this first week taught me anything it's that I need to
settle down and just be myself.''

Elarton convincing in save
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Scott Elarton is starting to act like a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   He's starting to think like a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he looked like a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, still regarded as one of the Astros' top
starting-pitcher prospects, is turning out to be one of their top
relievers. The 22-year-old rookie shut the door on the Florida
Marlins over the final three innings for his first major-league
save in the Astros' 10-6 victory in front of 21,870 at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable,'' Elarton said. ``I don't know what it is.
I've felt comfortable in the bullpen all along. It's good to come
into a situation where I could get a save, because you kind of feel
like there's something on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true reliever. Only in Elarton's case, his first
save came on the one-month anniversary of his move to the Astros'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton relieved starter Pete Schourek (7-6) in the seventh
inning with the Astros holding a 9-6 lead. Elarton retired the
first six batters he faced before giving up consecutive singles to
pinch hitters Craig Counsell and Gregg Zaun to start the ninth. The
6-7 righthander, whose fastball tops out around 93 mph, got out of
the jam with a pair of grounders and a flyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big. They had some momentum,'' said Astros manager
Larry Dierker, whose club built a 5-1 first-inning lead before
Florida rallied to tie the score in the third. ``Sometimes, it's
hard to stop them. (Coming back in a game) can be contagious. It is
for us when we hit. To get Pete out of the game, you don't know
what you're going to get in the bullpen. Sometimes it's good;
sometimes it isn't. It was very timely.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for the Astros' offense, which pounded a
Marlins rookie starter for the third consecutive night. This time,
it was Andy Larkin's turn. The righthander didn't make it past the
third inning, and for the second time in three days the first five
Astros to bat scored during a five-run first inning. The big blow
was a three-run home run by ex-Marlin Moises Alou, who has homered
in four consecutive games, one shy of Cliff Johnson's 1975 club
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the swing down,'' said Alou, who is batting
.556 (10-for-18) this season against the Marlins. ``I haven't been
hitting that many home runs in consecutive days since 1993-94. It's
a good feeling when you can go out there and drive the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the Astros' nine starters had a hit, with Craig Biggio
and Derek Bell each contributing three hits and two RBIs. Bill
Spiers went 2-for-5 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida manager Jim Leyland isn't surprised with the Astros'
offense, which ranks first in the National League with 592 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the better lineups in the league, without
question,'' Leyland said. ``That's a pretty tough lineup for any
pitcher, let alone a young pitcher. To be honest, we're overmatched
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The early run support was almost not enough for Schourek, who
ran into trouble in the third inning. The Marlins scored four runs
off him, with Derrek Lee accounting for three with a bases-loaded
double that tied the score at 5. Lee, who extended his hitting
streak to nine games, also hit a bases-empty home run in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, coming off a strong seven-inning outing against San
Diego five days earlier, allowed six runs and eight hits in six
innings in winning for the second time in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My control wasn't real sharp. The balls they hit _ some were
good pitches; some were bad pitches,'' said Schourek, who helped
his cause with two hits and a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros knocked Larkin (2-6) out of the game with three runs
in the third to go back in front 8-5. Larkin allowed eight runs, 10
hits and three walks in 2 innings.

Traditional giveaway items give way to chic beanies 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Giveaways at the ballpark used to be a traditional,
unsophisticated thing.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a baseball game, get your kids a bat, a ball, a cap or a
glove. Something that said baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams have tried giving away something different. The
Indians, for instance, once gave away cans of deodorant _ on
Mother's Day. And who can forget that June night in 1974 when they
sold beer for a nickel in Cleveland?
</P>
<P>
   Bat day, however, may no longer be the pinnacle of giveaways. On
July 7, crazed fans and memorabilia brokers stormed Coors Field in
Denver to grab one of the hot new giveaway items. Major League
Baseball added to its all-star luster by passing out something that
had nothing to do with the game:
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   50,000 of them, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   And now Beanie Ball seems to be changing the way sports teams
are playing the giveaway game. Seizing the moment, the Rangers and
the Cowboys plan to distribute the toy industry's latest phenomenon
at upcoming games. In a doff of the helmet to fullback Daryl
``Moose'' Johnston, the Dallas Cowboys intend to give away the
``Chocolate Moose'' Beanie Baby at the regular-season opener Sept.
6. The Texas Rangers are giving out ``Pugsley,'' a bean-stuffed pug
dog, on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Rangers announced the Beanie Baby giveaway, ``We
were getting a ton of calls,'' said Sherry Flow, the Rangers'
promotions manager. ``I never thought it would be a big promotion.
I guess I'm still trying to figure out what the craze is with
regard to sports teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Ball, sports-marketing experts say, reflects not only
changing consumer tastes but the growing sophistication of sports
franchises who recognize the benefits of jumping on a promotional
bandwagon as it passes by the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With competition for the sports entertainment dollar increasing,
marketing experts say teams are searching for unique,
higher-quality items to give away to fans. Bats, balls and T-shirts
haven't exactly been replaced, but they've had to make room for
Mattel Hot Wheels, Barbies, Duncan Yo-yos and Beanie Babies _ toys
with name recognition and value far beyond the ballfield, rink or
court.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular promotional items of today didn't exist or were
unknown to the public not long ago. Who knew what a screensaver or
a mousepad was back in the days of the Big Red Machine? Yet, both
are common giveaway items at ballparks and arenas today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all trying to tap into what's hot,'' says Sean
Brenner, editor of Team Marketing Report, a Chicago-based,
sports-business trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed a lot lately,'' adds Ben Creed, director of
marketing partnerships for the Florida Marlins. ``Of course, we
still want the item to be somehow baseball-related, or if it's not,
to have something saying `Marlins' on it.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Marlins are giving away bean-bag dolls
featuring team mascot Billy the Marlin, not Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs, however, are featuring two Beanie Baby
giveaway days this season. One, ``Daisy the Cow,'' was tied to
legendary broadcaster Harry Caray through his signature call,
``Holy Cow.'' A second giveaway, of ``Gracie the Swan,'' is being
nominally connected to Cubs first baseman Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for ballpark giveaways hasn't changed much
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to put more people in the seats,'' Creed
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely see a jump in attendance on a giveaway night,''
Dallas Stars spokesman Larry Kelly says.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, Kelly adds, are considering a Beanie Baby giveaway
for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey and basketball clubs have increased their number of
giveaway promotions in recent years, but baseball still leads the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot more seats to fill,'' Brenner explains. ``A
giveaway in baseball can make a real difference when you're trying
to fill 50,000 seats 81 times a season.''
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason behind the Rangers' long list of
giveaway nights, which include items such as magnetic schedules,
mugs, calendars, cups, umbrellas, caps, tote bags, jerseys,
sunglasses, commemorative pins, batting helmets, binders,
backpacks, growth charts, posters and seat cushions. Flow said the
biggest giveaways prior to Beanies have been the traditional ones:
bats, hats and replica shirts or jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of group sales with boy scouts and girl scouts,''
Flow said. ``And the day they usually pick is bat day.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling seats isn't the only reason for promotional giveaways,
though, or the Dallas Cowboys probably wouldn't be handing out
Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giveaways aren't that common in football,'' says Joel
Finglass, director of sales and promotions for the Cowboys.
``Ninety percent of your tickets in the NFL are pre-sold. Most of
the time they're just a bonus for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving away Beanie Babies, Finglass adds, provides loyal fans
with an item of considerable value _ some brokers reportedly
offered up to $500 to buy Beanie Babies given to fans at the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Hosting such a hot promotion doesn't hurt a team's image,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' Finglass says, ``for teams like us to stay
on top of trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams rarely do promotions anymore unless they have a corporate
sponsor underwriting the cost to purchase the giveaway item.
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines sponsors giveaways for the
Mavericks and Stars as well as the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good will and exposure for us,'' says Christy Hall,
manager of sports marketing for Southwest. ``We want to promote our
partnership with the teams and give folks something they can take
back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has given away screensavers, baggage tags and
miniature binoculars _ more adult-oriented items since airline
customers tend to be adults.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of sports giveaways, however, still go to kids.
Team officials say the promotional item lures the whole family to
the ballpark, resulting in more tickets sold, as well as
concessions, souvenirs and parking.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to sponsor a giveaway is not small. While screensavers
can go for $2 or less each, bats cost $3.75 apiece and baseballs
even more. Multiply that by 20,000 or more fans, and it is an
investment in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Hot as Beanie Babies are, some companies shy away from
sponsoring their giveaway. That's because it is difficult to
associate the sponsor's name with the dolls. Still, Southwest's
Hall says, they are likely to remain a better draw than bat day or
ball day for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just not a better traffic builder out there,'' Halls
says. ``This is not going away any time soon.''

LINEMEN TO BATTLE FOR SPOTS AT CAMP  
 DEVILS LOOKING FOR RIGHT TACKLE 
</HEADLINE>
 LINE -AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hog feeds are alive and well, and that's a good sign for the
status of Arizona State's offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The linemen, firm believers in bonding off the field, have met
several times this summer for barbecues, affectionately known by
the group as ``hog feeds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get along well,'' sophomore Marvel Smith said. ``And I
think we feel we can even be better than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That's encouraging for the Sun Devils, whose line may have been
the most unappreciated aspect of the offense last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the offensive line started doing better, the defenses
weren't blitzing Ryan (Kealy) as much,'' wide receiver Lenzie
Jackson said. ``That not only helped Ryan but the receivers, too.
It made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit will benefit from offensive line coach Dan Cozzetto's
decision last season to go with freshmen Smith (left tackle) and
Victor Leyva (right guard), who combined for 17 starts. They'll
join senior Grey Ruegamer, who Coach Bruce Snyder has suggested may
be the best center in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Scott Peters, the heaviest of the linemen at
321 pounds, will replace Kyle Murphy at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I see about him is all good,'' Smith said. ``The
only thing he needs is to get to know plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into this program already as strong as me and
Victor.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters will need to keep on his toes. Senior Randy Leaphart, a
backup at center and guard, had a strong spring.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such clarity at right tackle. Glen Gable, who
started the final nine games there last season, is gone. The
position will be won at Camp Tontozona, which starts Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Troy Davis, who started the first three games of last
season at right tackle before backing up Smith on the left side,
will square off with junior Thomas Schmidt and sophomore Dane Beem
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a heated battle,'' Cozzetto said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils were hoping to have Tucson High School standout
Ralph Zarate in the mix, but he hasn't reached the necessary ACT
score and may end up going to a junior college.
</P>
<P>
   Damien Niko, a standout recruit from Mesa Mountain View, also
did not qualify and won't be eligible this season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith thinks the line will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking forward to the season starting for a long
time,'' he said. ``It feels different going into camp not really
competing for a position, but I still have a lot of work to do,
focusing on technique and everything. I can't wait.'' &QL;

UTAH STATE MAY PURSUE NAU BASKETBALL COACH

<TEXT>
<P>
   The aftershocks of Phil Jackson's departure from the Chicago
Bulls might be felt in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been replaced by former Iowa State Coach Tim Floyd.
Iowa State replaced Tim Floyd with Utah State's Larry Eustachy. And
a Utah State official called Northern Arizona Athletic Director
Steve Holton on Tuesday, expressing interest in Coach Ben Howland.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Van De Velde, who became Utah State athletic director 10
days ago, didn't ask for permission to interview Howland but told
NAU of his interest.
</P>
<P>
   If things progress, Van De Velde said he will call for formal
permission to talk to Howland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing would not be real good,'' Holton said. ``But if
it's much better financially and all those things . . . The feeling
at mid-level schools is that if you leave a place better than when
you came in, you can't argue with people (leaving).''
</P>
<P>
   Howland, reached on a recruiting trip in Las Vegas, said he had
not been contacted and declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the job could be attractive to Howland, who has several
ties to Utah. He played at Weber State in Ogden, and his wife is
from nearby Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Howland has guided NAU to one of the biggest improvements in
college basketball history. Taking over one of the nation's worst
programs, he has gone 58-51 in four seasons, 42-15 over the past
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks won the Big Sky championship last season and
earned the school's first NCAA Tournament berth. &QL;

QUAKE-WRECKED COMPLEX RISES ANEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To the legion of young people who toured the swank
Woodman Avenue apartment complex in Sherman Oaks on Wednesday, the
advertising pitch for ``resort living'' had its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the $25 million complex, called the Premiere, a movie
theater, mini-market, putting green, gym, steam room and sand
volleyball court are part of the plush extras that push rents to
$750 a month for studios and $1,000 a month for one-bedroom units.
</P>
<P>
   Most are blind to its history as the largest apartment building
devastated by the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, the ravaged heart of
Sherman Oaks' ghost town, 15 miles northwest downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the steps outside the newly rebuilt Premiere _ known
as the Oakwood until the quake destroyed it _ Carl Iskandar gaped
at the upscale apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume the building is a new building, more
earthquake-conscious,'' said Iskandar, 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen in my whole
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that hardly anyone asked about earthquake safety after
the tour was just the way the folks in Sherman Oaks wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   With the grand opening this week of the Premiere, a 372-unit
complex, the section of the community devastated by the Northridge
Earthquake looks more like itself than it has in years _ and in
some eyes, even better.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Association, said the area is better than ever and the Premiere a
prime example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a mediocre apartment building before,'' Close
said. ``Now it is a state-of-the-art building _ a luxurious deluxe
apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what happened all over Sherman Oaks,'' Close
said. ``When people rebuilt, we made it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 quake drove away about 25percent of the Sherman Oaks
population. Many built homes or relocated in different communities.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 1994 temblor is known as the Northridge Earthquake,
it damaged 167 buildings in Sherman Oaks and caused $27.8 million
in damage to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those buildings remain scarred and uninhabitable.
According to Sherman Oaks leaders, some may never be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Jim Giorgio, then the former executive director of the
Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce, estimated the total loss to the
Sherman Oaks business sector at $211.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than four years, Sherman Oaks has made a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   New residents are coming back to the new buildings; customers
are returning to shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The post office has slowly watched its mail routes grow back to
size, according to Joe Clifford, a U.S. Postal Service supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Clifford said, Sherman Oaks' two post offices are
delivering 90percent of the mail they were delivering before the
tremor.
</P>
<P>
   Even the people forced to move away are seeing the community's
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   John Goy's home was lost in the earthquake, but his insurance
paid for him to rebuild but, unfortunately, not in Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government wouldn't help me buy there,'' he said,
explaining the reason was a fear of liquification along the river.
``The water table is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goy still eats dinner regularly at a Ventura Boulevard
restaurant in Sherman Oaks &UR;  &LR; and says the community has recovered
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' he said. ``It looks much, much, much
better.''

LOS ANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICT CRITICIZED IN TAINTED LAND BUYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Deborah Sullivan contributed to this
story.) 
(Repeating for those needing.) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Unified School District's practice
of building some new campuses on contaminated former industrial
sites has been sharply questioned by a state legislative audit.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a Joint Legislative Audit Committee investigation
released Wednesday, found that the district's environmental
analysis and cleanup at newly built Jefferson Middle School was
seriously deficient _ an issue of growing importance with 51 new
schools planned, some of them on toxic sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAUSD may be, in some cases, acquiring urban land for new
school construction based on political expedience, while
disregarding the environmental costs and health risks associated
with the cleanup of polluted land,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, who heads the audit
committee, said the district's history of failing to adequately
identify and sanitize contaminated property is particularly
troubling since L.A. Unified has embarked on a campaign to build 51
more schools within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is cause for major concern,'' Wildman said. ``Kids need
to be safe. If the LAUSD's internal problems of handling
environmental problems are not addressed, then they need to be
addressed by the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Niccum, the district's real estate and asset management
branch director, said there is contamination at two of the 10 sites
the district has bought or is acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   Niccum said that in a congested urban area, choices for new
school sites are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your options are sites where there are homes, apartments,
businesses or factories _ there aren't any strawberry fields or
orange groves as options,'' he said. ``You're left with the need to
build a school. You have to make one of those tough choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Niccum directed calls about environmental problems to the
district's environmental health and safety branch. Dianne Doi,
acting head of the division, said she could not answer questions
about the report's safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the audit committee bolsters allegations made by a
former environmental director for the district _ who was fired
Tuesday _ that the Los Angeles Unified School District does not
conduct adequate environmental studies on its properties and fails
to properly clean up the land.
</P>
<P>
   And the report said district officials did not tell the state
allocation board about toxic problems when they sought funding for
the Jefferson Middle School site, which is still undergoing an
intensive hazardous cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Land at the new sites for South Gate High School and Tweedy
Elementary School is highly toxic, containing chemicals, gasoline,
solvents, pesticides and metals, and will require ``meaningful
remediation,'' district officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education President Victoria Castro said environmental
problems were expected in South Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it's possible to clean the land,'' Castro said.
``As we proceed with the 51 schools, the public needs a much
clearer understanding of the process. We need to follow what's
happening and make sure they're clean and don't put children in
unhealthy situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But board member Barbara Boudreaux said the district should look
for other properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district should not buy contaminated land. There are
enough parcels out there. We shouldn't have to deal with this,''
said Boudreaux, whose district includes the environmentally
troubled Jefferson Middle School in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreaux said she didn't learn of the contamination problems
until this week. District documents show the board had been
apprised of the problems at Tweedy in August and South Gate in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Farleigh, campaign director of the environmental group
CalPIRG, said cleanup of toxic sites may be possible, depending on
the types of chemicals and level of contamination. However, she
said, a safer option would be to avoid them entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are systems in place that do result in safe cleanup of
toxic sites,'' Farleigh said. ``However, I feel that the LAUSD has
not done a sufficient job of looking at the chemicals that are
already at the site, and of looking at all the options for building
elsewhere. At some of them it may be possible to clean it up, but
why take that risk?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the funding for new schools will come from Proposition
BB, and members of a citizens oversight committee said using bond
money for toxic land is probably not cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remediation costs can often exceed land costs,'' said Steve
Soboroff, chairman of the committee. ``We need to stretch bond
dollars, and buying contaminated land isn't a great way to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit report included testimony from the San Diego Unified
School District's business services director, who said that
district has been able to build all of its new schools without
buying contaminated land or condemning property.
</P>
<P>
   Wildman began investigating the district last year, looking into
the district's construction of the controversial Belmont Learning
Complex, whose costs _ nearing $200 million _ make it the most
expensive high school in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation has expanded to include construction projects
districtwide, as well as real estate acquisition.

EMMITT SMITH DANCING A NEW STEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Emmitt Smith is doing what he does best,
charging straight ahead while TV crews do a spry backstep across
the field, trying to stay ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   There's no juking and jiving for Emmitt on this hot July
morning, no run to daylight. This is pure, bow-your-neck-and-growl
power football.
</P>
<P>
   For the media entourage trying to keep up, it's move or get
trampled.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who's just spent two-hours plus in practice, Smith has
remarkable energy, most of it generated through the smile on his
face and the spring in his step.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think I look?'' he's asking a couple of reporters
who are flanking him as he blasts straight toward the retreating
boom mikes and minicams. ``Don't I look like I'm running good to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Emmitt. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   So what are we supposed to say? Sorry, Emmitt, you look more
like Granny crossing the street against the light?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Smith ``has'' looked good in the first two weeks of
camp. Then again, if you can't look good now, you might as well
pack it up and find a shady spot by the pool.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Friday night's first preseason game at Texas
Sauna/Stadium carries a bit more intrigue than your normal,
everyday who-cares NFL exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first test under fire of the Cowboys' new Chan
Gailey offense, their first chance to gauge where they're at and
how far they have to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' guard Nate Newton sighs, ``will tell us how much
harder we're going to have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a fighter pilot,'' Emmitt says. ``You get in
the simulator and you fight in the simulator. Then you take what
you learn in the simulator and in the classroom and put it in the
jet. This first game is our jet.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been cleared for takeoff ... if the engines don't
stall.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're one of those fans out there braving the heat or
whether you'll be in the recliner with a glass a lemonade, keep
your eyes glued to No. 22 in the quarter or so that he's in the
game. This may be Emmitt Smith like you've never seen him before.
</P>
<P>
   We'll reserve judgment on whether that's good or bad.
</P>
<P>
   At times, this offense will ask Smith to clamp down on his
natural instincts in order to read the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it helps me become a much more patient back,'' is how
Emmitt puts it. ``In the past I've been so accustomed to power
football, to hitting the hole and taking everything that I see, and
really just going at it. This offense allows me to let things
develop a little bit, set things up a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to setting up blocks once I get down the field, but
not really letting the play fully develop and reading the defense
and letting them think I'm doing something, then doing something
else. In that regard, this offense allows me to do that as well as
being a straight downhill runner.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a chance to show his versatility, to prove that he's an
all-around back, that has put the spring back in Smith's step this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've only seen one style out of me, but I have confidence I
can succeed in this as well,'' Smith says. ``I'm a runner who's not
that fast, but I got vision, I got some shakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I've never really had to do was be patient. I took
what I saw. But in this offense I need to be a little patient on
some of the plays and I think that will help me as a running back.
If I can better myself in being patient on some plays, then convert
back to what I do, then that shows my versatility and that only
helps my game.''
</P>
<P>
   The multiple-sets that Gailey's offense utilizes, the chance to
run different plays, the opportunity to maybe actually surprise
defenses for a change has Smith and the Cowboys eager to play

   ``What we have to do as an offense is attack, attack, attack,

that. The last one's going to be the toughest this first year. If

OK.''

REPORT RIPS DISTRICT SOUTH CENTRAL

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jefferson Middle School is a prime example of what
can go wrong when a school district builds a campus on toxic land,
according to a critical report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Students will attend classes at the South Central Los Angeles
school even though workers will still be extracting contaminants
from the soil, which contained the carcinogen chromium-6 at initial
levels 540 times the limit allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   When the land was bought in 1990, district officials didn't know
the extent of the contamination. Once the land was acquired,
environmental analysis was deficient, and cleanup was only done
after the school was built, according to a report by the Joint
Legislative Audit Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every indication that the district not only failed to
properly assess the contaminants at the Jefferson site, but may
have withheld what they did know from state officials in a rush to
receive $11,834,812 in state land purchase funding,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the Los Angeles Unified School District,
however, contends that the district handled everything at the site
correctly. He said he could not comment on the report because he
had not read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, issues at this site were properly
investigated and remediated, received appropriate agency
approvals,'' said Barry Groveman.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 assessment by the district, with state oversight,
concluded that there is no health threat to students, although the
state committee report questions whether the remediation efforts
will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminated site was found by coincidence _ an EPA
scientist visiting a Superfund site ``strolled across the street to
the Jefferson site and was shocked to find it was a school,'' the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic problems at the 15-acre site would have been hard to
overlook, according to state officials' testimony. It once held a
World War II defense plant, furniture manufacturers, metal plating
operations and a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Once the land was acquired, the district's two phases of
environmental reports were deficient in their size and scope,
according to testimony by Jesse Huff, director of toxic substances
control for the California Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Huff chides the district for failing to
adequately follow the law. ``Local school districts, particularly
the largest one in the state, should be able to read the law,'' he
testified.
</P>
<P>
   James Wakefield, an attorney for the district, testified that
the LAUSD was impeded in its efforts to find out past uses of the
site because of a national security blackout surrounding defense
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The report said it was still unclear why the site was approved
by an inspector for the California Department of Education in 1989.
The department's approval process is also under examination.
</P>
<P>
   Huff said Cal-EPA's oversight failed at Jefferson because the
agency was not informed about problems there until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough environmental assessment wasn't conducted until after
the school was substantially completed and the California EPA
forced the LAUSD to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Melodie Dove, environmental organizer for Concerned Citizens of
South Central, said the organization began fighting the
construction of Jefferson Middle School two years ago, after a
neighbor received notice that Cal-EPA would test his property for
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   She said the school district failed to properly protect the
mostly African-American and Latino students from that hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an environmental justice issue,'' Dove said. ``It
says if they're building a school in South Central or East L.A.,
they don't go through all the steps of determining what the
contaminants are and doing possible cleanup and mitigation.''

CUBS END IT EARLY  
 D-BACKS CAN'T DIG OUT FROM 6-RUN DEFICIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Amaury Telemaco had toweled off after his night's
work, the Diamondbacks found themselves in a six-run hole. The
worst part? The third inning wasn't even over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Diamondbacks managed to chip away at the Chicago
Cubs' lead, they were never really in a position to seriously
threaten during Wednesday night's 7-3 loss at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks blew a chance to surpass the Florida Marlins
for the worst record in the majors, but Telemaco's awful evening
gave the Diamondbacks virtually no chance to escape baseball's
overall cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't locating my pitches,'' Telemaco said. ``In addition,
they were swinging the bats well. I needed to get ahead in the
count and I didn't do that. During the course of a season a pitcher
will go through games like I did tonight. It's just no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of spring training, Manager Buck Showalter
has been preaching how the Diamondbacks would be a work in progress
during this inaugural season, with players receiving chances and
needing to seize the opportunities when they're given in order to
make a mark.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the club has languished in last place in the
National League West and has had one of the worst records in ball
season, the Diamondbacks players are under pressure to perform in
order to keep their job.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco, claimed off waivers from these very same Cubs, was
picked up with the intention of getting a first-hand look at a
24-year-old right-hander who has shown promise in short glimpses.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco is not immune to losing his spot in the rotation. Many
more night like Wednesday, when he allowed six runs on eight hits
while facing just 15 batters before being lifted with no outs in
the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco's ERA in his last three starts is 7.47. He has won just
once in his seven starts and the Diamondbacks are 2-5 in games
Telemaco has started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amaury has pitched well for us,'' Manager Buck Showalter said.
``He'll get the ball again in five days.''
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco breezed through the first inning, retiring Lance
Johnson, Mickey Morandini and Sammy Sosa, who failed to his a grand
slam or a home run, consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   But the second inning offered a precursor to Telemaco's evening.
Mark Grace and Henry Rodriguez blasted a pair of solo home runs to
lead off the inning, Grace's splashing down in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The first six batters Telemaco faced in the third inning all
reached and Showalter made the quick jog to the mound to summon
help from the bullpen in the form of the suddenly dependable Willie
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher most likely to take Telemaco's place in the rotation
is Banks, who inherited a pair of runners on base with no outs in
the third from Telemaco but got out of the inning without either
runner advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Banks went on to three innings, retiring nine of the 10 batters
he faced while allowing a meaningless two-out single to Tyler
Houston in the fifth. Houston's single snapped a string of 22
consecutive batters retired by Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, a former first-round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins,
has pitched brilliantly since utilizing an arm-flapping,
double-pump windup that seems to have taken him back to his most
successful period, as a high school senior in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie has pitched well in situations given to him,''
Showalter said. ``How you pitch in those situations dictates if you
are elevated to other situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter admitted the Diamondbacks have talked about giving
Banks a start or two at some point.
</P>
<P>
   For right now, we'll see,'' Showalter said. ``It's a two-edged
sword. You hate to change someone who's doing so well in his
role.''

HENMAN UNFAZED BY TARANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Tarango lost, in order, his cool, a racket and his match
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Beach resident snapped during his second-round
match vs. England's Tim Henman _ and snapped his racket over his
knee _ during a 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 loss in the Mercedes-Benz Cup at Los
Angeles Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Henman, the tournament's second seed and a Wimbledon
semifinalist, was unfazed by Tarango's sideshows, coming back from
a 4-1 deficit in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's probably one of my good points, is I'm able to
stay positive and turn things around,'' Henman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even while his opponent is self-combusting.
</P>
<P>
   Tarango began verbal volleying with chair umpire Norm Chryst and
the linesmen in the first set and escalated his antics in the
second. He broke his racket and tossed it into the first row of the
crowd after Henman broke his serve to cut the lead to 4-3.
Tarango's outburst drew a warning from the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just disappointed with myself for losing my serve when I
was ahead like that,'' he said. ``I think it was just a little
machismo racket break. I just wanted to clear my head.''
</P>
<P>
   After going down 30-love in the next game, Tarango decided to
take a unscheduled water break, drawing a time-violation warning.
He also drew boos from the home crowd on his way back to the
baseline as one fan yelled ``Head case!''
</P>
<P>
   Henman tuned it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it upset my rhythm at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the world's 11th-ranked player said he was grateful
for the tough match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is my first tournament since Wimbledon, and
I'm really pleased with the way I'm playing,'' he said. ``It's
ideal to have a tough match like this as long as you win. You don't
want to have a tough match and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a calmer Tarango blasted tennis officiating in
general, calling it ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of line calls and when officials overrule is not
good,'' he said. ``The same people have been doing it since I was 7
years old. I mean !ital!literally!off! the same people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balls are hitting half on the line and they're calling them
out. It brings the quality of tennis down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarango also complained of dizziness, which he said affects his
serves. He plans to see a specialist in Beverly Hills today to
examine his neck and spine.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the L.A. tournament for the first time, Henman now
finds himself in the quarterfinals. His opponent is seventh-seed
Byron Black of Zimbabwe and USC, who defeated Gianluca Pozzi 6-3,
6-2 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In other singles matches Wednesday, Santa Monica's Michael Joyce
defeated Armenia's Sargis Sargsian 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, and Guillame
Raoux _ coming off Tuesday's upset of third seed Goran Ivanisevic _
defeated Kenneth Carlsen in a 2-hour, 47-minute marathon that took
three tiebreakers, 7-6 (9-7), 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday doubles, Grant Stafford and Kevin Ullyett defeated
Brandon Coupe and Kent Kinnear 6-3, 6-3; No.2 Martin Damm and Jim
Grabb defeated Jan-Michael Gambill and Vince Spadea 6-4, 6-2;
third-seeded Patrick Rafter and Sandon Stolle defeated Tuomas
Ketola and David Roditi 7-6 (6-5), 7-6 (6-4); and Eric Taino and
Adam Peterson defeated brothers Luke and Murphy Jensen 4-6, 6-3,
6-2; and Marcos Ondruska defeated Byron Black and Pat Galbraith 7-6
(6-2), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's late match, No. 1 seed Patrick Rafter won his
first-round match, defeating Ramon Delgado 6-3, 6-2.

Hernandez' incredible journey ended when a low-flying U.S. Coast
Guard chopper happened upon a cluster of eight castaways on a spit
of land called the Anguilla Cay one day late last December.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed pitcher and his wife, Norris Bosch, were among
the Cuban refugees who flit for freedom on a 20-foot boat that was
constructed from scrap wood and guided by a compass composed of
household magnets.
</P>
<P>
   The leaky boat somehow supported its occupants for 10 hours
before sinking and Hernandez and the others managed to swim a mile
to the cay, where they stayed and prayed for deliverance. On the
fourth day, the whirlybird came. It might as well have plunked
Hernandez down in a whirlpool; ever since then he has been tugged
this way and that by the highest highs and the lowest lows.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year, $6.6-million contract that Hernandez signed with
the New York Yankees is a matter of public record and, thanks to
his sterling start, no longer a topic of public debate. The
28-year-old rookie carried a record of 5-2 and an earned-run
average of 2.43 into his eighth start Wednesday night against the
Angels at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   What few people know are the hardships Hernandez continues to
endure even as the Yankees challenge the all-time single-season win
record.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, Hernandez' heart is like the boat that carried
him from Cuba, away from his two daughters, ages 7 and 3. It's
leaking and no amount of shipbuilding magnate George Steinbrenner's
money or resources can render it buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first-base coach, understands better
than most what makes Hernandez' heart sink, and not just because he
lives in the same mid-Manhattan hotel as the player.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenal was one of the last Cuban-born players to enter the
U.S. legally, in the early 1960s, before Cuban Communist leader
Fidel Castro _ himself a former pitcher of some renown _ bolted the
door shut.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Cardenal signed with the Giants at the age of
16. He didn't see either of his parents again until he was 35 and
in the ebbing stages of an 18-year major-league career. The longing
for family that Cardenal felt all those years now permeates from
Hernandez' pores in the quiet moments they spend together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's struggling a little bit,'' Cardenal said of the
pitcher known as ``El Duque.'' ``I'm not talking on the field. He's
pitching great, he's got great money, he's got the glamour of
pitching for the Yankees. But there's something missing in his life
that's important and that's the daughters he left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez never thought he'd leave Cuba right up until the week
he did. A longtime national team member, Hernandez had
opportunities to defect but he never did, explaining to would-be
go-betweens that he'd rather have 5 million Cuban fans cheering his
name than $5 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, though, his younger half-brother, Livan, did defect. A
year later, Orlando was unceremoniously dropped from the national
team, lest he follow Livan's footsteps to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Hernandez petitioned for reinstatement. On Dec. 15,
two months after Livan had earned World Series MVP honors for his
pitching in Florida's title run, Hernandez was summoned by
state-security agents and told in no uncertain terms that his
playing days were over.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was crushed. If there was one thing he loved more than
his flesh and blood, it was the game that coarses through his
veins. Ten days after the meeting with Cuban officials, Hernandez
made his escape, leaving a large chunk of his life behind.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenal can't imagine how he did it. ``I don't think I'd have
the nerve,'' he said. ``All you need is a 3-foot tall wave to flip
the boat. I don't think I could have risked my life like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of Hernandez' desire to play baseball is dizzying to
his new teammates. It also has been instructive. When Hernandez
walked into the clubhouse the first day and saw two pairs of new
shoes sitting there for him, his first reaction was there had been
a mistake and he needed to give one pair back.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ballplayer's standard $68 per diem, which is
almost as much as Hernandez was drawing in a YEAR at his job as a
rehabilitation therapist in a psychiatric hospital in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   His childlike joy at all the perks of being a professional has
been mildly contagious, which is saying something considering he is
among players whose salaries form the highest payroll in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think his attitude has rubbed off,'' said catcher
Joe Girardi. ``When you see how much he appreciates everything and
you think about what he went through to get to this level, it's
inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez' pitching has been a revelation. He has shown no rust
from his two-year layoff. With his high-leg kick (he nearly bumps
his chin with his knee), chameleon delivery and stubborn
competitiveness, Hernandez reminds many people of Cuban
right-hander an former major-leaguer Luis Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   Count among them Tiant, who spent a leisurely afternoon
conversing with Hernandez in Spanish last weekend during Old
Timers' Day festivities at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart pitcher,'' Tiant said from his home in Savannah,
Ga. ``When he's on the mound he makes you feel like he's in command
of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because off the mound there's so much he can't
control.

HENMAN UNFAZED BY TARANGO

By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Tarango lost, in order, his cool, a racket and his match
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Beach resident snapped during his second-round
match vs. England's Tim Henman _ and snapped his racket over his
knee _ during a 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 loss in the Mercedes-Benz Cup at Los
Angeles Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Henman, the tournament's second seed and a Wimbledon
semifinalist, was unfazed by Tarango's sideshows, coming back from
a 4-1 deficit in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's probably one of my good points, is I'm able to
stay positive and turn things around,'' Henman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even while his opponent is self-combusting.
</P>
<P>
   Tarango began verbal volleying with chair umpire Norm Chryst and
the linesmen in the first set and escalated his antics in the
second. He broke his racket and tossed it into the first row of the
crowd after Henman broke his serve to cut the lead to 4-3.
Tarango's outburst drew a warning from the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just disappointed with myself for losing my serve when I
was ahead like that,'' he said. ``I think it was just a little
machismo racket break. I just wanted to clear my head.''
</P>
<P>
   After going down 30-love in the next game, Tarango decided to
take a unscheduled water break, drawing a time-violation warning.
He also drew boos from the home crowd on his way back to the
baseline as one fan yelled ``Head case!''
</P>
<P>
   Henman tuned it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it upset my rhythm at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the world's 11th-ranked player said he was grateful
for the tough match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is my first tournament since Wimbledon, and
I'm really pleased with the way I'm playing,'' he said. ``It's
ideal to have a tough match like this as long as you win. You don't
want to have a tough match and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a calmer Tarango blasted tennis officiating in
general, calling it ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of line calls and when officials overrule is not
good,'' he said. ``The same people have been doing it since I was 7
years old. I mean !ital!literally!off! the same people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balls are hitting half on the line and they're calling them
out. It brings the quality of tennis down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarango also complained of dizziness, which he said affects his
serves. He plans to see a specialist in Beverly Hills today to
examine his neck and spine.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the L.A. tournament for the first time, Henman now
finds himself in the quarterfinals. His opponent is seventh-seed
Byron Black of Zimbabwe and USC, who defeated Gianluca Pozzi 6-3,
6-2 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In other singles matches Wednesday, Santa Monica's Michael Joyce
defeated Armenia's Sargis Sargsian 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, and Guillame
Raoux _ coming off Tuesday's upset of third seed Goran Ivanisevic _
defeated Kenneth Carlsen in a 2-hour, 47-minute marathon that took
three tiebreakers, 7-6 (9-7), 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday doubles, Grant Stafford and Kevin Ullyett defeated
Brandon Coupe and Kent Kinnear 6-3, 6-3; No.2 Martin Damm and Jim
Grabb defeated Jan-Michael Gambill and Vince Spadea 6-4, 6-2;
third-seeded Patrick Rafter and Sandon Stolle defeated Tuomas
Ketola and David Roditi 7-6 (6-5), 7-6 (6-4); and Eric Taino and
Adam Peterson defeated brothers Luke and Murphy Jensen 4-6, 6-3,
6-2; and Marcos Ondruska defeated Byron Black and Pat Galbraith 7-6
(6-2), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's late match, No. 1 seed Patrick Rafter won his
first-round match, defeating Ramon Delgado 6-3, 6-2.

ANGELS TROUNCE YANKEES, 10-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The New York Yankees win so often that their
losses are generally forgotten. But Joe Torre will no doubt
remember how Anaheim embarrassed the Yankees on Wednesday night,
10-5, how his team embarrassed itself, for perhaps the first time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   After performing with unusual energy Tuesday, the Yankees
sleepwalked through this game, like a second-division club playing
out its schedule. They didn't execute properly, they didn't make
adjustments, and in a couple of instances, they simply did not
hustle.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez gave up 13 hits and 10 runs in three and
one-third innings, the most runs and hits allowed by a Yankees
pitcher this year, and confirmed once more that unless he starts to
pitch inside more aggressively against left-handed hitters, they
are going to hammer him.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels' Tim Salmon finished off Hernandez with a
titanic two-run homer that almost cleared the bullpens that rest
beyond the left-center field fence, Hernandez began stepping off
the mound even before Torre arrived and was already en route to the
dugout when he handed the ball to his manager. Hernandez wore the
slight smirk that erupted on his face in the midst of the fourth
inning, as Anaheim blooped in a couple of hits.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole, awful fourth inning was no laughing matter. It
began when Garret Anderson hit a liner to right field, where Paul
O'Neill twisted and turned awkwardly before it went over his head
for a double. With a better route, O'Neill may or may not have been
able to make the catch; the ball was scorched, no doubt
contributing to the difficultly of the play.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was no gray area about O'Neill's effort on the
next play. Dave Hollins rolled a single through the right side of
the infield, and O'Neill, assuming Anderson would score and Hollins
would stop at first, loped in slowly. But Hollins, watching
O'Neill, suddenly charged around first and easily beat O'Neill's
belated throw into second base.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out Phil Nevin, and then the parade started.
Jason Baughman, a line single. Gary DiSarcina, a bloop hit over the
infield, scoring Hollins. Orlando Palmeiro ripped a two-run double,
and when the relay came back to the infield, Palmeiro was halfway
between second and third; Tino Martinez, the cutoff man, flipped to
Scott Brosius to begin the rundown.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way the play came together, however, the Yankees
were left with nobody covering third base, after Brosius initially
flipped to second, and Palmeiro scampered into the bag. Any number
of Yankees, from left fielder Chad Curtis to catcher Jorge Posada,
might have been responsible for the blown rundown, but in general,
the Yankees simply reacted slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds singled home Palmeiro and then immediately stole
second base. Darin Erstad, the eighth batter of the inning, dumped
a single over shortstop, and Hernandez, moving to back up home
plate, grinned as he ran home, disgusted by his bad luck on this
and several other hits. Posada patted him on the side,
commiserating.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez got ahead in the count to Salmon, no balls and two
strikes, and threw a changeup that hardly moved as it reached home
plate, thigh high. Salmon utterly killed it, and there was
Hernandez, smirking, Angels 10, Yankees 2.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson followed that with a single off the reliever
Darren Holmes, the seventh straight hit in the inning, the Angels
tied a club record. In all, Anaheim sent 11 batters to the plate in
the fourth, scoring eight runs.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre met
with Hernandez and told him he needed to throw inside more, and in
his next outing, against Toronto, Hernandez did this diligently.
But pitching last week and again on Wednesday night, Hernandez once
again remained focused on the outside part of the plate,
particularly when pitching to left-handed batters. The result is
that the left-handers, well aware of this trend, hang over the
plate fearlessly, not concerned whatsoever about Hernandez pumping
a fastball near their chest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, left-handed batters had 9 hits in 13 at-bats
against Hernandez, helping to propel his earned run average upward
by more than a run, from 2.43 to 3.66, and reduce his won-lost
record to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The night had started so promisingly, Darryl Strawberry giving
the Yankees a 1-0 lead in the top of the second, with his 17th home
run, against the knuckleballer Steve Sparks. When the Angels scored
twice in the bottom of the second, Derek Jeter unloaded a home run
into the right field stands, tying the game. The Yankees, it
seemed, had the same energy and efficiency they displayed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.

BOXING NEEDS TO SHOW ITS TEETH TO TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Here we are worrying about where Randy Johnson will be
in three days. We should be worrying about where Mike Tyson will be
in three months, since he already has shown us Vincent Van Gogh
wasn't the only lobe-lopping nut to walk the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In boxing, the fate of one psychologically troubled man _ for
whom no amount of boxing or money ever will fill the void of his
self-proclaimed darkness _ is secondary to the fate of a gigantic,
smarmy industry.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a betting person, as so many boxing fans are, better
put your money down on Tyson making a comeback in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   On the boardwalk, you'll be having some fists.
</P>
<P>
   On the boardwalk, people will be cheering for blood.
</P>
<P>
   On the boardwalk, the purse will be $50 million, most of which
will line the bottomless pockets of the irrepressible and now
unconvictable Don King.
</P>
<P>
   There is little reason to doubt that a Tyson rematch with
Evander Holyfield is coming to a pay-per-view screen near you,
probably just in time for the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   You can only begin to imagine the forthcoming froth of hype:
</P>
<P>
   Ear ye. Ear ye. Step right up, folks. A Christmas special with
``Jaws-of-Life'' Mike.
</P>
<P>
   When the big bout is about to happen, the whole
sports-entertainment world will start to get jiggy with it, as if
on a super-sized dose of Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a big-time heavyweight fight that gets
everyone all giddy and jittery. NBA stars fly into town on rented
jets. Hollywood stars make the scene. Glamour and glory surround
one of society's sick little addictions.
</P>
<P>
   We all understand that boxing needs Mike Tyson, the steamroller
of fury who has prompted every person who has ever watched him
fight to wonder where such rage and brutality come from in a single
human being.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing needs Tyson because there was no real heavyweight action
for the three years he was in prison serving time on a rape
conviction, nor has there been a compelling heavyweight bout since
Tyson's license was revoked a year ago, right after the June 28,
1997 fight in which Tyson viciously knawed off pieces of
Holyfield's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows the economics of boxing and gambling
understands that the great Garden State of New Jersey also needs
Mike Tyson, regardless of that bloody act of carnivorous horror he
committed in full view of every pay-per-view and MGM Grand Casino
ringside customer.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it will be extremely difficult for state regulators
in New Jersey to turn down Tyson's request for a license to once
again do his work with his sledgehammer fists that like to drill
nose bones through brains.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story is that New Jersey should deny Tyson
entry to the ring. They should uphold the decision of the Nevada
State Athletic Commission that revoked Tyson's license. And any
other state before which Tyson and his handlers appeal also should
deny Tyson the chance to fight.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Tyson and his people should be forced to
return to Vegas. Let Nevada finish its business on this matter.
</P>
<P>
   The loopholes in boxing are many, which is why Tyson has sought
a new start in New Jersey. But even without codified rules, the
decision whether Tyson should ever fight again should be left to
the state where he committed his own, ugly undoing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the very grounds for Tyson's return to the ring in New
Jersey are whether, according to the three-member panel, Tyson has
the ``good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility'' to
box in that state.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey panel has 45 days to find a way to make palatable
(pardon the expression) an excuse for his re-admittance to the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   And with as much as $200 million in tickets, pay-per-view and
casino receipts riding on another Tyson fight, it might not take
New Jersey regulators long to overlook what's criminal and what's
not.
</P>
<P>
   One question, though: How can a man who does not merely bite an
opponent's ear, but bites off a piece of his ear ever be deemed
responsible or to possess integrity?
</P>
<P>
   That alone should be enough of a question for the New Jersey
regulators to dismiss Tyson's request.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson snapped last June, when he was in trouble early in the
bout and Holyfield's head-butting had put Tyson into an
instinctively animalistic panic, it is safe to assume he would
resort to a similar tactic again.
</P>
<P>
   But that sort of logic is not likely with this impending ruling.
It should be easy enough for New Jersey regulators to cop a
position that it is not up to them to terminally condemn a fighter
such as Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   It will be easy enough to say Tyson has served his sentence,
paid his $3 million fine. The wiggle room is more than there for
this panel to give Tyson another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will be off to the boxing ring again, where the drama
surrounding and infesting boxing is almost as ugly and animalistic
as the horrible stuff that goes on inside the ring.

</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was once the scourge of Seahawks training camps,
stalking the halls of the players' dormitory in the middle of the
night because he had too much nervous energy to sleep. Whenever
there was a prank to be pulled, the rotund one was the primary
tugger. When laughter would erupt during pre-practice stretching,
the Pro Bowl defensive tackle was almost always the instigator.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Kennedy naps for an hour between practices and is
doing his best to blend into the Eastern Washington University
landscape. He doesn't even wear the customized practice jerseys
with his nicknames _ ``Big Dog'' and ``Tez'' _ across the
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten boring,'' he offers with a rumbling belly laugh.
``I'm even boring myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kennedy calls boredom, defensive line coach Tommy Brasher
calls acting his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you write that off to maturity,'' Brasher said.
``Cortez is right up against 30. He's still got a little of that
kid in him, but not as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this kinder, gentler Kennedy is rooted in what has been an
offseason-long love fest.
</P>
<P>
   In April, they renamed Main Street in his hometown of Wilson,
Ark., Cortez Kennedy Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the club signed him to a three-year, $17 million
contract extension, all but guaranteeing that Kennedy will play his
entire career with the team that made him the third pick overall in
the 1990 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's his realization that this game he still loves to
play has become serious business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win. We haven't got time to be playing around,''
Kennedy said. ``It's a do-or-die situation for a lot of people. We
want to keep everyone around.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it was the reality slap that was missing eight games
last year because of injuries _ the first of Kennedy's NFL career
in which he had started a club-record 100 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when you've made your last play or played your
last game,'' Kennedy said. ``You don't want to think about it. But
when I first got hurt I felt as low as I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason _ or reasons _ a change has come over
Kennedy from the days when two of his more memorable escapades
involved videotape and closets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Brasher was looking to make a good impression on the
players he had just been hired to coach. But during one of the
first defensive line meetings at training camp, he couldn't find
the videotape of that day's practice.
</P>
<P>
   As Brasher searched in vain, Kennedy shook in silent laughter in
the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Brasher did get even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made them watch the same tape over again, and the other
guys got on Cortez pretty good,'' he said with a smile of
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Kennedy's teammates, they didn't have the
authority to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite pranks in the dorm was to wait for another
player to get up and use the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Kennedy then would sneak into the room and hide in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd wait 'til you were back in bed, all comfy, then come
bounding out at you,'' defensive end Michael Sinclair said. ``And I
mean, that's intimidating _ a big ol' guy coming out of your closet
at midnight going, `Ahhhhhh.' Then he'd go down the hallway
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cortez is the real bogeyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair appreciates the serious side of Kennedy, and admires
what he feels is the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes with the expectations, the sense of urgency
that is here to win,'' Sinclair said. ``He doesn't have time to
fool around anymore. There are a lot of blitz packages we're
putting in. I find myself with my nose in the playbook at night. I
barely have time to even look at television.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've thrown so much at us, that even Cortez has had to get
in there and study.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dean Wells, for one, isn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't changed. He's just been a little more quiet than
usual this first week and a half,'' Wells said. ``Cortez is still
Cortez. He may take a few days off from joking around, but he lives
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming. Just wait. When the guys get a little flat,
Cortez is always there to say something goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day when Wells was asking Kennedy why he was being so
quiet during warmups, strength and conditioning coach Dana LeDuc
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dana told Dean, `Cortez is being so good because he's getting
ready to move into the front office after he retires,''' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a good laugh, Kennedy added: ``I guess it's only fair.
I've always been messin' with the guys and they're messin' with me
now.''

HOMERS CARRY RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ If baseball weren't a series of endless
tomorrows, Scott Hatteberg said, failure would be that much harder
to accept.
</P>
<P>
   But why worry about striking out four times in a game, Hatteberg
said, when you know that in the span of a single spin cycle, you
may have the chance to hit a home run?
</P>
<P>
   That's how it played out for the catcher, who hit one of three
Red Sox home runs Wednesday night in a 10-2 rout of the Oakland
A's, making it two wins in a row at the start of the team's longest
trip of the season, five in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Former A's pitcher John Wasdin, in his second start since
replacing the Korean Kid, Jin Ho Cho, in the Sox rotation, held his
former mates to two runs and six hits in six innings for his first
win this season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra also homered for the Red Sox,
who broke a 2-2 tie with four runs in the sixth. Garciaparra, who
has nine hits in his last four games, including three home runs,
hit his seventh homer since the All-Star break and 20th of the
season and seems as comfortable hitting cleanup as he did leadoff,
in the third spot, and in his backyard playing Wiffle Ball. He's
had three hits in both games here.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have had 11 extra-base hits in the two games,
have beaten the A's in all seven meetings this season. Oakland has
now lost nine in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jimy Williams shuffled his lineup, installing Garciaparra
in the No. 4 spot with Vaughn sandwiched between the shortstop and
No. 2 hitter John Valentin, the Sox have scored no fewer than five
runs in a game and are averaging 6.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess maybe I just had a gut feeling that was the best way
for us to go,'' the manager said. ``Put 'em in there, let 'em play.
I don't know how many games you use as a barometer, but you just do
what you think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the biggest difference he sees in Wasdin since his
return from Pawtucket is the use of his split-fingered fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having that split has helped him a lot,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe, who allowed just two hits in three scoreless
innings, was credited with his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's home run, a low line drive that traveled at
bullet-train speed into the left-field seats, came off A's loser
Mike Oquist and made it 3-2. Two outs later, Mike Benjamin drew a
walk and scored ahead of Hatteberg's ninth home run, one fewer than
he hit as a rookie last season. The Red Sox added another run when
DH Keith Mitchell, playing because Midre Cummings was a late
scratch with a sore right wrist, singled, stole second, and scored
on Darren Lewis's second single.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Hatteberg said he couldn't recall ever striking
out four times in a game, as he did Tuesday night. Hatteberg
whiffed twice against A's starter Jimmy Haynes, once against lefty
reliever Buddy Groom, and once against righty reliever T.J.
Mathews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that had happened to me when I was in the minor leagues, I
would have really been torn up,'' Hatteberg said. ``Sure, I was
upset, but we won the game and I realize, especially as a catcher,
that a lot of great hitters get punched out. It happened to me last
night, but baseball is just too difficult because it's
day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   With his right hamstring packed in more ice nightly than the
fish peddled back home on Atlantic Avenue, Vaughn was no threat to
add to the Red Sox' string of inside-the-park home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Vaughn made the same circuit as teammates
Garciaparra and Lewis on their inside-the-park jobs in the previous
two games, but at a more leisurely pace. Vaughn was credited with
his 26th home run of the season and first in 10 games when his
opposite-field drive in the fourth hit the glove of leaping left
fielder Rickey Henderson and struck the base of a TV camera set on
a platform just above the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ball came back to the field, Vaughn stopped at
second with what he assumed was a double. But third-base umpire Tim
Welke spun his right index finger, the signal that it was a home
run, the first extra-base hit of the night for the Red Sox after
six the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox added another run in the inning on singles by
Garciaparra, Darren Bragg, and Benjamin to tie the score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   After their uprising in the sixth, they iced the A's with a
four-run, five-hit ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a Bay area native, had three singles Wednesday night,
giving him five hits in the last two games here.

REVOLUTION'S RAPID DOWNFALL CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The ``Fort'' section behind the goal was
difficult to ignore Wednesday night during the Revolution's 3-1
loss to the Colorado Rapids at Foxboro Stadium. The fans chanted,
``Resig-nation,'' in place of ``Revo-lution,'' and ``Dead Man
Walking,'' referring to coach Thomas Rongen, who guided New England
to its eighth successive home defeat, extending its Major League
Soccer record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even heard it before the game started,'' Rongen said. ``I've
said the last five days that I am extremely disappointed in what
the team has done and extremely disappointed in my performance.
These fans deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the team in a position to win. We had more chances and
we didn't execute. We created more chances but we walk away with a
loss. The game plan was sound; unfortunately, we didn't pull the
trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have won twice, in Dallas and Tampa, since their
last home victory May 10. They have 16 points in 22 games, the
worst record in the league, but remain in contention for the final
playoff place with 10 games left.
</P>
<P>
   But though Rongen has been able to analyze the Revolution's
defeats, he has been unable to break the losing pattern. The
Revolution failed to control the midfield, partially a function of
having to move Dutchman Edwin Gorter to sweeper as the defense
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   And the defense failed again against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Balboa converted a free kick in the third minute as the
Revolution started slowly for the second successive time on a
three-game homestand. The Rapids had chances to increase their lead
before the Revolution tied the score as Raul Diaz Arce headed in
his 14th goal of the season on an Imad Baba cross in the 37th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution displayed little offensive cohesiveness,
they continued to threaten.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rapids broke the tie as Ross Paule fed Paul Bravo, who
chipped over goalkeeper Jeff Causey in the 21st minute of the
second half. Jamaican striker Wolde Harris, who replaced Waldir at
halftime, clinched the win in the 84th minute as the Revolution
made a desperate attempt to rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Revolution is struggling a little bit,'' Colorado coach
Glenn Myernick said. ``We never let them settle into their
formation, didn't let them get their rhythm, and put them back on
their heels early.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good players on the Revolution. They have
leaders within the team. I believe Thomas has enough leaders to
pull them out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, those leaders have been unable to change the Revolution's
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lack of execution in the final third is obvious,'' Rongen
said. ``We gave a goal and got down early, but it was not because
we defended poorly. To be put in that position is tough, especially
when everyone is playing for playoff positions. Every player is
pushing so hard to help the team that we have become our own worst
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado went to Adrian Paz on the right side early, and Paz
went past Janusz Michallik to cross, setting up the first goal.
Mike Burns failed to clear the cross, and Balboa was fouled by
Oscar Pareja 25 yards from the goal. Balboa then sent the free kick
low past the defensive wall and into the left side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, who host San Jose next Wednesday, attracted
13,074 fans, their lowest attendance since their May 10 win over
Tampa in a rainstorm.

REVOLUTION PLAYERS GET FANS' MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Their stretch of home futility now stands at
eight straight losses, a Major League Soccer record, but Wednesday
night at Foxboro Stadium, the Revolution got a graphic indication
of their sorry state that transcended mere statistics.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in their three-year existence, they heard
boos. At home. From the people renowned for being the most
supportive fans in the league.
</P>
<P>
   As they left the field following a 3-1 loss to the Colorado
Rapids, the Revolution heard undeniable evidence of the discord on
the home front as the crowd of 13,074 hooted them.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, these folks _ who are coming to the games in ever
dwindling numbers _ aren't happy. But neither are the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel sorry for the crowd,'' said sweeper Edwin Gorter. ``We
were talking about that before the game. This time they boo you.
That's normal. We give these people nothing and they get frustrated
just like us, but they have to pay for it and we get paid for it.
That's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction surprised Joe-Max Moore, but he could understand
it. ``I noticed it immediately because you usually don't hear it in
Foxboro,'' the third-year veteran forward said. ``They pay their
hard-earned money to come out and see us lose. It's disappointing
for them. It's normal across the world in terms of soccer teams
that don't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Team captain Mike Burns echoed those sentiments. ``It's to be
expected,'' he said. ``You look at our home games and the record we
have (3-8 in Foxborough). We don't like it but it's part of it, and
they had the right to boo us. If I knew what we should do, we'd do
it. I don't know what we should do. I'm at a loss for words right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Revolution can make amends by not falling behind
early. Wednesday night the Rapids took a 1-0 lead three minutes
into the game. ``What we need to do is go ahead sometimes, make it
1-0 for us and not always run behind a goal,'' said Gorter. ``Then
we had to play 30 minutes to make it 1-1. It costs a lot of energy.
It costs a lot of power. And then 10 minutes later, they score
again and you have to get a goal again.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the same old story _ the Revolution were forced to
gamble, and the next thing they knew, the Rapids were up, 3-1. ``If
it's 1-0 for us, they have to come and we can play counterattack,''
Gorter said. ``Now it's us who have to attack, attack, attack, and
you have to be afraid for the counterattack. We knew before the
game that this (Colorado) is a very good counter team.''
</P>
<P>
   With the All-Star break here, the Revolution don't play again
until next Wednesday when they face the San Jose Clash in their
third consecutive home game. No meetings are planned during the
hiatus. Everything's already been said. Several times, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say this is a big mistake, this is a big mistake,''
Gorter said. ``We all know that, but at this particular moment,
we're not able to resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Burns, ``Three years I've been in this situation, and
we've had players-only meetings and we've had coaches-and-players
meetings. We've had it all. The bottom line is we're not getting it
done.''

JOHNSON TRADE TALKS HEAT UP AS MARINERS GO COOL

<P>
   SEATTLE _ As of Wednesday night, the Mariners still hadn't let
Randy Johnson slip through their fingers. But their grip is
loosening.
</P>
<P>
   With an 8-7 loss to Cleveland a secondary issue, Seattle
appeared ready to pull the trigger on a multi-player trade
involving their disgruntled pitching ace, possibly as soon as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours into Wednesday night's game, the Madison Square Garden
sportswire reported and retracted that the Mariners had traded
Johnson and reliever Mike Timlin to the Yankees for starting
pitcher Hideki Irabu, closer Ramiro Mendoza and second baseman
Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in the Kingdome pressbox, Mariner president Chuck
Armstrong said no deal had been struck with New York Wednesday
night, acknowledging only that Seattle officials were talking with
several teams _ the club's first confirmation that Johnson was,
indeed, back on the trading block. On June 2, the Mariners
announced in a terse statement that the lefty would remain with the
team for the rest of the season and not be dealt.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also cautioned Wednesday night that a trade wouldn't
necessarily be made with the Yankees, apparently suggesting that
the Mariners were now receiving several offers for their pitching
ace and waiting to see who comes in with the best offer.
</P>
<P>
   With all this going on, a stone-faced Johnson was spotted by a
television camera peeking out of the clubhouse tunnel while Timlin
was seated in the bullpen, laughing. Timlin later would pitch to
three batters in the ninth, and come up with three outs.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, manager Lou Piniella was in no mood to talk about
possible transactions involving his club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to talk to Woody about trades,'' he said, referring
to Woody Woodward, vice president of baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin was surprised to hear about the latest rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I've heard of it. Tell me about it,'' Timlin
said. ``I'm still here and they haven't called me or told me
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman David Segui called the trade rumors ``just part of
the game.'' But he said he hadn't ``seen anything so far that
seemed worth the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering what happened Wednesday night, a deal couldn't come
soon enough. Shoddy defense and inconsistent relief pitching fueled
the Mariners' second straight defeat to Cleveland at home.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 7, the Indians' Jim Thome decided things
in the eighth inning, belting his 29th homer into the right-field
seats off reliever Greg McCarthy. The defeat dropped the Mariners
10 games behind AL West-leading Anaheim, which was a 10-5 winner
over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella didn't hide his desire for some much-needed relief
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland has a good bullpen and we're losing a lot of close
games to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle entered the contest with the third-highest error total
in the big leagues, 97, and added two more _ on the same play. That
effectively killed another efficient offensive output, one that
included a three-run homer by Jay Buhner to erase a 7-4 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner miscues were hard to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Normally steady Ken Griffey Jr. had a first-inning fly ball
deflect off his glove in center for what initially was ruled an
error, leading to the Indians' first run. An inning later, after
much consultation, the play was ruled a single.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reversing the next two Mariner bumbles, both coming
on the same, bizarre play.
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle clinging to a 4-3 lead, and the Indians' Jeff
Branson on first, Kenny Lofton dropped a bunt down the third-base
line. There to greet it was Mariner third baseman Russ Davis and
his team-high 27 errors.
</P>
<P>
   He threw the ball into the Indian bullpen for No. 28.
</P>
<P>
   As Lofton sped around the bases, the play was far from done.
Buhner tracked the ball down near the bench behind the practice
mound and came up firing. Third base was his target. Unfortunately,
no one except Lofton was there when the ball arrived, with Davis
still lingering near the plate. Lofton was awarded home when the
ball skipped into the stands. Buhner was awarded the error, his
first of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When the inning was mercifully over, Cleveland had sent 10 men
to the plate and scored six runs, and Seattle's starting pitcher,
Ken Cloude, had taken a seat on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cloude wasn't too sharp,'' Piniella said. ``We got him four
runs real quick and gave them back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Mariners batted around for four runs, plating
them on RBI singles by Alex Rodriguez, Buhner and Davis, and a
run-scoring double by Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Buhner lunged at a Jaret Wright delivery and
swatted it to right-center for a homer, scoring Edgar Martinez, who
had walked, and David Segui, who had singled. The Mariners now have
a major league-best 162 homers.

POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM LEWINSKY SCANDAL IN PUBLIC'S HANDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again, President Clinton stands on familiar
territory _ a precipice _ and few people seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the political ramifications of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal seem few for the president, experts say. Many citizens
already have made up their minds about the alleged dalliance and
the alleged cover-up and have moved on to other issues more
important to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `Perils of Pauline.' He's always tied to the train tracks
and always escapes, or up to this point,'' said Stephen Hess, a
presidential expert with the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prospect of presidential perjury and obstruction of
justice, if it is a clear-cut and sustained pattern, could rouse
some public ire and force Congress to do what few lawmakers want to
do before the November elections _ hold hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of charges
the president had an affair with Lewinsky when she was a
21-year-old intern and urged her to lie about it appears to be
nearing an end. Lewinsky will testify under immunity and on Aug. 17
Clinton will answer prosecutors' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, the American people have shrugged their
shoulders and if they continue to shrug their shoulders all it is
is another embarrassment for the president. If they start to turn
against him so everyone will be reading those poll figures as if
they are Holy Grail around here, then Congress may have no choice
but to follow up,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   The political impact on the president depends on whether the
public pulse quickens over any revelations in the next few weeks.
``This is in the hands of the people and the people's court,'' Hess
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a California political commentator, said,
``I don't get the sense that anybody outside the beltway gives a
whiff at this point in time. As long as the focus remains on the
Lewinsky matter, as long as the issue under debate is did he have
sex, this is not going to capture the attention of the American
public. This is not a constitutional crisis. If it becomes a debate
on a constitutional crisis then this may change.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts say the main reason for this national yawn: money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a case of much ado about nothing. People often vote
their pocketbooks and the president is keeping people's pocketbooks
filled,'' said Robert Stein, a Rice University pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy falls, I think the president will be victim to
anything and everything. If the economy holds up, I just doubt
there will be moral indignation. A substantial majority believe the
president had an affair and they are not greatly distressed by
that,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Stein also said Republicans could face a backlash if the
investigations into Clinton start spooking the stock market and
prompt even more declines. ``There are a lot of baby boomers
looking at their retirement accounts grow, and grow wildly, and if
anything threatens it, they're going to say why did you have to
impeach a president whose economy was roaring because he couldn't
keep his zipper zipped,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Howard Baker, the former Senate Majority Leader who
served on the Watergate committee, said he doubted the case would
lead to impeachment, a murky procedure steeped in politics by its
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to tell. My guess is no it won't. My guess is
the president will be severely embarrassed. My guess is there will
be ample grounds for impeachment inquiry by the House of
Representatives, which must go first. It probably will never reach
the Senate,'' Baker said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Baker added, ``that's not based so much on the law, which is
murky on impeachment by any measure, but the politics. In fairness,
I don't think anybody wants to handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Starr's investigation began in January, Clinton
consistently has garnered 60 percent or greater support in polls
for his job performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people so far have said that his job performance
counts for a lot more than the `he said, she said' argument which
most people don't care about. I think the person who ultimately has
suffered in terms of professional reputation is Mr. Starr,''
contended Lanny Davis, a former White House lawyer, appearing on
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's probe is reaching a critical point just 100 days
before the Nov. 3 elections that determine the party majority
controlling Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend they have a good shot at regaining the House
and Clinton is the main attraction in party plans to raise $18
million for its candidates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were reports that Democrats warned the White
House they would not spring to the president's defense, another
said most members, awed by Clinton's survival abilities, want to
wait and see what happens before pronouncing Clinton as politically
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans since January have planned for a short congressional
session so they could return to the campaign trial and defend their
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incumbents don't want to rock the boat,'' Jeffe said. Still,
she noted Clinton's appearance in California at mid-month to raise
money for Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer and gubernatorial candidate
Gray Davis will be interesting to watch for signs of a political
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Republicans run a
political risk by fanning the impeachment flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans want to be known as the party of
investigation instead of legislation; the party of partisanship
instead of progress, then I believe the voters will punish them.
That's the risk they run,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official signaled that Clinton will maintain there was no
sexual relationship with Lewinsky. ``The truth is the truth. I
believe the president told the truth. I don't doubt him. I believe
him,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jeffe noted, many people have a different take: ``If you
can't lie about sex, what can you lie about?''

GAINS FOR BLACK MARRIED COUPLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAMON G. MCLEOD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   African American married couples have made progress toward
income equality with whites in the 1990s, but such gains have been
modest or nonexistent for millions of other blacks, according to a
report to be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Census Bureau also found that blacks now number
34.2 million, or almost 13 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Any study that tries to identify trends in such a large segment
of the nation has to be approached with care, and census officials
were at pains to point out that using a wide brush to paint a
picture of this group would be as foolhardy as doing so with
whites, Latinos or Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are some clear patterns in the data, which
is based on an annual survey of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   The most encouraging is the narrowing of the income gap between
black and white married couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the brightest spot, the area where the most rapid
gains are being made,'' said census bureau demographer Claudette
Bennett, author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the median income for a black married couple was
$41,963, roughly 83 percent of the median income of a white married
couple, which was determined to be $50,190. In 1990, black couples
made 80 percent of what white couples made.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, only 46 percent of black families are headed
by a married couple versus 80 percent of white families.
Single-parent families headed by a black woman had an income of
only $15,530 in 1996. White women who were single parents had
significantly more: $24,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying problem of families and incomes can be tied
right back to what's happened in our cities for the last 30 years
with the disappearance of manufacturing,'' said Maria Casey,
president of Urban Strategies Council in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are no jobs, people don't get married,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Education levels have continued to rise for African Americans,
with nearly 75 percent of those over age 25 having completed high
school and more than 13 percent earning at least a bachelor's
degree. In 1990, only 66 percent had a high school diploma and 11
percent had a bachelor's.
</P>
<P>
   About 86 percent of whites over age 25 have finished high
school, and roughly one-quarter have a bachelor's.
</P>
<P>
   Casey said the improvement in education is positive, but is
still not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids may be graduating from high school, but what kind of high
school?'' she said. ``They're doing their part, but we have not
upgraded our schools nor have we provided the level of investment
in education that is necessary for them to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty rates continue to be stubbornly high. In 1996, about 26
percent of black families had income below the official federal
poverty lines. This is down a bit from 1993 when 31 percent were
poor, the worst time in this decade. However, black family poverty
rates have bounced between 26 and 33 percent since the 1970s. White
family poverty rates have been between 6 and 11 percent during the
same period.

BLOOD TESTS ADD TO CANCER STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sixteen years ago, more than a million Americans
agreed to reveal nearly every detail of their lives and family
histories _ their health and illnesses, their smoking and drinking,
the medicines they used, the foods they ate, and their environment
from infancy to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   It was all in the interests of cancer research: one of the
largest efforts ever undertaken to ferret out the risk factors in
cancer and find new clues to prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the participants have been followed up regularly
with fresh questionnaires, and although more than 135,000 have
died, the rest remain in the continuing survey.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in an attempt to take the research a critical step
further, the first of more than 1,200 men and women from the San
Francisco Bay area from the original study bared their arms and
added samples of their blood to the long and intimate records of
their lives _ records maintained by researchers since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide study, initiated by the American Cancer Society,
has already yielded vital information on cancer and human
lifestyles; now, with the addition of blood samples to the data,
new scientific information will emerge on the roles that genetics
and molecular biology play in the many forms of cancer, which will
kill an estimated 565,000 Americans this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of 40 volunteer blood donors in the study lined
up Wednesday at a pathology laboratory next to the Mount Diablo
Medical Center in Concord, Calif., and more will soon do the same
at other Bay Area medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the immense project, 77,000 American Cancer
Society volunteers throughout the country helped enroll the 1.2
million participants: people willing to answer highly confidential
questionnaires covering nearly 400 aspects of their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of survey data, analyzed by epidemiologists at major
research centers, has long been mined for detailed lifestyle data,
but the blood of the participants will open new lodes.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 who gave blood samples in Concord were all veterans of
questionnaires, which they have filled out every year or two. They
filled out more as they waited their turn to donate.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid bias in the ultimate analysis of the samples, all the
donors remained anonymous, but most were remarkably similar:
Elderly or close to it, veterans of previous blood donor drives,
eager to help push research forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing something like this is the only way they're ever going
to find a cure,'' said a Concord woman, who confessed she had
fainted many years ago as a first-time blood donor, but never
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given 100 pints to the Alameda-Contra Costa Blood Bank,
so this is nothing new for me,'' said a healthy, upright
74-year-old Walnut Creek man who worked for 34 years at the Alameda
Naval Air Station, has been married for 56 years, and counts four
granddaughters and eight great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have a buddy from our working days who's in hospice care
with pancreatic cancer,'' he said. ``Answering all these questions
and giving a little blood today won't help my friend, but maybe
it'll help our great-grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey has already yielded important preventive information.
Results have shown that in many people, the moderate use of aspirin
and similar nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs significantly
reduces the risk of cancers of the colon, rectum, esophagus and
stomach, which are expected to strike more than 165,000 Americans
this year, the cancer society estimates.
</P>
<P>
   And among the post-menopausal women in the survey, the use of
estrogen replacement therapy also appeared to reduce the risk of
colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, more than 60 scientific reports have been published
in medical journals as a result of the cancer society's large-scale
survey, according to Dr. Donald Beerline, a Concord pathologist and
board member of the cancer society's California division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned an enormous amount from our prevention study
already,'' Beerline said, ``but what's exciting now is that because
of all the advances in genetics and molecular biology over the past
15 years, having very large numbers of blood samples will allow us
to link the behavioral and lifestyle data to biology for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, the cancer society plans to collect samples
from 40,000 to 60,000 of the study's volunteer subjects. Each
sample should yield at least 100 sub-samples that will be made
available to cancer researchers for molecular and genetic analysis,
Beerline said.

BREAST CANCER STAMP GOES ON SALE THURSDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a first for the U.S. Postal Service, a premium
first-class stamp will be sold Thursday with proceeds going to fund
breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-cent stamp will sell for 40 cents, with the extra 8 cents
divided between the National Institutes of Health and the Medical
Research Program of the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative program is the brainstorm of Sacramento surgeon
Ernie Bodai, who has performed more than 1,200 mastectomies or
lumpectomies and witnessed first-hand the destructive effects of
the disease that will affect 1 in 9 American women.
</P>
<P>
   Bodai enlisted the help of Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Sacramento, and
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who wrote the legislation that
authorized the fund-raising stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``To break precedent in Washington isn't an easy thing to do,''
Feinstein said. ``Many people said that a stamp to raise money for
breast cancer could not be done. But you should never underestimate
California ingenuity.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million U.S. women have breast cancer, but half
have yet to be diagnosed. For years, the Bay Area had among the
highest breast cancer rates in the nation, although in recent years
those rates have dropped and now more closely mirror the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton showed off the colorful stamp at a White
House ceremony Wednesday, urging the public to spend the extra
money and ``help stamp out breast cancer once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are not surgeons,'' she said, and are not in a
position to do much about the epidemic that claims a life
approximately every 12 minutes. ``But each of us can buy this
stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service has printed 200 million breast cancer stamps,
which will be on sale for the next two years. If they are all sold,
$16 million will go to cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp was designed by a Maryland woman who is a breast
cancer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   The design features the mythological Roman goddess Diana,
pulling an arrow out of a quiver. Her right arm is raised behind
her head in a position recommended by health care professionals for
breast self-examination. Encircling her right breast are the words
``Fund the fight. Find a cure.''
</P>
<P>
   The money-raising effort is a first for the U.S. Postal Service
_ a technique it calls ``semi-postal,'' meaning part postal and
part charity. The same method has been tried with mixed success in
other countries _ including Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada _
according to Postal Service spokesman Don Smeraldi.
</P>
<P>
   Smeraldi said a portion of the additional 8 cents paid by
customers will be tax-deductible. Seventy percent of the proceeds
will go to the NIH, and 30 percent to the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation had an easy time passing in Congress, where
Republican Senators Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth
of North Carolina, and former Republican Rep. Susan Molinari of New
York joined the California authors.
</P>
<P>
   They were aided in a persistent lobbying effort by Bodai as well
as David Goodman, a San Francisco man who lost his wife of 38 years
to breast cancer, and Betsy Mullen of WIN Against Breast Cancer in
Los Angeles, a breast cancer survivor. All three were on hand at
Wednesday's White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the words, `Mrs. Mullen, you have breast
cancer,' I felt like I had been hit by a freight train,'' Mullen
told a crowd of more than 100 politicians, health care providers,
breast cancer survivors and reporters gathered in the East Room.
``This is a a novel opportunity to involve all of us in a fight to
find a cure.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stamps were sold at Washington, D.C., post offices
Wednesday afternoon, and they will go on sale across the country
Thursday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WANT TO TAKE IT WITH YOU?
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 2.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When our son Sam was born 21 years ago, we got him
a Social Security number that he'll keep for life. Someday, Sam's
kids are likely to have personal phone numbers that they can keep
for life no matter where they live or how often they move.
</P>
<P>
   The initial phase of the telecom technology upgrade, known as
local number portability (LNP), should be in place in the nation's
top 100 markets by the end of the year. In due course, number
portability should expand from current capabilities _ to keep a
number when you change local providers _ to span services in any of
the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   By next June, LNP should also be in place for wireless phones,
along with nationwide roaming. To keep track of ported numbers,
U.S. telecoms tap a huge database at the Number Portability
Administration Center.
</P>
<P>
   We are a mobile society. Mindful that each year one in every
four phone customers moves, Congress wrote the LNP rules into the
1996 Telecom Act. (An added benefit: improved digit ecology. Too
many moving days, fax machines and cell phones are chewing up
stocks of available numbers.)
</P>
<P>
   But it could cost as much as $4 billion in extra computer power
to turn what Congress wants into a universal reality. And someone
has got to pay for it all.
</P>
<P>
   So, after Feb. 1, 1999, both business and residential users will
be charged an extra monthly fee, for five years, to let phone
companies recover their costs. While the fee has yet to be set,
it's likely to be between 50 and 75 cents a month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that eventual full geographic portability,
boundless fiber capacity and Internet-based phone services could
spawn what economists call ``distance-insensitive pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will only be one pricing scheme for telephony,'' writes
Jerry Lucas in his TeleStrategies Insight newsletter. ``Customers
will pay a flat rate for unlimited calls anywhere in the United
States, but will pay on a per-call basis for terminating on
wireless or international networks,'' Lucas adds.
</P>
<P>
   With portability, demand for 800 numbers and other toll-free
services should recede. Using related intelligent network
technology, marketers could snatch up useful seven-digit numbers
uniformly in every area code. (All local phone calls from anywhere
to ``CANDIES'' could be routed to, say, a given Florida-based
business. The actual candies would then be sent from local shops to
local sites.)
</P>
<P>
   LNP minders worry that, while we'll all pony up, not all of us
will benefit, at least at first. Says Federal Communications
Commission chairman William Kennard: ``We should not ask consumers
to pay for number portability before they are able to enjoy the
benefits of the competitive options that number portability is
designed to facilitate.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people need to have a Social Security number. But LNP will
roll out as an optional feature. Unless it catches on quickly,
telephone rates will go up for the many to lend a helping hand to
the portable few.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most folks won't mind seeing that extra 50 cents or so
on their monthly phone bills come early next year. But if they do,
the feds could find they've dialed the wrong number.

   1. SOUND AND SCIENCE : LEARNING TO TUNE OUT THE NOISE
</P>
<P>
   AND HEAR THE WORLD We listen to the world selectively,
subjectively. The sound of a thundering waterfall puts us in a good
mood ; a dripping tap can irritate us to the point of rage. But we
simply tune out many sounds. We (wrongly) think of woods and fields
as silent places. And we ignore the fact that every mountain, every
market, every voice creates its own sound-aura. The world is an
orchestra, with man creating most of the false notes. A growing
brotherhood of ``sound-scapers,'' armed with microphones and
recorders, has been trying to document the world's sounds -- before
fast-encroaching noice pollution drowns out the very sounds of the
Earth. By Dirk Lehmann. From GEO magazine. 1,500 words. (English
translation available.) 2. WOMEN SHOW THE WORLD ABOUT GRACE UNDER
PRESSURE Life delivers no end of opportunities to show grace under
pressure and behave with dignity and style when something is
greatly upsetting us. What does it take to be a Jacqueline Kennedy
or a Hillary Rodham Clinton? Sherry Suib Cohen offers advice on
where to find outside support and inner strength. From McCall's
magazine. 1,100 words. 3. CAFFEINE : DEBATE STILL BREWS OVER ITS
PROS AND CONS Because it's a drug that can cause a mild dependency,
caffeine has gained a bad reputation. But warnings about mental
illness and birth defects are groundless, experts say. Athletes do,
however, report improved performance. By Ken McAlpine. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
WHERE IS DIANA? As the first anniversary of the death of Princess
Diana approaches, theologian Philip Nobile asks whether she is in
heaven or hell. From Prospect magazine. 1,300 words. (N/A UK)
________________________________________________________ 5. AN EVEN
BRIEFER HISTORY OF TIME Stephen Hawking retraces the genesis of his
Brief History of Time and considers what has happened in cosmology
since the book was published. From Prospect magazine. (N/A UK.)

   6. LOOK BEFORE TAKING THE PLUNGE WITH A POOL It's hot and you'd
love to have a pool in the backyard ... Here are some decisions to
make before you become a pool owner. By Kathy Sena. 1,000 words
plus 300-word sidebar. 7. BLIND PHOTOGRAPHER PROVES EYESIGHT ISN'T
ALL YOU NEED A former fashion photographer who has lost more than
90 per cent of his eyesight continues to practice his art, with
even greater success. By Ben Widdicombe. 1,200 words + photo. (N/A
Britain and Australia.)

corridors (microfluidics) B. All About Adam : Men may come out on
top after all, when it comes to beating a path through the jungle
of human history. C. Sunny Side Up : If solar activity is
responsible for changes in climate, could human polluters be

DISEASE REPORTED IN FRANCE French doctors report they are seeing
more and more patients afflicted with a new muscle disease which
causes painful inflammation. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News
Service. 1,000 words. 10. WHO ARE NETANYAHU'S STAUNCH SUPPORTERS?
Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu. By
Ehud Sprinzak. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 11.
PALESTINIANS HAVE REACHED THEIR LIMITS As the grand old man of
Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's personal influence and
political wiles have let him dominate and change Palestinian
politics in a way no other figure could. But Arafat will not live
forever, and Hamas, the radical Islamist group, will not stay on
the sidelines forever. By Khalil Shikaki. From Foreign Affairs
magazine. 2,000 words.

THE WAGES OF SIN LOOK PRETTY GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to corporate fraud, the obvious question that you
have to ask is: ``Why does anyone think they can get away with
it?'' But when you look at the sweetheart deal that Walter Forbes,
chairman of scandal-plagued Cendant, will get after announcing
Tuesday that he will resign, the answer seems obvious: ``Because
even when you get caught, the right people can still take home a
truckload of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of the Cendant scandal are by now well known, though
familiarity has not made them any less astonishing. Over the course
of the past three years, high-ranking executives at CUC
International (Forbes' old company, which merged with HFS to form
Cendant) routinely booked phony revenues in order to meet analysts'
estimates. At the end of each year, when accountants came in to
perform their annual audits, these same executives cooked the books
by moving future revenues into the current fiscal year and by
simply falsifying records. In total, CUC reported as much as $300
million in non-existent earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of this, Forbes was determined to stay in
office at Cendant and to become CEO of the company in the year
2000. But last Friday saw 44 Cendant executives take the remarkable
step of signing a public letter calling on him to resign or be
fired, and Henry Silverman, Cendant's current CEO, has been
distancing himself from Forbes almost from the beginning of this
debacle. Since the Cendant board was equally divided between former
HFS and former CUC directors, Forbes' position within the company
was relatively unassailable. But even Forbes had to see that it's
impossible to run a company when most of its managers think you're
either a crook or a shnook.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has always insisted, and continues to insist, that he
knew nothing about the fraud at CUC. That seems, on the one hand,
utterly improbable. On the other hand, if true it indicates a level
of managerial incompetence that is hard to reconcile with Forbes'
public image as a ``technological visionary'' who had transformed
the landscape of retailing. CUC's entire business was built on
getting customers to sign up for buyers' clubs. It didn't have
inventory in the classic sense, nor was it building giant factories
all around the globe. If Forbes wasn't paying close attention to
the revenue these buyers'-club memberships were generating, what,
exactly, was he doing?
</P>
<P>
   Setting up deals, apparently. The CUC-HFS merger, which brought
Forbes four million shares in Cendant stock, worth at the time
something like $100 million, instantly transformed CUC into a
retailing powerhouse. CUC's stock had languished for almost a year
before the merger, and although the market initially reacted
negatively to the deal, within a couple of months the company was
being compared to powerhouses like Cisco, Microsoft and Disney
because of the supposed reliability of its growth prospects. Those
growth prospects, of course, were based on numbers that CUC execs
picked from the ether.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, to be more accurate, they picked the numbers from
analysts' projected targets for the company. In that sense, Walter
Forbes is one of the first CEOs in memory whose career was
destroyed because his company hit, rather than missed, estimates.
And his demise is testimony to the truly dark side of the emphasis
on ``shareholder value.'' When companies are more concerned with
propping up their stock prices than running their businesses, it's
hardly surprising that fraud starts to seem like a reasonable tool.
</P>
<P>
   The real story of what happened to Walter Forbes will be well
worth reading if it ever comes out. For the spectacle of the last
few months has resembled nothing so much as a melodrama set in some
Third World kleptocracy, with Forbes the tinpot dictator holding
out and refusing to accept what everyone already knew--that his
future was over. Less than a year ago, Forbes was acclaimed by
Wired magazine as the man who was ``inventing the future of
retailing.'' Today, he's the man who wrecked a company. But, like
all deposed autocrats, he's leaving with lots of gold packed into
his suitcases. Forbes' severance package will total $48 million,
including $35 million in cash. Who says crime ... well, you know
the rest.

   Re: Joyce, or better don't
</P>
<P>
   Cher Maitre,
</P>
<P>
   Saw ``Wings of the Dove'' last evening &AMP; was very impressed. So
that was what it was all about! Your writing has no bigger fan than
EW, but I must admit to finding some of the later novels a bit,
shall we say, murky. Large &AMP; charming party at the Cineplex
Odeon--the young Waldorf Astors, Mr. Balfour, Ld &AMP; Lady Elcho,
Dcess of Manchester, Lady Essex, &AMP;c. &AMP;c. All seemed delighted but
for poor Teddy, who ran screaming from the theater during the first
reel--his nerves, no doubt. Miss Bonham Carter was splendid. She
ought to play Lily Barth if ``The House of Mirth'' ever makes it
out of turnaround. Is it true they're giving the Merchant-Ivory
treatment to your ``Golden Bowl''? Can't say I ever made it quite
to the end of that one either.
</P>
<P>
   Have you looked over the Modern Library list yet? As Scribner
authors, neither of us is likely to find much favor in a list of
books sold by Mr. Cerf. Still, I fear that to the younger
generation we must represent the literary equivalent of tufted
furniture and gas chandeliers. ``Ulysses,'' alas, is No. 1. Have
you driven into this fog? It's a turgid welter of pornography (the
rudest schoolboy kind) &AMP; uninformed &AMP; unimportant drivel. The
ingredients of soup do not make soup without the cook's
intervention. The same goes for Mr. Kerouac.

   Re: 100 romans
</P>
<P>
   Dearest Edith,
</P>
<P>
   The drab unblinking question that presents itself is that
``compilation'' to which you refer, whose arrival, though
unwelcome, is in no way resistible. Of the part that is mine to
pass over in silence is perhaps the course both of humility and of
humilite. That the number of my own works chosen should be trois is
a matter for neither protestation nor ingratitude. Yet that such an
ordering hardly induces in the author of the aforementioned trois
such satisfaction as might be hoped to accrue to one looking down
with Olympian detachment from beyond the vale of longevity is a
statement the validity of which cannot be called readily into
question. It is unlikely to fail to play upon the suspicions of
such a one that the composition of his most highly esteemed should
be that most lately converted into a wan cinematic confection of
fretsome abbreviation. Neither, however, could a figure such as he
neglect the observation that the personage with whom the former is
now abstractly in conversation was accorded the merit of only deux
livres, and that those deux were accorded a position more
terrestrial, which is to say well below those of the former on the
``list.'' Such a ``point,'' once made, could not resist the
tendency to instill feelings of ``envy'' and ressentiment on the
part of an author perhaps better compensated and perhaps more
``popular,'' but in the view of the critical intelligence--if any
such fitful and discredited light may still be conceived as being
within our sphere--not really as good as mine. Thus it is an
expression of both discretion and a great humble reverence for the
feelings of others to leave such a ``point'' unmade and unwinced
at.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may be additionally unpenworthy, there is another
``point'' that heavily impels making. It is that of all the
volumes, some eminent, some too much esteemed in the trail of
``fashion,'' there is one included that so transgresses the
hesitational boundary of propriety as to induce a feeling of
stammering dyspepsia. Attention is called to the uncouth Mr. Roth,
whose effluviations are so juvenalianly unspeakable that I cannot
bear to utter their ``title.'' This work, it cannot be refrained
from being pointed out, has as its chief topic that exercise that
in our own great palmy day was considered least worthy of writerly
elucidation. That this basely erotic occupation that was to our own
contemporaries so unsupportable should form the core of the work in
question might be thought to constitute a disqualification. To such
vulgarian depths does this ``fascination'' descend that there is in
one place depicted an act of rank unsalubrious congress between him
and a comestible whose ingestion by familial others is ineluctably
and tenebrously foreordained. I speak here of the ``liver'' scene.
For a work whose ``climax'' depends on feelings of the most
passionate revulsion to be esteemed ahead of your own labors, so
far superior as to be undeserving of inclusion in the same
tormented sentence, is, my dearest Edith, an insult insufferable to
all whose reverence for literature anglais is to be warranted. To
commiserate against so great and gaping an injustice presents
itself as a course of action perhaps less unwise than others.

THE SECRET SERVICE'S REAL SECRET
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month ((July)), the federal courts accomplished something
no president, congressional committee, government agency, or
private organization has been able to: They said ``no'' to the
Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the ``protective function privilege'' has raised
complicated, delicate, and important questions about presidential
privacy and the obligations of the Secret Service. Is the Secret
Service a Praetorian Guard that can abet an imperial president in
sleaze and coverup? How do we reconcile the president's privacy
with law enforcement's demands? While the courts have settled the
legal issue (for the moment), pundits continue to masticate these
questions dutifully.
</P>
<P>
   But something is being overlooked in the privilege squabble:
other complicated, delicate and even more important questions about
the Secret Service. Notably: Are there any limits on the amount of
money we will spend to protect the president? Is it healthy for a
democracy to surround its president with a bloated paramilitary
security apparatus?
</P>
<P>
   The real worry about the Secret Service is not, as the privilege
spat suggests, that the president has too much control over it. The
real worry is that no one has control over it. The Secret Service's
rise is one of the most remarkable and unremarked stories of
government in the last 40 years. In an age of open and (ostensibly)
frugal public administration, the Secret Service is an anomaly, an
agency that operates with nearly as much secrecy as the CIA and
spends almost as freely as its heart desires. How has this
happened?
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service was established in 1865 to fight
counterfeiting. It began guarding the president regularly in 1901,
after the assassination of President William McKinley, but remained
a modest enterprise until John F. Kennedy's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Secret Service has experienced the kind of
growth that, well, only stockholders in software companies have
come to expect. In 1957, it spent $3.5 million and employed 450.
This year, the Secret Service costs taxpayers about $590 million
and employs more than 4,600 people--including 2,000 special agents
(whose responsibilities include presidential protection) and 1,200
officers in the uniformed division.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is evidence of the Iron Law of Bureaucratic
Growth: An agency unchecked by outside forces expands. The service
asks, and it is given. For fiscal 1999, it requested $594,657,000
in federal funding (an increase of more than 5 percent over its
$564 million base--it receives about $30 million more in other
appropriations). The House just passed the Secret Service
appropriations bill, and how much did the agency get? Exactly
$594,657,000.
</P>
<P>
   Congress stiffs other federal programs, but all the Secret
Service's desires are fulfilled: $6 million for four armor-plated
limousines, $3 million for Y2K conversion, millions to pay for
extra travel expenses, $62 million to beef up White House security,
including new bulletproof windows, air defenses and 27 extra
security staffers. (Not that the public can find out much about how
the Secret Service spends its money: Details about how the
president is protected are classified. The agency has even removed
White House floor plans from the Library of Congress.)
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is untouchable. Congress is terrified of
scrimping on it. ``No one ever wants to not fully fund it,'' says a
congressional appropriations staffer. ``No one ever wants to be the
one who is responsible for risk or danger to the president.''
Another staffer asks, ``If they say it's necessary for the safety
of the president, who is going to say no?''
</P>
<P>
   The media, too, are reluctant to criticize: The last major story
to question the Secret Service appeared in the New Republic in
January 1981. (Two months later, Reagan was shot.) When the Secret
Service does attract notice, it tends to receive coverage best
described as Protection Porn.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service does not hesitate to exploit its Dead
President advantage, practicing an elegant variation of ``Fireman
First'' (a classic bureaucratic defense mechanism--when your budget
is threatened, propose cutting the fire department). On the rare
occasions the service is queried, it invokes the Dead President. A
month after the Oklahoma City bombing, and without a hearing, the
Secret Service shut Pennsylvania Avenue and surrounding streets to
traffic. Washingtonians complained. The service declared it was
necessary for the safety of the White House and the president. The
avenue stays closed.
</P>
<P>
   The privilege squabble, in fact, marks the first time the Dead
President defense has failed. In Justice Department briefs and in
private meetings, the Secret Service insisted that the failure to
recognize the privilege: would result in ``profound and predictable
peril'' to the president, ``could mean the difference between life
or death,'' would endanger ``the integrity of our national
security,'' etc. The appeals court rapped the agency for its scare
tactics, saying it must base its conclusions ``on solid facts and a
realistic appraisal of the danger rather than on vague fears
extrapolated beyond any foreseeable threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is not incompetent or corrupt, or even
especially greedy. In fact, it is almost universally admired for
its professionalism and efficiency. Even so, its ascendancy is
troublesome. It has made standard--even admired--measures that
ought to be intolerable in a democracy. A half-century ago, a
president could drive through city streets in a normal car with a
few bodyguards, and anyone could stroll up to the front door of the
White House. Of course, ours is a different and more dangerous age:
There are undoubtedly more and more sophisticated threats to the
president than we can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   But the expansion of the Secret Service has normalized a
paramilitary presidency. No one blinks at: 40-car motorcades that
shut down interstates and gridlock traffic, the 200-plus-strong
Secret Service delegation that accompanies the president abroad,
the transformation of the open White House into an impenetrable
fortress.
</P>
<P>
   During public events, it is perfectly acceptable for Secret
Service agents to approach crowd members and yank their hands out
of their pockets to confirm they are not hiding weapons. It is
unquestioned that the president should be chauffeured in a car that
costs $1.5 million. It has become a deep inconvenience for average
citizens to see their president, and a deep inconvenience for the
president to see average citizens. There is something unseemly
about this excessive security, and something undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., perhaps the only lawmaker
who ever criticized the Secret Service before the privilege flap,
said in a 1992 Senate speech that the agency has made the
``insufferable'' routine. ``I don't know if the agency itself is
aware of how arrogant and presumptuous it has become.'' Two years
ago, Moynihan remarked that soon, the service will ``have a
billion-dollar budget. And still just one president, one vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that the Secret Service's precautions are definitively
unnecessary. It's that no one knows whether they are necessary and
no one is willing to ask. Perfection is impossible in presidential
security. No matter how much we spend, the goal will always recede.
A determined assassin will be able to find a way to kill the
president. And the Secret Service will be able to find a way to
spend more money to prevent it. (In fact, the agency seems to have
found most of those ways already.)
</P>
<P>
   No one wants the president assassinated. But should it be
forbidden to ask if we could spend less and do less to protect him?

HIGH AND MIGHTY 
</HEADLINE>
  By SETH STEVENSON 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new It Girl on television these days--a pale, sexy,
raccoon-eyed waif who looks like an advertisement for shooting
heroin. The twist: The commercial is an ad for not shooting heroin.
The waif smashes china and plumbing fixtures in the commercial,
screaming angrily about how heroin will ruin your life.
</P>
<P>
   The waif spot is one of a series of new anti-drug commercials
that the government will pay $1 billion to air over the next five
years. The ads are produced by the Partnership for a Drug-Free
America--the best funded and best connected propaganda machine in
America today. It's backed by the president, the speaker of the
House, both parties in Congress, the biggest of big corporations
and foundations, the advertising industry and the major media.
</P>
<P>
   The slickness and pervasiveness of the campaign conceals one
flaw: The message--that all drug use leads to disaster--is a
baldfaced lie.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1986 by a group of advertising execs, the PDFA's
stated goal is to produce and place ads that persuade kids not to
try drugs, to ``denormalize'' adult drug use and to make drug use
``less acceptable.'' Its latest TV ads--created pro bono by leading
ad agencies--will saturate prime time this year thanks to a budget
in excess of what Nike or Sprint spent on TV advertising in 1997.
(The PDFA once relied on donated airtime, but in these flush days
network time is at a premium, hence the requisition of taxpayers'
funds.) The budget dwarfs even the public service ad campaign run
during World War II in support of the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   The ads focus solely on kids. In addition to the waif ad is one
that depicts a little girl answering questions. Lesson: Her mother
has told her not to talk to strangers but hasn't told her drugs are
bad. In another ad, a father and son sit at the breakfast table in
silence. Lesson: This time could have been spent talking about how
drugs are bad.
</P>
<P>
   Some have attacked the efficacy of these ads. Indeed, no study
conclusively demonstrates a link between them and reduced drug use.
Few have slammed the hypocrisy of the politicians and the ad agency
staffers behind this campaign, who can't all be drug virgins. But
the greater scandal is the free pass that reporters, most of whom
have imbibed, have granted the PDFA's propaganda blitz. (The lone
exception is the New York Times' Frank Rich.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's be clear: Drugs can be awful. They can destroy lives. But
for every person who has died or ended up in a gutter, millions
have dabbled in drugs and still led productive, sane, successful
lives. This is indisputable. In fact, some long-term drug use can
be harmless--and, yes, even kind of fun. But the PDFA model offers
only the salvation of abstinence or the perdition of addiction. The
PDFA's Web site suggests you tell your kids marijuana is ``a bad
drug that can hurt your body.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that marijuana smoke (like tobacco smoke)
contains carcinogens and the medical data suggest it compromises
the immune system and can also lead to short-term memory loss,
honesty demands that the silent dad in the PDFA ad admit to his son
that he smoked a good deal of pot when he was young, still
occasionally lights up at parties and has turned out just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the PDFA insists on using your tax dollars to lie to
your kids. Should teens hate and fear a friendly, well-adjusted,
responsible classmate who occasionally rolls a spliff? Should the
culture denormalize someone who does good work in a steady job,
hurts no one and once in a blue moon sniffs some blow at a club?
Are you on a hell-bound train if you take mushrooms? Is all drug
use drug abuse? The PDFA tells your kids ``yes'' when the correct
answer is ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most shameful thing about the PDFA propaganda
campaign is that its leaders know better, having used drugs
themselves. Bill ``Didn't Inhale'' Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and Al
Gore have all admitted to having tried drugs in their early days.
How can they tell kids pot is an evil gateway drug when they're
stellar proof that it isn't?
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, a propaganda campaign need not convince its
audience; it need merely suck the oxygen out of the lungs of its
foes. Prior to its alliance with the government, the PDFA merely
hogged the drug debate. Now it stands to monopolize it, thanks to
its ad dollars and its friends in the media. July 9, PBS's The
NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ran, without comment, all the PDFA's new
ads. (The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, responsible for 50
percent of the PDFA's funding, also donated over $500,000 to PBS
last year.) Media luminaries from ABC News anchor Peter Jennings to
Washington Post Co. mogul Katharine Graham have supported the PDFA
since its inception. The editorial side of Graham's Post has only
compliments for the PDFA, while the advertising side has donated ad
space to it.
</P>
<P>
   We don't trust Madison Avenue to tell us the truth about fabric
softener, so why are we letting it brainwash our children about
drugs? Indeed, if the PDFA had a shred of integrity, its ads would
be battling alcohol and tobacco, America's two most injurious drugs
and the two most popular among teens. (The PDFA no longer takes
money from Philip Morris, RJR Reynolds, and Anheuser-Busch or other
booze and smokes companies, but even so, the alcohol connection
remains: Margeotes/Fertitta and Partners, which created the waif
spot, also designs Stolichnaya vodka ads.)
</P>
<P>
   In a rational world, the Republicans who decry the anti-tobacco
campaign as another appendage of the nanny state would see through
the PDFA campaign and reiterate their belief that Americans can be
trusted to make informed choices. For instance, contrary to what
the raccoon-eyed waif suggests, many heroin users are able to use
their drugs and conduct functional lives. What makes heroin users'
life so crazy is that their dependence on an illegal drug forces
them to enter a criminal underworld. The PDFA ignores these
subtleties. Likewise with cocaine: Most of the 22 million Americans
who've tried it have had no trouble walking away from it. And pot?
No one has ever overdosed.
</P>
<P>
   By confusing propaganda with education, the PDFA stands to reap
the whirlwind. We don't lie to kids about alcohol. Everyone knows
from an early age what it can do--and that most people can handle
liquor, but some people can't. Eventually kids see through the drug
hysteria, usually by the time they turn 12 or 13 and start
observing drug users for themselves. When they discover they've
been lied to, they stop trusting the liar--their parents or
teachers or TV commercials--and start trusting their peers.
Whatever real opportunity we have to reach them vanishes. Simply
letting kids know what the real risks are, without hyperbole,
should be enough. Madison Avenue propaganda is counterproductive.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any update on an accident in New York City when
some scaffolding fell in or near Times Square? I haven't seen any
later news.
</P>
<P>
   A. The accident occurred July 21 when the 700-foot scaffolding
partially collapsed at the 48-story Conde Nast building, under
construction on 43rd Street just off Broadway, forcing the closing
of sections of Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue and Broadway, as well
as 41st, 42nd and 43rd streets. Theresa Feliconio, a resident of
the Woodstock Hotel near the accident site, was killed instantly
last Tuesday morning by a piece of metal that fell into the living
room of her 12th-floor apartment. Debris rained onto buildings and
the street below. At least 12 injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 29, some streets were reported to have reopened.
Parts of Sixth Avenue and several other streets remained closed.
Workers were continuing to cover the damaged, unstable scaffold and
construction elevator with a curtain of netting to hold remaining
debris in place.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Marines have a Latin motto, Semper Fidelis, meaning
``always faithful.'' The Coast Guard uses Semper Paratus, meaning
``always prepared.'' Are there similar mottoes for the Army, Air
Force and Navy?
</P>
<P>
   A. Representatives of each of the other branches report no Latin
mottoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is the latest version of the movie ``Gone With the Wind''
doing at the box office?
</P>
<P>
   A. In limited release since June 26 _ it's currently showing in
about 200 theaters nationwide _ the reissue of ``GWTW'' has taken
in between $2 million and $3 million, said Elizabeth Guider of
Variety, the show-biz publication. In the week ending July 23, it
grossed $620,255, a dropoff of about 30 percent from the previous
week, she said. The cumulative box office take from all its
releases since 1939 totals about $197 million (domestic) and $202
million (foreign) for a worldwide total of about $399 million. In
comparison, as of July 20, the cumulative domestic box office for
``Titanic,'' in the 213 days since it was released, was $590.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   If figures are adjusted for inflation, and to reflect real
ticket sales, 1939's ``Gone With the Wind'' would be the top
money-earning film of all time, with the equivalent of an estimated
$1.2 billion in box-office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A few weeks ago, I heard that an experiment would be done
with Wall Street computers to test for the year 2000 bug. The
computers would be set for the end of Dec. 31, 1999, to see what
would happen. What did? I never saw any results.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Securities Industry Association's test turned computer
clocks at 29 brokerage firms and 13 exchanges and clearing and
settlement firms ahead to Jan. 3, 2000, the first trading day of
the next century. It then ran simulated trades to see if they would
work.
</P>
<P>
   Based on preliminary feedback, the trades were successful, with
no major glitches. ``It's gone much better than we anticipated,''
said John Panchery, Year 2000 project manager for the association.
The only problem reported in the project involved miscommunication
_ not related to the date _ between the various computers set up
for the testing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent success of the test, securities officials
aren't yet claiming that no problems will occur when midnight Dec.
31, 1999, arrives. The testing so far is preliminary only, and was
done using a small volume of trades.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have read that antibacterial soap can harm a septic tank.
Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A. Septic systems are rich bacterial environments that could be
adversely affected only by very large quantities of such products,
said Tony Tyson, Extension Service engineer in Statesboro.
Antibacterial soap won't damage a septic system, he added. There's
not enough disinfectant in the soap to affect the bacteria. If that
were a concern, stronger products would be much more worrisome,
such as the chlorine-based cleansers often introduced into such
systems. In some cases even the laundry, with all its bleaches and
other products, empties into septic systems. In the typically small
quantities used they're still not a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Considering all the rough weather we've been having, is there
any list of, say, the 10 places in the United States with the best
climate?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're looking for weather as good as it gets in North
America, go west. Places Rated Almanac lists these cities and metro
areas as North America's top 10 for climate: San Francisco;
Honolulu; Los Angeles-Long Beach; Ventura, Calif.; San Luis
Obispo-Atascadero-Paso Robles, Calif.; San Diego; Orange County,
Calif.; Oakland, Calif.; Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-Lompoc, Calif.;
and Salinas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To assess climate, the almanac assigns scores to locations based
on three factors: mildness, which takes in everything from winter
temperatures influenced by wind chill to summer temperatures
influenced by humidity; brightness, which embraces the number of
clear days and wet days, plus latitude, an indicator of potential
sunlight; and stability, which takes in thunderstorms, snow, and
the difference between January's mean low temperature and July's
mean high.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale with 100 being the top, San Francisco got a score of
98.12.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the significance of the copper bracelets that we see
golfers wearing during televised tournaments?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some people think the wearing of copper bracelets helps
relieve arthritis pain, while others dismiss it as a folk belief
along the lines of such other ``cures'' as bee venom and various
diets and balms. While the Arthritis Foundation says the benefits
are unproven, it also says the wearing of copper bracelets is
considered harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any information on a Van Gogh exhibit coming to
Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs: Masterpieces from the Van Gogh
Museum, Amsterdam'' will be on view at the National Gallery of
Art's West Building from Oct. 4 to Jan. 3. It will include 70
paintings. After Washington, it will move to the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art Jan. 17 to April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Entrance to the exhibition at the National Gallery of Art will
be free, but passes will be required for entry. Beginning Aug. 30,
advance passes (no more than six per order) may be obtained through
Ticketmaster locations for a service charge of $2 per pass, and
through Ticketmaster PhoneCharge for $2.75 per pass plus a $1.25
handling fee per order. Also starting Aug. 30, passes can be
obtained in person at the Gallery's East Building pass desk, Fourth
Street and Constitution Avenue N.W. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster PhoneCharge: 1-800-551-7328. Exhibit information on
the Internet is available at the National Gallery of Art's
exhibition site: www.nga.gov/exhibitions/exhibits.htm
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently read that sugar water, if left in the sun, becomes
poisonous to hummingbirds. Does that same thing happen to
commercial solutions for hummingbirds sold at nurseries and pet
stores?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's likely, because after a period in the hot sun, the
solution ferments, with bacteria and fungi (usually yeasts)
producing compounds that are toxic to the hummingbirds. You should
check the solution _ whether it's one you make, or a product you
buy _ every few days in hot weather, and change it if you're
suspicious, said Jeff Jackson, extension wildlife specialist at the
University of Georgia Warnell School of Forestry. You can tell by
the odor if it's fermenting, but you shouldn't take a chance. If
you have a lot of hummingbirds, they probably will drain the
solution before it ferments, Jackson said. When the weather is
cooler, the solution doesn't need to be changed as frequently.
``The trick is to use your judgment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial solutions are no more effective than sugar water
combinations you can make in attracting hummingbirds,, Jackson
said, because it's the sugar in the water that attracts them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When is next year's Westminster Dog Show? How can we get
tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Westminster Kennel Club says its next annual show will be
Feb. 8-9, 1999, at Madison Square Garden in New York. Tickets won't
go on sale until the fall, said club spokesman Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   You can call the club at 212-682-6852 after Labor Day to request
a mail-order ticket order form; or, nearer the date of the show,
call the Madison Square Garden box office, 212-465-6741.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now that Alan Shepard has died, how many of the original
Mercury astronauts are still alive? What are their ages and where
are they now?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of the seven test pilots introduced as the first group of
astronauts for the Mercury program on April 9, 1959, four are
living:
</P>
<P>
   Scott Carpenter, 73, who made three orbits around Earth on
Mercury 7 in May 1962, retired from the Navy with the rank of
commander. He lives in New York and in Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Cooper Jr., 77, who orbited Earth on Mercury 9 in 1963
and did onboard experiments on Gemini V in 1965 to prepare for moon
missions, retired from the Air Force as a colonel. He lives in Van
Nuys, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. ``Wally'' Schirra Jr., 75, flew on Mercury 8 in 1962,
making six orbits of Earth; piloted Gemini 6 in 1965; and was
commander of Apollo 7 in 1968. A retired Navy captain, he lives in
Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Glenn Jr., 77, who became the first American to orbit
Earth on Feb. 20, 1962, in Mercury 6. A retired Marine Corps
colonel, he is a U.S. senator from Ohio. He's preparing to go into
space again aboard a shuttle mission in October.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom, who flew a suborbital flight on
Mercury 4 in 1962 and made three Earth orbits on Gemini 3 in 1965,
died Jan. 27, 1967, in the Apollo spacecraft fire at Cape
Canaveral, Fla. Donald K. ``Deke'' Slayton, whose Mercury mission
was scrubbed but who flew on the Apollo mission that docked with
the Russian Soyuz spaceship in 1975, died June 13, 1993. Shepard,
74, died July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the status of the volcano that erupted last fall in
the Caribbean? Have island residents been allowed to return to
their homes?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Soufriere Hills volcano on Montserrat has been relatively
calm in the months since the eruptions began last September, but a
``burst of activity'' occurred July 3, said Jill Norton of the
Montserrat Volcano Observatory. It was the first significant
activity in ``three or four months,'' she added. Scientistsexpect
to release a report on the outlook in a week or two, she said.
Information is available by calling the Montserrat Observatory,
664-491-5647. Residents of areas evacuated last fall have not been
allowed to return, Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does it mean when someone says ``take it with a grain of
salt''?
</P>
<P>
   A. The idea is that you're approaching some suggestion or
proposal with skepticism bordering on distaste. The basic concept
is that you would take the same approach to an unappetizing meal,
which might be made palatable by the addition of a grain or two of
salt. The expression dates from Roman times, with the Latin cum
grano salis, according to Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q. What does it mean when someone says ``take it with a
grain of salt''?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive bombing suspect, has eluded
capture for months. A massive manhunt has been under way, with
hundreds of FBI and other law enforcement people searching for him.
Is any estimate available on the cost, say, per day or per week,
for the manhunt?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not yet, but an FBI spokesman said it wouldn't be as high as
one might think. Most of the search cost is personnel related, he
said, but most of the personnel involved already are on the payroll
and have just been reassigned temporarily to this mission.
Additional costs would be for equipment brought into the search
area, but no tally is yet available on that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I haven't seen anything lately about the fires in Florida.
Are they all out? What was the final acreage and dollar-figure
damage?
</P>
<P>
   A. All the fires are contained and most are controlled, said
George Cooper, fire resource manager in the Florida Department of
Forestry. ``Contained means we've got suppression lines around
them, controlled means they're out,'' he explained. The fires that
are continuing are burning in organic fuel or muck, and they're
relatively minor. The typical summertime pattern of localized heavy
rains and thunderstorms has returned to Florida, Cooper said,
helping prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials haven't finished computing the dollar cost of the
damage or of the firefighting mission, but some statistics are
known: 499,477 acres burned between June 1 and July 21; 126 homes
destroyed, 211 homes damaged; 25 businesses destroyed, eight
businesses damaged; and 86 vehicles damaged or destroyed.
Miraculously, considering that up to 10,000 firefighters were
involved and 150 aircraft flew 2,080 ``aircraft days,'' only 124
fire-related injuries to firefighters were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The only Florida area still considered in the tinderbox stage is
Panama City, Cooper said, because it hasn't seen a return of rain.
The two or three counties in that area still are considered in
critical fire stage.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I didn't see any report about casualties on ships associated
with the tsunami that struck Papua New Guinea July 17. Does a
tsunami not cause any damage until it reaches land?
</P>
<P>
   A. A tsunami is a series of traveling ocean waves of great
length and long duration. As it crosses the deep ocean, its length,
from end to end, may be 100 miles or more, its height from trough
to crest only a few feet. It cannot be felt aboard ships in deep
water, which explains why you didn't hear about any shipboard
problems or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As the tsunami enters the shoaling waters of coastlines in its
path, the velocity of its waves diminishes and wave height
increases. It is in these shallow waters that tsunamis become a
threat to life and property, striking with devastating force.
</P>
<P>
   The three waves striking Papua New Guinea claimed at least 1,200
lives, officials reported, but the toll is expected to climb much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've read several times lately about something being shown on
TV in ``letterbox format.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. Think of the shape of a movie screen: wider than it is high.
Think of the shape of a TV screen: usually about the same height
and width. Letterbox format refers to showing a wide-screen image
on TV in its original proportion, allowing viewers to see it in its
full width, not just the portion in the middle. You'll see it on TV
with a black band across the top and bottom of the image.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a recent column, Miss Manners suggests that the word
``staff'' has to do with diseases and infections. Isn't she
mistaken in her spelling?
</P>
<P>
   A. We wouldn't be ill-mannered enough to presume to speak for
someone else, but let's be generous and politely assume Miss
Manners _ who often injects humor into her recommendations for
proper behavior _ knows the difference between ``staff'' and
``staph.'' She was responding to a reader asking whether a manager
should refer to the people who work for him as ``employees'' or
``co-workers.'' She recommended using the word ``staff,'' adding
that she hoped people associated it more with competence than with
infections.
</P>
<P>
   You're right, of course, to point out that ``staff'' is not the
medical word. That is staphylococcus, or staph for short.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our family recently was at a beach near Destin, Fla., and
observed a strange phenomenon. At night, the breaking surf glowed
with a bright, fluorescent light. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a fairly common occurrence created by bioluminescent
planktonic organisms in the water, said Wade Jeffrey of the biology
department at the University of West Florida in Pensacola. The
organisms usually give off light when they're disturbed, such as
when a boat is passing by, and sometimes the effect appears in the
surf as it approaches the beach. Think of the light given off by
fireflies, but imagine it in the sea water, and you have the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any connection between the name of the drug Viagra
and the Sanskrit word for tiger?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Sanskrit Dictionary says the word for tiger in English is
transliterated as vyaaghraH or shaardulaH; the word for ``a tiger
among human beings,'' purushhavyaaghra. A Sanskrit connection to
the word Viagra would be colorful but incorrect, said Pamela Gemmel
of Pfizer Inc. in New York, developer of the product. The name
Viagra was created years ago for a urology drug Pfizer was
developing, but that drug eventually was named something else, she
said. However, the company liked the name, so it was applied later
when sildenafil citrate was developed. Gemmel said other theories
about the name Viagra _ also incorrect _ have linked it to the
words vigor, vitality, virility and even Niagara (as in Falls).
</P>
<P>
   Q. News reports about a passenger jet forced to make an
emergency landing said it had to dump fuel before attempting the
landing. Where is fuel dumped? Is there a special zone or altitude,
or can it be done anywhere?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are no hard-and-fast rules, said Anne Eldridge of the
Federal Aviation Administration, because dumping of fuel usually is
associated with a potential problem or emergency, or with a flight
that is diverted to an airport far short of its intended
destination. Dumping is done to reduce the weight of the airplane
and to slow the landing speed, as well as to reduce the risk of
fire in an emergency, she added. In general, pilots try to dump
fuel at altitudes above 1,500-2,000 feet, where it will vaporize
before it reaches the ground, and they try to avoid doing it over
populated areas, Eldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It was reported recently that an American tourist was found
hacked to death in a hotel room in Kenya. Do you have any more
details for those who may be considering a trip there?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although some published accounts decribed the victim,
identified as Luzzola Heriot, as a tourist, a British newspaper
said she had moved into a house she was renovating in Timau, 30
miles from Nairobi. In any case, her body was found in a room at a
hotel at Nanyuki, about 80 miles north of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Few details are available, but whatever the circumstances, the
death probably will add to Kenya's already declining state of
tourism, which has been blamed on rampant crime and recurring
politically motivated violence. Earlier this year, Nairobi's
expatriate community voiced anger in the face of chronic violence
in Kenya after the murder of a German technician. Two people are
being tried for the murder in February of a British tourist at the
Aberdare County Club near Nanyuki. And at the end of January,
heavily armed bandits attacked and robbed nine tourists in the
Masai Mara game reserve, one of Kenya's most popular areas for game
viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department reports a high rate of street crime against
tourists in Nairobi, Mombasa and elsewhere in Kenya, as well as
robberies of tourists drugged with food and drinks laced with
sedatives. For recorded information, call the State Department's
Citizens Emergency Center at 202-647-5225 and follow the prompts
for Kenya or any other country. On the Internet, you'll find
information on the State Department's home page (www.state.gov).

<P>
   Q. I've noticed an increasing number of programs on Discovery
Channel and elsewhere being shown in letterbox format. Does this
have anything to do with the new digital technology?
</P>
<P>
   A. Only about 5 percent of Discovery Channel's programming is in
letterbox format, said Discovery spokeswoman Karen Beimdiek, and
it's done only because the film was shot on Super 16 format film.
She cited two advantages: ``an appealing look visually, and as a
means of preparing for the future, when TV sets are designed to be
more wide-screen or higher definition.'' What has been shot on
Super 16 film will match proportionally the newer TV sets without
having to reformat the picture to fit current sets, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q. An article about Saratoga Springs, N.Y., used the term
``giddyup.'' Where did such a curious word originate?
</P>
<P>
   A. Also spelled giddyap and giddap, it's simply an informal
pronunciation of ``get up.'' As any fan of westerns knows, it is a
command to a horse to speed up.
</P>
<P>
   Q. After visiting Arlington National Cemetery, I'm curious about
Fort Myer. Where did it get its name? What is its history?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Military District of Washington reports that the site
currently occupied by Fort Myer traces its ownership to George
Washington Parke Custis, who owned the land where Arlington
National Cemetery now stands. Part of the Arlington estate became a
cemetery for war dead and the remainder became Fort Whipple, named
in honor of Brevet Maj. Gen. Amiel Weeks Whipple.
</P>
<P>
   In 1881, Fort Whipple was redesignated Fort Myer in honor of
Brig. Gen. Albert J. Myer. A secondary benefit in the renaming was
to avoid confusion raised by the existence of a Fort Whipple in
Arizona. During his career, Myer served as commanding officer of
Fort Whipple and was appointed the Army's first chief signal
officer in 1866, a position he held until his death in 1880.
Quarters One at Fort Myer, completed in 1899, has been home to the
U.S. Army chief of staff since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Fort Myer served as a military
in-processing and out-processing station. Defense troops also were
stationed there throughout the war. The U.S. Army Band,
``Pershing's Own,'' moved to Fort Myer in 1942, and in 1948 two
battalions of the 3rd Infantry Regiment were reactivated and
assigned to Fort Myer and Fort McNair. Today, Fort Myer is under
the jurisdiction of the commanding general, U.S. Army Military
District of Washington.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any update on an accident in New York City when
some scaffolding fell in or near Times Square? I haven't seen any
later news.
</P>
<P>
   A. The accident occurred July 21 when the 700-foot scaffolding
partially collapsed at the 48-story Conde Nast building, under
construction on 43rd Street just off Broadway, forcing the closing
of sections of Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue and Broadway, as well
as 41st, 42nd and 43rd streets. Theresa Feliconio, a resident of
the Woodstock Hotel near the accident site, was killed instantly
last Tuesday morning by a piece of metal that fell into the living
room of her 12th-floor apartment. Debris rained onto buildings and
the street below. At least 12 injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 29, some streets were reported to have reopened.
Parts of Sixth Avenue and several other streets remained closed.
Workers were continuing to cover the damaged, unstable scaffold and
construction elevator with a curtain of netting to hold remaining
debris in place.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Marines have a Latin motto, Semper Fidelis, meaning
``always faithful.'' The Coast Guard uses Semper Paratus, meaning
``always prepared.'' Are there similar mottoes for the Army, Air
Force and Navy?
</P>
<P>
   A. Representatives of each of the other branches report no Latin
mottoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is the latest version of the movie ``Gone With the Wind''
doing at the box office?
</P>
<P>
   A. In limited release since June 26 _ it's currently showing in
about 200 theaters nationwide _ the reissue of ``GWTW'' has taken
in between $2 million and $3 million, said Elizabeth Guider of
Variety, the show-biz publication. In the week ending July 23, it
grossed $620,255, a dropoff of about 30 percent from the previous
week, she said. The cumulative box office take from all its
releases since 1939 totals about $197 million (domestic) and $202
million (foreign) for a worldwide total of about $399 million. In
comparison, as of July 20, the cumulative domestic box office for
``Titanic,'' in the 213 days since it was released, was $590.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   If figures are adjusted for inflation, and to reflect real
ticket sales, 1939's ``Gone With the Wind'' would be the top
money-earning film of all time, with the equivalent of an estimated
$1.2 billion in box-office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A few weeks ago, I heard that an experiment would be done
with Wall Street computers to test for the year 2000 bug. The
computers would be set for the end of Dec. 31, 1999, to see what
would happen. What did? I never saw any results.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Securities Industry Association's test turned computer
clocks at 29 brokerage firms and 13 exchanges and clearing and
settlement firms ahead to Jan. 3, 2000, the first trading day of
the next century. It then ran simulated trades to see if they would
work.
</P>
<P>
   Based on preliminary feedback, the trades were successful, with
no major glitches. ``It's gone much better than we anticipated,''
said John Panchery, Year 2000 project manager for the association.
The only problem reported in the project involved miscommunication
_ not related to the date _ between the various computers set up
for the testing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent success of the test, securities officials
aren't yet claiming that no problems will occur when midnight Dec.
31, 1999, arrives. The testing so far is preliminary only, and was
done using a small volume of trades.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have read that antibacterial soap can harm a septic tank.
Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A. Septic systems are rich bacterial environments that could be
adversely affected only by very large quantities of such products,
said Tony Tyson, Extension Service engineer in Statesboro.
Antibacterial soap won't damage a septic system, he added. There's
not enough disinfectant in the soap to affect the bacteria. If that
were a concern, stronger products would be much more worrisome,
such as the chlorine-based cleansers often introduced into such
systems. In some cases even the laundry, with all its bleaches and
other products, empties into septic systems. In the typically small
quantities used they're still not a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Considering all the rough weather we've been having, is there
any list of, say, the 10 places in the United States with the best
climate?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're looking for weather as good as it gets in North
America, go west. Places Rated Almanac lists these cities and metro
areas as North America's top 10 for climate: San Francisco;
Honolulu; Los Angeles-Long Beach; Ventura, Calif.; San Luis
Obispo-Atascadero-Paso Robles, Calif.; San Diego; Orange County,
Calif.; Oakland, Calif.; Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-Lompoc, Calif.;
and Salinas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To assess climate, the almanac assigns scores to locations based
on three factors: mildness, which takes in everything from winter
temperatures influenced by wind chill to summer temperatures
influenced by humidity; brightness, which embraces the number of
clear days and wet days, plus latitude, an indicator of potential
sunlight; and stability, which takes in thunderstorms, snow, and
the difference between January's mean low temperature and July's
mean high.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale with 100 being the top, San Francisco got a score of
98.12.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the significance of the copper bracelets that we see
golfers wearing during televised tournaments?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some people think the wearing of copper bracelets helps
relieve arthritis pain, while others dismiss it as a folk belief
along the lines of such other ``cures'' as bee venom and various
diets and balms. While the Arthritis Foundation says the benefits
are unproven, it also says the wearing of copper bracelets is
considered harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any information on a Van Gogh exhibit coming to
Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs: Masterpieces from the Van Gogh
Museum, Amsterdam'' will be on view at the National Gallery of
Art's West Building from Oct. 4 to Jan. 3. It will include 70
paintings. After Washington, it will move to the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art Jan. 17 to April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Entrance to the exhibition at the National Gallery of Art will
be free, but passes will be required for entry. Beginning Aug. 30,
advance passes (no more than six per order) may be obtained through
Ticketmaster locations for a service charge of $2 per pass, and
through Ticketmaster PhoneCharge for $2.75 per pass plus a $1.25
handling fee per order. Also starting Aug. 30, passes can be
obtained in person at the Gallery's East Building pass desk, Fourth
Street and Constitution Avenue N.W. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster PhoneCharge: 1-800-551-7328. Exhibit information on
the Internet is available at the National Gallery of Art's
exhibition site: www.nga.gov/exhibitions/exhibits.htm
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently read that sugar water, if left in the sun, becomes
poisonous to hummingbirds. Does that same thing happen to
commercial solutions for hummingbirds sold at nurseries and pet
stores?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's likely, because after a period in the hot sun, the
solution ferments, with bacteria and fungi (usually yeasts)
producing compounds that are toxic to the hummingbirds. You should
check the solution _ whether it's one you make, or a product you
buy _ every few days in hot weather, and change it if you're
suspicious, said Jeff Jackson, extension wildlife specialist at the
University of Georgia Warnell School of Forestry. You can tell by
the odor if it's fermenting, but you shouldn't take a chance. If
you have a lot of hummingbirds, they probably will drain the
solution before it ferments, Jackson said. When the weather is
cooler, the solution doesn't need to be changed as frequently.
``The trick is to use your judgment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial solutions are no more effective than sugar water
combinations you can make in attracting hummingbirds,, Jackson
said, because it's the sugar in the water that attracts them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When is next year's Westminster Dog Show? How can we get
tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Westminster Kennel Club says its next annual show will be
Feb. 8-9, 1999, at Madison Square Garden in New York. Tickets won't
go on sale until the fall, said club spokesman Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   You can call the club at 212-682-6852 after Labor Day to request
a mail-order ticket order form; or, nearer the date of the show,
call the Madison Square Garden box office, 212-465-6741.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now that Alan Shepard has died, how many of the original
Mercury astronauts are still alive? What are their ages and where
are they now?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of the seven test pilots introduced as the first group of
astronauts for the Mercury program on April 9, 1959, four are
living:
</P>
<P>
   Scott Carpenter, 73, who made three orbits around Earth on
Mercury 7 in May 1962, retired from the Navy with the rank of
commander. He lives in New York and in Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Cooper Jr., 77, who orbited Earth on Mercury 9 in 1963
and did onboard experiments on Gemini V in 1965 to prepare for moon
missions, retired from the Air Force as a colonel. He lives in Van
Nuys, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. ``Wally'' Schirra Jr., 75, flew on Mercury 8 in 1962,
making six orbits of Earth; piloted Gemini 6 in 1965; and was
commander of Apollo 7 in 1968. A retired Navy captain, he lives in
Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Glenn Jr., 77, who became the first American to orbit
Earth on Feb. 20, 1962, in Mercury 6. A retired Marine Corps
colonel, he is a U.S. senator from Ohio. He's preparing to go into
space again aboard a shuttle mission in October.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom, who flew a suborbital flight on
Mercury 4 in 1962 and made three Earth orbits on Gemini 3 in 1965,
died Jan. 27, 1967, in the Apollo spacecraft fire at Cape
Canaveral, Fla. Donald K. ``Deke'' Slayton, whose Mercury mission
was scrubbed but who flew on the Apollo mission that docked with
the Russian Soyuz spaceship in 1975, died June 13, 1993. Shepard,
74, died July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the status of the volcano that erupted last fall in
the Caribbean? Have island residents been allowed to return to
their homes?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Soufriere Hills volcano on Montserrat has been relatively
calm in the months since the eruptions began last September, but a
``burst of activity'' occurred July 3, said Jill Norton of the
Montserrat Volcano Observatory. It was the first significant
activity in ``three or four months,'' she added. Scientistsexpect
to release a report on the outlook in a week or two, she said.
Information is available by calling the Montserrat Observatory,
664-491-5647. Residents of areas evacuated last fall have not been
allowed to return, Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does it mean when someone says ``take it with a grain of
salt''?
</P>
<P>
   A. The idea is that you're approaching some suggestion or
proposal with skepticism bordering on distaste. The basic concept
is that you would take the same approach to an unappetizing meal,
which might be made palatable by the addition of a grain or two of
salt. The expression dates from Roman times, with the Latin cum
grano salis, according to Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q. What does it mean when someone says ``take it with a
grain of salt''?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive bombing suspect, has eluded
capture for months. A massive manhunt has been under way, with
hundreds of FBI and other law enforcement people searching for him.
Is any estimate available on the cost, say, per day or per week,
for the manhunt?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not yet, but an FBI spokesman said it wouldn't be as high as
one might think. Most of the search cost is personnel related, he
said, but most of the personnel involved already are on the payroll
and have just been reassigned temporarily to this mission.
Additional costs would be for equipment brought into the search
area, but no tally is yet available on that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I haven't seen anything lately about the fires in Florida.
Are they all out? What was the final acreage and dollar-figure
damage?
</P>
<P>
   A. All the fires are contained and most are controlled, said
George Cooper, fire resource manager in the Florida Department of
Forestry. ``Contained means we've got suppression lines around
them, controlled means they're out,'' he explained. The fires that
are continuing are burning in organic fuel or muck, and they're
relatively minor. The typical summertime pattern of localized heavy
rains and thunderstorms has returned to Florida, Cooper said,
helping prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials haven't finished computing the dollar cost of the
damage or of the firefighting mission, but some statistics are
known: 499,477 acres burned between June 1 and July 21; 126 homes
destroyed, 211 homes damaged; 25 businesses destroyed, eight
businesses damaged; and 86 vehicles damaged or destroyed.
Miraculously, considering that up to 10,000 firefighters were
involved and 150 aircraft flew 2,080 ``aircraft days,'' only 124
fire-related injuries to firefighters were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The only Florida area still considered in the tinderbox stage is
Panama City, Cooper said, because it hasn't seen a return of rain.
The two or three counties in that area still are considered in
critical fire stage.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I didn't see any report about casualties on ships associated
with the tsunami that struck Papua New Guinea July 17. Does a
tsunami not cause any damage until it reaches land?
</P>
<P>
   A. A tsunami is a series of traveling ocean waves of great
length and long duration. As it crosses the deep ocean, its length,
from end to end, may be 100 miles or more, its height from trough
to crest only a few feet. It cannot be felt aboard ships in deep
water, which explains why you didn't hear about any shipboard
problems or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   As the tsunami enters the shoaling waters of coastlines in its
path, the velocity of its waves diminishes and wave height
increases. It is in these shallow waters that tsunamis become a
threat to life and property, striking with devastating force.
</P>
<P>
   The three waves striking Papua New Guinea claimed at least 1,200
lives, officials reported, but the toll is expected to climb much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've read several times lately about something being shown on
TV in ``letterbox format.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. Think of the shape of a movie screen: wider than it is high.
Think of the shape of a TV screen: usually about the same height
and width. Letterbox format refers to showing a wide-screen image
on TV in its original proportion, allowing viewers to see it in its
full width, not just the portion in the middle. You'll see it on TV
with a black band across the top and bottom of the image.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a recent column, Miss Manners suggests that the word
``staff'' has to do with diseases and infections. Isn't she
mistaken in her spelling?
</P>
<P>
   A. We wouldn't be ill-mannered enough to presume to speak for
someone else, but let's be generous and politely assume Miss
Manners _ who often injects humor into her recommendations for
proper behavior _ knows the difference between ``staff'' and
``staph.'' She was responding to a reader asking whether a manager
should refer to the people who work for him as ``employees'' or
``co-workers.'' She recommended using the word ``staff,'' adding
that she hoped people associated it more with competence than with
infections.
</P>
<P>
   You're right, of course, to point out that ``staff'' is not the
medical word. That is staphylococcus, or staph for short.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our family recently was at a beach near Destin, Fla., and
observed a strange phenomenon. At night, the breaking surf glowed
with a bright, fluorescent light. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a fairly common occurrence created by bioluminescent
planktonic organisms in the water, said Wade Jeffrey of the biology
department at the University of West Florida in Pensacola. The
organisms usually give off light when they're disturbed, such as
when a boat is passing by, and sometimes the effect appears in the
surf as it approaches the beach. Think of the light given off by
fireflies, but imagine it in the sea water, and you have the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any connection between the name of the drug Viagra
and the Sanskrit word for tiger?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Sanskrit Dictionary says the word for tiger in English is
transliterated as vyaaghraH or shaardulaH; the word for ``a tiger
among human beings,'' purushhavyaaghra. A Sanskrit connection to
the word Viagra would be colorful but incorrect, said Pamela Gemmel
of Pfizer Inc. in New York, developer of the product. The name
Viagra was created years ago for a urology drug Pfizer was
developing, but that drug eventually was named something else, she
said. However, the company liked the name, so it was applied later
when sildenafil citrate was developed. Gemmel said other theories
about the name Viagra _ also incorrect _ have linked it to the
words vigor, vitality, virility and even Niagara (as in Falls).
</P>
<P>
   Q. News reports about a passenger jet forced to make an
emergency landing said it had to dump fuel before attempting the
landing. Where is fuel dumped? Is there a special zone or altitude,
or can it be done anywhere?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are no hard-and-fast rules, said Anne Eldridge of the
Federal Aviation Administration, because dumping of fuel usually is
associated with a potential problem or emergency, or with a flight
that is diverted to an airport far short of its intended
destination. Dumping is done to reduce the weight of the airplane
and to slow the landing speed, as well as to reduce the risk of
fire in an emergency, she added. In general, pilots try to dump
fuel at altitudes above 1,500-2,000 feet, where it will vaporize
before it reaches the ground, and they try to avoid doing it over
populated areas, Eldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It was reported recently that an American tourist was found
hacked to death in a hotel room in Kenya. Do you have any more
details for those who may be considering a trip there?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although some published accounts decribed the victim,
identified as Luzzola Heriot, as a tourist, a British newspaper
said she had moved into a house she was renovating in Timau, 30
miles from Nairobi. In any case, her body was found in a room at a
hotel at Nanyuki, about 80 miles north of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Few details are available, but whatever the circumstances, the
death probably will add to Kenya's already declining state of
tourism, which has been blamed on rampant crime and recurring
politically motivated violence. Earlier this year, Nairobi's
expatriate community voiced anger in the face of chronic violence
in Kenya after the murder of a German technician. Two people are
being tried for the murder in February of a British tourist at the
Aberdare County Club near Nanyuki. And at the end of January,
heavily armed bandits attacked and robbed nine tourists in the
Masai Mara game reserve, one of Kenya's most popular areas for game
viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department reports a high rate of street crime against
tourists in Nairobi, Mombasa and elsewhere in Kenya, as well as
robberies of tourists drugged with food and drinks laced with
sedatives. For recorded information, call the State Department's
Citizens Emergency Center at 202-647-5225 and follow the prompts
for Kenya or any other country. On the Internet, you'll find
information on the State Department's home page (www.state.gov).

Travel Warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've noticed an increasing number of programs on Discovery
Channel and elsewhere being shown in letterbox format. Does this
have anything to do with the new digital technology?
</P>
<P>
   A. Only about 5 percent of Discovery Channel's programming is in
letterbox format, said Discovery spokeswoman Karen Beimdiek, and
it's done only because the film was shot on Super 16 format film.
She cited two advantages: ``an appealing look visually, and as a
means of preparing for the future, when TV sets are designed to be
more wide-screen or higher definition.'' What has been shot on
Super 16 film will match proportionally the newer TV sets without
having to reformat the picture to fit current sets, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q. An article about Saratoga Springs, N.Y., used the term
``giddyup.'' Where did such a curious word originate?
</P>
<P>
   A. Also spelled giddyap and giddap, it's simply an informal
pronunciation of ``get up.'' As any fan of westerns knows, it is a
command to a horse to speed up.
</P>
<P>
   Q. After visiting Arlington National Cemetery, I'm curious about
Fort Myer. Where did it get its name? What is its history?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Military District of Washington reports that the site
currently occupied by Fort Myer traces its ownership to George
Washington Parke Custis, who owned the land where Arlington
National Cemetery now stands. Part of the Arlington estate became a
cemetery for war dead and the remainder became Fort Whipple, named
in honor of Brevet Maj. Gen. Amiel Weeks Whipple.
</P>
<P>
   In 1881, Fort Whipple was redesignated Fort Myer in honor of
Brig. Gen. Albert J. Myer. A secondary benefit in the renaming was
to avoid confusion raised by the existence of a Fort Whipple in
Arizona. During his career, Myer served as commanding officer of
Fort Whipple and was appointed the Army's first chief signal
officer in 1866, a position he held until his death in 1880.
Quarters One at Fort Myer, completed in 1899, has been home to the
U.S. Army chief of staff since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Fort Myer served as a military
in-processing and out-processing station. Defense troops also were
stationed there throughout the war. The U.S. Army Band,
``Pershing's Own,'' moved to Fort Myer in 1942, and in 1948 two
battalions of the 3rd Infantry Regiment were reactivated and
assigned to Fort Myer and Fort McNair. Today, Fort Myer is under
the jurisdiction of the commanding general, U.S. Army Military
District of Washington.

 &HT;    Dance Sport stepping to a different tune
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH _ Come Sunday, August 2, they will have danced all
week.
</P>
<P>
   For the 18th consecutive year, The Triple Crown DanceSport
Championships are waltzing and swinging, mamboing and boleroing,
fox-trotting and quick-stepping their way around the Gulfstream
Ballroom of The Breakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 700 dancers signed up, and I expect around 1,200
spectators,'' said Larry Dean, owner of Dance Consultants
Unlimited, the event's producer.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent competition, paired professionals and amateurs _
mostly teachers and their students _ took to the floor while a team
of judges and a young woman named Laurie Frederik watched.
</P>
<P>
   The judges were evaluating the dancers' timing, posture and
showmanship. Frederik was nursing a broken baby toe on her left
foot and wishing she could be out there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke it in an Indianapolis competition two weeks ago,'' she
sighed, ``and I'm real disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at the University of Chicago,
Frederik, 30, said ballroom dancing is the perfect respite from an
academic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend my days in front of a computer, studying Cuban
culture,'' she explained. ``Then at night, I get to put on
rhinestones and bright red lipstick and be a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Her instructor, Gregory Day, is a former ballet dancer who came
to ballroom styles when the ballet studio he frequented in New York
City was sold and turned into a ballroom studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing is dancing,'' he figured. ``You have the waltz and
swing in both country-western and ballroom dancing, and the
two-step and fox trot are similar, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One winner was Nancy Lowenstein, ``over 60,'' who appeared on
the dance floor in a baby's nightgown, nightcap, bib and pacifier _
until the loudspeakers blasted I'm Just A Baby In This Business Of
Love, and the toddler togs fell away to reveal a skimpy and
shocking red flapper dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a first place this morning,'' Lowenstein boasted. ``It's
not a career on the Broadway stage, but it makes me feel good about
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, about $175,000 in prizes and scholarships will be
awarded by week's end, Dean said, and greater glory may be ahead
for ballroom dancing.
</P>
<P>
   It's been accepted as a full exhibition event at the 2000
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

 &HT;    Officers deserve justice, not vengeance
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My dad was a Fort Worth cop for almost 40 years, most of that as
a
</P>
<P>
   detective in the homicide division.
</P>
<P>
   Working the homicide detail isn't exactly easy duty -- the hours
can be
</P>
<P>
   brutal for one thing -- but he would tell me plainly that it was
nothing
</P>
<P>
   compared to the 10 years or so he spent patrolling the streets
of Cowtown.
</P>
<P>
   Uniform officers take the frontline of danger in the police
business. Twice
</P>
<P>
   in that 10 years criminals made direct attempts on his life. In
that era
</P>
<P>
   before police officers had to watch how they treated prisoners,
it was a
</P>
<P>
   mistake that both men paid for.
</P>
<P>
   I won't say that a detective's job doesn't have elements of risk
but,
</P>
<P>
   generally, they arrive when the danger is over to investigate
the crime
</P>
<P>
   already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   When my father was a patrolman, my mother did not sleep while he
was on
</P>
<P>
   duty, no matter what his work hours might have been. She lived
with the
</P>
<P>
   fear, barely submerged in her mind, that, one day, she would get
the dreaded
</P>
<P>
   visit from a police chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   As cop's kids, my brother, sister and I lived with that fear,
too. It did
</P>
<P>
   not affect us a keenly as it did my mother, but it was still
there.
</P>
<P>
   So I think I understand a bit of what the families of Jacob J.
Chestnut and
</P>
<P>
   John Gibson are feeling this week. How horrible it must have
been to hear
</P>
<P>
   the news of a Capitol shooting knowing that was where your
husband or father
</P>
<P>
   worked. The dreadful waiting of minutes until you heard the
worst news
</P>
<P>
   confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   No one should ever have to hear that news, but police officers
all over the
</P>
<P>
   nation (and the world) take the job knowing the risk. Chestnut
and Gibson
</P>
<P>
   willingly gave their lives for their country. They deserve the
highest
</P>
<P>
   honors we can bestow upon them.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Chestnut and Gibson families are not alone in
tragedy. They
</P>
<P>
   are not the only innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
   Two others live all the way in Florida: Mr. and Mrs. Russell E.
Weston Sr.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to suggest that the Westons are feeling loss like
the
</P>
<P>
   families of Chestnut and Gibson, but when you make national
statements
</P>
<P>
   apologizing for the actions of your son, you are feeling
considerable pain.
</P>
<P>
   How could Weston the father known what was going to happen? How
could the
</P>
<P>
   mother have stopped it. They apparently raised their son as best
they could,
</P>
<P>
   then watched helplessly when, after he was already an adult, he
began to
</P>
<P>
   experience mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the record suggests that they tried to help their
son. Certainly
</P>
<P>
   they encouraged him to take the medication that might have
helped him lead
</P>
<P>
   an ordinary life. They practiced the theory of ``tough love,''
ordering him
</P>
<P>
   out of their Florida house after he took a pistol and shot 14
cats.
</P>
<P>
   What could they have done? How would they have known that Weston
would turn
</P>
<P>
   from shooting cats to shooting police officers? He was an adult
and they had
</P>
<P>
   no standing to commit him, then and there, to a mental
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as horrible as the news that your father has been killed
in the
</P>
<P>
   Capitol is the news that your son was the one to do the deed.
</P>
<P>
   By overwhelming numbers, the mentally ill are not violent
people. They work
</P>
<P>
   in your office and you'll never know. They go to school with
your children
</P>
<P>
   and sleep over at your house. Yes, some of them are even police
officers and
</P>
<P>
   do fine jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Like disorders from ulcers to high blood pressure, most mental
illness can
</P>
<P>
   be corrected or controlled with medication. The cases of the
violently
</P>
<P>
   mental ill are rare but, admittedly, it makes big news when such
a person
</P>
<P>
   takes his acts in the community.
</P>
<P>
   For parents like the Westons, there is little to do but watch in
horror
</P>
<P>
   like the rest of us. No psychiatrist or counselor could have
told them how
</P>
<P>
   to do anything different. They were powerless to prevent this
crime, but the
</P>
<P>
   perpetrator carries their name. Russell Jr. is still their son.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Weston Jr. needs to be put away to protect society.
It is just
</P>
<P>
   as clear that this nation should move with all deliberate speed
in honoring
</P>
<P>
   the memories of Jacob J. Chestnut and John Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   But it does those two fallen officers no honor to put a mentally
ill person
</P>
<P>
   to death.
</P>
<P>
   It would, in fact, be an insult to their service of justice.

 &HT;    A question of taste
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If society shrugs as standards decline, we're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   An old friend who has seen the calendar turn about as many times
as I have was on the phone. ``I think I've lived too long,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe both of us have,'' I replied. ``What's bothering you
today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the cigarette billboard in Atlanta?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I replied. ``I haven't had to go to Atlanta this
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Winston billboard. It says, `Finally, a butt worth
kissing.' Can you imagine such bad taste on a billboard in downtown
Atlanta?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly where is it?'' I asked. ``I don't think we have
billboards like that on our side of town. We're still pretty
old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the Connector going north,'' he said. ``What do you
think it means?''
</P>
<P>
   I had to admit I had no idea. When I was foolish enough to smoke
Winstons myself I never considered kissing what was left of a
cigarette before snubbing it out and throwing it away.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being in poor taste, the billboard doesn't make sense.
If they're trying to sell cigarettes, whatever happened to
``Winstons taste good, like a cigarette should?'' As an example of
how things have changed, remember when purists were upset because
that advertisement, being grammatically incorrect, was corrupting
the language? They wanted to change it to ``as a cigarette
should.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think with all the trouble the tobacco companies are in
they'd at least try to have dignified advertising,'' my friend
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably can't find any,'' I explained. ``The people who
make the ads are either old hippies or young smart alecks who get
their kicks by shocking old folks like you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said, ``but who's bossing the shop? Who approves
the ads at the tobacco company?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're the same people who own and manage radio
stations and allow all that garbage on the air,'' I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear Guy Millner's radio interview?'' my friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't. I was in the garden picking tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about his relationship with Mrs. Millner,'' he
explained. ``He was being questioned about rumors saying he and
Mrs. Millner weren't getting along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he say to that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they were getting along great. Then he gave an
example. He said, `I patted her on the butt before I left home this
morning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a nice thing for him to do,'' I replied, ``but if I
patted my wife on her butt and broadcast it on the radio, I
wouldn't be going home that night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me either,'' he said. ``I might not be going home that
month.''
</P>
<P>
   While my friend thought it untoward for a gubernatorial
candidate to tell a radio audience about patting his wife on the
butt, he was particularly surprised to hear it from Guy Millner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't he after the religious right vote?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I read it. Guy's the traditional values,
motherhood, God and Country candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Won't talk like that on the radio upset religious right
folks?'' my friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' I replied. ``Nothing upsets anyone any more. Bad taste
has become so common we're like the old man in north Georgia who
lived in a room above his chicken house. After a while he got to
where he thought chicken manure didn't stink.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the two 18-year-old virgins who were supposed to
make love for the first time on the Internet. Thank goodness that
turned out to be a prankster's hoax, but not before everybody
believed it was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The really scary thing about that episode, as national columnist
Mona Charen pointed out, is that while everybody was believing
copulation was actually going to take place in full view of
strangers all over the world, none of the news reports about it
reflected disapproval, or even concern. Like the north Georgia
chicken farmer, we've lived with manure so long we don't notice the
smell.
</P>
<P>
   This is a free country. Every citizen, high or low, enjoys
freedom of speech and expression, guaranteed by the Constitution. A
billboard can say whatever some advertising agency adolescent, or
tasteless company CEO, wants it to say. It's a First Amendment
thing.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange how we've come to use the right of free speech and
expression. It would be a violation of the First Amendment to
prohibit billboards on the Downtown Connector merely because they
rot the fabric of society and offend those who retain a modicum of
propriety. However, it is not a violation to prohibit billboards
beside an interstate highway in south Georgia merely because they
are offensive to the eye and sometimes cause trees to be cut down.
</P>
<P>
   I will have to call my friend back and apologize for slandering
the northside. Eventually, I had to go into Atlanta. Right there
south of the stadium was a duplicate Winston billboard. Not far
away was another, touting a radio station and informing me that
rock music, sex, and beer are the three essentials of life.
</P>
<P>
   We are in trouble. Churches can teach, preachers can preach,
philosophers can philosophize, authors can write great books,
editors can publish responsible newspapers, but advertising and
entertainment decide standards.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The loonies-with-guns lesson _ again
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two Capitol Police officers who died doing their duty have
been given the honored burial they deserve in Arlington Cemetery. A
week of national drama over the deaths played out as if scripted _
as, indeed, by now such occasions are.
</P>
<P>
   The breaking news is followed by catch-as-catch-can interviews
in which shock and disappointment are exercised. Flowers and other
tokens of remembrance and of caring appear at the scene. Sentiment
is spilled, in this case largely in the form of congressional
speeches often canted toward a Heavenly outcome. (House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay seemed almost delighted at the victims' prospects.)
</P>
<P>
   Solemn funerals end the public spectacle, and the lingering,
hellish private grief is left to its own devices. The rest of us
have by then had all the vicarious involvement we care for.
</P>
<P>
   We then proceed to do nothing very useful nor germane, because
in most instances anything germane or useful would cost either
money or political will and we have declared ourselves impoverished
of both.
</P>
<P>
   Congress now talks about extending or otherwise shifting its
perimeter. The next crazy person with a gun would still be crazy
and would still be armed, but the new deaths would be at some more
discreet remove from congressional chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress does not wonder whether it might knit up a seamless
system to care for, and about, the mentally ill. And it insists
upon a slovenliness in firearms management that makes it no trick
for a man who has been delusional for years to pick up a gun and go
hunting his devils.
</P>
<P>
   With the development of antipsychotic drugs in the 1970s, we
began closing, with just relief, our often horrid old warehouses
for the mentally ill. A network of outpatient clinics and programs
was to be put in its place. It was not, and what passes for a
system now is spotty and incoherent. Many patients stop taking
their medication and few states allow the outpatient commitment
that would mitigate that and incidentally would spare city streets
the pathetic and corrosive human litter of untreated illness.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Eugene Weston Jr., charged in the Capitol shootings, was
classified paranoid schizophrenic for Social Security benefits in
1984. In 1996, the Secret Service investigated his threats toward
the president. (Among his delusions: Clinton planned the Kennedy
assassination in jealousy over Marilyn Monroe. Even Ken Starr
didn't think of that one.) Weston was committed to a Montana mental
hospital later that year but was released with a prescription and a
bus ticket to his native Illinois. ``Greyhound therapy,'' as they
say.
</P>
<P>
   He got a gun permit there early this year _ Brady law background
checks often miss mental illness because there's no national
recordkeeping _ and then simply lifted a .38 from his parents'
house. We won't require firearms owners to store their weapons
under lock.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, absolutely none, is beyond substantial social
repair, as other nations have shown, but we have convinced
ourselves we are helpless. Communal sentimentality and mourning,
however sincere at the moment, are finally just cheaper and easier
than common effort.

 &HT;    Fastpitch online reaching world
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ A great experiment in cyber softball is being
conducted in a small room at the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   From here, a 1,000-game tournament is being transmitted to the
world, one score at a time, one computer keystroke at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing quite like this has been tried before,'' said Melinda
Miller, the town's director of information services. ``We have had
to develop our own software. The response we've gotten has been
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, host city for the ongoing NSA Girls Youth Fastpitch
World Series, expanded its Internet Web site to provide tournament
results, highlights and features on participating teams. Under
Miller's direction, www.nsa-worldseries.com was born _ and to a
reception that was enthusiastic beyond expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the World Series began this week, the site has been
bombarded by more than 1,500 hits per day from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic has been more than we can handle,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County tech companies have rallied to donate services
to deal with the surprising demand: Yonder Technology developed the
Web site, Klear Technologies created software for tournament
brackets, and Citywalk.net Inc. helped expand Internet capacity.
</P>
<P>
   At restaurants in north county _ Pizza Hut, McDonald's, R.J.
Gators, the Blarney Pub &AMP; Brewery _ computer terminals were
installed so players and their families could follow the series,
which they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail messages have come to Miller's screen from more than 40
states. Players who couldn't make the trip to Jupiter have sent
thanks for the chance to follow the games with the click of a
computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite e-mail came from Mark Grcevich, who coaches the
18-and-under Nighthawks from Lowell, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``I can't thank you enough for what you are doing on
the Internet. Our team was going to play in the tournament but had
to withdraw ... because of a serious car accident involving three
kids from our team, including my daughter. So I have been following
the teams from our area.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller believes Jupiter has set a standard on how future
tournaments will transmit information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed the focus of communication from paper to the Web
site,'' she said. ``Cyber softball. I like that.''

 &HT;    After 25 years, nature calls
 &HT;    By Ian Trontz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ When it finally happened, Emma Goldwire
couldn't use her bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carpet was wet, it even ran out into the hallway,'' said
Goldwire, 75, who lives at 1961 W. 13th St. ``I had to go to my
daughter's house to take a shower.''
</P>
<P>
   The leak was caused by roots from a neighbor's ficus tree. They
had penetrated the bathroom floor, reaching underneath the tub and
around Goldwire's toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Ficus trees _ and their cousins, rubber and banyan trees _ can
send roots more than 100 feet from their bases in search of water
to nourish their splendid canopies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ficus is probably the most invasive plant we have for
roots,'' said Latimer Farr, a master gardener with the Palm Beach
County Extension Service. ``It's not recommended at all to put next
to a house or water pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, after plumbers and her son-in-law gave up
trying to stop her bathtub from leaking, Goldwire finally pulled up
the bathroom carpet. She found the root of her problem.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 years ago, she said, her neighbors planted the tree
about 50 feet from her bathroom. The tree was at least 40 feet tall
when the property owner, Forest Parson, sent two men this week to
chainsaw it to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll pay to repair Goldwire's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwire also blames the roots for water damage in the adjacent
den, but Parson said he won't fix that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even sure it was my tree that did it,'' he said,
adding another tree on the block may have been guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwire isn't relieved yet. ``It's got to be done,'' she said.

 &HT;    Meet Lindsay: singer, poet, social critic
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Editor's note: For the next few weeks, Ron
Wiggins will be picking names at random from the phone book for
What's Your Story?, a column based on the premise that everyone has
a story to tell. This week, he found Lindsay Porter, a Jupiter,
Florida teenager ready to take on the world if she could just skip
the high school portion.
</P>
<P>
   If Lindsay Porter, almost 17, could get a note from her mother
excusing her from her senior year at Jupiter Community High School,
that would be fine with her.
</P>
<P>
   Except that she would miss chorus. She loves chorus. Especially
her chorus teacher, the only teacher who seemed to notice when she
dropped out of school for eight weeks near the end of her sophomore
year. That was the time her mom and stepdad packed her off to live
with her dad in Port St. Lucie for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Lindsay, what you see is what you get,'' says her mother,
Janni Bland, an accountant. Bland says this with a good deal of
affection, considering that her daughter _ the future
singer/songwriter _ can be a royal pain in the household.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's sister, Stephanie, 12, is standing by, ready to
contribute to the big-deal newspaper story being done on her
sister. ``You're so annoying,'' little sister says to big sister.
``She claws me when we wrestle. I can hardly wait until she moves
out and I have the house to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, this critique is also laden with affection. Maybe the
poem Lindsay wrote about her little sister helps explain. Love,
Tea, and Soup
</P>
<P>
   I painfully scrunch my legs
</P>
<P>
   under my little sister's tiny table.
</P>
<P>
   Because I love her
</P>
<P>
   While she pours me
</P>
<P>
   a cup of imaginary
</P>
<P>
   tea and cooks me soup
</P>
<P>
   on her ``play'' stove . . .
</P>
<P>
   Because she loves me
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay surrenders a sheaf of her poetry, explaining that it may
one day find its way into song lyrics. ``I've spared you all of my
I-want-to-kill-myself poetry,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay is far from suicidal. Homicidal, maybe, if you count the
times she'd like to drown some of the nitwit boys in her classes.
Sometimes school is so tedious that it practically makes her teeth
ache.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, today's little scene in the English class she
is taking in summer school. Yes, she flunked English, even after
acing her assignments, because she wouldn't ``participate'' in
class.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to participate when you don't attend. ``English
was last period, after all,'' she says, the implication being that
last period should be optional. On her rare appearances, the
teacher liked to make a big deal of her deigning to honor the class
with her presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe I flunked,'' she says. ``I thought I would
get a C.''
</P>
<P>
   As for today's outburst in class, it seems that the teacher was
trying to lead an intelligent discussion of the novel Ordinary
People when this jerk kid started going on and on about the book's
earthy language.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a typical male adolescent mind-set, Lindsay says.
It is so insufferably, insipidly, obnoxiously childish, and people
wonder why some students feel suffocated by high school! So she
turns on this twit, and, with a contempt that soars beyond
infinity, she explains, ``They allow the language in a novel
because they expect you to be mature enough to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   As if.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the crux of Lindsay Porter's problem with school. She
could probably stand it if the other students would just pretend to
be interested in learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in college, people are there because they want to
be,'' she huffs. ``How can you learn anything in high school with
these adolescent boys laughing because they find sexual meaning in
everything the teachers say?''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay is not so much alienated from her contemporaries as she
is in tune with adults. ``I have more in common with my mom's
friends than people my age,'' she says. ``One of my best friends is
my 28-year-old cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay does have friends her age, but she can count them on two
fingers: Her chorus pal who got her over her singing shyness and
her friend who moved to Minnesota and will always be a part of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's brother, Christopher, 14, admits under direct
examination that his big sister is pretty cool in her own weird
way, and leaves it at that. After all, she will have her driver
license soon, and a fellow may need a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay is reconciled to serving out her last year of high
school. She will bring her grades up. She will continue to get math
tutoring. She will participate in class.``I'm trying to build study
habits,'' she says. ``When you get to college, they aren't
interested in your excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   And, no matter how hideous high school may be, chorus, and her
piano and guitar studies, restoreth her soul.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her writing. Before he leaves, the interviewer
glances down at one of Lindsay Porter's poems, intending to read a
verse. But once he begins, he can't stop:
</P>
<P>
   Generations
</P>
<P>
   Mom _ Can we trade?
</P>
<P>
   Your Beatles
</P>
<P>
   For my Guns-n-Roses?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   I didn't think so.

 &HT;    ``Alzheimer proof'' home to comfort, protect loved one
 &HT;    By Dale Fuchs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Imagine that you are 75 years old but you
picture yourself the way you looked at 25. Gentlemen admired you
then, the way you swept your long locks up above your slender neck,
where you would fasten that first strand of cultured pearls.
</P>
<P>
   You peer into the mirror, and . . . who's that? You see a
wrinkled face, a stranger's face. ``Go away!'' you holler. ``Help!
There's a strange woman in the house!''
</P>
<P>
   You shuffle away from the stranger, down an unfamiliar hallway
into an unfamiliar living room. How did I get here? you wonder. Who
lives here? When can I go home?
</P>
<P>
   Home is the brick apartment building on the Grand Concourse in
the Bronx, where you and your husband lived after the first baby
came. Oh, no! you think. Where's the baby? I must find my baby!
</P>
<P>
   You try to leave this strange house to find the baby, but the
front door is locked. So, with all your might, you climb through a
window. And suddenly you find yourself sprawled on the grass,
aching and wondering how you got there.
</P>
<P>
   Then you remember: You're supposed to meet Betty at the steps of
the Astor Hotel in just an hour. You collect all the shiny, round
objects you can find in the neighbor's trash (you need a subway
token, after all) and amble past one palm tree after another in
your South Florida subdivision, looking for the subway that will
take you from the Bronx to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   You have just entered the confused world inhabited by people
with Alzheimer's disease. This world follows a certain logic, even
if the details vary from person to person and the reasoning is
obvious only to those who live inside.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Warner, an architect and gerontologist from Jupiter,
explains this logic in a new book, ``The Complete Guide to
Alzheimer's-Proofing Your Home,'' published this month by Purdue
University Press, (800) 933-9637.
</P>
<P>
   The 470-page book gives caregivers room-by-room _ and
symptom-by-symptom _ advice on how to make a loved one feel more
comfortable and independent at home.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests home adjustments that can help behavioral
problems common to people with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Like seeing ghosts or strangers in the mirror. Or rummaging for
objects _ cardboard, buttons, scrap pieces of metal so precious
during the Great Depression. Or wandering, even ``escaping,'' from
a home they do not recognize as their own.
</P>
<P>
   And it explains why these things happen: For instance, people
with Alzheimer's lose their short-term memory and often believe
they are living 50 years ago. (If they learned English since that
time, they may not even recognize the word bathroom but will recall
the word bano.) They will also hoard and hide strange objects
because they have symbolic meaning. The act of collecting makes
them feel more in control.
</P>
<P>
   Several books have been written already about designing homes
for people with Alzheimer's, but never in terms the general public
can understand, says Alzheimer's Association spokeswoman Nicolle
Gajda. She calls the book, with its 28-page directory of
Alzheimer-proofing products, a ``much-needed resource.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips from the book:
</P>
<P>
   BATHING AND SHOWERING
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a hand-held shower head with an on-off button.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change door handles that lock from the inside. Otherwise,
Grandma may lock herself in, then forget how to get out. Consider
replacing the bathroom door with a shower curtain or folding door.
They afford privacy yet allow you to enter quickly in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   DRESSING
</P>
<P>
   _ Simplify your loved one's wardrobe. Too much clothing means
too many choices, which is confusing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Label drawers with pictures of what's inside: shirts, socks,
shorts.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Mom has a favorite red dress that she won't take off _ even
to wash it _ buy a second red dress that looks just like it. Switch
dresses when it's time to wash.
</P>
<P>
   USING THE TOILET
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, people with Alzheimer's would use the commode _ if
only they could find it, or recognize it, or weren't afraid of
sitting on it. So . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure the pathway from your loved one's room or favorite
chair to the bathroom is free of obstacles. Encountering a
footstool or TV set on the way may be enough to cause confusion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decorate the bathroom in different colors, so that the toilet
bowl may be distinguished from the floor tiles and the tub. Beige
on beige and other chic, one-color decorating schemes may look good
in House Beautiful, but for a person with Alzheimer's, Mark Warner
says, it makes finding the commode ``like looking for a polar bear
in a snow storm.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hampers and wastepaper baskets may look like a toilet to a
person with Alzheimer's. Add decorations to lessen the resemblance,
buy a childproof hamper, or one that requires some skill to open,
and label the bathroom and toilet in big, bold letters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attach a ``bidet device'' to your toilet. It will spray water
to clean your loved one. Some come with heated toilet seats and
drying fans.

<P>
   About 4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   One in 10 people age 65 or older _ and nearly half of those age
85 or older _ have Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Seven out of 10 people with Alzheimer's disease live at home.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends take on almost 75 percent of the work needed
to care for their loved one at home. The rest of the work is done
by paid help, at an average of $12,500 a year, most of which isn't
covered by Medicare or private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A person with Alzheimer's will live an average of eight years
after symptoms appear. Some people live as long as 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   SOURCE: The Alzheimer's Association.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR LOVED ONE WANDERS:
</P>
<P>
   Camouflage closets that are off-limits with wallpaper that looks
like a book shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Camouflage sliding glass doors with decals that make them look
like picture windows or murals.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure windows can't open far enough to climb through. Many
people with Alzheimer's don't recognize their own home and will try
to ``escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Install motion detectors and other alarms that make pleasant
sounds, like the ring of a cow bell or the tinkle of chimes.
</P>
<P>
   If Mom wanders at night, place a ``sofa saver'' (normally used
to keep Rover off the couch) on the floor around her bed. That way,
when she steps down, an alarm will sound and wake her caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   Build a doorway between Dad's room and his caregiver's room,
then hide the original doorway behind a piece of furniture. That
way, to leave his room, Dad must first pass the through his
caregiver's room.
</P>
<P>
   DEVICES THAT EASE LIFE:
</P>
<P>
   Photo Dial Phone (Polyconcept USA, (203) 358-8100). If Dad can't
remember a name or phone number, he can just press the button with
the picture of the person he wants to call.
</P>
<P>
   Bathtub with doors (BathEase, (888) 747-7845) so your loved one
doesn't have to balance on one leg and lift the other over a tub
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Waterwand (International Environmental Solutions, 800-972-8834).
This faucet control shuts off the water automatically in case Mom
forgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe return'' bracelet with your loved one's name and address.
Available through the Alzheimer's Association, (888) 572-8566.

</P>
<P>
   COMMON PROBLEMS IN THE HOME
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors. Many people with Alzheimer's disease do not
recognizetheir reflection in a mirror and think it is a stranger or
a ghost.While mirrors are a good idea in the early stages of
Alzheimer's -they encourage proper grooming - it's best to cover
them, removethem, or disguise them with murals as the disease
advances.
</P>
<P>
   Black or dark-colored floor tiles and throw rugs. These
sometimeslook like ``holes'' to people with Alzheimer's and cause
terror everytime they walk across a checkered kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Balconies. Grandma may no longer realize she lives on the
fifthfloor. Make the balcony off limits with a combination of locks
andalarms. That way, if Grandma figures out the lock, an alarm will
warnher caregiver that she stepped outside.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinets containing sharp utensils, medications. Use
child-prooflocks, and place locks above or below your loved one's
line of sight.Hang signs on doors and drawers that are off limits.
</P>
<P>
   The refrigerator. Keep medications in a small refrigerator in
thecaregiver's room. That way Dad can rummage through the frige in
thekitchen all he wants - without the risk of taking too much
medicineby accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some household plants, such as dieffenbachia, are harmful if
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Bright lights and abrupt changes in lighting can be
disorienting.

 &HT;    Parasite claiming more spill victims
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Rita Fuentes knew she was going to be in for a long
day. Fuentes, the communicable disease nurse for the Williamson
County and Cities Health District, had scores of calls to return
from the day before _ all to people who had reported stomach
ailments that officials believe is caused by a July 14 spill of raw
sewage from a City of Austin pumping station into Brushy Creek.
</P>
<P>
   But when she got to the office, she had a whole new stack of
calls to make: 47 messages from people reporting symptoms that
varied from diarrhea and vomiting to nausea and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   By lunch, she and her assistant had 63 more messages. And
Fuentes' neck was still sore from cradling the phone the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The spill of 170,000 gallons of raw sewage into Brushy Creek
came after the pumping station lost power during a thunderstorm.
Since then, 13 wells have been contaminated _ four of which belong
to the Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District. Nine people have
tested positive for a rare parasitic infection called
Cryptosporidium.
</P>
<P>
   The generator that lost power in the storm did not have a
back-up generator, and the phone line that the alarm system depends
on was also knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 300 people had called Williamson County health
officials to report illnesses. Fuentes' job was to return their
calls, record their symptoms and addresses, and question them about
the water they have been drinking in the days following the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been swamped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said they got five more tests back Wednesday,
but they showed no signs of the parasite.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't necessarily mean they weren't infected with
crypto,'' said Doug McBride, spokesman for the Texas Department of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   In all, nine of 17 Brushy Creek MUD residents have tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year old Brushy Creek woman, who did not want her name
published, said she was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in bed for days,'' she said. On Friday, July , she said
she told her husband, ``I've had enough,'' and he called the family
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if we lived in the Brushy Creek MUD, and then told us
to go to the hospital right away,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital took a stool sample, she said. By Tuesday, she got
the news that she was infected. The hospital would not identify
people treated in the outbreak, citing patient privacy
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Schumacher, 66, of the 16500 block of Denise Drive in
the Brushy Creek MUD, said his was one of the messages Fuentes
received over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He said he, his wife and son all started feeling sick July 21,
the day the MUD closed four of its five drinking wells because of
they were contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Schumacher called the health district number he saw
in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sure it was from the water,'' he said. ``We just
don't get diarrhea in our household.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher said he was upset with the MUD officials for their
delay in testing the wells. The district did not test the water
going into its wells until three days after the spill. And by the
time it closed the wells, a week had passed since the spill,
allowing for contaminants like Cryptosporidium to slip into the
public water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute they learned of that spill they should have shut
those wells down, even before the testing,'' Schumacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of illnesses aren't just being reported to the health
district, said Lisa Quay, a MUD resident and former board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I go _ swimming lessons, the grocery store, the
women's club _ everyone comes up to me and says, 'My family is
sick,' `` she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandee Sykes, the president of the Woods of Brushy Creek
Neighborhood Association, said she had not heard of such widespread
illness from her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, who went door to door Tuesday evening to make sure her
neighbors had all the information they needed, said, ``People
aren't dropping like flies, but they should be concerned.''

 &HT;    X-RAYS via computer disc saving time, lives
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Three minutes in a hospital room can seem longer
than an hour in the pediatrician's waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an emergency, says Dr. Kathleen Bohanon, it takes at
least three minutes for a doctor to see her patient's X-rays after
the pictures have been shot. Someone has to develop and print the
film, then someone else has to run the hospital-hall dash to
deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes is a lot of time for doctors and nurses to spend
drumming their fingers and watching the clock and wondering if they
did all the right things a few moments earlier when the patient's
heart stopped beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to see that X-ray immediately so you can decide the
next thing to do for this critically ill patient,'' says Bohanon, a
colonel and the chief of medical staff at Wright-Patterson Medical
Center. She'd hate to spend most of her time in a hospital where
that's still not possible, which would be most other hospitals in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, nearly all the X-rays and many other
diagnostic images at Wright-Pat have been captured on computer
disks instead of film. As soon as the X-rays are taken, they can be
seen on any of 60 monitors throughout the hospital. Through the Air
Force's Medical Diagnostic Imaging Support System (MDIS), a doctor
often can look at the X-ray before the patient is wheeled back from
radiology.
</P>
<P>
   Besides boosting emergency response to the speed of light,
picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) such as MDIS
have the advantage of turning out X-rays that never disappear in
long-forgotten folders. That availability often spares patients
from repetitious tests or unnecessary biopsies. The digital X-rays
require fewer exposures to radiation, and might someday lead to
more definite diagnoses and 3-inch disks on which people can carry
their complete medical histories.
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of satellite technology and battlefield urgency,
PACS have caught the attention of most big civilian hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in 10 years, the only people doing X-rays on
film are going to be Third World countries,'' said Dr. Kevin Voss,
the colonel who directs the Wright-Pat Medical Center radiology
department. At an international convention of radiologists last
November, he said PACS were the hottest topic of discussion since
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) started producing sharp pictures
of soft tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Wright-Pat has every kind of picture on its PACS network except
mammograms, which require such intense sharpness that the
government hasn't approved a digital medium for them. Besides
X-rays, it has CAT scans, MRIs, ultrasound and gastrointestinal
pictures and, after ironing out the final wrinkles last week,
angiography (heart) images.
</P>
<P>
   The system has 2 trillion bytes of storage capacity _ enough for
250,000 chest X-rays _ and plenty of shelf space for archived disks
when that fills up. It needs 28 square feet to store images that
used to take up 2,800 square feet, Voss said. The former darkroom
for developing X-ray film has been turned into an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every health-care decision depends on transferring
information out of and into the radiology department,'' said Bilal
Ezzeddine, who has spent three years developing a PACS as imaging
project director at Kettering Medical Center. He said hospitals
cannot tolerate backlogs in imaging departments, which slow down
the rest of a hospital as surely as a highway accident downtown
backs traffic up to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering already uses its PACS for one thing still in the
planning stage at Wright-Pat: transmission of images between
distant hospitals. Cardiologists at Kettering can view images from
Middletown Regional Hospital, which has a diagnostic heart lab but
no surgical program, and discuss a patient's treatment while he's
on his way in an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The military first did that more than seven years ago during the
Gulf War, said Chuck Beverly, who oversees Wright-Pat's PACS for
its manufacturer, GE Medical Systems. A radiologist in Virginia
read a CAT scan that was beamed off a satellite from the
battlefield in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   With its unique battlefield needs and its network of military
hospitals, the Department of Defense was in a better position than
individual hospitals to sink a huge investment into digital imaging
and archiving _ $8.5 million up front in Wright-Pat's case. It was
the second military hospital on line in the fall of 1992 and phased
in the system until it stopped using film internally in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now the system has progressed to the point where people at the
medical center can work with community hospitals looking for
archiving networks. With the military's new Tricare health plan
farming more and more business out to civilian doctors,
transmitting images between hospitals is becoming essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's exciting here is technology has fixed a problem and
made it better,'' said Ed Quillan of the med center's computer
systems department.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was to accommodate the growing field of medical
imaging without hiring a platoon to file and distribute the
pictures. A study at Brooke Army Medical Center outside San Antonio
showed that two weeks after X-rays were taken, 30 percent couldn't
be found and about 10 percent hadn't been read. ``I'm sure that's
true at most teaching hospitals,'' Voss said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology evolved from the snapping and storing of large
volumes of pictures from spy satellites. ``If you can get a
detailed image from miles above the Earth, imagine what you can get
up-close and personal with somebody's anatomy,'' said Master Sgt.
Tom Monroe, the non-commissioned officer in charge of MDIS.
</P>
<P>
   The military's system wasn't the first network for storing and
transmitting images, Beverly said. It was just the first to
transfer images of different manufacturers _ say from a Siemens CAT
scanner through a Merge modem to a GE network on Imation disks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things doctors noticed was that they no longer
had to spend as much as half an hour a day looking for X-rays that
were piled in wire baskets or in transit between departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when we create an image, the physician can see it down the
hall and he's happy,'' Monroe said. ``And we still have it filed,
so we're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The system took a little longer to grow on radiologists, Voss
said. They knew how to read film. Screens are a little different.
``It was like going to England and driving on the opposite side of
the road.'' The docs were afraid they'd miss something.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they learned the screen lets them do something film
never allowed: They could adjust for brightness and contrast.
Instead of calling the patient back to reshoot a bad image, they
could fix it themselves. Instead of using separate exposures for,
say, a hip and a thigh, they only needed one. They could even tweak
a single chest X-ray to focus on the lungs, the ribs, the spine and
the liver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's particularly helpful with kids because they're all
different sizes,'' Bohanon said. ``You might be getting film every
day of a baby with lung disease, and each one's a little different
darkness. So you're trying to decide if the disease is changing or
the X-ray technique is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing current and previous X-rays is the best way to
diagnose many illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a nodule on somebody's chest, we've got the
person's X-rays going back to 1992,'' Voss said. If it hasn't
changed in six years, it can't be cancer. ``Now we don't have to do
a biopsy. We don't have to do surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, the Wright-Pat doctor can even show both pictures
to his patient on his office desktop computer. A link with the
hospital's appointment system will put the right pictures on the
desktop just when the patient arrives. If the patient can see a
picture of his own pneumonia, Voss said, he might be more inclined
to take his medicine as directed.
</P>
<P>
   The technology will soon put images together with lab reports
and doctors' comments, Monroe said. Properly encrypted, a chest
X-ray can be e-mailed to a California specialist. Or a neck X-ray
can be sent from the emergency room to a neurosurgeon's home, where
he can decide if he needs to rush to the hospital or if surgery can
wait till the morning.
</P>
<P>
   As huge databases grow, doctors can compare similar disorders to
see what subtleties they have in common. They're already learning
more about the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease that way.
Some day, computers probably will be able to look for those
characteristics and help doctors make a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just getting started,'' Voss said. With chest X-rays
and mammograms, some computers are programmed to highlight areas
where the radiologist should pay close attention.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, the computers are flagging too many things that
don't matter. ``But that's coming. Computer-assisted diagnosis is a
natural progression. Predicting what's going to occur based on past
information _ people are just scratching the surface on that.''

 &HT;    Texas thirsts for hint of relief
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz

<TEXT>
<P>
   Austin _ It's hot. It's dry. And nobody knows when it's going to
rain.
</P>
<P>
   That was the consensus at a legislative hearing on Texas'
deepening drought. Lack of rainfall and triple-digit temperatures
are producing wide-ranging effects statewide:
</P>
<P>
   Texas' share of water in the two international reservoirs
supplying the Lower Rio Grande Valley is at a combined 21percent of
capacity, the lowest level since the storage system was completed
nearly 30 years ago. (Mexico's storage is at 14 percent.) State
officials foresee no immediate problems meeting the needs of
household and municipal uses, but crop losses are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Flow at Comal Springs in New Braunfels, the largest spring in
the southwestern United States, is dropping daily and could soon
hit the level where the existence of spring-dependent endangered
fish would be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   More ranchers are selling off cattle because pastures are
withering and feed is expensive. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman, winding up a two-day tour of Texas and Oklahoma, said
last year's farm bill ended a program allowing the federal
government to assist farmers with feed costs and compensate them
for dead animals during natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials have put 213 of the state's 4,201
community water systems on a ``watch list'' because their pumps and
pipes are under strain or supplies are being depleted. The human
toll is mounting, with 96 deaths since June 1. The latest victim
was Tommy McDeane, 48, of Dallas, who died recently at a hospital
after an apparent heat stroke about two weeks ago. In Central
Texas, temperatures have broken the century mark in 16 of the last
19 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a whuppin,''' said Travis Miller, a professor and
extension agronomist with Texas A&AMP;M University, about the state's
estimated agricultural losses of $1.5 billion. But his comment also
spoke volumes about the broader effects of the searing weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature enacted a landmark water law last year that
requires cities, water-supply companies, irrigation districts and
other suppliers to conserve more, plan for droughts and work out
regional water-supply arrangements. State Sen. Buster Brown, R-Lake
Jackson, said it was unfortunate that thelegislation was not passed
a few years ago. It's too soon for all of the plans and
conservation measures to be in place, he said at the hearing, held
by a House-Senate panel examining water issues.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, cities across the state can provide residents
with water, said Carolyn Brittin, director of special projects for
the Texas Water Development Board, a planning and financing agency.
</P>
<P>
   But if the drought worsens, many small and medium-size cities
could be hard-pressed for cash to drill new wells, replace broken
equipment and make other improvements, said state Rep. Ron Lewis,
D-Mauriceville. He said many such communities might hesitate to
apply to the development board for loans.
</P>
<P>
   As in most droughts, farmers and ranchers have been the first to
feel the impact. Ranchers are selling 30 percent more cattle than
last summer in the East Texas town of Navasota, said Curtis Burlin,
who runs the local auction barn. ``If you have to sell them all,
it'll take you five years to grow new cows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry said some auction
houses are selling cattle at 10 times last year's rate. ``We're
sitting on what could be one of the worst natural disasters in
Texas history,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton already has declared Texas and 10 other states
in the South and Southwest disaster areas because of heat and
drought, triggering $100 million in federal aid. Texas is expected
to receive $32.7 million of that, primarily for helping low-income
people pay utility bills and buy air-conditioning units, said Tom
Millwee, state coordinator of emergency management.
</P>
<P>
   The current drought differs from the 1996 drought, said James
Kowis, a senior technical specialist for the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission. The 1996 drought began in the fall of the
previous year, while this one began after a wet spring. Therefore,
most areas of the state have more ample supplies now than they did
at the same time two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there are notable exceptions. The watershed supplying the
Lower Rio Grande Valley never received sufficient rainfall to
recover from the '96 drought, Kowis said. And stream flows in
scattered parts of the state are approaching the levels of two
years ago. That spells trouble for some of the state's endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the fountain darter, a 2-inch fish that lives in
the cool waters of Comal Springs. Normally, water flows from the
Edwards Aquifer into the springs at 125,000 gallons per minute.
</P>
<P>
   This week, flow was about 80,000 gallons _ the lowest all year.
Increased draw on the aquifer prompted the Legislature in 1993 to
form the Edwards Aquifer Authority. The agency is supposed to
regulate aquifer pumping and monitor aquifer levels to keep them
from dropping below federally mandated levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, an environmental group, is considering stepping
up its pending federal lawsuit against 1,000 of the largest aquifer
pumpers, including San Antonio and several military bases, said
Myron Hess, a lawyer for the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lucky in the past, the last two times that the
aquifer dropped to dangerously low levels, that we got rain,'' Hess
said. ``But we're not going to get lucky every time.''

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ My dad was a Fort Worth cop for almost 40 years,
most of that as adetective in the homicide division. Working the
homicide detail isn't exactly easy duty -- the hours can be brutal
for one thing -- but he would tell me plainly that it was nothing
compared to the 10 years or so he spent patrolling the streets of
Cowtown. Uniform officers take the frontline of danger in the
police business. Twice in that 10 years criminals made direct
attempts on his life. In that era before police officers had to
watch how they treated prisoners, it was a mistake that both men
paid for. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED.

   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ It's almost camp meeting time in Georgia. Those

New Hope or blessed Shiloh campground. But until camp meeting
starts, there are decoration days at small churches all over the
state. (Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ If society shrugs as standards decline, we're in
trouble. An old friend who has seen the calendar turn about as many
times as I have was on the phone. ``I think I've lived too long,''
he said. ``Maybe both of us have,'' I replied. ``What's bothering
you today?'' `` ``It's a Winston billboard. It says, `Finally, a
butt worth kissing.' Can you imagine such bad taste on a billboard
in downtown Atlanta?'' (Minter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

13th St. ``I had to go to my daughter's house to take a shower.''
The leak was caused by roots from a neighbor's ficus tree. They had
penetrated the bathroom floor, reaching underneath the tub and
around Goldwire's toilet. Ficus trees _ and their cousins, rubber
and banyan trees _ can send roots more than 100 feet from their

reported stomach ailments that officials believe is caused by a
July 14 spill of raw sewage from a City of Austin pumping station

   DISC-XRAYS _ Three minutes in a hospital room can seem longer

emergency, says Dr. Kathleen Bohanon, it takes at least three
minutes for a doctor to see her patient's X-rays after the pictures
have been shot. Someone has to develop and print the film, then
someone else has to run the hospital-hall dash to deliver it. ``You
need to see that X-ray immediately so you can decide the next thing
to do for this critically ill patient,'' says Bohanon, a colonel
and the chief of medical staff at Wright-Patterson Medical Center.
For more than two years, nearly all the X-rays and many other
diagnostic images at Wright-Pat have been captured on computer
disks instead of film. As soon as the X-rays are taken, they can be
seen on any of 60 monitors throughout the hospital. (Lamb, Dayton

   YOUR-STORY _ WEST PALM BEACH _ Editor's note: For the next few
weeks, Ron Wiggins will be picking names at random from the phone
book for What's Your Story?, a column based on the premise that
everyone has a story to tell. This week, he found Lindsay Porter, a
Jupiter, Florida teenager ready to take on the world if she could

reported stomach ailments that officials believe is caused by a

   DISC-XRAYS _ Three minutes in a hospital room can seem longer
than an hour in the pediatrician's waiting room. Even in an
emergency, says Dr. Kathleen Bohanon, it takes at least three
minutes for a doctor to see her patient's X-rays after the pictures
have been shot. Someone has to develop and print the film, then
someone else has to run the hospital-hall dash to deliver it. ``You
need to see that X-ray immediately so you can decide the next thing
to do for this critically ill patient,'' says Bohanon, a colonel
and the chief of medical staff at Wright-Patterson Medical Center.
For more than two years, nearly all the X-rays and many other
diagnostic images at Wright-Pat have been captured on computer
disks instead of film. As soon as the X-rays are taken, they can be
seen on any of 60 monitors throughout the hospital. (Lamb, Dayton

   FILM-REVIEW-NEGOTIATOR (Undated) _ ``The Negotiator'' is

NORMANDY VETERANS RELIVE INVASION THROUGH TALE OF PVT. RYAN

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANIEL J. VARGAS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Linda Lopez never understood why her father,
Remigio Cobarruvias, was so reluctant to talk about World War II,
especially his role in the tide-turning D-Day invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Until ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobarruvias was a 19-year-old medic with the Fourth Infantry
Division, which stormed Utah beach. He was drafted just after
graduating from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of Cobarruviases saw the new Steven Spielberg
film last weekend. When the credits rolled and moviegoers filed
out, Cobarruvias sat still, staring at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to him and thanked him for what he did, and most
importantly for coming home,'' Lopez says.
</P>
<P>
   She says experiencing the film as a family was healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bridges the generational gaps,'' she says. ``The horrors my
father experienced at such a young age, it explains why he didn't
want to talk about it. Now, I really understand what he went
through. It's a part of my father's history so it becomes my
history, and I want it to be part of my children's history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' strips away any glamour attached to
combat and shines a harsh light on ``the good war,'' the bloodiest
conflict in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   The film, starring Tom Hanks, follows eight infantrymen who land
at Normandy on D-Day and end up searching for Pvt. Ryan (Matt
Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Spears had heard some of her grandfather's war stories
and rummaged through his military photos and records, but she
couldn't comprehend what he went through, the hellish nature of
combat.
</P>
<P>
   Until ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear a story, but not all the gunfire, the screams,''
Spears, 27, said after seeing the film with her 74-year-old
grandfather, World War II veteran Charles W. Armstrong, who took
part in the Normandy invasion. ``I never pictured it quite like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1944, Armstrong was a 20-year-old paratrooper (like
the character Pvt. Ryan) with the 82nd Airborne Division. Armstrong
and 35 other men aboard a C-47 were dropped 35 miles inland just
hours before the Allied invasion of Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few minutes into ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the tears
began. During the grisly, 24-minute re-enactment of the Omaha beach
landing that opens the film, Armstrong clenched his 82nd Airborne
camouflage cap. He took deep breaths. His legs twitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly like it,'' the three-time Purple Heart
recipient says of the film. ``It was so real. While I sat there, I
couldn't stop from crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong says he was lucky to be so far inland that day. He had
volunteered for airborne duty because paratroopers made $50 more
per month. He was pulled out of Italy and then stationed in
Nottingham, England, for three months in preparation for D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a lot of friends over there,'' Armstrong says. ``We
were scared. Everyone was afraid, but you had to go. I wasn't a
coward. Even now, some days I wake up crying.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Lisa Armstrong, 37, says the film has given her a
newfound gratitude for World War II veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives would be different today if it wasn't for them,''
she says. ``I'm so proud of him and glad he made it through. It was
hard to watch, but I think it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears says she didn't want to see the movie without her
``papa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to experience it with him,'' she says. ``I just
wanted to be with him holding his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, says Cobarruvias, who as a medic saw the horrors of
combat up close, was ``real, real tough.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ryan's'' realism is important, he says, so younger
generations can understand that World War II was just as terrible
as the Vietnam conflict, so often chronicled on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad people can get an idea of what happened over there,''
he says. ``War is hell. It takes a lot of our young people.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Tinkering with the legend of Atlantis
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 2, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a devoted reader of the Sunday New York Times Book Review
section. Often it saves me the trouble of reading the books
themselves, which allows me to talk about more books than I
actually read, which is helpful at cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   A recent New York Times review of the Richard Ellis book
``Imagining Atlantis'' caught my attention, and inasmuch as I have
not been invited to many cocktail parties lately, this is my only
outlet for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   According to reviewer Robert Eisner, a professor of classics and
humanities at San Diego State University, Ellis claims that
Atlantis did not and does not exist. It was invented by Plato,
writes Ellis, for one of his literary dialogues, just as Lilliput
and Brobdingnag were creations of Jonathan Swift for ``Gulliver's
Travels.''
</P>
<P>
   I never have met anyone who sent out a search party for either
Lilliput or Brobdingnag, but scores have been in pursuit of
Atlantis, that formerly powerful civilization that legend says
apparently sank into the sea because of a huge sinkhole, or
something similar.
</P>
<P>
   According to the review, upwards of 2,000 books have been
written about Atlantis, none of them proving there ever was an
Atlantis. People have looked everywhere for the place, in the
Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the Straits of Florida, the Caribbean,
maybe even in the Gowanus Canal.
</P>
<P>
   But no Atlantis. And, now, the definitive disclaimer by Ellis:
Atlantis never was. Plato made it up.
</P>
<P>
   What the author and reviewer fail to recognize, in their
literary efforts to be academically correct, is that Atlantis does
exist in the minds of every adventurer and dreamer who ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist I once worked with, the late John Keasler, once
wrote a most profound statement about Atlantis. ``That which you
can find is never Atlantis,'' he wrote, ``but that which you can
never find always will be Atlantis.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis, therefore, is what the Chicago Cubs have been
searching for since 1908, the Boston Red Sox since 1918. Atlantis
is what soap opera star Susan Lucci has been seeking for more than
18 years. Atlantis is what Amelia Earhart sought, and Judge Crater,
too. Atlantis is where Harold Stassen wanted to go, where Bob Dole
is planning a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis may be a literary myth but it is a very real state of
mind. Atlantis is that one thing that is just beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I should read the Ellis book but I won't. With all
those hard-to-say and even harder-to-recall Athenian names, I'd
never make it through the book. For me, ``Imagining Atlantis'' may
be an Atlantis in itself; just beyond my ken.
</P>
<P>
   Keasler's observation about Atlantis always has stayed with me,
particularly because that was a trip he talked me into when I was
managing editor of the Miami News. Handing in his expense account
and receipt BEFORE leaving, he and two buddies set sail from Fort
Lauderdale in a fishing boat. They returned in about a week,
proclaiming the discovery of Atlantis in the region of some known
Bahamian turtle kraals.
</P>
<P>
   I recall another thing he said about Atlantis. ``It's partly off
Bimini and partly off Andros Island. So is some good snapper
fishing,'' he wrote for the Miami News many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's something else I've never been able to find _ some good
snapper fishing.

SEXY `GOVERNESS' PIVOTS ON EXPOSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the sensuous, visually astute British period
piece ``The Governess,'' Minnie Driver plays Rosina, a young London
Jewish woman who, to provide for her family after her father is
killed, pretends to be a Protestant in order to secure a position
in a dour, isolated Scottish household.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is the feature writing and directing debut of
Sandra Goldbacher, doesn't make much of its threat to explore 1840s
anti-Semitism. Rather, it uses Rosina's deception as a central
motif for a story about people who are not what they seem, and how,
perhaps, a new technology of artifice can help expose the truth.
Call it ``Isle of Skye Confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving on the windswept, North Sea rock, Rosina discovers
that the wealthy Cavendish clan is made up of an affected,
borderline hysterical mom (Harriet Walter), a distracted dad (Tom
Wilkinson), a dissolute adult son (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and a
misbehaved little girl (Florence Hoath) whom her new nanny
describes as ``a rodent in petticoats.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun, resourceful Rosina quickly brings the child around. It
takes a little longer to get to the Mister, who is obsessed with
discovering a fixing solution for the newfangled craft of
photography. Rosina figures it out for him, then provides more by
posing for a series of ``art'' pictures (Salome's a favorite
theme). Their inevitable affair brings Cavendish out of his uptight
shell but of course threatens the very foundation of Christian
Victorian propriety.
</P>
<P>
   The movie eventually lurches into soapy complications while it
becomes another female empowerment parable that uncomfortably
imposes 1990s attitudes on 1840s sensibilities. Still, for its
cunning interplay of image and illusion; its genuine, exultant
eroticism; and the opportunity it gives the versatile Driver to
break out of supportive-girlfriend purgatory, ``The Governess''
deserves our indulgence. &QL;

 WHEN AN OLDER WOMAN ROMANCES A YOUNGER MAN   World rights except

scenes from ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Hollywood Stars, a

 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's no big deal when Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Michael
Douglas, Clint Eastwood or Harrison Ford romance and win the hearts
of their leading ladies _ most of whom are young enough to be their
daughters.
 &HT;    But what happens when the tables are turned, and the woman is 40
and the object of her desire is 20? Add to the mix the fact that
the couple are black and you have a story perfect for Hollywood.
 &HT;    The movie is ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' (opening Aug.
14.) It stars Angela Bassett as a gorgeous, single stockbroker who
lives in San Francisco, with an adorable son.
 &HT;    All she is missing is a man to share her lifestyle. With pal
Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg) she takes off for a vacation to Jamaica
and falls for Winston Shakespeare (newcomer Taye Diggs, who comes
to the screen from Broadway's ``Rent''). Winston, just out of his
teens, is the son of a wealthy surgeon, but a hunk _ and an
aspiring medical student.
 &HT;    The movie is shot with what could be an intriguing story, but
director Kevin Rodney Sullivan hammers us into a near coma with a
barrage of one liners about age.
 &HT;    Stella (Bassett) is called a cradle-robber. ``I'm old enough to
be your mother,'' she tells the man courting her. He's labeled
jailbait. Get the picture?
 &HT;    While Eastwood and Beatty are obviously decades older than their
leading ladies, Bassett, at 40, looks anything but. Diggs, in his
mid-20s, could pass for 30 so the point seems lost.
 &HT;    But why quibble? That's not what's happening here. When late in
the movie, Stella is taken by the sight of Winston taking a shower
and steps in with him, the audience gasped at the shots of Diggs'
naked torso. He's the Bo Derek of the 1990's.
 &HT;    I haven't seen moviegoers react like that since Robert Redford
took his shirt off in 1973 for Barbra Streisand in ``The Way We
Were.'' Of course, Bassett, best known for her 1993 role as Tina
Turner in ``What's Love Got to Do With It,'' is no chopped liver in
the body department.
 &HT;    The scenario isn't pure Hollywood fiction. It's based on Terry
McMillan's book about her affair with a much younger man. But you
can bet neither of them looked like Bassett or Diggs. McMillan's
last work on screen was in 1995 with ``Waiting to Exhale,'' and the
author, capitalizing on the popular new black ``chick flick''
genre, wrote ``Stella.''
 &HT;    The producer protests that she has a serious aim here:
``Hollywood is uncomfortable with the woman being older,'' declares
Deborah Schindler. ``It goes against the Hollywood grain. Maybe our
film will help crack that stereotype.''
 &HT;    But Bassett certainly doesn't need help. At The Four Seasons
Hotel in Beverly Hills she enters the room in a body-hugging
scarlet dress, black and red clogs, no jewelry or makeup, and
admits that she, too, has dated a much younger man.
 &HT;    ``I once had a boyfriend who was pretty young. I think it can
work. I've dated guys who have been 10 years younger than I _ but
10 years is a significant amount of time. And they were very mature
guys. It was fun but I didn't get as far as thinking of marrying
them.''
 &HT;    So does she approve of older women-younger men relationships?
``If the guy loves and appreciates and admires you _ and he's
mature enough then go for it,'' she says.
 &HT;    Married herself (a year in October) to actor Courtney Vance, (he
appeared in the 1997 TV remake of ``Twelve Angry Men''), Bassett is
off the market. But she has a good memory.
 &HT;    ``I know this girl,'' she says. ``Stella has dealt with so many
disappointments in matters of the heart that she puts romance in a
place where her expectations are zero. I think audiences can really
open themselves up to this piece.'''
 &HT;    Bassett, who came to Hollywood after growing up in projects in
St. Petersburg, Fla., got the acting bug at l6 on a student trip to
Washington, D.C., where she was overwhelmed by James Earl Jones'
performance in John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men.''
 &HT;    On several scholarships, she earned an undergraduate degree from
Yale and went on for a master's in fine arts from the univeristy's
School of Drama. After several Off-Broadway roles, she landed on
Broadway in two August Wilson plays, the 1984 ``Ma Rainey's Black
Bottom'' and the 1986 ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone.''
 &HT;    In l990, John Singleton cast her as a single mother trying to
raise a son in ``Boyz N the Hood.'' She was Betty Shabazz, wife of
Malcolm X (opposite Denzel Washington) in Spike Lee's 1992 movie
about the black leader. But it was her performance as Turner that
earned her a Hollywood Foreign Press best actress Golden Globe and
a best actress Oscar nomination.
 &HT;    The new film may seem small after that kind of performance but
Bassett insists, ``I like Stella. Like many women she's a nurturer,
friend, mother, aunt and worker. She's just plain busy with life.
She has put off nurturing herself, giving herself the freedom to
really love somebody and let him love her _ regardless of a big age
difference.''
 &HT;    She grabbed the part, she says, because, ``The story deals with
universal themes while asking some important questions. Can you
live your own life? Is finding love possible, and if so, what does
it take?''
 &HT;    And maybe she and the film makers hope this story might change
things in Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``This theme hasn't been done very often,'' notes Sullivan.
``This is a male-driven industry so the folks who make the
decisions probably prefer to see an an older actor with a younger
woman,'' he says. ``But as Hollywood evolves more women are in
decision making positions.''

`VOYAGE' A FINE FAREWELL FOR MASTROIANNI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At one point in Manoel de Oliveira's melancholy,
charming film ``Voyage to the Beginning of the World,'' the
resonant Portuguese word saudade is translated to mean ``nostalgia
when you lose your sense of irony.'' Spoken by the great Marcello
Mastroianni in his last movie appearance, it sums up the delicate
feeling, if not the complexity, of this bittersweet memory film.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's world-class director for the better part of the
century, Oliveira, now 89, is clearly reflecting on his own life in
``Voyage.'' Mastroianni plays an aging Portuguese filmmaker named
Manoel who road-trips through the locations of his youth regaling
three accompanying actors like a character out of Proust, with the
memories evoked by sights both changed and remarkably preserved.
</P>
<P>
   But Oliveira isn't just looking back in this film. Rather, he
examines the past as prelude to both the present and future _ and
ultimately views it all as a kind of circle where the elusive
concept of home resides.
</P>
<P>
   With Manoel are two French-speaking Portuguese actors, the
intelligent, impudent Judite (Leonor Silveira) and the fun-loving
Duarte (Diogo Doria). The most significant fellow traveler, though,
is Afonso (Jean Yves Gautier), a Frenchman of Portuguese descent
who doesn't speak his father's tongue but is determined to make
contact with his Iberian relatives for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   As the focus of the film shifts from Manoel's memories to
Afonso's encounter with a suspicious aunt (the wonderful,
rhino-hided Isabel de Castro), questions of where blood ties and
cultural identity belong in modern, cosmopolitan Europe emerge. The
answers, which incorporate the conforming effects of urbanization
and mass media and the specter of nationalism gone horribly wrong
in the Balkans, are not simple.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Oliveira's cinematic plan is simple, but
elegantly so. Much of the movie consists of four people talking in
a moving van and more pseudo-intellectual conversations framed
against picturesque destinations. Yet the film, which opens with a
long shot of lines speeding by on a highway, gradually shifts into
an exquisite collection of visual rhythms, with tempos that change
to fit the emotional mood of a scene much as the film's
well-tempered musical score graduates from dissonance to more
contemplative, if not more comforting melodies.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about this understatedly unsettling piece is pure
pleasure, though: watching Mastroianni being every bit the
sophisticated imp of international cinema he always was to the very
end.

BAD POLICE WORK IN `THE NEGOTIATOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the goofy and contrived dramatic/action situations
thought up for this summer's crop of movies, the premise for ``The
Negotiator'' is probably one of the least offensive.
</P>
<P>
   It may be difficult to swallow that a police hostage negotiator
who finds himself framed for his partner's murder resorts to taking
hostages himself in order to clear his name. But at least as
directed by L. Gary Gray (``Set it Off'') and acted by Samuel L.
Jackson, the thing is watchable.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson plays Danny Roman, famed in Chicago police circles for
his golden tongue and steely courage in life-and-death
circumstances. But when his partner is assassinated and papers
indicating that Danny has been siphoning pension funds to off-shore
accounts are found in his house, Danny demands to face his accuser.
</P>
<P>
   That man is an ethically ambiguous internal affairs investigator
named Niebaum (the late J.T. Walsh). When Danny gets no
satisfaction, he loses his head and takes Niebaum, his assistant
and a petty informer hostage. His intention is to hold them until
he can interrogate Niebaum and learn who framed him.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), another well-known police
negotiator from across town. Danny will only talk to him because he
knows that the real perpetrators of the crime are fellows in his
own precinct. Danny can't trust his friends because exonerating
Danny will implicate them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the two-hours-plus movie is spent shifting between the
command center occupied by Danny's colleagues and the federal
office building where Danny is trying to get the truth out of
Niebaum and his computer system. In all the back and forth, the one
thing the audience knows is that Danny is innocent. What we don't
know is which of the cops played by John Spencer, Ron Rifkin and
David Morse are trying to kill Danny for their own nasty reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that the movie doesn't have much comprehensible plot.
We know that Sabian will do the right thing and help Danny in the
end, but when the mystery is unraveled and the frame-up is
revealed, I, personally, had no idea what anyone was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many things about this movie that stretched credulity
was the fact that Danny was accused of stealing from the pension
fund based solely on incriminating papers found in his house. I
never heard anyone wondering if these papers had Danny's
fingerprints on them. If not, how did he get them into the house?
With pincers? And when the rubber gloves worn by the killer were
found, no one checked to see if Danny's fingerprints were inside
the gloves' fingers. This is shoddy police work, if you ask me.
</P>
<P>
   I also wondered about the urgency of getting Sabian, who was
stuck in traffic, to the hostage-taking site when he easily could
have started talking to Danny by cellular phone the minute the
police brought him onto the case. Couldn't the filmmakers dream up
another way of creating dramatic tension?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in these big-budget action movies it's always dismaying
when the makeup and wigs look bad. Poor Spacey shouldn't be reduced
to wearing a toupee that is a different color from the rest of his
hair.

DON'T CONFUSE `BASEKETBALL' WITH ANYTHING BY WOODY ALLEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2   Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``BASEketball'' is the kind of movie where if two
people walk into a room that has a chute marked ``soiled laundry,''
you know with complete certainty that one of them will fall through
_ and 10 seconds later, you'll see every yucky detail of the
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has been billed as a melding of David Zucker's wacky
``Naked Gun'' sensibilities with the crude satire of ``South Park''
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who star in the film.
Unfortunately, most of the time, ``BASEketball'' just gives us
vulgarity without any of the biting wit. The generational comic
graft simply doesn't work, although the movie isn't without some
funny moments, especially for those in the audience who like their
genital humor in rapid-fire doses.
</P>
<P>
   When ``BASEketball'' begins, it looks like Zucker is going pull
one of his trademark spoofs, this time skewering the professional
sports scene. In a few dead-on minutes, Zucker and his writing team
hit every target _ the commercialization, the franchise relocation,
the lack of loyalty of both players and team owners. There's some
great stuff here that takes the games' greed to the next logical
level _ stadiums named after a hemorrhoid ointment and blimps owned
by the makers of tampons (a great way, no doubt, to make inroads
with that coveted female demographic).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a couple of dimwits (Parker and Stone, naturally) are
spinning their wheels, wondering if they'll have to get jobs and
buy a pair of khakis to finally score with the babes. It turns out
there will be no need for that. The hybrid sports game they play in
their driveway, ``baseketball,'' has caught the eye of a wealthy
Texas oilman (Ernest Borgnine) who decides to promote it as the
alternative national pastime. And to make it a true alternative, he
lays down a couple of ground rules. Teams can't move and players
(who are paid a flat rate) can't switch teams.
</P>
<P>
   The movie spends an inordinate amount of time on the game
itself, perhaps because Zucker and his friends really did invent
it. It's kind of like the basketball shooting contest ``horse,''
only in ``baseketball'' you get singles, doubles and home runs
depending on where you shoot the ball. You miss a basket and you
record an out. You can also ``psyche'' the shooter out by employing
such varied and cunning strategies as pulling down your pants,
calling out the opponent's mother or squirting milk into his face
through a nipple apparatus. (Don't ask.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of it is as dumb as it sounds. There are only so many times
you can watch these guys try to psyche each other out before it
becomes even more boring than an American League baseball game.
Almost all the humor comes from the toilet, and after the first
shock wave wears off, you're left with a bunch of doofuses talking
about chicken poop and vomit. It's all irony, virtually
substance-free. And as anyone who has recently followed David
Letterman's career will tell you, that kind of comic sensibility
wears thin after a while.
</P>
<P>
   There are some funny bits, though, including costume designer
Catherine Adair's inspired team uniforms for the ``baseketball''
league (the Roswell Aliens, L.A. Riots, San Francisco Fairies,
etc). Broadcasters Bob Costas and Al Michaels share the announcing
duties and spoof their own serious images. There are also the
requisite stadium giveaways _ free-range chicken night, dozen-egg
night _ that are good for a laugh or two.
</P>
<P>
   As actors, Parker and Stone are great writers, but they have a
genial enough presence and can hold their own opposite Jenny
McCarthy and Yasmine Bleeth. Also on hand are the ``baseketball''
cheerleaders, whose uniforms come courtesy of Frederick's of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It's all geared toward 17-year-old adolescents or guys who shop
for bed linens at the ESPN Store. For this audience, you can't have
too many shots of people getting kicked in the groin. Others might
start to feel their pain.

BARRYMORE-BUOYED `EVER AFTER' STILL A CINDERELLA STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Attitude is everything in ``Ever After,'' a
Cinderella story minus the fairy-tale trappings but drenched in
'90s-style romantic fantasy. It's the kind of thing where Cindy
sometimes saves the prince, and the stepmother is a figure of
ridicule as well as malice, but no one's going to dare take the
happily out of ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the illusion of realism director Andy Tennant and his
first-class design team (production designer Michael Howells,
Merchant-Ivory's Oscar-winning costumer Jenny Beavan) get on screen
is nicely complemented by a set of natural, witty performances. If
the script, by Tennant, Susannah Grant (``Pocahontas'') and Rick
Parks, wasn't so fundamentally dream-wishy, the film might be
mistaken for something like social history.
</P>
<P>
   Or a good farce, which it occasionally turns into.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens sometime in the 19th century, when an aging
survivor of the French royal family (Jeanne Moreau, exquisitely
imperious) summons the Brothers Grimm to her palace. She has a bone
to pick with their version of ``Cinderella,'' and she has the
actual glass slipper to prove her point.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back about three centuries to a rustic manor home where a
bright little tomboy named Danielle is the apple of her widowed
father Auguste's (Jeroen Krabbe) eye. But shortly after he
remarries the snooty if penniless noblewoman Rodmilla (Anjelica
Huston), Auguste has a heart attack. His last thoughts are of his
daughter, which provides at least a semblance of emotional
justification for the stepmother's future wickedness.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or so years later, Danielle has grown into robust Drew
Barrymore. Though reduced to servant status by Rodmilla and her
daughters, the pretty but hateful Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and the
porky, resentful Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey, who played the
magnificently psycho sourpuss in ``Heavenly Creatures''), Danielle
accepts her degraded position by choice. Her efforts are all that's
keeping the mismanaged family estate solvent, and she's covered
with ashes because she stays up all night reading Thomas More by
firelight.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she ain't no victim, she's just pursuing a slightly
downscale self-improvement strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle and handsome Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) meet cute:
She beans the heir to the French throne with well-pitched apples
when he steals her father's horse. He's just trying to run away
from an arranged marriage to some Spanish princess he's never met,
but no matter. Henry admires the peasant girl's spunk.
</P>
<P>
   When she disguises herself as a noblewoman and meets the prince
again, he doesn't recognize Danielle but is intrigued by her
stubborn commitment to the plight of the working folk. Infatuation
grows through a series of convenient encounters, sometimes abetted
by the Renaissance equivalent of a fairy godmother: Leonardo da
Vinci (Patrick Godfrey), visiting scholar and matchmaker
extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   Rodmilla has other plans, however. The French king gives his son
until the big masked ball to find a mate he really loves, after
which the Spanish gambit goes into effect. Sexy Marguerite is a
perfect candidate, and that scruffy Danielle better not get in the
way. Without the aid of a magic pumpkin, can the good-hearted girl
prevail?
</P>
<P>
   Huston has a fabulous time playing the calculating, grasping
Rodmilla; she knows just how to deliver a pretension-puncturing
gesture in a way everyone but the character can laugh at. Barrymore
and newcomer Scott make a wonderful couple, of course; it would be
hard for them not to, since they're both playing people whose flaws
are even attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Lynskey, no surprise, is the supporting-cast standout as the
disrespected duckling who refuses to toe the evil stepsister line.
She's a comic vision of rebellion in puffy sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in France's Dordogne region, ``Ever After'' is visually
sumptuous without getting too fussy about it. It's not any more
believable than the fantastic versions of the ``Cinderella'' fable,
and it's hardly the subversion that the filmmakers may wish to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   And, as ever, a change in style has little impact on anything as
powerful as the wish to believe in happily ever after.
</P>

TRUE DREW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Drew Barrymore certainly didn't have a fairy-tale
childhood. But she knows a thing or two about happy endings, and
that made her a pretty good choice to play the Cinderella-type
character in ``Ever After,'' a charming, romantic update of the the
classic children's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing I've learned,'' the 23-year-old Barrymore
says, ``is that fairy tales get darkest right before the light.
That's one of the reasons I wanted to be in this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever After'' manages to put a modern twist on the story while
retaining a wonderfully old-fashioned feel. Cinderella no longer
waits for Prince Charming to rescue her; in fact, she saves the
prince's life with her quick thinking _ and strong back muscles _
on one occasion. The girl loves to read, can hold her own with a
sword and would be just as happy without the prince, as long as she
could somehow move her stepmother and stepsisters off her late
father's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be doing this kind of movie at a time when there
are so many films being made about tough, evil subjects,'' says
Angelica Huston, who plays the (still) wicked stepmother with
delicious gusto. ``Being involved with something sweet and tender
was a delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Andy Tennant (``Fools Rush In'') came upon the Susannah
Grant's original script two years ago and, with the help of writing
partner Rick Parks, polished it, adding comic elements and beefing
up the role of the prince (who never actually speaks in the Disney
animated feature).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had recently become a parent, and I was starting to notice
the kind of influence these stories and cartoons had,'' Tennant
says. ``I didn't want my daughters to grow up believing they have
to marry a rich guy with a big house in order to live happily ever
after.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore came attached to the project, and while Tennant admits
she wasn't everyone's choice to play Danielle, the film's
Cinderella, he believed she would be perfect for the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Drew, and I can tell you that she has lived
Cinderella's story,'' says Tennant, who five years ago directed
Barrymore in ``The Amy Fisher Story,'' one of the actress' first
significant comeback projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has lived through a lot,'' Tennant continues. ``She didn't
have an easy childhood, and I think this project appealed to her to
a certain extent because it could let her exorcise those demons.
There were many times on the set where I would see her going into a
black hole and tap into some things that I think she's done a good
job of avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew, too, that the movie rested upon her shoulders, which
I think both psyched her up and terrified her.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore's troubled past should be familiar even to people who
don't tune into ``Hard Copy'' or read the gossip sheets, perhaps
because she made such a point of going public with the ups and
downs of her life. Her autobiography (yes, she has already written
one) contained the famous line: ``I had my first drink at age 9,
began smoking marijuana at 10, and at 12 took up cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting was in her bloodstream as well, being the granddaughter
of the legendary John Barrymore and goddaughter of Steven
Spielberg, who cast her at age 6 in her first movie, ``E.T.'' After
teen years that began in a mental health facility and ended with a
cover spread in Playboy, Barrymore took control of her life _ and
career _ by winning legal proceedings against her mother, who was
then her manager, too.
</P>
<P>
   So when Barrymore speaks of fairy tales, she certainly has in
mind the fractured kind as told by the Brothers Grimm attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of see this movie as an abolition of cliches,'' she
says. ``Cinderella doesn't have to be this girly, helpless
creature. She can be strong. She can be smart. She can be
vulnerable, but she can learn to make it on her own, too. I think a
lot of young women will be able to relate to this story and see
that it's what is in your mind and heart that's important. You take
care of that and the other things will come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever After'' also explains the motivations of the story's
other characters, showing the prince to be something of a prisoner
of his title. (``He learns that power is the ability to change the
world for the better,'' Barrymore says. ``I really like that. It's
something I'm trying to learn, too.'') Huston's stepmother isn't a
cartoon character, either. She's a baddie, all right, but part of
the reason she despises Cinderella is that the girl's presence is a
painful reminder of her late husband's untimely death.
</P>
<P>
   This thoughtful grounding gives the scenes between Barrymore and
Huston an interesting, emotional resonance that expands on the
fairy tale's universal themes.
</P>
<P>
   ```Cinderella' has always had some pretty powerful things going
on,'' Tennant says. ``There's the sibling rivalry, mother-daughter
rivalry and issues of self-worth. Those are all reasons the story
has been around for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore was thrilled to work with Huston, daughter of
directing great John Huston, and not for simply the obvious
reasons. She saw it as a linking of two great dramatic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the idea of both of our families coming together,''
Barrymore says. ``It's kind of cool to think of honoring the legacy
of the Hustons and Barrymores in one movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As for their potent scenes together, Barrymore admits there are
some obvious mother-daughter correlations to her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there were some times when it got kind of hard,''
Barrymore says. ``But that's part of acting and part of what makes
it great. You should be willing to go to those places for all your
roles. I love having that cathartic channel and being able to give
a sense of myself in my movies. I don't think you ever need to
create any drama. Life provides it.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, for Barrymore, the drama is coming in smaller
doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good girl, and she's really pulled her life
together,'' says Charles Shyer, the producer-writer of ``The Parent
Trap'' who directed a young Barrymore in the 1984 comedy,
``Irreconcilable Differences'' and has since kept in touch. ``She
is a real success story, the kind of which this town needs.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Barrymore is basking in the light of a happy ending, she
is making sure to keep her feet firmly grounded, from the dirt she
sprinkled in her shoes when she attended the Oscars (``With the
daisies in my hair, I was a human flower pot,'' she says with a
laugh) to the kinds of slippers she really prefers to wear. Hint:
They're not of the glass variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' she says, giggling. ``I'm an Isotoner girl. I didn't
even get one of those glass slippers Salvatore Ferragamo made for
the movie. Too fussy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cinderella for the '90s indeed.

DESPITE THE MUSIC, THE NEW `PARENT TRAP' IS ENGAGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm trying to remember what my reaction to ``The Parent Trap''
was when I saw it as a little girl in 1961. My primary recollection
is that it was extraordinary that through the magic of movie
technology, one actress _ Hayley Mills _ was able to play two
little girls.
</P>
<P>
   As the technology has improved the magic has gotten even more
seamless. Lindsay Lohan, 12-year-old veteran of commercials and
television, is a frighteningly poised child who is truly impressive
as the long-separated twins, Annie and Hallie, who meet by accident
at summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   What the two freckled, red-headed fencing and poker experts
discover when they confront their mirror-image faces is that their
parents, Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) and Nick Parker
(Dennis Quaid), divorced when they were babies and haven't seen
each other since.
</P>
<P>
   While the twins in the 1961 movie were pretty identical in looks
as well as personality, these twins are more like those identical
cousins Patty Duke played on television.
</P>
<P>
   Annie, with a cultured English accent, was raised in London by
her wedding dress-designing mom in an atmosphere of gentility,
hushed book-lined rooms and tweed. The butler, Martin (the amusing
Simon Kunz), is her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hallie is a hip American kid raised in California on her
father's vineyard. The housekeeper, Chessy (terrifically portrayed
by Lisa Ann Walter), is her surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now if this movie were ``The Nanny,'' Nick would have married
Chessy years ago. But it's ``The Parent Trap,'' and it is therefore
necessary for the twins to impersonate each other and return to the
wrong parents at the end of the summer in order to get them to
marry again. For this to work, Nick would have to be single.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the big drama in the movie, which was written by
producers Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, along with David Swift,
is that when Annie (the English twin) goes to Napa posing as
Hallie, she finds that Dad is about to marry a hussy who is after
his money. Meredith Blake is a tall blond, acid-tongued vulture
and, as played by Elaine Hendrix, she is suitably dislikable.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping into action, Hallie admits to Elizabeth who she really
is and mother and daughter jump on a plane for the U.S.A. where
Meredith is busy trying to plan the wedding and send Nick's
daughter somewhere far away, like boarding school in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith's transparent greed makes her a wonderful foil for
Annie and Hallie, who are two of the cleverest trick-playing kids
since Macaulay Culkin in ``Home Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers does a good job directing this upper-class fairy tale
about the problems of the rich and lovelorn. Richardson is, as
always, serene and kindly in her persona. You would want to be her
daughter and you can understand why Hallie, once she's found
Elizabeth, would be reluctant to give her up. And Quaid is still a
bit boyish for my taste _ it's unseemly at his age _ but he does a
creditable mid-life crisis victim succumbing to the charms of a
toxic younger woman.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what little girls today are going to remember about
this movie 37 years from now, but parents can take heart in knowing
that it's a movie they can safely let their kids see.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't understand is why a wide range of utterly unrelated
and out-of-context music is used. All of sudden, boom, we hear the
theme from ``The Great Escape.'' And then, equally out of nowhere,
there is the Beatles tune ``Here Comes the Sun'' played against a
shot reminiscent of the ``Abbey Road'' album cover that has nothing
to do with anything except that it's a street corner in London and
the movie is shot partly in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Mood'' is played as if there were a big-band dance
scene coming up, but of course there isn't. The danger in using
such recognizable and evocative music is that the audience expects
it to mean something and wonders why it doesn't. The one thing you
don't want your audience doing is taking time out to ponder the
soundtrack when they're supposed to be absorbed with the plot.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   While she was the former Soviet Union's first lady, Raisa
Gorbachev was often villified in the press, both at home and
abroad. A strong, intelligent, stylish, articulate woman, she was
frequently criticized for her hemlines, her shoes, her sunglasses,
her ``willfulness,'' her opinions, her lack of a traditional female
demeanor _ and for having ``too much control'' over her husband,
Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of the marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton, in
fact, the Gorbachevs' longlasting relationship has been notably
egalitarian. Gorbachev himself once revealed in an NBC-TV interview
with Tom Brokaw that he ``discussed everything'' with his wife _
igniting a storm of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Only after becoming a sixtysomething grandmother _ and keeping a
high profile through activism in issues concerning women, children
and families _ has Raisa Gorbachev come to rank high in Russian
public-opinion polls. Today she is one of the most admired women in
her troubled nation.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hillary Clinton, on reaching 50 and packing her
healthy daughter Chelsea off to college _ while keeping a heavy
schedule of activities on behalf of women, children and families _
suddenly began to rank high in U.S. public-approval surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Today Mrs. Gorbachev regards with almost motherly empathy the
trials of other first ladies in the spotlight, including those of
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted in June at the elegant Copley Plaza
Hotel in Boston, after Mrs. Gorbachev had received an honorary
degree from Northeastern University, where The Gorbachev
Foundation, a political, social and environmental think tank, has
its North American headquarters.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.

FROM VIETNAM, PHOTOS WORTH THOUSANDS OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I wasn't there. ``There'' is Vietnam, and that's
the word so many use.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors to ``Requiem,'' an exhibition of war photographs
by photographers killed in the Vietnam War, also weren't there.
Others were, and all kinds left comments in a guest book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried here today. I was there. It was as horrible as these
images.'' So wrote a man who served in a helicopter unit in Vietnam
from 1967 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been there. Done that. Have the steel plate in my head to
prove it,'' wrote another visitor. ``The memories are still too
powerful to look at the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Photos never speak of the real pains endured,'' wrote a former
Marine.
</P>
<P>
   The messages in the book speak of real pain, and therefore I
omit the names of those who wrote them. Many are private
communications between authors and their souls.
</P>
<P>
   Some messages were left like names on rocks. ``I was there, Aug.
'65 _ July '66,'' wrote a veteran, adding only his name and former
rank.
</P>
<P>
   Many writers left no name at all. One left the kind of message
that carries the bleak cynicism of the '60s: ``War is a great photo
opp.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, based on the book ``Requiem,'' edited by famed
war photographers Tim Page and Horst Faas, is sponsored by the
Freedom Forum, a foundation dedicated to a free press.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition runs through Aug. 22 at the One Market office
complex in San Francisco, where the Freedom Forum has its West
Coast headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The late Larry Burrows' famous 1965 photo of a crying Marine
helicopter crew chief hangs opposite polished elevators. A picture
of the legendary photographer Dickey Chapelle lying mortally
wounded near Chu Lai is just steps away from diners at the posh One
Market restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about something cheerful, uplifting in the lobby,'' wrote
one office worker, suggesting such topics as puppies.
</P>
<P>
   Another person wrote: ``Put something positive up _ get rid of
bad memories and the negative. I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999 a larger display of the photographs, as shown in
New York and Arlington, Va., will be at the Oakland Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horst Faas is trying to get it made into a documentary,'' said
Gina Louise Keel of the Freedom Forum, ``but people say, `No one
wants to see that _ it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't over. Just read the guest book.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran passing through said he was shocked to see
photographs of Hill 875 in the A Shau Valley in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was WIA (wounded in action) there and remember it just like
that. Just like being on the surface of the moon. These are more
nightmares than memories, but they evoke tears immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   A man born too late for the war wrote of the photographs: ``When
I look into the eyes of the soldiers, I don't see heroes. I don't
see the look of fear. I see them realizing that they will, in fact,
die in this war. ... I take the name of my uncle who died in
Vietnam. I hope he didn't realize that he was about to die, but if
he had the realization, I hope at least he was content.''
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of the soldiers in the photographs are what strike you,
not what little gore there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the world yet,'' wrote a journalism student,
26. ``In school they ask `Would you cover a war if there was one?'
I always raise my hand _ the drive, the instinct, the scoop _ but
after seeing the truth in their eyes in these photos, I have to ask
myself the same question, `Would I?'''
</P>
<P>
   The most common comments are ``moving,'' ``powerful,''
expressions of hatred for war and thanks from veterans to
photographers for telling their story.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the images are too strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nauseating display pandering to people's worst
instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think they're not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one blind? No hair on fire? No grandmother deafened? No
child with legs blown off? ...''
</P>
<P>
   Looking through the guest book, you're struck by how thoughtful
most people are. In shaky block letters someone had written:
``Footnote, 7/24/98: (Photographer) Sean Flynn's girlfriend spent
her life savings looking for him after he disappeared in Cambodia.
Tim Page was never compensated for his injuries. God bless all, GI,
Vietnam, 1965-66.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Army lieutenant and CBS journalist filled two pages of
the guest book adding the stories of video photographers who died
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a few people wrote dumb comments, but most didn't. There
were only two responses to other people's comments.
</P>
<P>
   One came after someone wrote, ``It takes bravery to fight and
die _ not hide in the background with a camera,'' which drew the
response ``A moron must have written this.''
</P>
<P>
   To that someone wrote, ``Make your own comment, a------.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those rare civilizing moments with that
seven-letter word in it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with sense knows that writing in this guest book is to be
taken as seriously as leaving a memento at the Vietnam Memorial
wall in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After all, your comment is in the same book as ``Let there be no
more wars. I miss my Uncle Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``I was there.''
</P>

 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that most Russian Israelis cannot tolerate the
rhetoric of the left because of their painful memories of the
Soviet Union. Having been exposed to intense anti-Semitism, many of
these insecure immigrants share the widespread ultra-Orthodox
distrust of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians, unlike the ultra-Orthodox, do not have an
echelon of young activists who dictate their political agenda, they
are nourished by several conservative daily newspapers printed in
their native language. This right-leaning Russian press is, in
fact, the unifying element of a highly diverse group.
</P>
<P>
   However, with their secularism, heterogeneity and large number
of countries of origin, the Jews from the former Soviet Union are
the softest part of the soft right. Russian electoral behavior can
be quite pragmatic. While their rhetoric remains conservative, the
Russians are in nobody's pocket. Netanyahu will have to work hard
to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful to the soft right for its votes, Netanyahu has been
quick to recognize the price of its continued support. A superb
communicator, Netanyahu knows that this emotional constituency is
enamored of chauvinist rhetoric and attacks on Arab terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   When a crisis with the Palestinians, Hizballah, the Clinton
administration or alleged ``Arab sympathizers'' anywhere erupts, a
belligerent Netanyahu rushes for the cameras. The astounding
success of this media strategy was evident after the Mossad, the
Israeli security service, bungled an assassination attempt last
year on a Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from the Labor Party, the United States and a livid
King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu told the soft right exactly what
they most wished to hear: that, regardless of political risk, he
would continue to hunt terrorists wherever they might be and that
Israelis' security would remain his sole consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, in a meeting with an elderly Sephardic
kabbalistic rabbi, Netanyahu pandered again to soft-right
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not realizing that he could be heard by reporters, the prime
minister whispered that Israeli leftists had forgotten how to be
Jews and could not be entrusted with the nation's security because
they are prepared to accept Israeli Arabs as partners in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vocal departures of Binyamin Ze'ev Begin _ the
son of Menachem Begin, the Likud's founder _ and others from
Netanyahu's cabinet undermined his authority among members of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   But with the backing of the soft right, who either disregard his
critics outright or see them merely as ``in-fighters,'' Netanyahu
is able to maintain solid public support and convince his
detractors that he is still the best game around. In an age of
television and virtual politics, the soft right is a great asset
for a leader of Netanyahu's style.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, the ultra-Orthodox and the Russians dislike the
Arabs and distrust the secular left, but they are not prepared to
enter into a bloody confrontation with the Palestinians or Syrians.
Unlike the Israeli right's hard core, which is ready to fight for
the land of Israel and to accept the concomitant sacrifices, most
Israelis, including the Russian immigrants, are opposed to spilling
blood to keep the West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox and Russian families of
soldiers are especially likely to resent any government that leads
the nation into a costly military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by making it known to Netanyahu that a continued
deterioration in the peace process could cause them to switch
allegiances, the soft right may have its finest hour.

<P>
   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>

<P>
   As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's
personal influence and political wiles have let him dominate and
change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure could.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oslo peace process flags, Arafat falls and Hamas rises,
the mainstream, secular nationalist movement _ Arafat's al-Fatah _
could indeed lose its current hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, like their Israeli neighbors, are highly
politicized. The 1993 Oslo Accords call for an end to terrorism,
mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and the creation of the Palestine Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   How do Palestinians feel about these issues?
</P>
<P>
   Pundits often make sweeping generalizations about ``belligerent
Palestinian attitudes'' without bothering to offer evidence of any
sort. But since 1993, Palestinian public opinion has been surveyed
regularly and extensively, and can be quite accurately gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian students, like most other Arab students, tend to be
more radical, defending ideals rather than compromises. To be sure,
a general lack of responsibilities influences student thinking
about the peace process. But more important, students' perceptions
of Oslo are colored by the way they perceive their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most students see the peace process as an American tool to
stabilize Arafat's regime and maintain a domestic status quo. The
more disillusioned the students are with Arafat's Palestine
Authority _ accusing it of corruption, mismanagement and lack of
democratization _ the more opposed to the peace process they
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, embrace the values of
political Islam and seek to establish an Islamic state. They
emphasize traditional values, including veiling women and limiting
their political role, but are not totally opposed to some liberal
and democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists oppose the peace process, refusing to acknowledge
the legitimacy of Israel. They have no consistent demographic
characteristic, even though disproportionately more support for
them is found among illiterates and the most educated youth.
</P>
<P>
   The nonaffiliated are likely to be older, female,
better-educated West Bank residents. But, excluding the
universities, Palestinian society remains deeply traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, religion cuts different ways for the Palestinians.
Those who pray daily are as likely to support the secular
nationalists of Arafat's Fatah as they are to support Hamas. But
the Islamists have more support among those who oppose women's
participation in politics and less support among feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas increases significantly among those who
strongly oppose reinterpreting Islamic law to make it applicable to
conditions of contemporary life. Support for the mainstream and the
left increases among those who seek a more modern form of Islam.
While Fatah has done well at appropriating some religious
symbolism, the bottom line is that Palestinian traditionalism
provides a deep wellspring of support for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, surveys of Islamist public opinion
reveal significant heterogeneity. Palestinian Islamists are not a
special group with identifiable demographic characteristics. They
do not necessarily think alike, and they lack a unified worldview.
Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism
depends on diplomatic movement, national reconstruction, and
Arafat's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Support for attacks against Israelis has dropped from 57 percent
in November 1994, to 46 percent in February 1995, to 33 percent a
month later, and to 21 percent in March 1996 _ all dates of major
suicide bombings by members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. But
frustration creates a constituency for terror.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's response to violence, including a policy of closing off
the West Bank and Gaza, and the infliction of collective pain and
suffering, led to a rise in support for violence among Palestinians
after months of steady decline. One significant jolt occurred in
the spring of 1997 in response to groundbreaking for the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, violence is popular among Palestinian university
students. Almost 60 percent advocate armed attacks against Israeli
targets, while only 25 percent oppose them. Moreover, 70 percent
believe that armed resistance is a realistic option for
Palestinians if the current negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of Palestinians not only rejected
terrorism against Israelis but also backed the March 1996 Palestine
Authority crackdown against the Islamists after the bus bombings
the month before, knowing full well that the raids sought to
prevent further attacks on Israelis. Only 32 percent opposed the
reprisals against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   To most Palestinians, Islamist terrorism slows the return of
West Bank land, undermines the Palestinian economy, boosts the
right-wing Israeli Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu _ and pushes
the Palestine Authority to focus on Israeli security at the expense
of Palestinian democracy and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, statehood is a sine qua non. A final peace
plan that did not grant Palestinian independence would be doomed on
the Palestinian street. Moreover, Palestinian opinion would buck
any resolution that did not give the new state of Palestine the
vast majority of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, are quite flexible about security
arrangements to ease Israeli jitters. The most important of these,
demilitarization of a Palestinian state, would almost certainly be
acceptable to Palestinian public opinion, so long as the state
comprised most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Palestinians supported the establishment of
a sovereign but demilitarized state in 95 percent of the West Bank
and all of Gaza, but support dropped to only 16 percent if the
state took up a smaller area of the West Bank. Palestinians would
also probably tolerate continued security cooperation with Israel
and a limited Israeli troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   On two other contentious issues, settlements and refugees, the
Palestinians are also flexible. About a third of Palestinians would
accept Israeli annexation of some settlements, amounting to 5
percent of the West Bank. Over 40 percent of Palestinians support
having the settlers remain, under Palestinian sovereignty and law.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of the central grievances of Palestinian nationalism
_ the plight of the refugees who lost their homes during the
fighting after Israel was established in 1948 _ many West Bankers
and Gazans have abandoned the refugees' dream of returning to homes
in present-day Israel. Instead, they would have the 1948 refugees
settle for a ``right of return'' that exists only in principle,
accompanied by an actual return to a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest of the final status issues is Jerusalem. Here, the
Palestinian street gives Arafat little room for maneuver. The idea
of leaving Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital while
establishing a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a Palestinian
village adjacent to Jerusalem but technically outside its municipal
boundaries, won only 9 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian proposal, which spoke of the Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem reverting eventually to Palestinian control, managed
to get 27 percent support, but such additional territorial
concessions in Jerusalem would be unthinkable for even a dovish
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about half of Palestinians say that final talks with
Netanyahu are doomed to failure. Palestinians flatly distrust
Israel's leaders. When asked whether they trusted Israeli
government intentions toward the peace process, only 7 percent said
yes, while 81 percent said no. The suspicion intensified after the
election of Netanyahu and the groundbreaking at Har Homa, rising to
91 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half the Palestinians saw the Israeli
public as genuinely wanting Palestinian-Israeli peace. In other
words, even though most Palestinians say that they believe in the
good intentions of the Israeli public, they think that Netanyahu
has no intention of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Arafat's leadership is essential. He
remains the pillar of Palestinian politics. Positive evaluations of
his performance have risen steadily, with only minor hiccups. In
contrast, support for Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the leader of Hamas,
dropped from 20 percent to 14 percent between November 1994 and
October 1995. Today, Arafat's positive rating stands at about 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Palestinians rank their democracy behind those of
Israel, the United States and France, and ahead of Jordan and Egypt
_ neither heretofore known as bastions of civil liberties. The
democratic systems of Israel and America get high marks not only
among supporters of the peace process but also among supporters of
the opposition, including the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fully 80 percent of Hamas supporters describe
Israeli democracy as good or very good, and 71 percent of them
evaluate American democracy as good or very good. Almost across the
board, Palestinians know quite clearly what kind of democracy they
admire. They also know they do not have it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is dire. If Arafat and the national movement
fail, the Islamists could take the initiative. It is only amazing
that they have not done so already. Hamas remains the sole credible
alternative to Fatah and the mainstream nationalists. Those who
have deserted the Islamists have not changed loyalties; most have
simply sat on the sidelines. They could become a reservoir for an
Islamist revival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that Yitzhak Rabin, known in Israel as
``Mr. Security,'' went to Oslo was his fear that his choice was to
deal either with the PLO today or Hamas tomorrow. Netanyahu faces
the same choice. However, he does not act like he knows it.

<P>
   As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's
personal influence and political wiles have let him dominate and
change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure could.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oslo peace process flags, Arafat falls and Hamas rises,
the mainstream, secular nationalist movement _ Arafat's al-Fatah _
could indeed lose its current hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, like their Israeli neighbors, are highly
politicized. The 1993 Oslo Accords call for an end to terrorism,
mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and the creation of the Palestine Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   How do Palestinians feel about these issues?
</P>
<P>
   Pundits often make sweeping generalizations about ``belligerent
Palestinian attitudes'' without bothering to offer evidence of any
sort. But since 1993, Palestinian public opinion has been surveyed
regularly and extensively, and can be quite accurately gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian students, like most other Arab students, tend to be
more radical, defending ideals rather than compromises. To be sure,
a general lack of responsibilities influences student thinking
about the peace process. But more important, students' perceptions
of Oslo are colored by the way they perceive their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most students see the peace process as an American tool to
stabilize Arafat's regime and maintain a domestic status quo. The
more disillusioned the students are with Arafat's Palestine
Authority _ accusing it of corruption, mismanagement and lack of
democratization _ the more opposed to the peace process they
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, embrace the values of
political Islam and seek to establish an Islamic state. They
emphasize traditional values, including veiling women and limiting
their political role, but are not totally opposed to some liberal
and democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists oppose the peace process, refusing to acknowledge
the legitimacy of Israel. They have no consistent demographic
characteristic, even though disproportionately more support for
them is found among illiterates and the most educated youth.
</P>
<P>
   The nonaffiliated are likely to be older, female,
better-educated West Bank residents. But, excluding the
universities, Palestinian society remains deeply traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, religion cuts different ways for the Palestinians.
Those who pray daily are as likely to support the secular
nationalists of Arafat's Fatah as they are to support Hamas. But
the Islamists have more support among those who oppose women's
participation in politics and less support among feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas increases significantly among those who
strongly oppose reinterpreting Islamic law to make it applicable to
conditions of contemporary life. Support for the mainstream and the
left increases among those who seek a more modern form of Islam.
While Fatah has done well at appropriating some religious
symbolism, the bottom line is that Palestinian traditionalism
provides a deep wellspring of support for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, surveys of Islamist public opinion
reveal significant heterogeneity. Palestinian Islamists are not a
special group with identifiable demographic characteristics. They
do not necessarily think alike, and they lack a unified worldview.
Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism
depends on diplomatic movement, national reconstruction, and
Arafat's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Support for attacks against Israelis has dropped from 57 percent
in November 1994, to 46 percent in February 1995, to 33 percent a
month later, and to 21 percent in March 1996 _ all dates of major
suicide bombings by members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. But
frustration creates a constituency for terror.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's response to violence, including a policy of closing off
the West Bank and Gaza, and the infliction of collective pain and
suffering, led to a rise in support for violence among Palestinians
after months of steady decline. One significant jolt occurred in
the spring of 1997 in response to groundbreaking for the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, violence is popular among Palestinian university
students. Almost 60 percent advocate armed attacks against Israeli
targets, while only 25 percent oppose them. Moreover, 70 percent
believe that armed resistance is a realistic option for
Palestinians if the current negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of Palestinians not only rejected
terrorism against Israelis but also backed the March 1996 Palestine
Authority crackdown against the Islamists after the bus bombings
the month before, knowing full well that the raids sought to
prevent further attacks on Israelis. Only 32 percent opposed the
reprisals against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   To most Palestinians, Islamist terrorism slows the return of
West Bank land, undermines the Palestinian economy, boosts the
right-wing Israeli Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu _ and pushes
the Palestine Authority to focus on Israeli security at the expense
of Palestinian democracy and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, statehood is a sine qua non. A final peace
plan that did not grant Palestinian independence would be doomed on
the Palestinian street. Moreover, Palestinian opinion would buck
any resolution that did not give the new state of Palestine the
vast majority of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, are quite flexible about security
arrangements to ease Israeli jitters. The most important of these,
demilitarization of a Palestinian state, would almost certainly be
acceptable to Palestinian public opinion, so long as the state
comprised most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Palestinians supported the establishment of
a sovereign but demilitarized state in 95 percent of the West Bank
and all of Gaza, but support dropped to only 16 percent if the
state took up a smaller area of the West Bank. Palestinians would
also probably tolerate continued security cooperation with Israel
and a limited Israeli troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   On two other contentious issues, settlements and refugees, the
Palestinians are also flexible. About a third of Palestinians would
accept Israeli annexation of some settlements, amounting to 5
percent of the West Bank. Over 40 percent of Palestinians support
having the settlers remain, under Palestinian sovereignty and law.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of the central grievances of Palestinian nationalism
_ the plight of the refugees who lost their homes during the
fighting after Israel was established in 1948 _ many West Bankers
and Gazans have abandoned the refugees' dream of returning to homes
in present-day Israel. Instead, they would have the 1948 refugees
settle for a ``right of return'' that exists only in principle,
accompanied by an actual return to a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest of the final status issues is Jerusalem. Here, the
Palestinian street gives Arafat little room for maneuver. The idea
of leaving Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital while
establishing a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a Palestinian
village adjacent to Jerusalem but technically outside its municipal
boundaries, won only 9 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian proposal, which spoke of the Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem reverting eventually to Palestinian control, managed
to get 27 percent support, but such additional territorial
concessions in Jerusalem would be unthinkable for even a dovish
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about half of Palestinians say that final talks with
Netanyahu are doomed to failure. Palestinians flatly distrust
Israel's leaders. When asked whether they trusted Israeli
government intentions toward the peace process, only 7 percent said
yes, while 81 percent said no. The suspicion intensified after the
election of Netanyahu and the groundbreaking at Har Homa, rising to
91 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half the Palestinians saw the Israeli
public as genuinely wanting Palestinian-Israeli peace. In other
words, even though most Palestinians say that they believe in the
good intentions of the Israeli public, they think that Netanyahu
has no intention of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Arafat's leadership is essential. He
remains the pillar of Palestinian politics. Positive evaluations of
his performance have risen steadily, with only minor hiccups. In
contrast, support for Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the leader of Hamas,
dropped from 20 percent to 14 percent between November 1994 and
October 1995. Today, Arafat's positive rating stands at about 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Palestinians rank their democracy behind those of
Israel, the United States and France, and ahead of Jordan and Egypt
_ neither heretofore known as bastions of civil liberties. The
democratic systems of Israel and America get high marks not only
among supporters of the peace process but also among supporters of
the opposition, including the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fully 80 percent of Hamas supporters describe
Israeli democracy as good or very good, and 71 percent of them
evaluate American democracy as good or very good. Almost across the
board, Palestinians know quite clearly what kind of democracy they
admire. They also know they do not have it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is dire. If Arafat and the national movement
fail, the Islamists could take the initiative. It is only amazing
that they have not done so already. Hamas remains the sole credible
alternative to Fatah and the mainstream nationalists. Those who
have deserted the Islamists have not changed loyalties; most have
simply sat on the sidelines. They could become a reservoir for an
Islamist revival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that Yitzhak Rabin, known in Israel as
``Mr. Security,'' went to Oslo was his fear that his choice was to
deal either with the PLO today or Hamas tomorrow. Netanyahu faces
the same choice. However, he does not act like he knows it.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Bantam because of their strength in the mass market; I
have never regretted my choice. They assigned me a fine editor,
Peter Guzzardi, who made me rewrite my first draft in terms that he
could understand. He also had the bright idea of changing the
title. My original idea had been, ``From The Big Bang To Black
Holes, A Short History Of Time.'' But Peter changed it to ``A Brief
History Of Time.'' I am sure this title has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after I met Guzzardi I caught pneumonia while at the
European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva. For a time my life
was despaired of. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy
operation, which removed my power of speech altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, I had been able to dictate to a secretary who could
understand me, but for a time, I could communicate only by raising
my eyebrows when someone pointed to letters on a card. At that
rate, it would have taken until the next millennium to finish my
book.
</P>
<P>
   However, a software developer called Walt Waltosz heard of my
plight, and provided me with a computer and a program that allowed
me to scan the screen and select words, which are printed on the
bottom half of the screen. Over the years, the system has
developed. My present version was made for me by Intel. It has a
mobile telephone, with access to the internet.
</P>
<P>
   I can claim to be the most connected person in the world. I have
kept my original speech synthesizer, however, partly because I
haven't heard one with better phrasing, and partly because I now
identify with this voice, despite its American accent. But the
speech synthesizer uses chips which are now obsolete, so I will
have to change eventually. That will bring a real identity crisis,
especially for my wife, who won't recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer system, I was able to finish ``A Brief
History'' and it was duly published. Despite wanting it sold on
airport bookstalls, I had expected it to be only modestly
successful. So I was surprised by its reception. It was on the
Sunday London Times' bestseller list for 237 weeks, longer than any
other book in history. (Apparently, the Bible and Shakespeare don't
count).
</P>
<P>
   And it has been translated into more than 30 languages. This
means I am recognized wherever I go, though sometimes I try to
disguise myself by saying that I am often mistaken for Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Why was ``A Brief History'' such a success? A contributing
element must be the fact that I am disabled, or should I say,
physically challenged, to be politically correct. But the main
reason was that the public was hungry for a book of this type.
There were already many books about the early universe and black
holes on the market, ranging from the very good to the very bad.
However, I felt that none of these really addressed the big
questions which had led me to do research in cosmology and quantum
theory.
</P>
<P>
   People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where
did we come from? How did the world begin? What is the meaning and
design behind it all? The creation accounts of the past now seem
less credible. They have been replaced by a variety of
superstitions, ranging from New Age to ``Star Trek.'' But real
science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most people believe that real science is too
difficult for them. But I don't think this is the case. Not
everyone can be or wants to be a theoretical physicist, but most
people can understand the basic ideas, if they are presented
clearly without equations.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity is making great advances in science and technology, and
the pace of change is quickening. I recently gave a lecture at the
White House to an audience that included the Clintons. I argued
that we will never reach a state of advanced, but essentially
static science and technology, like that shown in ``Star Trek.''
Instead, progress will continue at an ever increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, it is vital that we all take part in the
debate about where we are going. We don't want the knowledge and
the decisions to be left to a few experts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that people buy my book to leave on their
coffee tables. I am sure this does happen, but it is not the reason
for most of my sales. Hundreds of people write to me or stop me in
the street, to tell me how they have enjoyed it. They ask detailed
questions, or point out what they think are errors, so they must
have read at least part of it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't answer all the letters, but I try to correct genuine
errors. By now, most of them have been fixed, although I recently
got a long letter from a lady in Toronto complaining about
something I said about Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   I know the book is difficult. If you can understand everything
in it, you would be ready to start a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.
It does not matter too much if people can't follow all the
arguments. They can still get the flavor of the intellectual quest:
to understand the universe on the basis of rational laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the 10 years since ``A Brief History''
was first published? Should I write a sequel, and if so, what would
I call it? ``A Brief History of Time, Part 2.'' Or maybe, ``A
Slightly Less Brief History.'' However, I decided against both
these possibilities. Everything I wrote in the original book is
still valid. It just required extending, to include the exciting
observational and theoretical developments over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the observational side, there has not been much progress in
conventional particle physics. The United States was building a new
particle accelerator, the SSC, which would have reached the
energies where crucial evidence for our theories was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the United States went through a fit of feeling
poor and cancelled the project. I told President Clinton that this
was a very short-sighted decision. His defense was that he had been
in favor of the SSC, but that it was cut by Congress. This is true,
but I think he could have fought harder. As it is, we will have to
wait until 2001 for a new particle accelerator in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmology, on the other hand, there has been spectacular
progress on the observational front. The Hubble space telescope,
and new large land-based telescopes such as the Keck telescope in
Hawaii, have enabled us to see galaxies and supernova near to the
limiting distance we can observe.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, we have detected faint ripples in the
background of microwaves that fills the universe. These ripples are
tiny _ one part in 100,000 _ but are evidence that the early
universe was not homogeneous. These small variations in the makeup
of the early universe are big enough to have grown into the
structures we observe in the universe, such as galaxies, stars and
even ourselves. So we are seeing in these ripples the finger prints
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the ripples is consistent with the theory of
inflation _ the idea that the universe had a period of accelerating
expansion, in the very early stages. And it agrees with the
proposal that I made, that the universe has no boundaries, in space
and imaginary time.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inconsistent with most alternative theories of the
origins of the ripples. Observations of the microwave background by
new satellites should settle the issue and tell us if we indeed
live in a universe that has no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples in the microwave background had been predicted. It
was gratifying to have our theories confirmed, but it was not a
great surprise. The really exciting moments in science are when we
discover something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not definite yet, there are suggestions in some
recent observations of supernova that there may be a repulsive
gravitational force called the cosmological constant. Einstein
originally introduced the constant into his equations, when he
still believed that the universe was static. If the galaxies
started off at rest relative to each other, the gravitational
attraction between them would cause them to fall towards each
other, unless it was balanced by a repulsive force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hubble later discovered that the universe is expanding,
and so removed the need for a cosmological constant to hold the
universe in a static equilibrium. After that, Einstein called the
cosmological constant ``my greatest mistake.'' But we may have to
think again; Einstein may not have made a mistake after all. This
would mean that the universe would continue to expand forever, at
an ever-increasing rate. Inflation might be a law of nature, to the
discomfiture of monetarist economics. But the inflation of the
universe is less than a millionth of a percent per century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the progress we are making is helped by the fact that all
theoretical physics papers are now on the internet. It has made
physicists the world over into a global village. If someone has a
new idea, they send it to a computer in Los Alamos. Within a week,
there will be several developments to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, I said I thought there was a 50 percent chance
that we would find a complete unified theory in the next 20 years.
I would have lost that bet. Thanks to what's gone on recently in
time, I think it's more likely we'll find it in the next 20 years.

have to change eventually. That will bring a real identity crisis,
especially for my wife, who won't recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer system, I was able to finish ``A Brief
History'' and it was duly published. Despite wanting it sold on
airport bookstalls, I had expected it to be only modestly
successful. So I was surprised by its reception. It was on the
Sunday London Times' bestseller list for 237 weeks, longer than any
other book in history. (Apparently, the Bible and Shakespeare don't
count).
</P>
<P>
   And it has been translated into more than 30 languages. This
means I am recognized wherever I go, though sometimes I try to
disguise myself by saying that I am often mistaken for Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Why was ``A Brief History'' such a success? A contributing
element must be the fact that I am disabled, or should I say,
physically challenged, to be politically correct. But the main
reason was that the public was hungry for a book of this type.
There were already many books about the early universe and black
holes on the market, ranging from the very good to the very bad.
However, I felt that none of these really addressed the big
questions which had led me to do research in cosmology and quantum
theory.
</P>
<P>
   People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where
did we come from? How did the world begin? What is the meaning and
design behind it all? The creation accounts of the past now seem
less credible. They have been replaced by a variety of
superstitions, ranging from New Age to ``Star Trek.'' But real
science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most people believe that real science is too
difficult for them. But I don't think this is the case. Not
everyone can be or wants to be a theoretical physicist, but most
people can understand the basic ideas, if they are presented
clearly without equations.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity is making great advances in science and technology, and
the pace of change is quickening. I recently gave a lecture at the
White House to an audience that included the Clintons. I argued
that we will never reach a state of advanced, but essentially
static science and technology, like that shown in ``Star Trek.''
Instead, progress will continue at an ever increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, it is vital that we all take part in the
debate about where we are going. We don't want the knowledge and
the decisions to be left to a few experts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that people buy my book to leave on their
coffee tables. I am sure this does happen, but it is not the reason
for most of my sales. Hundreds of people write to me or stop me in
the street, to tell me how they have enjoyed it. They ask detailed
questions, or point out what they think are errors, so they must
have read at least part of it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't answer all the letters, but I try to correct genuine
errors. By now, most of them have been fixed, although I recently
got a long letter from a lady in Toronto complaining about
something I said about Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   I know the book is difficult. If you can understand everything
in it, you would be ready to start a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.
It does not matter too much if people can't follow all the
arguments. They can still get the flavor of the intellectual quest:
to understand the universe on the basis of rational laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the 10 years since ``A Brief History''
was first published? Should I write a sequel, and if so, what would
I call it? ``A Brief History of Time, Part 2.'' Or maybe, ``A
Slightly Less Brief History.'' However, I decided against both
these possibilities. Everything I wrote in the original book is
still valid. It just required extending, to include the exciting
observational and theoretical developments over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the observational side, there has not been much progress in
conventional particle physics. The United States was building a new
particle accelerator, the SSC, which would have reached the
energies where crucial evidence for our theories was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the United States went through a fit of feeling
poor and cancelled the project. I told President Clinton that this
was a very short-sighted decision. His defense was that he had been
in favor of the SSC, but that it was cut by Congress. This is true,
but I think he could have fought harder. As it is, we will have to
wait until 2001 for a new particle accelerator in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmology, on the other hand, there has been spectacular
progress on the observational front. The Hubble space telescope,
and new large land-based telescopes such as the Keck telescope in
Hawaii, have enabled us to see galaxies and supernova near to the
limiting distance we can observe.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, we have detected faint ripples in the
background of microwaves that fills the universe. These ripples are
tiny _ one part in 100,000 _ but are evidence that the early
universe was not homogeneous. These small variations in the makeup
of the early universe are big enough to have grown into the
structures we observe in the universe, such as galaxies, stars and
even ourselves. So we are seeing in these ripples the finger prints
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the ripples is consistent with the theory of
inflation _ the idea that the universe had a period of accelerating
expansion, in the very early stages. And it agrees with the
proposal that I made, that the universe has no boundaries, in space
and imaginary time.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inconsistent with most alternative theories of the
origins of the ripples. Observations of the microwave background by
new satellites should settle the issue and tell us if we indeed
live in a universe that has no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples in the microwave background had been predicted. It
was gratifying to have our theories confirmed, but it was not a
great surprise. The really exciting moments in science are when we
discover something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not definite yet, there are suggestions in some
recent observations of supernova that there may be a repulsive
gravitational force called the cosmological constant. Einstein
originally introduced the constant into his equations, when he
still believed that the universe was static. If the galaxies
started off at rest relative to each other, the gravitational
attraction between them would cause them to fall towards each
other, unless it was balanced by a repulsive force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hubble later discovered that the universe is expanding,
and so removed the need for a cosmological constant to hold the
universe in a static equilibrium. After that, Einstein called the
cosmological constant ``my greatest mistake.'' But we may have to
think again; Einstein may not have made a mistake after all. This
would mean that the universe would continue to expand forever, at
an ever-increasing rate. Inflation might be a law of nature, to the
discomfiture of monetarist economics. But the inflation of the
universe is less than a millionth of a percent per century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the progress we are making is helped by the fact that all
theoretical physics papers are now on the internet. It has made
physicists the world over into a global village. If someone has a
new idea, they send it to a computer in Los Alamos. Within a week,
there will be several developments to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, I said I thought there was a 50 percent chance
that we would find a complete unified theory in the next 20 years.
I would have lost that bet. Thanks to what's gone on recently in
time, I think it's more likely we'll find it in the next 20 years.

GAY GROUPS SAY HOUSE ANTI-HOMOSEXUAL MEASURE WON'T SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gay and lesbian advocates said Thursday they are
confident they can defeat a House-passed anti-gay measure barring
San Francisco from spending federal money unless it revokes its
domestic-partners ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., was
narrowly approved Wednesday night by a 214-212 vote as an amendment
to a $94 billion spending bill for housing and veterans programs.
</P>
<P>
   The vote showed that ``there was no overwhelming mandate for the
city to change its policy,'' said Winnie Stachelberg, political
director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and
lesbian group.
</P>
<P>
   Stachelberg said she believes the Riggs amendment ``will be
pulled out of the bill'' this fall when the House and Senate
negotiate in a conference committee on the final spending bill they
will send to President Clinton. The Senate has not yet passed its
version of the housing and veterans measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the close vote underscores the good prospects for the
Riggs provision to be stripped out in conference,'' Stachelberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in an interview
Thursday that defeat of the provision cannot be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hopes the Riggs amendment ``will not survive and
added that ``since it was such a close vote, our hand was
strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   But she noted that ``there is anti-gay momentum in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should assume nothing,'' Pelosi said. ``Republicans
went against one of their most fundamental principles of local
autonomy in order to strike a blow against gays and lesbians''
</P>
<P>
   Riggs' amendment would bar San Francisco from spending about $65
million in federal housing funds for community development,
homeless shelters, housing for people with AIDS and lead abatement
unless the city revokes its domestic-partners policy. Its ordinance
requires companies with city contracts to offer the same benefits
to employees with domestic partners as they do to married workers.
</P>
<P>
   During an emotional hour-long debate on the House floor, Riggs
was the only one to defend his amendment, saying San Francisco's
ordinance was wrong to grant unmarried gays and lesbians the same
status as married heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill for the Departments of Housing and Urban
Development and Veterans Affairs is already on shaky ground.
President Clinton has threatened to veto it because he disapproves
of other provisions it contains. An aide in the White House Office
of Management and Budget said the president also ``strongly
dislikes'' the Riggs' amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are anxious to avoid a presidential veto for fear it
would result in government shutdowns that could reflect badly on
Congress in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and
lesbian group, predicted Senate conferees will eliminate the Riggs
provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment in the Senate is always very different on
these issues than in the House,'' Ivers said. ``The Senate ... does
not by its nature confront; it makes deals. A small whiff of
controversy on an issue will make the Senate reluctant, and there
certainly is controversy on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivers noted that a 1996 gay rights bill, the so-called
Employment Nondiscrimination Act, fell short of passage in the
Senate by just one vote. In a chamber with 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats, that vote indicated ``that gay and lesbian issues are
somewhat better understood in the Senate,'' Ivers said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS Action, a national
network of 3,200 community AIDS organizations, predicted the Riggs
measure ``will ultimately crumble because of the fact that it
infringes on local authority. I think most members of Congress are
hesitant to trample on local authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Zingale also forecast the demise of another anti-homosexual
amendment by Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., which passed the House
late Wednesday. Hilleary's measure, which would take $21 million
from housing programs for people with AIDS and give it to veterans,
was adopted 231 to 200.
</P>
<P>
   The measure ``pits veterans against men, women and children with
AIDS,'' Zingale said. ``I think most members of Congress will want
to provide housing to members of both groups in need.''

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON -- Last summer on the Mall, a large group of women
carried 1,500 life-sized, blood-red wooden figures from the Capitol
to the Washington Monument, behind mournful bagpipes.
 &HT;    Each figure represented a woman who had been killed by a
physically abusive partner in 1997. Her story was typed out and
pinned to the figure.
 &HT;    The demonstration was staged by The Silent Witness National
Initiative, organized by Janet Hagberg of Minneapolis-St. Paul.
 &HT;    ''Our goal is to eliminate domestic violence,'' she said.
 &HT;    Ms. Hagberg points to specific programs that are working to save
lives. One she pointed to was the Compassion Workshop developed by
Dr. Steven Stosny ''that has an 87 percent success rate for
court-ordered batterers.''
 &HT;    A year after his workshops in Prince George's County, Md., 74
percent of victims reported that even verbal aggression had ended.
 &HT;    Stosny's results are dramatically better than the average
court-ordered intervention. A USA Today story this week spotlighted
a study of anti-battering programs in Pittsburgh, Houston, Dallas
and Denver. Those programs reported that 40 to 45 percent of men
battered again within 30 months of attending a treatment program.
And that was after a 50 percent dropout rate.
 &HT;    So the known cure rate was really not around 55 percent, but
half of that, 27 percent. Further, according to the victims, even
when physical abuse ended, verbal abuse increased, which can be
devastating.
 &HT;    What is the difference between these two approaches?
 &HT;    Rosemary Boerboom of St. Paul, who has switched from teaching
the ineffectual Duluth model (which began in Duluth, Minn.) to
Stosny's, told me: ''The Duluth model is a socio-political analysis
of inequality, based on the theory that abuse is a tactic of power
and control men use against women. It is an analysis of patriarchy
and second-class status of women.
 &HT;    ''The Stosny model is based on the best learning theory about
how people change. He talks about anger as a defense against hurt.
Participants get a very powerful tool called HEALS, which is a
technique of emotional regulation that really works and is easy.
Instead of trying to change people by shaming and blaming, Stosny
increases their self-esteem,'' said Ms. Boerboom.
 &HT;    Stosny told me, ''Compassion is more empowering than anger. On
the first night, we say, 'Imagine the worst thing you ever said or
did to a person you love. Now imagine a stranger doing that. What
would you do?'
 &HT;    ``Most would have an instinct to protect a loved one. That is
our deepest nature, our core value. Compassion stops abuse. When
they get disconnected from core values, when they feel shame, they
attempt to dominate spouse and children.''
 &HT;    Therefore, he teaches a HEALS model that makes resolution of
anger and depression automatic, once it is learned and practiced.
 &HT;    First he asks participants to envision a blinking neon sign when
they feel anger rising, which blinks, HEALS.
 &HT;    The H is for Healing. The E of the word is to Explain to
yourself that the lowest core hurts -- one is feeling beneath the
anger, perhaps a feeling of being disregarded, unimportant, guilty,
devalued, powerless or unlovable.
 &HT;    A is to Access your core values, your soul, the deepest part of
you, your value as a child of God, says Stosny. L is to remember to
Love yourself. The trick is to feel compassion first for yourself,
and then for the person who offended you. S is to Solve the
problem.
 &HT;    He says, ''If my wife calls me a `brainless twit,' I see the
flashing HEALS sign. At first, I feel unlovable. But am I
unlovable? No, I might have just made a mistake. I know that does
not mean I am unlovable. So I can feel compassion for her core
hurt. When I feel compassion for her, I can't be angry at her. Nor
do I feel hurt anymore.'' Thus, the HEALS model dissipates anger.
 &HT;    Janet Hagberg uses the model daily. Recently her group held a
successful fund-raiser. But the woman who organized it was very
angry and made various criticisms. Janet went home feeling livid.
She flashed HEALS in her mind, and went to her lowest feeling.
Powerless? No, it went deeper to unlovable.
 &HT;    ``But am I unlovable? Absolutely not. What is going on with her?
Perhaps she has a tough marriage, and what we said got close to her
own experience. Now I can be compassionate toward her.''

DESPITE THE MUSIC, THE NEW `PARENT TRAP' IS ENGAGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm trying to remember what my reaction to ``The Parent Trap''
was when I saw it as a little girl in 1961. My primary recollection
is that it was extraordinary that through the magic of movie
technology, one actress _ Hayley Mills _ was able to play two
little girls.
</P>
<P>
   As the technology has improved the magic has gotten even more
seamless. Lindsay Lohan, 12-year-old veteran of commercials and
television, is a frighteningly poised child who is truly impressive
as the long-separated twins, Annie and Hallie, who meet by accident
at summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   What the two freckled, red-headed fencing and poker experts
discover when they confront their mirror-image faces is that their
parents, Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) and Nick Parker
(Dennis Quaid), divorced when they were babies and haven't seen
each other since.
</P>
<P>
   While the twins in the 1961 movie were pretty identical in looks
as well as personality, these twins are more like those identical
cousins Patty Duke played on television.
</P>
<P>
   Annie, with a cultured English accent, was raised in London by
her wedding dress-designing mom in an atmosphere of gentility,
hushed book-lined rooms and tweed. The butler, Martin (the amusing
Simon Kunz), is her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hallie is a hip American kid raised in California on her
father's vineyard. The housekeeper, Chessy (terrifically portrayed
by Lisa Ann Walter), is her surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now if this movie were ``The Nanny,'' Nick would have married
Chessy years ago. But it's ``The Parent Trap,'' and it is therefore
necessary for the twins to impersonate each other and return to the
wrong parents at the end of the summer in order to get them to
marry again. For this to work, Nick would have to be single.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the big drama in the movie, which was written by
producers Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, along with David Swift,
is that when Annie (the English twin) goes to Napa posing as
Hallie, she finds that Dad is about to marry a hussy who is after
his money. Meredith Blake is a tall blond, acid-tongued vulture
and, as played by Elaine Hendrix, she is suitably dislikable.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping into action, Hallie admits to Elizabeth who she really
is and mother and daughter jump on a plane for the U.S.A. where
Meredith is busy trying to plan the wedding and send Nick's
daughter somewhere far away, like boarding school in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith's transparent greed makes her a wonderful foil for
Annie and Hallie, who are two of the cleverest trick-playing kids
since Macaulay Culkin in ``Home Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers does a good job directing this upper-class fairy tale
about the problems of the rich and lovelorn. Richardson is, as
always, serene and kindly in her persona. You would want to be her
daughter and you can understand why Hallie, once she's found
Elizabeth, would be reluctant to give her up. And Quaid is still a
bit boyish for my taste _ it's unseemly at his age _ but he does a
creditable mid-life crisis victim succumbing to the charms of a
toxic younger woman.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what little girls today are going to remember about
this movie 37 years from now, but parents can take heart in knowing
that it's a movie they can safely let their kids see.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't understand is why a wide range of utterly unrelated
and out-of-context music is used. All of sudden, boom, we hear the
theme from ``The Great Escape.'' And then, equally out of nowhere,
there is the Beatles tune ``Here Comes the Sun'' played against a
shot reminiscent of the ``Abbey Road'' album cover that has nothing
to do with anything except that it's a street corner in London and
the movie is shot partly in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Mood'' is played as if there were a big-band dance
scene coming up, but of course there isn't. The danger in using
such recognizable and evocative music is that the audience expects
it to mean something and wonders why it doesn't. The one thing you
don't want your audience doing is taking time out to ponder the
soundtrack when they're supposed to be absorbed with the plot.

   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Smithy gets frequent dialysis because of
kidney failure. His doctors told him that a renal transplant is
needed. Without it, he'll die while he is still in his productive
years as a professional person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smithy'' isn't his real name, but he's a real person who
registered in the national program to get a kidney if an
appropriate match should become available. He also sought a
relative who might be a kidney donor.
</P>
<P>
   Successful matches are more likely from blood relatives where
blood groups and immune factors have a better chance of being
compatible. ``Compatibility'' means a better chance that the new
kidney won't be rejected or sloughed off.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Smithy had such a relative whom we'll call Jonesy.
Imagine Smithy's relief when he learned that Jonesy's immunological
profile matched.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was for Jonesy to undergo evaluation to decide if
he were a suitable donor, that nothing in his own medical profile
would make the surgery too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine the disappointment at the finding that Jonesy has a
renal aneurysm (a ballooned area in the main artery going to one of
his kidneys) and, therefore, could not be a donor.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation was conveyed to Smithy by functionaries of his
managed-care plan. They offered to let Smithy remain on the
registry of names of people needing kidneys. Smithy, Jonesy and
their respective families accepted the decision at first because
they relied on the system.
</P>
<P>
   But when they decided to seek a second opinion, the malignancy
of managed care shoved a stake into the family's trusting heart.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant, associated with a major teaching hospital, said
that what the managed care plan called an ``aneurysm'' was only an
anatomical vz{3m~jHFyi &UR; ]j &QL; Kv-gUecDV55bUn6T}WxF)36C P~|cI

   ``It's been just a horror.'' _ Store owner Pam Olsey, in
Greenwich, Conn., describing Powerball fever.
</P>
<P>
   I've never understood why the media always use the old
struck-by-lightning comparison to show how difficult it is to win
the lottery. Wrapping up a report from some convenience store where
hundreds of dreamers are waiting in line for hours to buy a ticket
for Powerball or whatever, the reporter cheerfully tells viewers,
``Just remember, you have a much greater chance of being struck by
lightning than of winning tonight's jackpot!''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the recent Powerball drawing, that chestnut is
correct. The odds of winning the big jackpot were more than 80
million to one, while the chance you'll get struck by lightning is
about 12 million to one. (A single winning Powerball lottery ticket
worth a record $295.7 million was sold in the east-central Indiana
town of Richmond.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, are these the only options? Lottery ecstasy _ or hit by
lightning?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you're dreaming of winning the big prize, we like
to say you're in the grips of ``lottery fever.'' There seems be
some strange sort of ill health thing working here when it comes to
lottery coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Want further proof? Consider the list of odds provided by the
Associated Press in one of the hundreds of stories about that
Powerball madness. Quoting from ``The Book of Risks'' by Larry
Laudan, the AP listed several other experiences more likely to
occur than a Powerball win.
</P>
<P>
   All involved horrible and sudden death. Among the examples:
</P>
<P>
   Odds of freezing to death _ 3 million to 1
</P>
<P>
   Odds of being killed by an animal _ 2 million to 1
</P>
<P>
   Odds of being electrocuted _ 350,000 to 1
</P>
<P>
   Odds of dying in a plane crash _ 250,000 to 1
</P>
<P>
   Odds of being poisoned _ 86,000 to 1
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we in the media are subconsciously reminding lottery
players (and ourselves) that a lifetime transpires in the blink of
the cosmic eye, and even if one wins a jackpot against astronomical
odds, one will soon have to leave this world and step blindly into
the vast dark chasm of infinity.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or we just like cool death stats.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one I haven't seen anywhere, mainly because I came up
with it. It may seem like a goof, but I did the math. Do you
realize you're more likely to marry talk show host Larry King than
win at Powerball? It's true!
</P>
<P>
   Odds of winning the Powerball jackpot: 80 million to 1
</P>
<P>
   Odds of marrying Larry King: 35 million to 1
</P>
<P>
   Of course, depending on the pre-nup agreement, marrying Larry
King could be the same thing as winning the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Another staple of lottery-fever coverage is the series of
interviews with the regular-folk dreamers _ who often have a hard
time comprehending just how much damage they could do with an
instant fortune. It's almost sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get a bigger car and pay off my bills!'' a lady told
CBC-News.
</P>
<P>
   Ma'am. We're talking about a quarter of a billion dollars. You
can do a little more than simply pay off the VISA charge and
upgrade to a full-size Buick. Buy the Minnesota Vikings, purchase a
few small islands, fund your own campaign for the U.S. Senate _
things like that.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the guy who told Fox that if he won the Powerball
jackpot he'd go to Vegas, because when you're rich ``you get
everything comped.''
</P>
<P>
   True _ but you'll be able to afford those Siegfried &AMP; Roy
tickets and the Surf `n' Turf dinner on your own if you're cashing
a $10 million check every year for the next 25 years, my friend.
</P>
<P>
   At least those people seemed to be decent and well-behaved.
That's more than can be said for the lottery line-waiters who
reportedly started helping themselves to snacks without paying for
them in a store in Hammond, Ind., or the angry customers who cursed
at clerks in Connecticut when some machines refused to start for
several hours. These clowns may never be struck by lightning, but
they sure don't deserve to have the gods of karma strike them with
the thunderbolt of good luck, either.

AT THE U.S. CAPITOL, VICARIOUS EXPLOITATION OF GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The widow of Capitol Police Officer Jacob J.
Chestnut said it was ``amazing to think that a man so simple, so
humble and so private could rock the nation by merely doing his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, amazing. But then, this is a nation that has trouble
distinguishing profound emotion from sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   It is a nation that reveres privacy yet routinely drives a
bulldozer over it.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of our news media, we habitually use the personal
tragedy of strangers for our own vicarious, short-lived catharsis.
We are in deep need of inspiring role models but tend to find our
``heroes'' only on a movie screen or among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite insistence to the contrary by Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, Tuesday's Capitol Rotunda ``tribute'' to Chestnut and
Capitol Police Detective John Gibson was inappropriate excess that
nearly cheapened the deaths of both men. Their already-stricken
families looked like captives, forced to endure an excruciating
public hour under the klieg lights.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chestnut and Gibson were shot down _ like 81 other
police officers so far this year _ in the line of work. Long ago
they swore to serve and protect and give up their lives if
necessary. A man who, by all reports, is about as mentally ill as
they come, called them on that oath.
</P>
<P>
   But to the politician eulogizers _ and to all the Americans who
phoned their ``love and sympathy'' into television and radio
call-in shows after the service _ Chestnut and Gibson are war
heroes. Never mind that ``the enemy'' in this war is a paranoid
schizophrenic whose family was unable to keep him on medication.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lott, the policemen did not die in a shootout with
a crazy man and save the lives of many Capitol tourists. Rather,
they ``defended freedom and all of our lives'' and ensured the
``liberty of future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich said their deaths ``reminded
millions that freedom only lasts as long as there is courage.''
Their wives' and childrens' loss, he added, was ``a real but
painful building block of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who started by calling Chestnut and
Gibson ``watchmen,'' descended into embarrassing hyperbole when he
alluded to the Normandy invasion, the subject of Steven Spielberg's
new blockbuster film.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as any soldier who ever landed on a beach,'' Gore
said, the policemen fought for their country by ``defending each
citizen's right to cross that door (of the Capitol) safely.'' They
were ``ministers of our democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, the politician most often accused of slickery
and spin, delivered the most understated and sensitive remarks.
</P>
<P>
   He actually acknowledged that the slain policemen's families had
taken on an ``extra burden by joining us here today.'' He spoke of
``the innumerable acts of heroism that go unnoticed'' every day in
this country and of the other police officers who were killed this
year, police officers who ``make it seem so ordinary, so expected
... most of us do not even see their sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton joined the other overstaters and said that, in
dying, Chestnut and Gibson ``consecrated this house of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling moment though belonged to Lott. After quoting
Abraham Lincoln _ one of only 27 Americans who had been honored
with such a Rotunda ceremony _ Lott declared that ``the spirit of
freedom is in this room because of'' Chestnut and Gibson. Then he
referred to them by name, knowingly, affectionately.
</P>
<P>
   Except he called John Gibson ``J.J.,'' which was Chestnut's
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Lott quickly corrected himself, but it was an inexcusable gaffe,
the perfect result of pretending an intimacy exists where it does
not.
</P>
<P>
   From the tone of the talk-shows afterwards, no one seemed to
care. Or notice.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: IF YOU'RE FAT, IT'S GOD'S WAY
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ God must have loved fat people. He sure
made a lot of me.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the new enlightenment. Nothing is anybody's fault
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The devil made you do it? Uh-huh. Blame it on the Big Guy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're gay, it's because God made you gay.
</P>
<P>
   If you're gobby fat, it's because God made you gobby fat.
</P>
<P>
   According to what I read in the newspaper, scientists have
discovered a fat gene that predisposes our girth, no less than
growth genes decide our height.
</P>
<P>
   As disgusting and repugnant as the condition is, it's simply not
the fault of the individual that he's short.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for fat folks _ it's nature, not nurture. Going on a
diet is going against nature.
</P>
<P>
   And all this time I thought I was a slothful glutton. It turns
out I'm a defenseless victim, same as everybody else. You think? I
don't know what to think anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me again. Why did I eat all that chicken and dressing,
sweet potatoes and buttered corn, ham hocks and turnip greens,
pecan pie and whipped cream?
</P>
<P>
   It's like the fellow said about climbing the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's there.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I ate a mountain of food at my cousin Marie's
this past Sunday. That's how it is when the kinfolks from my
daddy's side of the family get together about this time each year.
Marie and my daddy were double first cousins, what with a brother
and sister marrying a sister and brother.
</P>
<P>
   We all go back to my great-grandfather, Arthur Johnson Murray,
who came down from Tennessee and fought with Texas in the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, we say we're going to get a Civil War veteran
medallion for his gravestone, but we don't get around to it.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, too, I say I'm going on a diet. I have no doubt that
my being fat was passed on by previous generations. But I'm not so
sure it's all in my genes. I suspect it has more to do with the
recipes they passed down.
</P>
<P>
   Marie, for a fact, cooks like her mother, Aunt Rose. And nobody
could cook like Aunt Rose. When it came to frying chicken, compared
to the Colonel, she was a five-star general.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, my mother had baked a cheesecake. But it wasn't my
mother's cheesecake. It was Aunt Rose's cheesecake. It was Aunt
Rose's recipe.
</P>
<P>
   God didn't make me fat. God just made Aunt Rose. Everything
else, generation to generation, fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   Still and all, I keep trying to cut back on my eating. Sunday I
didn't even have second helpings. That way I can blame it on the
devil.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with most everything. Billy Joe Shaver, the
picker-poet, said it best: ``The devil made me do it the first
time. The second time I done it on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   I've been skinny and I've been fat. I like being skinny _ but
not as much as I like to eat.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in my jeans.

AEROBICS STEPS INTO THE FUTURE AS A TOUGH AND VARIED SPORT

<TEXT>
<P>
   If your idea of aerobics is housewives in leg warmers bouncing
to disco in a church basement, think again. That stereotype is as
outdated as Olivia Newton John.
</P>
<P>
   The world of aerobics has gone through a revolution. Having
started humbly in 1969 and attaining ``craze'' status in the 1980s,
aerobics has evolved into a professional and athletic beast many
old timers might not recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Today's health clubs boast a wider variety of exercise classes
than ever, ranging from yoga and meditation aimed at aging baby
boomers to brutal drill classes geared to a younger, sportier
crowd. These days, you're as likely to encounter tai chi or
cardio-boxing on your aerobics schedule as you are low impact, and
you can find competitive sport-aerobics on ESPN _ and as of 2004,
in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And while the new aerobics has an unquestionable appeal _ more
than 24 million Americans attend sessions regularly, according to
the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America _ there are also
critics who say elevating it to sport status has taken aerobics too
far from its roots.
</P>
<P>
   The aerobics class paradigm is still recognizable: one hour,
broken into a 10-minute warm-up, a 40-minute cardiovascular
section, and a 10-minute cool-down, with or without abdominal
crunches. It's what's done in the 40 minutes that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The new aerobics staples include intense group cycling, hip-hop
dance, and the ubiquitous step aerobics. Around town we found
classes called ``boot camp,'' in which members leap obstacles and
do sprint drills, and ``urban athlete,'' in which members run and
do jumping jacks on city streets. We also found line dancing,
yoga-aerobics, and fitness boxing.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and Los Angeles, we found signs of things to come:
firefighter-training aerobics class, led by real firefighters, in
which participants haul hoses, hoist mannequins, and heave
sledgehammers; Sunday morning gospel aerobics, accompanied by a
live choir; wrestling aerobics; Capoeira aerobics; speed
jump-roping class, choreographed in-line skating classes, and many
other incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere do the winds of aerobics change blow more powerfully
than they did this week in Orlando, Fla., as athletes from 35
nations competed in the Bally's Total Fitness World Aerobic
Championship IX. In its most amazing makeover, aerobics has become
a tough competitive sport.
</P>
<P>
   The national AAU aerobics champion, Tracie Finan, is group
fitness director for the Healthworks health club in Boston's Back
Bay. ``Aerobics has really changed,'' said Finan, who is also the
national competitive step-aerobics champion, and trains as hard for
her sport as any professional athlete. ``It's nothing like it used
to be.'' Finan is currently ranked third in the world for amateur
competitive aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   So, how and when did all of this happen?
</P>
<P>
   According to Peg Jordan, the editor of American Fitness magazine
and the author of a new book, ``The Seventh Sense'' the modern
fitness movement began in the late 1800s, when men (yes, just men),
inspired by the machine age, began to view the body as ``a machine
which could be analyzed through simple objective skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Women, generally, were left out of the realm for several
decades. But that all changed in 1969. That year, an Air Force
physician, Kenneth Cooper, who studied the cardiopulmonary capacity
of runners, published a book called ``Aerobics,'' and the term was
born, along with the relatively new idea that regular aerobic
exercise, such as running or cycling, was good for you. Later that
same year, an Air Force officer's wife, Jacki Sorensen, took
Cooper's philosophy and set it to dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Sorensen's invention was usurped by a professional dancer named
Judi Shepperd Misset, who invented and franchised Jazzercise in the
early 1970s, which grew at one of the fastest paces in franchise
history. At the height of the feminist movement,
aerobics/jazzercise was embraced by millions of women long excluded
from athletics. Aerobics was a sport of their own.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, people like Gilda Marx and Richard Simmons became
had become household names, and celebrities got involved. By 1983,
Jane Fonda had ushered in the fitness video movement.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '80s, ``Seventh Sense'' author Jordan released a
report indicating that roughly 65 percent of the nation's 28
million aerobics participants were ending up hurt, thanks to
unqualified instructors and dangerous, meaningless exercises, such
as the donkey kick and hydrant lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a registered nurse, co-founded the Aerobics and Fitness
Association of America, which established guidlines and certified
instructors. Since then, the association has certified more than
100,000 instructors in 75 nations.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, ``Hollywood-style aerobics was being replaced
with scientifically valid, highly credentialed, extremely
professional aerobics,'' writes Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as boomers get on in years, says Boston Sports Club
aerobics director Sherry Catlin, they want ``kinder, gentler
exercise classes.'' Men want dance-free workouts. Younger
exercisers, meanwhile, want innovative, funky, athletic workouts.
Carol Espel, manager of an Equinox gym in New York, says, ``Today's
aerobics consumer is very educated. They're not just going to walk
into any class. They want mind and body balance, and there's a real
emphasis on sports.'' At Equinox, one of the most popular classes
involves lifting barbells for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This month's international aerobics competition in Orlando was
broadcast on ESPN, but don't be surprised if you heard nothing
about it elsewhere, says Howard Schwartz, president of the National
Aerobic Championship Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of sports writers have been slow to catch on to
this as a real sport,'' said Schwartz. ``They still think of
aerobics as Jane Fonda. The level of athleticism would astonish
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitve aerobics, or sport-aerobics, is a bit of a misnomer,
and is a world apart from recreational aerobics. At 3 minutes in
length, a sport-aerobics routine hardly qualifies as aerobic at
all. Nonetheless, the compulsory drills, including high kicks,
jumping jacks, pushups, and lunges, are taken directly from
traditional aerobics class.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries with highly conditioned aerobics competitors,
there is little or no mainstream access to aerobic exercise
classes. Research presented by Mette Nordahl Svendsen at the
University of Copenhagen indicates that in Romania, for example,
aerobics were illegal before 1990, and were practiced only at
underground ballet schools. This year's competitors in Orlando
included 16 delegates from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of the aerobics industry in communist and formerly
communist nations is astounding,'' said Schwartz. ``Eastern
European countries are getting very involved in the sport. ... The
competitors come from universities, gymnastic departments. They are
really fine-tuned athletes.'' Europe and Latin America dominate the
competitive field, with many international champions training in
Brazil, where, Schwartz says, dance is a part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, many of the amateur American competitors have
been alienated in recent years from the sport they invented, and
until recently, dominated. This, in turn, has spawned a generation
of amateur competitions, aimed at instructors, while the
professional contests are taken over by gymnasts. The amateur
competitions have in turn given rise to the newest breed breed of
contests, the beauty-fitness pageant, also dominated by Latin
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   What does Kenneth Cooper think of all this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I created the word aerobics back in 1966. My publisher titled
my first book `Aerobics' after one of the chapters. I didn't agree
with the title, because I thought it was a poor name _ people
couldn't pronounce or spell it, and I felt wouldn't remember. Look
what has happened over the past 25 years.''

THROWING BABY OUT WITH THE SMUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG BAILEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My ticket out of this Popsicle stand, I'm convinced, will be the
Academy Award-winning script I'm working on. I'll find the time to
finish it soon, sell it to Tinseltown in some major mega-deal
involving studio moguls and weasel agents, watch the thing get
produced into a boffo blockbuster, collect the dough and the
prizes, and then retreat to live happily ever after in wine
country.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product, currently with the working title ``Flying
High,'' will undoubtedly be written on one of two new scriptwriting
programs for the Macintosh that make it so easy to prepare
good-looking scripts that all you need is an idea. And ideas come
cheap, the programs don't.
</P>
<P>
   But in using them, you barely have to know the strict Hollywood
rules of script formatting because everything is done for you. Type
a character's name and the program stores it away so the next time
you need only to strike one letter and, wham, the whole name
appears and you're ready to start typing dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to remember camera angles, stage commands, or
scene headings because the programs offer menus and other speedy
tricks to take care of all that, leaving you more time to think
about what you want to write. They automatically number scenes,
pages, and acts as well as allow you to write notes in the margins
or paste in footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, you don't even have to know how to spell or use big words
(a plus in Hollywood circles) because the programs come with
powerful spell checkers and a huge Thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The newest scriptwriting program on the Macintosh market is
Scriptware, by Cinovision Inc., of Boulder, Colo. The company says
its product is already the best-selling scriptwriting program for
Windows and is the software of choice at Universal, Warner
Brothers, and Paramount Studios and for over 80 TV shows and
movies, including ``The X-Files,'' ``Millennium,'' ``Cosby,''
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Cybill,'' ``Deep Space Nine,'' and ``Veronica's
Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen any of those shows but I've used the newly
released Scriptware 1.0 for the Mac for a few weeks now and my
script is well into development.
</P>
<P>
   Like other scriptwriting programs, Scriptware will automatically
format, paginate, and allow easy scene shuffling and
reorganization. Although Scriptware comes with a manual, it's a
snap to get up and writing without ever referring to it because of
the program's intuitive commands.
</P>
<P>
   My few quibbles with Scriptware for the Mac are that it doesn't
include all the features in the Windows version, the typeface
defaults to a cheap-manual typewriter style, I couldn't import a
script produced on another scriptwriting program (even though the
manual said I could), and it has one of the most annoying
registration procedures known to mankind. Until you register the
program by phone _ which on the East Coast can only be done between
the hours of 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. _ a reminder message pops up on the
screen every few minutes preventing you from typing for at least 60
seconds. Since I'm never home between these hours, I still haven't
registered the product and the message is driving me nuts.
</P>
<P>
   But Scriptware is worth a look and you can download a demo at
the company's Web site at http://www.scriptware.com. While it
carries a suggested pricetag of $300, the program is currently on
sale for $200 and can be bought for about $100 as a competitive
upgrade if you already own another scriptwiting program.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Scriptware is, though, I give a slight edge to
another program called Final Draft, by B.C. Software, which just
released its latest version 4.1 for the Mac. Although its features
are nearly identical to Scriptware's, Final Draft seems more
aesthetically pleasing with a better look and feel, and the program
doesn't come with an annoying registration process.
</P>
<P>
   The company has posted regular, and free, updates to Final Draft
since its release and says that this fall it will produce Final
Draft A.V., which supports multicolumn scripts for audio-visual
scriptrwriters.
</P>
<P>
   The program also lists for $300 but can be found at some on-line
mail order companies for about $240. You can download a demo by
visiting http://www.finaldraft.com.
</P>
<P>
   Having a good scriptwriter program won't guarantee you can write
a good script, but the claims these programs make are essentially
true. Without them you could waste a lot of time organizing the
look of your script to conform to Hollywood's style.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from that drudgery, I'm able to concentrate solely on the
script itself. And I will, as soon as I find the time.

WE SHOULD ALL BE ASHAMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In places where people actually live, this frenzy over sex and
sins of the flesh that has clearly consumed so much of the news
business lately as well as all of Washington is looked upon as both
ludicrous and shameful. This kind of thing _ a lie told after a guy
gets caught cheating on his spouse _ has only been going on since
men and women lived in caves and used rocks rather than lawyers to
settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, today's case of boiling loins involves the president
of the United States, a serial groper who, one minute, is asking
why the wealthiest country on the planet cannot provide adequate
health care for all, and the next minute is asking, `Has anyone
seen my pants?' Go figure!
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton has serious character flaws, lacks in
self-discipline, is unable to control his personal appetites, has
embarrassed his family, has thrown more than a few of his friends
to the wind, and has forfeited any stature in history because he
will surely be remembered more for the size of his libido than any
set of laws is pretty obvious. His terminal horniness has already
shaped his legacy: He's the guy who weakened one of the foundations
of our legal system _ the lawyer-client privilege _ and made it
easy for any deviant to sue any president or subpoena the leader of
the free world for practically anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   And all this pathetic stuff _ the accusations of perjury and
obstruction of justice _ is rooted in sex. That's why the nation,
exhausted by Clinton's excessess and alibis, is forced to witness
the absurd spectacle of a clearly obsessed, totally demented
prosecutor spending millions to prove the president is a liar who
cheats on his wife. As if nobody knew that when he was elected and
then re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton years are proof that prosperity does a bit more than
swallow all sins; it allows political mediocrity to succeed and
self-absorption to flourish. It creates the false illusion _
through temporary comfort _ that there is no difference between
moral and economic values; that both can be measured or defined by
numbers on Wall Street. That the dollar is currently stronger than
honesty. That money is a more powerful factor than outrage. So it
ought not to be a huge surprise when Bill Clinton sees this
sentiment in his polls and asks, ``Are you going to believe me or
your lying eyes?''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: He would rather face Ken Starr, a grand
jury, even impeachment, rather than confront the fury of his wife
after admitting publicly that he did indeed have sex with ``that
woman,'' Monica Lewinsky, who is not much older than his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on both of them,'' Tom Reilly was saying Wednesday.
``The president for putting himself in this predicament, and Starr
for abusing the power of his office. I don't know of any other
prosecutor in the country who would go in this direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr has spent $40 million in this investigation. Know what
40 million dollars is? That's five years of my budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is the district attorney for Middlesex County. He was out
and about Wednesday running for attorney general of Massachusetts,
talking to luncheon groups, shaking hands, trying to raise enough
money to succeed at his task in order to save the Commonwealth from
being henpecked to death by his opponent, a state senator, Lois
Pines, who wants an apology instead of an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all over the place every day,'' Reilly pointed out, ``and
this issue _ the Lewinsky thing _ never comes up. I haven't been
asked one question about it. It's something people don't want to
talk about. They're uncomfortable with it. I'm uncomfortable with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 35,000 cases a year in our office. A lot of them
involve civil complaints where people say. `You said this. They
said that.' We don't indict people for perjury when they lie about
sex in a probate court. This is like the theater of the absurd.
It's mind-boggling: two incredibly powerful people using all their
power to go at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not excusing Clinton's behavior or his lying, if he did
lie. But this is the independent counsel run amok. I mean, where is
the common sense here? How did it ever get this far?''

PORTLAND PRESSES FOR MAINE BUYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's getting near crunch time in Portland, Maine, where the
impending sale of the state's largest daily, the Portland Press
Herald (circulation 72,000), has both newsroom employees and local
residents nervous. The current owners, Guy Gannett Communications
(not to be confused with the Gannett Company mega-corporation) are
divesting their media holdings, which include the Press Herald and
Maine Sunday Telegram, the Kennebec Journal and Central Maine
Morning Sentinel, the Coastal Journal, television station WGME-TV
in Maine, and six other network-affiliate television stations.
</P>
<P>
   With the price for the Press Herald said to be up around the
$200 million mark, some of the reported bidders creating jitters
are the Gannett Company, the Journal Register Company that owns the
Fall River Herald News and the Taunton Daily Gazette, and William
Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group Inc., which owns a number of New
England papers including The (Lowell) Sun and Berkshire Eagle. A
bid by the paper's employees to buy the Press Herald fell short and
it is now widely expected that the new owner will be announced
within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a sale to big chain ownership has inspired
something of a revolt among local residents. Last Sunday, a
citizens group called ``Save Our Hometown News'' took out an ad in
the Maine Sunday Telegram asking the current owners to consider the
impact of the sale on the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried,'' said group organizer Mike Roland, explaining
that ``Save Our Hometown News'' was a ``fairly spontaneous and
sudden response (by citizens) who are concerned about their local
paper. The paper's got a real special relationship with the
community. They're really the lead vehicle for the community
dialogue.''
</P>

   On June 30, thousands of attendees at the 12th World AIDS
Conference in Geneva awoke to find that their USA Today was
actually an advertisement dressed up as a newspaper. Although the
paper looked much like a normal issue, close inspection revealed a
page-one disclaimer noting that ``this special promotional edition
has been prepared by the USA Today promotion department on behalf
of Glaxo Wellcome.'' And none of the stories contained bylines, a
good idea since they were paid advertisements for drug company
Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   According to USA Today director of media relations Steve
Anderson, the two-page ``promotional wrap'' is standard operating
procedure at conventions and other special events where a specific
audience is being targeted by an advertiser. ``We offer our top
level clients a promotional wrap,'' said Anderson, explaining that
USA Today has done ``hundreds'' of similar promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said these wraps are not big moneymakers and that Glaxo
Wellcome's bill essentially ``covers the cost of it.'' But that
does little to assuage some of the stunned conventioneers or Public
Citizen, the consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter released Wednesday and signed by Public Citizen
research associate Dr. Peter Lurie, Health Research group director
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, and noted media analyst Ben Bagdikian, the group
called on USA Today publisher Thomas Curley to take ``immediate
action against all USA Today employees'' involved in the special
Glaxo Wellcome issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the little reason to expect better from a for-profit
pharmaceutical manufacturer, but for a major international
newspaper to sell its name and reputation in the service of
increased profit is a craven violation of journalistic ethics,''
the letter stated. ``In the absence of immediate correction action,
any subsequent reporting by USA Today on matters regarding the
pharmaceutival industry will be tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Curley was not available for comment Wednesday. But Anderson
responded to Public Citizen's complaint by saying, ``We do make
sure that these wraps are plainly labelled as promotional copy.''

   The fallout from CNN's ill-fated ``Operation Tailwind'' story
alleging United States use of nerve gas during the Vietnam War may
have some major journalistic gurus squirming. The Pew Charitable
Trust, the Project for Excellence in Journalism, and the University
of Maryland College of Journalism are collaborating to produce a
series of scholarly articles examining press behavior for
publication in The American Journalism Review.
</P>
<P>
   So guess what was slated as the next installment in the series?
A piece examining foreign coverage by none other than Peter Arnett,
the CNN correspondent last seen fighting for his job on the grounds
that he narrated the ``Operation Tailwind'' story while knowing
next to nothing about it. (Arnett's implication that on-camera
reporters are glorified script readers infuriated a number of his
colleagues.)
</P>
<P>
   According to series editor Thomas Kunkel, the nerve-gas episode
has delayed, but not derailed the Arnett effort. Arnett was
``halfway through the piece when the CNN (Tailwind) story
exploded,'' Kunkel said. ``The piece is definitely still in the
chamber, so to speak. The episode, unfortunate as it is, doesn't
abrogate his entire career.''

   SWEETHEART-SCAM (Undated). Law authorities and families are
struggling to deal with so-called ``sweetheart'' scams in which
young Gypsy women find vulnerable old men, become their
sweethearts, financees or wives and clean out their bank accounts
and other assets. A Bellevue, Wash., dentist and his sister have
petitioned Thurston County, Wash., Superior Court to overturn the
will of their late father, who died at 76 after after marrying a
20-something Gypsy woman from the Steve family (the one involved in
a massive welfare fraud case). He changed his will several times,
with the final one leaving the woman something between $500,000 and
$750,000.

   BOOK-GRAVE (Undated) Jack Olsen's new book, ``Hastened to the
Grave,'' tells of a Gypsy crime ring in San Francisco that bilked
vulnerable old men out of their money and homes and hastened their
deaths by spiking their food with digitalis. One of the heroes of
the book is private investigator Fay Faron, who donated nearly five
years of her life trying to bring the perps to justice. The larger
story is that Gypsy crime rings are operating across the country
with almost identical MO's. PHOTO

Cinderella story, is that it's not lacking in audacity.

   FILM-BASE (Undated) Are this summer's Hollywood comedies aiming
lower than ever before in terms of bathroom humor, cruelty jokes,
insensitivity to minorities and all-around bad taste? There's more
evidence for the prosecution in ``BASEketball,'' a harrowingly dumb
comedy that combines the talents of writer-director David Zucker
(``Airplane!'' ``The Naked Gun'') with the creators of trash-TV's
``South Park,'' Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

   FILM-WHATEVER (Undated) ``Whatever,'' a movie about high school

opposites who attract.

amateurish and over the top, we initially wonder if we'll ever be
able to engage with the caricatured characters who inhabit the
upscale and elite Southern town, Azalea Springs.

that was converted into a minimum security mental institution back
in 1953. His camera is a roving fly-on-the-wall as the staff and

performance of Witold Gombrowicz' ``Operetta.''

CHURCH-LED CAMP HELPS URBAN TEENS CHANGE THEIR TUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WESTON, Mass. _ It looks like just another summer camp _ field
trips, pizza parties, and pickup basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   But for the young Christian activists and local Catholic Church
leaders behind it, the three-week program at Regis College here is
part of a new strategy to reach at-risk youth in American cities.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to bridge the chasm between churches and many teens
by communicating with them in a language they understand _ in this
case, rap and hip-hop music.
</P>
<P>
   For the 32 young people who have come here from Boston and
several other US cities, the camp is a nuts-and-bolts introduction
to the music industry, from songwriting to recording. When the
program ends tomorrow , campers will walk away with a compact disc
of the songs they've created.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, camp organizers hope, they'll also be more
optimistic about their future.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is a key part of an ambitious collaboration, which
includes the Boston Ten Point Coalition and the Archdiocese of
Boston, to make urban churches more relevant to the lives of
disadvantaged city youth. Next year, organizers plan camps in three
cities focusing on music, sportscasting, and film and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have people who are, like, the big names in the industry,
and who came out of the same type of situation like me, speak to us
most certainly opens your eyes and makes you think that maybe if I
give it my best shot I could do something good for myself,'' said
Johnny Blaze, 17, of Boston. Blaze was putting the finishing
touches on the rap song he was set to record.
</P>
<P>
   If he weren't at this camp, Blaze said, he'd be doing what he
usually does on summer days: hanging out in his Codman Square
neighborhood or ``smoking weed to forget my problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, teens here are learning that rap music can have a
positive message and still be hip; that collaboration is more
productive than conflict, and that public-speaking skills are
crucial to business success. Many of the teachers are evangelical
Christians or active Roman Catholics. The archdiocese provided a
significant chunk of the camp's $100,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   The camp received the strong endorsement of Cardinal Bernard F.
Law, who has made tackling problems of urban youth a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the cardinal embraced it and the Sisters of Saint
Joseph made Regis available is because this is for real,'' said the
Rev. Paul O'Brien, secretary for pastoral services for the
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is to use what teens are interested in to teach
them life skills, morals, and conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many churches are suffering from narcolepsy with respect
to urban youth culture,'' said Harry Young, president of Youth
Entertainment Studios, or YES, a Virginia-based organization that
is coordinating the camp with the archdiocese, the Ten Point
Coalition, and the Dorchester Uhuru Project.
</P>
<P>
   Young says the aim is to open multimedia studios in the nation's
most blighted neighborhoods to teach teens about the communications
and entertainment industries. Organizers hope to open the first
studios in Boston and Chesapeake, Va., by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire is to'' create ``multimedia Motowns with recording
studios, Internet publishing facilities, and TV production
equipment for severely at-risk teens,'' said Young, adding that the
Boston studio is proposed to be housed at the Ella J. Baker
Settlement House in Dorchester. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``And we'd do it through churches by having the churches staff
the studios,'' said Young, a Harvard Business School graduate and
former programmer for the Family Channel, who helped found YES five
years ago. ``It would be a powerful outreach tool for local
churches.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The importance of religion in people's lives is a constant
subtext of the camp at Regis.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the speakers here, including record producers and
hip-hop stars, spoke of the influence of Christianity on their
lives. Wyclef Jean, a hugely popular rapper from Haiti, told the
campers he was the son of a Christian minister. ``Everyone I roll
with knows I follow God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the teens at Regis, the music camp was a vacation
from turbulent home lives. Marisol Viera, 16, said she liked not
having to look out her window, as she does in her Dorchester
neighborhood, and see a street filled with drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the studio and hearing myself sing, I was like, `Wow,
I have some talent,''' Viera said. ``I'm walking away with a lot
more confidence. I realize God gave me some talent and I can do
something with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gene Rivers, a leader of the Ten Point Coalition, said
alliances on youth issues are forming among younger black ministers
and Catholic Church leaders in several cities, including
Philadelphia, Washington, and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Rivers and other church activists say, urban
churches serving poor communities largely have failed to reach
teenagers because they have been unable or unwilling to try to
understand a youth culture heavily influenced by sports,
entertainment, and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if one is serious about reaching kids who may be
alienated or turned off and not trust institutions and adults,
music is one excellent language to reach them,'' said Joseph
Doolin, secretary for social services for the Boston Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Bland, 19, who spent four months in a Virginia group home
last year after being arrested for possession of marijuana, said
the camp has broadened his life view and deepened his Christian
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking away knowledge and some useful skills and a strong
appreciation for the fact that God cares about everyone, even us
kids who are like at the bottom of the ladder,'' said Bland.

`THE THIEF' IS JOYLESS, RELENTLESSLY SAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Admittedly, there are some buoyant Russian movies. ``Burnt By
The Sun'' brimmed with vitality and ``The Ascent'' evoked the
austere beauty and extreme closeups of a Carl Dreyer classic.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, recent Russian cinema still thrives on
the belief that life is bleak. Efforts like ``Mother and Son,''
which admittedly have been visually astounding, dramatize the
ordeal of living in an economically beleagured Russia before and
after Perestroika and the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thief,'' which was nominated in 1997 for an Oscar in the
best foreign film category and won top honors at the 1997 NIKAs
(the Russian equivalent to the Academy Awards), is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   It's a joyless, dour and relentlessly sad movie metaphor for
life during Stalin's reign over post-war Russia in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   That life is seen through the eyes of a young boy, Sanya (Misha
Philipchuk), as his beautiful young mother, Katya (Ekaterina
Rednikova) falls instantly in love with a dashing, renegade
military officer named Tolyan (Vladimir Mashkov), who she meets on
a train.
</P>
<P>
   Tolyan turns out to be a fraud; in truth he's nothing but a
common thief (who sports a tattoo of Stalin on his chest and a
panther on his shoulder) and who alternately dotes on and abuses
both mother and boy. He's even stolen his uniform from an unknown
soldier in order to acquire lodging and the opportunity to ravage
his neighbor's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dismal life but, because living is a trial in itself
under Comrade Stalin, Katya stays with Tolyan. Ultimately the woman
pays a terrible price for her loyalty. As their relationship
deteriorates, it's inevitably 6-year-old Sanya who comes to adore
and worship Tolyan and think of him as ``daddy.'' Just when Katya
has had enough of pain and crime and is intent upon leaving her
lover, Tolyan suffers a surprising fate _ one that will tear the
``family'' apart.
</P>
<P>
   Chukhrai ultimately beats us to death with the downbeat crisis
that prevail over the character's lives. There's no relief in ``The
Thief'' and more, the ending betrays everything that is interesting
in the story. Who wants to watch a depressing film about life in a
bygone era that has no resolution and redemption? Perhaps that's
precisely the point Chukhrai is trying to make _ there is no point.
</P>
<P>
   The Thief. Directed and written by Pavel Chukhrai. Cast:
Vladimir Mashkov, Ekaterina Rednikova, Misha Philipchuk.
Stratosphere Entertainment. 90 minutes. Rated R for language,
violence, sexual content. In Russian with English subtitles.

MGH VIDEO-CONSULTING PROJECT UNITES SPECIALISTS NATIONWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Time is brain.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Massachusetts General Hospital neurologists describe
the crucial minute-by-minute decisions faced by doctors treating
stroke patients whose brains have been deprived of oxygen-carrying
blood.
</P>
<P>
   So MGH neurologist Lee Schwamm has set up an experimental
videoconferencing center, permitting doctors and patients in
emergency rooms miles away to consult with Boston specialists about
life-or-death treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Remote Stroke Management project, which integrates high-tech
and clinical medicine in the nascent field of telemedicine, was
launched last week during Prince Andrew's tour through MGH to view
the latest medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a simulation for the prince and the press, an emergency room
doctor at Salem's North Shore Medical Center suspected that a
patient had suffered a stroke. Two minutes after his pager went
off, a neurologist at Boston's MGH stood ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   Through high-speed communications and computer monitors, the
Boston neurologist asked the ``patient'' to perform a few simple
tasks, physical and verbal, and reviewed the individual's brain
scans. After confirming the stroke, he prescribed clot-busting
therapy that the ER doctor delivered. Under different conditions,
he could have requested that a patient be transferred to MGH, where
a multidisciplinary team of stroke specialists would assemble.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke recovery and ``real time'' technology are an ideal fit
because strokes require expertise in diagnosing, and skill in
carrying out clinical procedures. The newest therapy, the powerful
genetically engineered clot-buster tPA, should be administered only
to patients whose stroke is caused by clots, and not bleeding
through an artery.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, however, tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator,
must be given intravenously within three hours after onset of the
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   If tPA is delivered directly to the clot using a tiny catheter
threaded through the brain's arteries, it has a 6- to 12-hour
limit. This treatment is available only in major hospitals, and
telemedicine eases the way for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another option for people who can't get treated within
three hours,'' said Dr. Sanford Levy, a neurologist at North Shore
center who heads the project there. ``The diagnostic work can be
done here and the patient and his records transferred to Mass.
General easily without delaying treatment at their ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroke treatment also lends itself to telemedicine because it
doesn't require the laying on of a doctor's hands to heal _ the
feeling of rough and smooth textures or abnormal growths, or the
manipulating of soft organs.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that stroke patients treated with tPA have shorter
hospital or rehab facility stays and a 30 percent better chance of
ultimately being free of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're adding another layer of depth to the services a
community hospital offers, and to physician-to-physician
consults,'' said Schwamm, who designed the system after fiddling
with his $100 video camera and personal computer. Negotiations for
similar links to two other New England hospitals are underway, he
said. The cost for each remote location: about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's minuscule compared to a single patient's
hospitalization and nursing care,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Majoz Moonis, who heads the stroke unit at
University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Care in Worcester,
called MGH's pilot project with Salem a ``great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Schwamm said he fears some community hospital officials
may think that MGH is stealing patients, and decline to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes affect up to 700,000 Americans a year, killing about
one-third of them. It is the leading cause of disability. The
annual price tag runs about $30 billion in direct costs and lost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce the burden of strokes are hampered by people's
ignorance of the disease's symptoms, and subsequent delay in
getting help. Symptoms include dizziness, numbness, headaches,
slurred speech, vision problems, and shortness of breath.

BUSINESS ACUMEN, TECHNOLOGY TURN LANDFILL INTO CASH COW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was a beautiful day at the dump and David
Hansen, garbage guru, was giddy.
</P>
<P>
   Dante's ``Inferno'' had nothing on the Rapp Road landfill in
Albany this July day at high noon. Temperatures hovered around 90,
the sky was the color of dirty dishwater and the humidity hung as
heavy as a woolen blanket.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of weather that tries the souls _ and noses _ of
landfill operators.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen is president of Landfill Technologies Inc., which has
developed an array of landfill improvements using the Albany dump
as its laboratory since 1981. The dump has drawn landfill engineers
from across the country and abroad, including representatives from
Israel, Argentina, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming from all over the world to see what Albany
is doing with its garbage,'' said Hansen, a bear of a man who
sweated profusely and grinned like a child when tramping with
visitors over the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the technologies in use are a state-of-the-art plant for
extracting methane gas from the landfill, burning it and converting
that energy into electricity. Another is a system for improved
compacting of solid waste and covering it with a thin coating
called Posi-Shell that has proved more efficient than dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albany landfill is on the cutting edge of technologies. It
has become a leader in several areas,'' said Thomas Reynolds,
environmental engineer for the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The praise is tempered by the city's checkered history of
handling its solid waste. In 1990, an explosion of methane gas
leaking from another Albany dump caused damage to homes and
required $4.4 million to relocate residences and alleviate the gas
danger.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Gov. George Pataki announced a $1.4 million
settlement of a federal lawsuit brought by a neighborhood group for
pollution caused by the ANSWERS plant, a waste-to-energy facility
developed jointly by Albany and the state.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the dump is a fire-breathing cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel the power of those engines?'' Don Mazzarello, who
wore headphones to protect his ears, shouted over the rumble of two
truck-sized engines.
</P>
<P>
   The air in the engine room was a wall of sound and fury, with
intense heat rolling off the red-hot, 1,400 Fahrenheit burn zone.
The engines suck out methane gas from pipes buried deep in the gut
of the landfill, burn the gas and convert it into electricity that
is purchased by Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzarello operated the brand-new electric generating plant,
which recently went on line at the landfill. Known as Minnesota
Methane, the plant is owned by NEO Corp. of Minneapolis and is
capable of extracting enough methane from the buried garbage to
produce 1.9 megawatts of power _ the equivalent of lighting 19,000
100-watt light bulbs. Eventually, the landfill might be able to
produce 3.2 megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
   Methane is a colorless, odorless and highly flammable gas. It is
produced when organic matter decomposes. Naturally occurring
bacteria essentially eat the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a giant compost pile.
</P>
<P>
   Methane production is altered by rainwater, heat and other
factors. By pumping in air through the piping under the landfill,
the bacteria can be stimulated to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a living entity out there,'' Hansen said. ``I'm
fixated by garbage. There's a lot going on under the ground. I've
spent most days out here for the past 17 years and it changes every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Methane has invested about $2.5 million so far in the
Albany landfill. The city paid nothing, and it avoids about $20,000
per month in upkeep costs on the methane gas extraction it would
have to do anyway.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city stands to benefit to the tune of $6 million over the
next six years, said Gregg Nolte, deputy commissioner of the city's
Department of General Services..
</P>
<P>
   Nolte's dream would be to use the electricity generated by
burning methane gas from the landfill to power the city's street
lighting, saving millions of dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not far-fetched,'' Nolte said. ``The technology is
improving all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the microscopic bacteria churning through the
decades of garbage are the equivalent of the bunny in the Energizer
battery ads. They just keep going and going and going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process starts right away, but peak methane production is
eight or nine years after the garbage was covered,'' Hansen said.
``Production is good for about 20 years. That takes us well into
the 21st century here.''

   Those of us with monitor tans start getting nervous whenever
Congress takes up Internet legislation. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the latest effort to protect kids from on-line smut.
Last year the Communications Decency Act was gutted by the Supreme
Court, so Congress is trying to be a bit more creative this time
around. Last week, the Senate passed an appropriations bill with a
rider that will force schools and public libraries to use Internet
filtering software or lose their federal funding. Another part of
the bill will require that commercial Web sites with material
deemed ``harmful to minors'' must prevent minors from getting into
the sites.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sympathetic to the goal of this bill. There's some appalling
stuff on line, material that children have no business seeing. But
these proposals are a lousy way to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory filtering idea was proposed by Arizona Senator
John McCain, a conservative Republican who for some reason wants to
impose a sweeping federal mandate on thousands of classrooms and
libraries across the land. I favor blocking porn and violence on
school computers, and I think libraries should set limits on how
kids use their Internet terminals. But these institutions are
perfectly capable of working out for themselves the best ways of
doing this. The feds should butt out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the plan to force Web sites to hide their seamier
material from youngsters. There's just one little problem: How?
Consider the on-line magazine Salon, a lively site with excellent
writing on politics and the arts. And yes, sex. Salon won't let a
week go by without a thoughtful but raunchy consideration of the
world's favorite pastime, written in a form that is definitely not
suitable for the kiddies.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's advertiser-supported, Salon is a commercial site,
subject to the new law. But there's no practical way to seal off
the naughty articles from the rest of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, an effort to protect our children is going too far.
The Supreme Court should knock this one down, if the House of
Representatives doesn't scrap it first.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the House can be trusted to do right by the Internet.
Consider pending legislation that's supposed to fight the plague of
spam _ those unsolicited ads for porn and get-rich-quick schemes
that flood our e-mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an area that's ripe for federal legislation. It's already
illegal for businesses to send ads to your fax machine. Republican
Chris Smith of New Jersey proposes to extend the ban to e-mail.
This wouldn't do much to stop spam from other countries, but for
now it mostly originates in the United States anyhow. I think the
Smith bill is the best approach to spambusting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thurda (July 30)the House is supposed to vote on a bill that
would effectively legalize spam. The legislation, drafted in the
Senate, would simply bar the common practice of using phony return
e-mail addresses in these obnoxious mailings. Spammers would have
to include a name, street address, phone number, and correct e-mail
address. Recipients of spam would thus be able to write back to the
sender asking them to stop, with stiff civil penalties if the
mailings continue.
</P>
<P>
   A fat lot of good that'll do. Even if spammers comply, they're
free to keep clogging the Internet with tens of millions of useless
messages. But we don't want to know who these guys are. We just
want them to stop. Bring on the Smith bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every now and then, Congress gets it right. On Tuesday,
the Senate Finance Committee approved a two-year moratorium on new
state and local Internet taxes. And the House backed a three-year
Internet tax moratorium last month. Everyone agrees that taxation
of Internet activity is coming. But there's a consensus that taxes
on this new industry should be delayed, until lawmakers know enough
to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's an outbreak of prudence and common sense, in the last place
you'd expect. Maybe I've been too hard on these guys.

ANOTHER BOWIE: WEALTHY WEB WIZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SAUNDERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprisingly few people scoffed when rocker David Bowie, known
more for his high-heeled antics in the '70s than his high-tech
forays in the '90s, announced recently that he was leaping further
into the digital ether.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie was one of the first celebrities to leverage his name and
sonic appeal into the wide-open Web with davidbowie.com, and
expands that foothold with the anticipated August launch of
BowieNet, an Internet service provider that will enable fans to
become citizens of a Bowie-focused cybercommunity. If successful,
Bowie could be at the forefront of a new kind of Web gathering, a
collective driven by the personality at its center.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest shift for rock's reigning master of reinvention,
yet another permutation of the Bowie persona that has mutated
through Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke, various glam rock
incarnations and now, to its current state, the Omniscient Elder
Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Bowie is one of the world's richest musicians, with a
personal wealth estimated in excess of $200 million. He plans to
add to that with this new venture, likely to finance a few more
palatial villas in warm places.
</P>
<P>
   At $20 per month, the price is comparable with AOL and other
major ISPs and online services, but with full internet access
customized for Bowie fans. E-mail will be routed to
subscriber(AT)davidbowie.com, and a national scattering of points
of presence will allow users local-call dialup service.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the hook is Bowie himself, and the site intends to
feature exclusive Bowie content that should satisfy the most rabid
Bowiephile. The service's Web browser will be customized with
pictures, sounds, and graphics, likely similar in some ways to the
artistic use of simple design elements on the davidbowie.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie shrewdly allied himself with industry players with the
tools to make such a venture work smoothly. The network
infrastructure is provided by Concentric Network Corp., of
Cupertino, Calif., with the whole deal orchestrated by a management
and technology partnetship called UltraStar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.33l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Behind the name are two of the people most responsible for
Bowie's financial success: Robert Goodale, executive vice president
of Bowie's management company for six years; and William Zysblat,
co-owner of RZO, the firm that coordinated the innovative $55
million sale of bonds based on future royalties from Bowie's songs.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   One of BowieNet's partners is N2K, the online music
entertainment firm that established jazzcentralstation.com as a
major jazz content provider. Definitely worth clicking is the link
to milesdavis.com, which, as one might deduce from the URL, intends
to be a comprehensive and official Miles resource.

   With each month, Yahoo! Internet Life extends its lead over the
chaotic field of Web-focused print magazines. It also proves
there's a substantial crossover between Web users who prefer to
retrieve their information on line, and diehards who swear by the
infinitely more portable dead-tree editions.
</P>
<P>
   The well-designed glossy anticipates boosting its guaranteed
circulation base to 600,000 by February, double the initial
circulation after its first year of operation. There's space to
grow within the genre, although two good-looking competitors folded
within a year: The Web Magazine, a promising venture that never
caught on; and NetGuide, which attempted to chronicle the Web's
spread and was bowled over instead.
</P>
<P>
   Like new growth springing up where old trees fall, several
ambitious magazines have joined the race to catch Yahoo! Internet
Life. Worth searching for is Upside, an excellent new-media
chronicle that also seems poised to fish the waters patrolled by
Wired, the now-mainstream mag that is part of the Conde Nast
empire.

   Kodak.com is mustering support for PhotoQuilt 2000, a Web-wide

however, should be accompanied by a brief story that gives it some
context. This will also enable visitors to use the site's indexing
software to search for keywords.

   Viewers can zoom into pictures with surprising magnification;
this is just one of the benefits of the FlashPix formatting that
each picture undergoes.

   Total Annihilation freaks have a new reason to cackle as they
rampage through the core, an expansion pack that enables players to
choose 100 quick scenarios. The battle tactics add-on also has a
long-awaited feature allowing players to select the length of
desired missions. The shortest can be played in the time needed to,
say, run out for a carton of milk. The longest is a several-hour
siege perfect for developing bleary eyes.

 Drug cuts relapse in herpes study
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current New England Journal of Medicine shows
that a commonly used antiviral drug, acyclovir, can prevent
recurrences of herpes infections in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 400,000 Americans are infected with herpes Simplex
I, which causes fever blisters on the mouth and infections in the
eye, some serious enough to cause blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ocular herpes virus and the genital herpes virus
(Simplex II) are notorious for recurrences because the viruses can
hide in nerve tissue. Once you get ocular herpes, for instance, you
have up to a 50 percent chance of relapse.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, led by Dr. Kirk Wilhelmus, a professor of
ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, 703
patients who had had ocular herpes were given either acyclovir or a
placebo to prevent recurrences. Those who took 400 milligrams of
acyclovir twice a day had a 41 percent reduction in recurrences,
said Wilhelmus in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was even more pronounced _ a 50 percent reduction in
risk _ for those with the most serious form of ocular herpes,
stromal keratitis. There was no rebound in recurrence rates for at
least six months after patients stopped taking the drug, nor were
there any serious side effects associated with the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drug is the first treatment that helps prevent herpes of
the eye from returning. The results of this study should change
medical practice,'' said Dr. Carl Kupfer, director of the National
Eye Institute, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, Dr. Douglas A. Jabs of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine in Baltimore, agreed, calling the
findings ``robust.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Osteoporosis risk lessened by drug
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One million Americans routinely take steroid drugs like
prednisone to combat rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory
bowel disease, and other conditions. But a major side effect of
steroid treatment is an increased risk of osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the New England Journal of Medicine by researchers
from the University of Iowa and elsewhere shows that the drug
Fosamax (alendronate) offers significant protection against this
bone loss, at doses of 5 or 10 milligrams a day.
</P>
<P>
   While previous research had shown Fosamax can prevent and treat
post-menopausal osteoporosis, this is the first large study to show
it works in steroid-induced osteoporosis, too.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. Kenneth Saag, an assistant professor
of internal medicine at the university, studied nearly 500 men and
women ages 17 to 83 for 48 weeks. All the patients were taking at
least 7.5 milligrams a day of prednisone.
</P>
<P>
   All patients also took 800 to 1,000 milligrams a day of calcium,
as well as 250 to 500 International Units of vitamin D daily to
help protect their bones. The patients also received either
Fosamax, at one of the two doses, or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, those who took Fosamax had a nearly 3 percent increase
in bone density and a 40 percent reduction in risk of spinal
fractures, regardless of age or sex, said Saag in a telephone
interview. For post-menopausal women not taking estrogen
replacement therapy, the higher dose was more effective; for
everyone else, the low dose worked just as well. The study was
sponsored by Merck and Co., which makes Fosamax.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MS found to flare less in pregnancy
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long known that women have more auto-immune
diseases like multiple sclerosis than men and that pregnancy
sometimes makes such diseases worse, and sometimes, better.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from 12 European countries report in the New England
Journal of Medicine on 254 women with MS. Compared to the year
before pregnancy, the women were 70 percent less likely to have an
MS flare-up in the last three months of pregnancy. In the three
months after delivery, they were 70 percent more likely to have
one.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that during pregnancy, a woman's immune
system shifts from a preponderance of pro-inflammatory (TH1) cells
to a preponderance of anti-inflammatory (TH2) cells, said Dr. John
N. Whitaker, head of neurology at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham and author of an editorial on the study.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the resurgence of MS after childbirth, Whitaker said
in a telephone interview, women with MS should be offered one of
three commonly used drugs.

`WATER' IS A CLEVER COMEDY ABOUT HOMOSEXUAL PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first half hour, this gay soap opera runs amok as far as
tone and technique. The acting is so amateurish and over the top,
we initially wonder if we'll ever be able to engage with the
caricatured characters who inhabit the upscale and elite Southern
town, Azalea Springs.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the film comes back down to Earth and transforms
itself into a clever, spry comedy about homosexual panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Water'' is like watching ``Steel Magnolias'' on
speed. But fortunately, the core couple-to-be in the movie move
center stage and ground the story within its overblown peripheral
chaos and camp.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Stratton (Keri Jo Chapman) is in an unhappy marriage with a
too-busy husband. Worse, her society mother, Lily (Barbara
Lasater), intrudes in her life _ and her wardrobe _ on a
too-regular basis. Alex stoicly goes about her business despite
their constant carping and disapproval. Only her friends at the
town's new AIDS facility, gay Spencer (John Hallum), and old high
school chum, Grace Miller (Teresa Garrett), keep her spirits
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   When the town's country club-like Women's League surprisingly
votes to do its volunteer work at the hospice, the decision upsets
several of the snooty women and causes controversy when Spencer
drunkenly jokes at the Azalea Ball that he became gay ``after
drinking the town's water.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the whole burg turns upside down and is in a frenzy; Alex
falls in love with Grace, and newspaper reporter Mark Anderson
(Derrick Sanders) defies his old-school dad and announces that he,
too, is gay. Even Brother Daniel (John Addington), who runs a
``Homo-No-Mo'' support group, inadvertently gets caught in the
craziness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Water'' features two attractive lead characters.
Chapman and Garrett inhabit their parts with quiet assurance and
gravity and they hold our attention by offering welcome relief from
the rest of the insanity. Unfortunately, most of the other actors
push the envelope as far as perpetuating old stereotypes _ both of
gays and Southern belles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, director and writer Kelli Herd has made a pleasant and
moving comedy that sprung from her astonishment over ``the lack of
films about gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   She manages to poke fun at conservative, right-wing factions yet
isn't vicious or mean in her humor. That allows the film to
transcend being pigeon-holed. It has a more universal appeal. In
fact, ``It's in the Water'' played two years ago at the Seattle
International Film Festival, where it packed the house and was
well-received.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not perfect _ the look of the film has no real style
or originality _ it does have an eclectic charm. And Chapman, who
has appeared on ``Baywatch,'' is terrific as a society wife who has
been beaten down by marital and parental pressure. She retains a
resilience that is compelling.
</P>
<P>
   As Alex begins to take control of her life, the actress visibly
blooms onscreen. While Patricia Rozema's ``When Night Is Falling''
is still the best film about a woman's coming out, ``It's in the
Water'' is a feel-good addition to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the Water. Directed by Kelli Herd. Written by Kelli
Herd. Cast: Keri Jo Chapman, Teresa Garrett, Derrick Sanders,
Timothy Vahle. Herd Film Co., 100 minutes. Unrated with nudity,
language, gay themes.

`WHATEVER' COPS AN ATTITUDE EARLY ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This movie about high school girls on the fast track to hell in
1981 cops an attitude early on and maintains its facade of
hopelessness and apathy throughout. Like ``Girls Town'' and ``All
Over Me,'' its main characters are opposites who attract.
</P>
<P>
   Anna (Liza Weil) lives with her mom and bratty little brother.
She's up for admittance to art school _ Cooper Union in Manhattan _
and has genuine artistic talent. Brenda comes from an abusive
household and she's full of rage and self-loathing. She doesn't
care about anything but having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever'' opens with a distasteful scene of three boys
``running a train'' on Brenda as she lies drunkenly in a field.
It's an unsettling and revolting moment that sets the tone for
things to come.
</P>
<P>
   But Anna is the film's real protagonist. She's shy and unsure
and mouths off to everyone in authority in an effort to be
accepted. Only in art class under the guidance of Mr. Chaminsky (an
over-the-top Frederic Forrest) does she find her footing. Deep down
she desperately wants to be admitted to college. She's fragile,
ackward and at the age where any rejection could break her in half.
</P>
<P>
   The girls slum from party to party; Brenda grows continually
more reckless, picking up older boys, and Anna follows behind,
picking up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The unfocused world of teenagers at a breaking point is captured
beautifully in ``Whatever.'' Anna admits she's ``afraid of being
ordinary'' and writer/director Susan Skoog and Liza Weil, the young
actress who astonishingly inhabits Anna, ensure she's anything but.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad the same can't be said for Skoog's script, which
relies upon banalities, overused trademarks of teenage angst and
rebellion and that old red herring, abuse, as the impetus for
Brenda's sullen rage.
</P>
<P>
   The party scenes are perfectly recreated, with the miasma and
lethargy of youth wasting their lives and brain cells with too much
alcohol and drugs, and not having a very good time in the process.
It almost feels like a documentary in some instances, which would
have been a fascinating premise, but Skoog forces her narrative
into conventional dramatic structures and it hurts the film.
</P>
<P>
   Had she just let the camera roll and not pushed the story into
such convenient, cliched and obvious slots, the film might have
been revelatory. But it opts to follow a more traditional path and
despite two exceptionally fine performances from Weil and Morgan,
``Whatever'' is, well, just whatever itself.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and written by Susan Skoog. Cast: Liza Weil, Chad
Morgan, Mark Riffon. Sony Pictures Classics. 112 minutes. Rated R
for language, sexual content, nudity, scenes with drugs and
alcohol, violence.

FOR LEWINSKY AND MOTHER, THE ORDEAL GOES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They hunkered together like frightened prey as
prosecutors stalked their secrets.
</P>
<P>
   For Monica S. Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia K. Lewis, time
passed slowly in the six months that independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr tightened the prosecutorial circle around them before they
agreed on Tuesday to cooperate in his investigation of President
Clinton in exchange for full immunity from criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, a mother and daughter accustomed to many of the
finer things money can buy lived in fear that they could land
behind bars for their roles in Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lewinsky and Lewis are starting over, free from prosecution
as long as they tell grand jurors all they know about Lewinsky's
alleged affair with Clinton and any efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   But with much to tell _ and so much upheaval behind them _ the
lives of the mother and daughter from Beverly Hills will never be
the same.
</P>
<P>
   According to news accounts, taped conversations between
Lewinsky, a 25-year-old former White House intern, and her former
co-worker, Linda R. Tripp, show Lewinsky confided details of her
alleged sexual relationship with Clinton to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes also reportedly indicate Lewis, 50, was scheming to
try to conceal her daughter's relationship with Clinton when
Lewinsky and Tripp were subpoenaed in the sexual harassment case
that Paula Corbin Jones brought against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In one taped exchange, Lewinsky told Tripp her mother had
offered to help pay expenses if Tripp would follow through on her
idea to fake a ``foot accident'' to avoid testifying, according to
Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was quoted as saying her mother described Tripp's idea
for the foot injury as ``brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ploy was never used.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, in an affidavit, denied having sex with Clinton. The
president also denied under oath that he and Lewinsky had a sexual
relationship, a denial he has repeated publicly.
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis's part, Starr has also investigated whether she helped
Lewinsky develop a mysterious list of ``talking points'' for Tripp
to use if she testified in the Jones case. The talking points are
considered possible evidence of an effort to have Tripp lie about
Clinton's alleged encounter with a White House volunteer, Kathleen
Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Starr, in the end, would have considered Lewis complicit
in a criminal case involving Lewinsky or Clinton, all that mattered
to the mother and daughter was the possibility raised by Starr's
staff that he might.
</P>
<P>
   None of the estimated 70 witnesses who have testified before
Starr's grand jury since January became more distraught than Lewis
did during two appearances in February. At one point, the judge
halted questioning and summoned a nurse for Lewis. The judge later
excused her because she was too upset to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The episode marked a low point in the lengthy ordeal the mother
and daughter have endured since Lewinsky burst from obscurity with
the first news reports on Jan. 21, a week after Starr's
investigators confronted Lewinsky after she and Tripp discussed her
alleged affair with Clinton over drinks at a Ritz-Carlton hotel in
suburban Washington. Investigators were monitoring a hidden
recording device worn by Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The first call Lewinsky made while the investigators detained
her was to her mother _ who has been her daughter's housemate,
closest friend, and confidante.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who shared Lewinsky's passion for the social circuit,
became a freelancer for the Hollywood Reporter while she lived a
millionaire's life in Beverly Hills during her 19-year marriage to
Dr. Bernard S. Lewinsky, a prominent oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   At one social event, Lewis, which is her pen name, befriended
the singer Placido Domingo. She later wrote a book, ``Three
Tenors'' about Domingo, Jose Carrera, and Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign she harbored little naivete about the public appetite
for sexual intrigue, Lewis reportedly encouraged her publishers to
promote the book by leaking rumors that she had slept with Domingo,
which she would deny.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lewis reportedly told Starr's investigators after they
detained Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton: ``What's the big deal? So
she lied and tried to convince someone else to lie?''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Lewis accompanied Lewinsky home to the duplex
apartment they were sharing in the Watergate complex next to the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Lewis
moved there after she and Dr. Lewinsky divorced in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed the episode at the Ritz-Carlton,
Lewis and Lewinsky faced a battery of television cameras whenever
they left the Watergate. They grew increasingly reclusive, although
Lewinsky occasionally attended social events with her former
lawyer, William H. Ginsburg, and Lewis sometimes escaped to New
York to visit her then fiance and now husband, R. Peter Straus, 75,
a communications executive who has stood by Lewis and Lewinsky
throughout the experience.
</P>
<P>
   But the mother and daughter mostly were alone with their secrets
and their fears. Now, they have something more to share: an
uncertain future.

`BASEKETBALL' IS LOW AND DUMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are this summer's Hollywood comedies aiming lower than ever
before in terms of bathroom humor, cruelty jokes, insensitivity to
minorities and all-around bad taste?
</P>
<P>
   That's the argument several critics have made recently, and
based on the evidence of such films as ``Mafia!,'' ``There's
Something About Mary,'' and even ``Dr. Doolittle,'' it's hard to
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still more evidence for the prosecution in
``BASEketball,'' a harrowingly dumb comedy that combines the
talents of writer-director David Zucker (``Airplane!'' ``The Naked
Gun'') with the creators of trash-TV's ``South Park,'' Trey Parker
and Matt Stone.
</P>
<P>
   This one is about two Milwaukee underachievers (Parker and
Stone), who inadvertently invent a backyard game that combines
elements of both basketball and baseball, with an added ``psyche
out'' factor in which opponents deliberately try to rattle each
other's concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to five years later, and the sport is the rage of America,
largely because it has forbidden all the things we hate about
professional sports in the '90s _ players aren't highly paid, they
can't change teams and corporate money is kept out.
</P>
<P>
   It's rather a clever idea for a sports satire, on the basis of
which sports-enthusiast Zuker apparently managed to recruit a slew
of famous sports announcers (Bob Costas, Tim McCarver, Curt Gowdy
and Al Michaels), and such sports legends as Reggie Jackson, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Dale Earnhardt to take part.
</P>
<P>
   But, not content to make merely a clever satire, he's junked up
the movie far beyond anything he's ever dared in the past. It's one
flatulence, urination and vomit gag after another; juvenile attacks
on gays (the San Francisco team is ``the Ferries''), Hispanics and
the blind; cruelty jokes that go on for agonizing lengths of screen
time.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, despite his successful track record as a comedy
director, Zuker proves himself not especially adept at
low-low-humor _ not half as imaginative as, say, the Farrelly
Brothers (``Kingpin,'' ``Dumb and Dumber''). At least three-fourths
of his gags fell absolutely flat with the audience Universal
recruited for the Seattle preview showing. Barely a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   But the real tragedy is that, by spending so much of its time
heaping up the most abysmal kind of adolescent humor,
``BASEketball'' fails to live up to whatever small potential it has
as a sports comedy. The script doesn't even have time to tell us,
for instance, how this game is played. We're forced to keep staring
at these numbskulls throwing basketballs and running around some
weird shaped court without ever really knowing what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball. Directed by David Zucker. Cast: Trey Parker, Matt
Stone, Yasmine Bleeth, Robert Vaughn. Universal. 100 minutes. Rated
R for gross humor.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D-

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... she says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What she didn't know was that an entire family had been waiting
_ and literally praying _ for her arrival for decades. She didn't
know that the grandmother she'd never met had pasted a halo of
Brock's baby pictures on her bedroom mirror, or that an aunt
carried a faded photograph of her in her wallet. (More people who
knew the secret.) ``It was really strange, like being famous and
not knowing you're famous,'' Brock says.
</P>
<P>
   She knew none of this, of course, when she arrived by chance at
a convention in Dorado Beach four months after her mother's death.
Or when she asked a hotel desk clerk how she might track down
someone in the area and he suggested she try any number of old
restaurants where locals hang out. Or when, in the first restaurant
she entered, the cook announced that he knew the brother of one
Clemente Morales Torres. Or when the cook fetched a young man named
Rafi, who said he was related to Clemente Morales Torres and that
Torres had indeed been in Japan after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Brock got a pretty good idea what was coming when she told
Rafi that Torres might be her father and he nonchalantly replied:
``Yeah, I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few hours were chaos. She was taken to meet her uncle,
the proprietor of a nearby store. She was whisked to an elegant
neighborhood home where she met her two aunts, one of them weeping
as she pulled Brock's baby picture from her wallet. She was hurried
to another, more modest, home where her elderly paternal
grandparents _ Miquel and Maria, no longer living at the address to
which Brock had sent her letter _ were waiting. ``My grandfather
embraced me and cried and mumbled things in Spanish,'' Brock says.
``Then I sat between the two of them on a couch while they held my
hand and talked in Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing was, they all knew. They all knew of the young man who
had joined the Army, gone to Japan, fallen in love, fathered a
child, and come home alone. They had prayed for the child's arrival
in their midst, and the prayers had finally been answered. Even as
the father of the little girl had gone away to live on the US
mainland, even as he was now working as a cab driver in New York,
they had waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing thing,'' says Brock, ``that they had loved
me dearly but had never known me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rita Brock talked to her father for the first time on the
telephone from Puerto Rico the next morning. He told her that he'd
met her mother in a US hospital in Japan where he was an orderly
and she was a nurse. He explained that he and Ayako had lived
together for six months after Rita was born, and that he'd been
shipped to Korea. He told her she'd been named after actress Rita
Hayworth, who was part Hispanic. And he admitted that he hadn't
kept in touch with Ayako, finally receiving a letter from her
announcing that she'd gotten married and that he should never try
to contact her or their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cried a lot,'' Brock says of that first conversation with
her father. ``He said several times that he had wanted to find me
but had wanted to respect my mother's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brock did not, she recalls, have any strong feelings about
this voice at the other end of the line. To her, it seemed she was
simply having a polite conversation with a kind of stranger. ``He
just seemed like some guy that I was supposed to know but didn't
feel any connection to,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Later they would meet face-to-face in New York. Torres would cry
again, but Brock still didn't know what to feel. ``It was a numbing
experience in some ways,'' she recalls. ``Many of my assumptions
around the experience had been shattered. I'd thought it would be
hard to find him. I thought people might be unhappy to see me. So I
couldn't connect to the intense euphoria in Puerto Rico. More than
anything, it was bewildering.''
</P>
<P>
   It still is. Four times divorced, Torres, now in his early 70s,
lives in Chattanooga, where he is a part-time security guard.
Brock, herself divorced with no children, sees him only about once
a year. He signs his cards, ``Dad.'' She calls him ``Clemente.''
``He really doesn't know me in the way a father would know me,''
says Brock. ``We don't have those shared experiences. He's not
someone I would go to for help. ... It's hard to imagine him as my
father. Mostly he's this person who connects me to this very
interesting family in Puerto Rico.'' Describing herself as ``half
Puerto Rican but not culturally Puerto Rican,'' Brock says she'd
eventually like to live on the island, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she still wonders why her mother never told her the
secret. And she wishes she had. She muses aloud about the
difficulties her mother must have faced in raising a mixed-race
child within a xenophobic culture. And hadn't Ayako Brock written
in longhand to Clemente Torres in March 1953, when she told him not
to contact her, ``If necessary to tell (Rita) I will tell her about
you?'' But she never did tell her, except by leaving a document in
a metal box as she was dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably had some intent to tell me, but the longer she
waited the harder it got,'' Brock theorizes.
</P>
<P>
   After she had learned the secret and found her birth father,
Rita Brock visited her adoptive father's family in rural
Mississippi. When she told her Aunt Pearl Gilmore that she'd
discovered she wasn't Roy Brock's daughter and that her father was
really Puerto Rican, the older woman didn't blink. Yes: she knew,
too. Heck, Aunt Pearl allowed as how just about everyone knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way to do it,'' she declared, laughing. ``You tell
people something but don't tell them it's a secret. That way they
won't talk about it.''

PATRIOTISM IN THE BOARDROOM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the unlikeliest controversies of the 1988 presidential
campaign was the ``Pledge issue'' _ Michael Dukakis's veto of a
Massachusetts law requiring public school teachers to lead students
each day in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis had opposed the law, though it merely codified an old
tradition of teaching children to honor the flag and ``the Republic
for which it stands,'' on the grounds that it violated the First
Amendment. The Legislature emphatically overrode the governor's
veto _ singing ``God Bless America'' as it voted _ but Dukakis
refused to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, running against Dukakis for the White House,
Vice President George Bush made that veto an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so
much?'' Bush taunted. ``It is very hard for me to imagine that the
Founding Fathers ... would have objected to teachers leading
students in the Pledge.'' Democrats denounced Bush for questioning
Dukakis's patriotism, but the barb stung. It was effective because
it reinforced a popular view of Dukakis _ that he was one of those
elitist know-it-alls who turn up their noses at the values and
customs of Middle America.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who don't like things like the Pledge,'' said
William Bennett, then US secretary of education. ``They have
disdain for the simple and basic patriotism of most Americans. They
think they're smarter than everybody else; they don't like these
kinds of rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   What brings this history to mind is a sheaf of letters sent to
me by Ralph Nader, the self-described ``consumer advocate'' and
longtime scourge of American business.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has been writing to CEOs of the nation's largest
corporations, raising the question of whether they feel any
particular loyalty to the United States. American taxpayers, he
points out, have certainly been loyal to them. ``The tax code
subsidizes foreign investment by US corporations, ... the
Export-Import Bank provides subsidies as loan guarantees for US
multinationals, (and) a federal agency called OPIC (the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation) insures these companies against
political risks.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have added the roughly 125 corporate welfare programs
that hand out pork to American business _ for example, the
Agriculture Department's Market Promotion Program, which pays
companies to advertise abroad. Analysts at the Cato Institute have
totted up $65 billion in annual subsidies to Big Business. That
doesn't include the salaries of officials who act as pitchmen for
American goods, the protectionist trade sanctions Washington slaps
on many foreign exporters, or the commercial attaches posted in US
embassies. And it doesn't include the soldiers and sailors who have
fought _ and sometimes died _ to guard American investments.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has been urging America's foremost corporations to make a
voluntary show of support ``to the country that bred them, built
them, subsidized them, and defended them.'' How? By opening their
annual shareholder's meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's suggestion is no doubt mischievous. I'm sure his motives
have less to do with patriotism than with embarrassing the
corporate directors and managers he has spent a lifetime hassling
and harassing.
</P>
<P>
   But on the merits, his idea is unassailable. US law and US
liberty have allowed the owners of America's great companies to
build empires of remarkable wealth and power. It would be
appropriate indeed for those owners to pause once a year to pledge
allegiance to the flag of the United States _ to this blessed
nation of ``liberty and justice for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 corporations contacted by Nader, only one accepted
his proposal. ``We think the suggestion,'' said Federated
Department Stores, ``is a good one ... and would be a positive
statement on many levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of Nader's letters were ignored. Sears, du Pont, Pepsico,
IBM, and American Express were among the corporations that never
replied. Others merely acknowledged his request, or rejected it
without explanation. Citicorp was brusque: ``It is not our practice
to respond about (sic) what we consider the possible merits or
disadvantages of every proposal that is made.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies claimed that since their operations are wholly
domestic, there is no reason for their shareholders to recite the
Pledge of Allegiance. AT&AMP;T, Kodak, Coca-Cola, and many others
argued the opposite _ that the ``global nature'' of their business
makes it impossible that those attending the annual meeting should
stand for the flag. Ford Motor Co. renounced any feeling of
American patriotism. ``As a multinational ... Ford in its largest
sense is an Australian company in Australia, a British company in
the United Kingdom, a German company in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna CEO Richard Huber bluntly denounced Nader's suggestion as
``contrary to the principles on which our democracy was founded.''
Motorola condemned the ``political and nationalistic overtones'' of
the Pledge. The CEO of PriceCostco, Jim Sinegal, snapped: ``What do
you propose next _ personal loyalty oaths?'' Kimberly-Clark's
senior VP called the idea ``a grim reminder of the loyalty oaths of
the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   What a disgrace. Are dignified expressions of patriotism
appropriate only before baseball games, but not when serious
business is at hand? Is it only 5th-graders who should be urged to
stand to honor the flag?
</P>
<P>
   Nader isn't asking for corporate America's allegiance to him. He
is asking that respect be shown to the flag. Apparently that is
more than the CEOs and board chairmen of the Fortune 100 can abide.
Why? What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets them so
much?

CLOCK WON'T SAY ON THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I hung a Regulator clock on a plasterboard wall with a molly
bolt, which pulled out of the wall. You know the rest; the clock
fell. I can't change the location of the clock. How can I keep it
on the wall?
</P>
<P>
   R.F., Medford. Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Good question, but never fear, there are ways. What happened,
of course, is that the molly bolt was inserted in 3/8- or 1/2-inch
plasterboard, neither of which was strong enough to hold the bolt
that holds the clock. And, since the clock is held by a loop in
back, you can't use two molly bolts to share the weight.
</P>
<P>
   I understand why you can't (or don't want to) move the clock,
but think about it: Is there another place you could hang the clock
on a stud, which would be the best way to hang a heavy object? Then
you could put up a picture where the clock was.
</P>
<P>
   If not, here is what you can do: Buy or have made a steel or
brass mending plate long enough to reach two studs, and screw it
onto the studs. Make sure there is a hook in the middle of the
plate, so you can hang the clock on it. If there is no hook, you
could drill a hole in the middle of the plate and insert a bolt,
with nuts on both sides, which would act as a hook or hanger. The
thin mending plate will allow the clock to hang relatively tightly
against the wall. One more idea: Instead of the mending plate, use
a brass chain, each end screwed into a stud. Then hang an S-hook in
the middle of the chain to hold the clock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My bungalow-style house was treated with semitransparent
stain, and it still looks pretty good, except for where a tree
branch made deep scratches in the wood siding. A painter redoing my
house said a new coat of semitransparent stain will not cover the
scratches, and proposed using solid stain instead. Is solid stain
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   JIM McCONAUGHY, Haverhill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The solid stain might cover the scratches better than
semitransparent, but you are opening up a big can of worms if you
use it, because solid stains can peel, and probably will. I would
go ahead and continue with the semitransparent stain, but first
sand the scratches as much as practicable so they will show less.
And if that is not satisfactory, replace the scratched shingles or
clapboards.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have trouble opening my aluminum storm door; it is too
tight in its frame; my husband forced it, and now it won't close.
How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   ARLENE WHITE, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since it is aluminum, chances are there is a small aluminum
frame attached to the wood frame; the door sits in this aluminum
frame. It's my guess that the wood frame has swollen with all the
rain we have had, making the opening smaller, ergo, the door won't
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, check the hinges to make sure the screws are tight.
Now, to make the opening bigger, you have to take off that aluminum
frame. Then plane or cut down one or both sides of the wood frame
(and the top as well), put the aluminum frame back up, and see what
happens. Another way to do it is to substitute 1/2-inch board for
the 3/4-inch board on the sides and top of the opening.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that you can just take off the aluminum frame and
mount the door in the wood frame, because this type of aluminum
door probably has its hinges riveted onto the aluminum frame.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it isn't a wood door. Such doors can be planed or sawed
to fit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I get grape juice stains from my Formica counter top?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA GAUTHIER, Kingston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try these tricks: First and easiest is bleach. Apply a bit of
bleach on the stain; it should bleach out without affecting the
top. Or, make a mix of baking soda and water, slather it on the
stain and leave it for 15 minutes or so. Scrub and rinse. Or, Soft
Scrub; slather that on and wait a while, scrub, and rinse. Pine Sol
might also do it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I can't find a replacement gasket for my 20-year-old Norge
front-loading dryer. The gasket keeps the clothes from catching on
sharp metal edges. Even the distributor in Woburn, Mass. could not
find a gasket.
</P>
<P>
   SARKIS TOOMAJIAN, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's wonderful, isnt it? You get a good appliance, and it
serves you well for 20 years or so (far beyond its life
expectancy), then replacement parts are discontinued for such old
machines. Pooh.
</P>
<P>
   So, you will have to play it by ear. If the gasket is flapping
in the breeze (not entirely gone), you could wrap it with duct
tape. If the gasket is totally gone, put the tape in its place.
Duct tape has a reputation of drying out and loosing its grip under
heat, but the new stuff, which is harder to work with, may stick
better. At least it is unlikely to ooze any of its adhesive onto
the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   One source you might try to see if they have a gasket: Bay State
School of Appliances in Canton, Mass.; telephone 781-828-3434.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, with or without a gasket, the dryer owes you
nothing and you owe it nothing, because the life expectancy of an
electric dryer is 14 years, and of a gas dryer, 13 years.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I still remember how shocked I was when I first read that girls
were beginning to diet in the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   I blamed the families, especially the superficial, empty-headed
mothers who taught their daughters to care too much about their
appearance. I blamed the media and a corporate culture that
presented girls with unattainable models of slimness as a way of
inducing them to spend more money. I saw this premature concern
with weight as a way of distracting girls from their real purposes
in life, turning would-be astronomers and aspiring physicians into
obsessive fat gram counters. I thought that having so many young
girls dieting was appalling.
</P>
<P>
   I take it all back. They have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Today's kids are under assault by a multibillion-dollar fast
food industry intent on cramming fried foods, snack foods, and
sweet foods down their throats. I now think that one of the most
important skills we can teach our children, male or female, is how
to avoid getting hooked on food that is dangerous to their health.
</P>
<P>
   Today's kids face too many temptations. A birthday party, which
used to be an unusual event, comes up every week. Once you invited
a few friends and that was that. Today, in an attempt to be more
inclusive, children invite every classmate to every birthday party,
which results in a hectic, and very fattening, social calendar for
all.
</P>
<P>
   My grandaughter and I went to a roller-skating party the other
day, and it was lots of fun, especially when I discovered I could
still skate backward. As Jessie and I passed the food table,
however, we snacked on potato chips, M&AMP;Ms, cheese puffs, pretzels.
Then came lunch: cheese-drenched pizza and sugar-filled soda. And
dessert: rich chocolate cake, creamy ice cream. At the end of the
party, the two of us waddled to the car.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not blaming anyone. This is the same menu Jessie served at
her birthday party. This is the food that's on every children's
menu in every restaurant in America. This is the food they serve
when the gym team wins a match or the Girl Scouts have a picnic.
This is the food the baby sitter orders when she's asked to give
the kids dinner, the food a family eats when it stops on the road
for a meal. This is the food for sale at movie theaters, in bowling
alleys, at ball games. This is the food many schools are now
serving in their cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it fattening, the portions are getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Most ice cream stores these days start their cones at $1.89 or
more. Several scoops fill even the smallest container to
overflowing. If you ask for a single scoop, the kid behind the
counter informs you that small is not an option. When I've offered
to pay top price for one tiny scoop, I usually get one the size of
a bloated softball. And don't forget the sprinkles: oreo cookies,
M&AMP;Ms, chunks of chocolate peanut-butter cups, rainbow jimmies
shoveled on with a trowel. The ``smallest'' dish of ice cream in
these places could hold any kid for a month. Have you seen a muffin
lately? Eating one is like lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   The results are everywhere you look. In the past 30 years, the
proportion of US children who are overweight has doubled, from 5 to
11 percent, but getting fat is only one of the problems that comes
from eating this stuff. Pediatricians are increasingly concerned
about the incidence of high blood pressure in boys 10 to 18, who,
upon examination, are found to already have a thickening of the
heart muscle that has been linked to heart failure in adults.
Excess weight is also a contributing factor to adult-onset
diabetes. In addition, because we live in a fat-hating culture,
being heavy puts a child under significant psychological strain.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents discover, to their dismay, that after their child
hits school, they have no control over what she eats. How else can
a family fight back except by placing the responsibility for her
diet within the child? What else can parents do but explain the
principles of good nutrition and hope they've succeeded in walking
the fine line between raising a healthy child and creating fertile
ground for bulimia or anorexia?
</P>
<P>
   This is a culture that is deeply at odds with our children's
well-being. As long as money changes hands, advertisers don't care
what they push on our kids: cigarettes, caffeine-laden soda, or
clogged arteries and a blighted life, it's all the same to them. As
the only voice of reason around, the conscientious parent walks
this minefield with caution. One misstep and the child is hiding
candy bars under the bed or subsisting on one small apple for
dinner, slice by slice.

NERVOUS HABITS OFTEN REFLECT A DEVELOPMENTAL NEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child, Susan Swedo bit her fingernails so much that her
parents made a deal with her. If she stopped biting for a month,
they'd take her to the movies, a treat in rural Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now a mother of three and a pediatrician who, perhaps not so
coincidentally, researches children's nervous habits, she
understands how much her biting must have bugged her parents. She
also understands why they were never able to get her to stop. It
turns out that nail or cuticle biting is one of the hardest habits
for children to break; 20 percent of those who do it, like Swedo,
will still be picking or biting as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, most of the habits our children engage in go away on
their own. While they last, though, any one of them _ from hair
twirling to lip picking, thumb sucking to shirt sucking, finger
tapping to knuckle cracking _ can make you crazy. And therein lies
the rub. Just because a habit bothers you doesn't mean it bothers
your child. Indeed, most children pick, bite, or suck without even
realizing it. Not only that, but most of the time, the habit serves
an important purpose and a developmental need, usually for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them nervous habits but more commonly it's about being
overtired, out of control, or trying to concentrate,'' says
clinical psychologist Laura Gutermuth Foster, who researches
developmental disorders at the University of Maryland at Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see that the baby who sucks his thumb is trying to
comfort himself. It's also easy to connect it to a primitive
suckling reflex. It's harder to make the connection with a
9-year-old who one day starts to suck on his shirt-sleeve but
Foster says it's the same need. In fact, she says many kids migrate
from one form of oral gratification to another, typically pacifier
to thumb to pencil chewing to shirt sucking.
</P>
<P>
   Even infants have habits. Body rocking on all fours or head
banging are considered habits, even though they can be scary to
watch; one is fueled by a need to strenthen muscles pre-walking,
the other by unexpended energy. They tend to disappear by 18
months &UR;  &LR; but residual rocking in a seated position or at bedtime may
continue into adulthood and still be normal, says &UR;  &LR; experimental
psychologist Gershon Berkson, a professor at the University of
Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time for the onset of habits is between 2 and 5. A
2-year-old rubs her ear lobe with her finger or her blankie against
her lip, a 3-year-old twirls her hair. Or you may see something
more ritualistic: a 4-year-old who insists on the same orange shirt
every day or who refuses to eat a broken cracker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about wanting to exert control over your world,''
says Foster. It may feel like rigidity to you, but it's a source of
security to a child. ``Let it roll off your back,'' says Foster.
``It'll disappear faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all habits begin out of a need for self-comfort. Hair
twirling, most common among fifth- and sixth-grade girls, calms a
child so she can concentrate. Finger or foot tapping starts as a
way to expend unused energy. The genesis for nail biting and
knuckle cracking is tactile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pick a finger because there's a rough spot or a hangnail.
You crack your knuckle because you get a sensation of tightness in
your finger. Some boys start because they think it's macho,'' says
Swedo, who is chief of pediatrics for the National Institute of
Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it takes on a life of its own. ``You do one finger, you
check the next, and pretty soon you're into a pattern of doing them
all,'' she says. ``Once you start, you have to do it to
completion.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, sometimes something that makes a child nervous _
bedtime, a test, the first day of school _ is what brings a habit
on. ``Going to sleep is one of the most anxious periods of the
day,'' says Swedo. ``You're separating from the family and facing
fears of the dark. Sucking your thumb, rubbing your blankie,
rocking, even the sequence of events are calming.''
</P>
<P>
   With any habit, the task for a parent is to be alert to teasing
by peers or to potential medical issues. Otherwise, there's no
reason to try to make a child stop, says Foster.
</P>
<P>
   In the preschool years, teasing is unlikely; distracting her
with another activity or ignoring the habit is your best strategy.
Whatever you do, at this or any age, don't shame a child, says
child psychiatrist Stuart Goldman of Children's Hospital in Boston.
``Saying, `I'm surprised a boy your age does this,' or, `Your
little sister doesn't do that,''' is humiliating,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the school-age years, it's a different story; peers will
notice a habit that is socially uncool, like nose picking or
sucking a thumb at school. It can be important, indeed critical,
for a child to be aware of what she's doing and able to control
herself. Point the habit out, talk about how peers might react, and
label it as something to be done in private. Avoid nagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's trying to self-calm, nagging makes him more anxious.
You increase his need,'' says Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting a child habit-free, no matter what the habit,
is that she herself wants to stop. What typically will push her to
that point is being teased or seeing the habit annoy her best
friend. Even if you warn her this might happen, she likely won't
believe you; she has to figure this out herself. Start by pointing
out, ``When I was a kid, someone who picked his lip would be
teased. Does that happen to you?'' Offer support _ ``Do you want me
to point out to you when you do it?'' _ and a way for him to gain
control, for instance, a substitute behavior like chewing gum. You
can also suggest, ``How 'bout if you carry paper in your pocket and
every time you notice someone noticing you picking your lip, you
mark it on the paper. Then you can decide for yourself if this is a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've done that, back off. There are a few exceptions,
however, when more is called for:
</P>
<P>
   _If you really can't stand it. If he cracks his knuckles at the
table or picks his nose, send him to his room, says Swedo. ``Tell
him, `It ruins our meal and I know you can control it enough not to
do it at dinner. Please stop or leave.''' Don't be punitive, just
matter-of-fact.
</P>
<P>
   _If it could have a medical component. Hair twirling can turn
into hair pulling, which is a serious medical problem. Picked
fingers can get infected. Offer a substitute behavior that gets her
need met: a smooth stone in her pocket for touching or a small ball
to squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   _If it interferes with her ability to function. Habits can cross
a line and become rituals or obsessions, says child psychiatrist
Henrietta Leonard of Brown University. A 5-year-old who taps his
fingers during story time has a habit that may be disturbing to
others, but that's all it is. (Give him options for acceptable
substitute behaviors.) But if he interrupts his play to rush to a
spot in the room to tap on the floor, he could be moving along a
continuum. ``Get it checked out,'' says Leonard. She is coauthor,
with Swedo, of ``Is It Just a Phase?'' due out in October (Golden
Books).
</P>
<P>
   _If it's a tic. Throat clearning, sighing, coughing, or sniffing
when there isn't a cold or allergy are common verbal tics; motor
tics include repetitive eye blinking, facial grimaces, and head
shrugs. Unlike habits, kids are aware of these and feel
self-conscious, but they're unable to stop. If it lasts more than
three weeks, contact your pediatrician, advises Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   When a child wants to rid himself of a habit, star charts and
other mild behavioral modification can help. For instance, says
Goldman, ``Take a baseline of how many times a day you observe it,
say five, and set a goal together of anything less than five being
worthy of special time with you. Then work down from there. The key
is not to set unrealistic expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps of any parent, Swedo is best prepared to be sympathetic
to a child's nervous habits. So far, though, her three daughters
haven't had any, not even a hint of nail biting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _A nervous habit doesn't automatically mean a child is nervous,
unhappy, or poorly adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   _At the onset of a habit that you know could be troubling, the
first time you notice it is the time to have a conversation: ``This
is the kind of thing kids tease about.''
</P>
<P>
   _Habits can appear overnight. In a school-age child, look for a
catalyst. There may be a stress she needs help with.
</P>
<P>
   _You can point out potential bad consequences from a habit _
braces from sucking, infection from picking _ but don't expect them
to faze a child. He can't project into the future.
</P>
<P>
   _Superstitions are normal, a kind of magical thinking (``If I do
this nothing bad/something good will happen'') and not cause for
concern. Don't belittle your child for having one.
</P>
<P>
   _If your child is too old to have a blankie and likely to get
teased at sleep-overs, cut it into small pieces. It will be less
offensive, and there's always a spare.

JUST HOW THE GARDEN GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners are a curious lot (you can take that two ways, and
probably should), and lately this gardener has been curious about
just how his garden does grow.
</P>
<P>
   My idle summer thoughts ran thusly: In the front yard, awash in
sunshine, the grass grows and must be mowed (though not so much in
the heat waves of July, which may be of some relief to us as we
swelter). In the back, where I have the vegetable garden, there is
too much shade, and corn will not grow. Grass and corn are both
monocots, and what do we really know about monocots? This is how my
interest was piqued (and this is how my mind works, a process well
understood by my long-suffering wife).
</P>
<P>
   The plants we are familiar with are gymnosperms (conifers, which
have no flowers and whose so-called naked seeds are not encased
inside ovaries) and angiosperms (the flowering plants, with seeds
in ovaries). Angiosperms (division Anthophyta) constitute the
largest classification of plants and are divided into two classes:
monocotyledons (monocots) and dicotyledons (dicots).
</P>
<P>
   The classes are named for the number of cotyledons each has.
Cotyledons are the ``seed leaves,'' those small fleshy appendages
(one on monocots, such as grass and corn; two on a dicot, such as a
rose and marigold) that appear as a seed sprouts. They provide
storage for nutrients from the seeds and, in some cases, may
generate food through photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   It is not so simple, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Dicots greatly outnumber monocots, and they are quite different
in many ways. But many plants have a mix of monocot and dicot
characteristics, attributable in part to a shared ancestry. Tracing
the morphology of angiosperms, which would help us understand the
differences, and just where each species fits, is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Monocots evolved from dicots so early in the development of
flowering plants that there are large gaps in the fossil record.
There are plenty of flower fossils from the mid-Cretaceous, but by
then the split was well under way. Monocots may have branched off
from a Magnoliidae-like lineage, perhaps sharing ancestry with
Magnoliales, an order that now comprises several primitive dicots.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the number of cotyledons (and even that is not
definitive in every case), the differences between monocots and
dicots are both external and internal, obvious and obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, monocots have leaf veins that are parallel, and the
base of a leaf sheathes the stem; dicot leaf veins are reticulate,
or netlike, and the flat part is usually connected to the stem by a
petiole, or stalk.
</P>
<P>
   Monocots can have modified structures underground for storage
and anchoring, such as bulbs (fleshy leaves, as in onions and
tulips), corms (dry leaves and stem) and rhizomes (stems).
</P>
<P>
   The parts of monocot flowers typically occur in multiples of
three; the floral parts of dicots come in multiples of four and
five.
</P>
<P>
   Monocot roots are adventitious, arising from nodes along stems,
and fibrous; dicot roots develop from the radicle at the base of
the seed and often have taproots.
</P>
<P>
   None of these by itself is definitive.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, monocots have vascular bundles (the xylem and phloem,
which carry nutrients and moisture) scattered inside the stem. In
dicots, these are arranged in a ring around the edge of the stems.
</P>
<P>
   Monocots do not form wood, lacking the vascular cambium that
forms the annual rings in woody dicots as new xylem is created and
pushes outward, though bamboos and palms and agaves can take on
woody characteristics. Palms, for example, use overlapping leaf
bases, thickened enlarged cells, and prop roots.
</P>
<P>
   Monocots have pollen with single furrows or pores; dicots have
pollen with three furrows or pores.
</P>
<P>
   None of these is itself definitive.
</P>
<P>
   There is a single definitive characteristic, though.
</P>
<P>
   Plastids, small structures inside cells, are found in all
plants. Inside the phloem, they contain crystalloid proteins, and
the shape of those is distinctive. In monocots, they have a
triangular shape; in dicots, all dicots, they do not.
</P>
<P>
   So, aside from passing the time on a hot summer afternoon, who
cares? Well, monocots compose a quarter of the flowering plant
species, and economically those may be the most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Corn, rice, wheat and barley are derived from monocots. Bamboo
and palms are key building materials in many countries, and sugar
cane, pineapples, dates, bananas and many tropical fruits also come
from monocots. They also give us lilies and orchids, grasses and
sedges, rushes and cattails. Not surprisingly, monocots are
primarily tropical.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me back to my hot afternoon, and reality. Got to
mow the monocots.

AUTHOR REFOCUSES ON WHO LED THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the Hardy Boys had gone on to Yale and studied
English literature, they might have ended up a lot like Ron
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum, by his own account, is a writer obsessed with
mysteries. He investigates investigations, immerses himself in
``clandestine subcultures'' and ``esoteric controversies,'' and
reads deep between the lines of the darkest puzzles, in search of
the hidden meanings that might unravel the great conundrums of our
time _ yet suspecting they'll never be solved.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, ``Explaining Hitler'' (Random House), grapples
with what may be the most enormous conundrum of all _ the true
nature of Western civilization's emblematic mass murderer and,
ultimately, of evil itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum adopts the role of literary critic-turned-gumshoe _
analyzing the texts of the historians, philosophers, and
theologians who have addressed the riddle, and then interviewing
them, probing their underlying methods and motives, stacking up
their stories and theories against one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a scholar, I'm an educated consumer of scholarship,''
Rosenbaum said over coffee at the Oyster Bar in Grand Central
Station, not far from his Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I read the literature,'' he said, ``the more I became
struck by how divisive _ how intriguingly divisive _ the
controversy about every facet of Hitler's biography, every facet of
his psychology, was. These were brilliant, deeply learned scholars
who were at loggerheads a half-century after Hitler's death, still
arguing over the origins of his anti-Semitism and `Was he
sincere?'''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters in Rosenbaum's tale is every bit as
motley and fascinating as the witnesses cross-examined in a
top-notch murder mystery.
</P>
<P>
   There's the first generation of dueling Hitler-explainers _ H.R.
Trevor-Roper, who argued that Hitler was ``convinced of his own
rectitude,'' versus Alan Bullock, who saw Hitler as cynically
manipulating popular German anti-Semitism for his own political
ends.
</P>
<P>
   There are the Freudians, who explain the Holocaust as the
product of Hitler's sexual perversities or as a reaction to
sublimated self-hatred stemming from his own possible Jewish
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   There's Daniel Goldhagen, who sees the death camps as the
culmination of tendencies in German culture _ and Hyam Maccoby, who
sees them as the legacy of Christianity itself. There's Claude
Lanzmann, director of the nearly nine-hour documentary ``Shoah,''
who finds it sinful even to seek a ``why'' for the Holocaust,
arguing that explanation leads to exculpation; and Louis Micheels,
an Auschwitz survivor, who declares we must find a why, to prevent
the Holocaust from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum may be uniquely trained to sift through this mountain
of evidence and clues _ which is where the Hardy Boys and Yale come
in.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Bayshore, Long Island _ ``an uneventful place,''
as he calls it _ and found refuge in books as ``a way of escaping
to a more adventurous realm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hardy Boys detective books, he said, ``may have been my
biggest influence as a young kid. I got fixated on the idea of
solving mysteries. Maybe I was envious. I wished there were a lot
more skulduggery going on in my town.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rosenbaum went to Yale (class of '68), the English lit
department still revolved around the New Criticism, which preached
that the meaning of all literature was to be found through keen
examination of the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``I escaped from the academic world,'' he said, ``but one of the
things I brought to journalism from it was close reading _ not just
of literature, but of court documents, memoranda between
politicians and generals, the stenographic records of Hitler's
table talks.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freelance writer for numerous magazines for 25 years,
Rosenbaum has applied close reading _ and his obsession with
skulduggery _ to the CIA mole-hunters, the residual puzzles of
Watergate, JFK's assassination, and the subterranean world of the
Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The past three years, as a columnist for the weekly New York
Observer, he has resharpened his literary tools, probing less-trod
passages to illuminate unsolved mysteries in the life and work of
Shakespeare, Salinger, Nabokov, Pynchon, even the pop lyrics of
Rosanne Cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do read incessantly,'' Rosenbaum said. ``I always have a
stack of books that I'm reading simultaneously.'' His tastes tend
toward the grim. One of his favorite tomes is Robert Burton's
17th-century ``The Anatomy of Melancholy.'' His sense of identity
as a Jew is shaped mainly by his passion for such Jewish writers as
Kafka and the darker works of Isaac Bashevis Singer.
</P>
<P>
   He ends his book with the mystery of Hitler unsolved _ possibly
unsolvable. ``The deeper I looked into things,'' he said, ``the
less certain I became.'' In a sense, this makes his tale all the
more profound and scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to cling to the one theory, the one book, the one
rumor, to make them think it's nailed down,'' he observed. ``It's
pretty frightening to conclude that you don't really understand
where this evil comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum sees many theories as distractions from this
discomfort, as intellectual constructs to fit Hitler into some
scheme of normal human conduct and, thus, make staring into the
abyss more bearable.
</P>
<P>
   He especially distrusts the recent historians and political
scientists, such as Christopher Browning, who see the Holocaust as
the result of impersonal, almost inevitable forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to believe that great events don't happen without
great causes,'' Rosenbaum said. ``Contemporary historians want to
believe in great abstractions because it's considered a more
sophisticated way of looking at things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum may heap particular scorn on this school of thought
because he once endorsed it himself.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the genesis of ``Explaining Hitler'' to a conversation
in 1983 with a group of Jewish militants. ``They were talking about
building pipe bombs and attacking neo-Nazis,'' he recalled, ``and I
got into an argument with them about taking the law into one's own
hands. I took the liberal position that if you do this, others will
take the law into their hands and retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them said, `Wouldn't you have taken the law into your
own hands in Weimar Germany in the 1920s, when Hitler was on the
rise? Wouldn't it have been a good idea then to assassinate
Hitler?' I replied, `How do you know that would have made a
difference? There were powerful forces of history that would have
brought about a Hitler anyway.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I believed this even when I said it,''
Rosenbaum said. ``Certainly, I wasn't satisfied with my answer. It
made me wonder about the decisiveness of Hitler. Would
assassinating him have made a difference? It became a question I
wanted to investigate. I thought I'd write a novel, set in the
period, about an attempt by Jews to assassinate Hitler. I spent
four or five years researching it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more he delved into the controversies, the more he
favored the idea of a nonfiction book. He was particularly taken
with his discovery in German archives of the Munich Post, a
long-forgotten newspaper of the 1920s whose journalists were the
first to see Hitler as a murderer while so many other observers
were dismissing him as a clown or the tool of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me,'' he said, ``that some postwar scholarship,
which downplayed or dismissed the centrality of Hitler's role, was
replicating the common prewar view of Hitler _ the view that
underrated him, that saw him as a pawn of larger forces.''
</P>
<P>
   In this light, Rosenbaum came to see reestablishing Hitler's
central role as not only a factual responsibility but also a moral
one. The scholars who do otherwise, he writes at the end of his
book, permit Hitler ``to escape.'' They ``grant him the posthumous
victory of a last laugh.''

DOWN TO THE SEA WITH JOSHUA SLOCUM, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ALONE AT SEA 
The Adventures of Joshua Slocum 
By Ann Spencer 
Doubleday, 321 pp., illustrated, $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I read ``Alone at Sea'' on a cruising sailboat in Katama Bay off
Martha's Vineyard, not 5 miles from where an Edgartown fisherman
made the last positive sighting of Joshua Slocum's yawl Spray as it
sailed south, bound for the Caribbean, 90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The few dozen sailboats that lie here at anchor boast aluminum
masts that fairly bristle with electronic sensors _ VHF radio,
single sideband, TV, Loran, GPS, radar, anemometer _ all to aid and
protect the humanity on the decks below. For modern sailors, every
revisit to the world of Joshua Slocum is as much rebuke as it once
was inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Slocum's sailing conditions on Spray _ with
a compass, sextant, and inoperable clock _ and those on any modern
36-foot fiberglass cruiser scarcely needs mention. And yet his
towering abilities as a navigator, sailor, ship-wright, and
quick-witted adventurer are _ as many times as one comes upon
accounts of them _ awesome to behold. Spencer's book, an
appreciation of the man who sailed alone around the world from
April 1895 to July 1898, may not much advance our knowledge beyond
the earlier biographies, but it does repaint a wonderful old
seascape with loving care and some new detail.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time he spent cruising and navigating the world ``in
solitude supreme'' Slocum ironically was a very public man. After
his circumnavigation on a boat he rebuilt from a derelict oyster
dragger he found sitting in a Fairhaven cow pasture, Slocum wrote
and lectured extensively for the rest of his life. Spinning his
yarns to an amazed and, by Spencer's account, affectionate audience
(the old sea captain looked, spoke, and acted the part to a fault),
he made spellbinding his livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   The only real mystery of Slocum's life remains the circumstances
of his death. Was he lost in the fierce November gale that swept up
the Atlantic shortly after he left the Vineyard in 1908? Did Spray,
now in near-derelict condition, come apart in the autumn storms off
Hatteras? Or was Spray run down one night by a mail boat in the
lesser Antilles? Spencer explores the theories, seeming to favor
the last one, which came to light 50 years after Slocum and Spray
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Slocum's many scrapes and escapes, his struggles
against nature at its fiercest and most elemental, became the
metaphor of the man's life long before Spencer arrived at the
subject, though she finds something of a new beginning. She sees
Slocum as a man out of his time. At the end of the 19th century, as
he was coming of age as modern history's greatest sailor, the world
was turning away from sail to steam power, which he detested. His
early glory days as captain and part-owner of the magnificent
clipper Northern Light gave way to several reversals of fortune
that struck as suddenly as running aground on a bar, which he did
in one of his few miscalculations as navigator. Midlife found
Slocum penniless, depressed at the death of his first wife,
Victoria, and without a ship or prospect of another command.
</P>
<P>
   At this low point a friend offered Slocum the 36-foot sloop that
``needs some repair.'' Slocum was in Fairhaven next day, only to
find Spray such a derelict _ high, dry, and half-rotted _ that what
had seemed like a new prospect looked like a derisive joke. So
preposterous was the idea of restoring such a wreck that villagers
of Fairhaven often came to watch in wonderment as Slocum labored.
</P>
<P>
   But Slocum was stubborn, obsessively optimistic, and visionary.
He ``no doubt gave villagers their first intimation of how
determined and resourceful the old captain could be in heavy seas.
The crowd gathered in the pasture shared the assumption that Slocum
would be breaking up the Spray for scrap. His reply was quick and
to the point: `No, going to rebuild her.'''
</P>
<P>
   The best parts of Spencer's book are the pure shots of Slocum,
either his own poetic language or many of his time-polished tales
of pirates, storms, mutinies, hostile natives, and treacherous
reefs. Slocum's stories are, as Spencer notes in echoing his
publishers, a blend of ``Walden'' and ``Treasure Island.'' They are
always wonderful to read, even in retold form. The element of
Thoureau is in Slocum's quest to confront the essentials of life as
they are found not only in nature but in solitude. And though
Spencer treats this well and with care, no biography has ever
improved on Slocum's own ruminations, which she includes: ``The
loneliness of my state wore off when the gale was high and I found
much work to do,'' wrote the old captain. ``When fine weather
returned, then came the sense of solitude, which I could not shake
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when asleep, as Spray sailed along in perfect balance with
the tiller lashed, Slocum knew by instinct where the boat was, as
if he had an inner GPS attuned both to heaven and sea. It mattered
not, when he was sailing Spray, that no one was aboard to witness
his magnificent navigational skills. Says Spencer: ``He tested and
stretched his abilities, which were considerable, and in doing so
discovered where his limits were to be found. With no one to
witness his astonishing feats of seamanship, Slocum took comfort in
the knowledge that he had one constant companion at all times,
besides the Spray. As Slocum told it, `I sailed alone with God.'''

STATES BET ON A LEGION OF SUCKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend never plays the lottery unless the prize is over $10
million because, he says, if you win $1 million, or even a few
million more, it's not worth it. What have you got after taxes? he
asks.
</P>
<P>
   A lot more money than you had before?
</P>
<P>
   The lottery tends to cloud minds. Naturally my friend has been
buying fistfuls of Powerball tickets and has mentally spent the
$250 million he's sure he'll win, this time. He was angry when he
didn't win last week, actually angry. He took it personally.
</P>
<P>
   I almost never bet on anything because I know I'll lose. So I'm
fascinated by people who are sure they're going to win every time
they place a bet, even when they're betting on a state-run lottery,
where the odds of winning are infinitesimal.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this thinking come from? Whatever its source, it's
epidemic, and nothing, even years of losing, does much to
discourage it. Yesterday, throngs of Massachusetts residents
continued to storm the borders of neighboring states to buy
Powerball tickets, even as the executive director of the New
Hampshire Lottery _ the director of the lottery! _ was advising
bettors on Page1 of the Globe to save their money, that Powerball
is, in effect, a fool's game.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing against taking a chance. As my mother, an avid
lottery player, always says: Somebody's got to win. But when the
odds are 80 million to 1, you don't have to be a mathemetician to
figure out that it won't be you.
</P>
<P>
   Lotteries are a lousy bet. When state lotteries started up, a
lot of people assumed that they would drive the numbers game out of
business. That hasn't happened because organized crime gives
bettors much better odds than the state does. There are plenty of
seasoned gamblers who won't buy a lottery ticket because the odds
are so high. Some gamblers refuse to play the state lottery on
moral/political grounds, because they see it as a regressive tax
that moves money from poor communities, where the lottery is
popular, to richer towns, where it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has aired
radio commercials about problemgambling. I've heard two or three of
them and none of them mentions the lottery. In one a man babbles on
about how he has a sure-fire system for winning at the race track.
In another a desperate-sounding woman talks about her husband's
gambling addiction, how he spent the grocery money, how even stole
money from their kid's piggy bank to squander at the track. You
might think horse players were the only people with gambling
problems.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I should note here that I own one-10th of a racehorse,
the fabulous Fly McGrew, whose earnings currently stand at $135,
against expenses of $8,200, and rising daily, unlike my hopes for
him. But that's another story. I may be a fool, squandering my
money on horse feed, but I'm having fun, and even with that
pathetic return on my investment, I'm still doing better than I
would playing the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   I mention Fly only to make the point that I have spent some time
at Suffolk Downs and Rockingham Park. Of course there are
compulsive gamblers at the track, but there are many more people
with gambling problems playing the lottery simply because so many
more people play the lottery than the horses.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery addiction is a serious, growing problem, as a Globe
series on the Massachusetts lottery pointed out last year. Isn't it
a little hypocritical for the state to wring its hands about
problem gambling at the race track in those radio ads while
ignoring the elephant in its own living room?

HOCKEY REF STEWART WAGING HIS TOUGHEST FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Stewart has been in tough situations before.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thanksgiving night in 1979 when he came back home to Boston
for the first time as a professional hockey player to play in front
of his mother, father, and friends.
</P>
<P>
   He had a straightforward assignment from his team, the Quebec
Nordiques, who had brought him up from the minors to do a fistic
number against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time the two teams played, Robbie Ftorek (now coach
of the New Jersey Devils) had hit Bobby Schmautz in the throat with
his stick and the Bruins put out the word they were going after
Ftorek the next time they met,'' recalled Stewart. ``(Quebec)
called me up to protect Ftorek. And I was happy to do it. I would
have done anything to come home and play in Boston Garden. It had
always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart remembers walking briskly across the concourse in North
Station and meeting a surprised Bobby Miller, an old friend who was
playing for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here?'' asked Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to keep you guys off Ftorek,'' said Stewart. ``Tell
(Terry) O'Reilly to be ready to drop the gloves the first time I
come on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly obliged. Stan Jonathan obliged. Al Secord obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart battled the building and survived.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has another battle going, and surviving this one is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had cancer surgery back in June, and they took out 2 feet of
my colon,'' said Stewart, who just finished up his 14th season as a
National Hockey League referee after eight seasons as a player in
the World Hockey Association, the minors, and that NHL cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stewart is one of the best-liked guys in the hockey world.
Players like him because he is no-nonsense and can't be
intimidated. Coaches and general managers like him because they
know he will not be a homer and will call the game as he sees it,
no matter who's beefing at him or where the game is being played.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he knows, he is going to find out how tough he really is.
He hopes he will be as sturdy as he has been in
non-life-threatening situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this happens to you, your whole perspective changes,''
said Stewart, who's in the midst of ongoing chemotherapy and hopes
to return to officiating in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not angry anymore,'' he said. ``It seems I was angry my
whole life, and I don't know why. Each day I get up and look at my
wife and 5-month-old son (McCauley John Stewart), I am thankful.
Part of my rehabilitation after surgery has been listening to
motivational tapes. I don't need them anymore. I just look into my
son's face, and that's all the motivation to do what I have to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has been a horse when it comes to officating. No one has
called more games than he has, both NHL and American Hockey League,
during the regular season in the past decade. He remembers calling
more games in 1989 than anyone else in hockey _ almost 90 between
the two leagues, when the average is in the area of 60.
</P>
<P>
   Always strong, well-conditioned, and seemingly indestructible,
Stewart missed just six games in 14 seasons. ``I tore my hamstring
and had to sit out for a couple of weeks,'' he said. ``But that was
the only time I missed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart remembers feeling punk for the first time during the
NHL's Olympic break in February. ``My stomach didn't feel good,''
he recalled, ``and then I was watching TV the morning that Katie
Couric's husband died and I said to myself, `Maybe I should have
this checked out.' As it was, this saved me life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was given a series of tests, and in the beginning, there
didn't seem to be any real problem. Then a colonoscopy turned his
life upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little groggy coming out of the anesthesia, but when I
looked up, I could see the concern on the faces of the doctors,''
said Stewart. ``I told them to give it to me straight. Don't kid a
kidder. They didn't. They told me I was in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, he had the cancerous section of his colon removed.
``The doctors told me there are four stages and I was about 2
1/2,'' he said. ``I feel very lucky. A little bit longer and I
wouldn't have the chance I have now. And it's a very good chance.
I'm going to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart hopes to be back on skates in three weeks, even though
he still acknowledges being weak on his feet. He doubts he can go
to training camp with the rest of the NHL officials Sept. 10, but
he has his sights set on being ready for the opening games in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to call off the golf tournament my brother Bill and
myself run in memory of my father,'' he said. ``We hated to do it,
but my father always said when he was alive, `If you can't do
something the right way, don't to it at all.' We'll definitely be
back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul and brother Bill, without fanfare, would take the proceeds
from the tourney and purchase sporting equipment for kids
throughout Boston. This year, with some money left over from 1997,
the Stewarts are sponsoring junior golf at Franklin Park and paying
for all the equipment used by the kids in a youth hockey program,
the gear to be cleaned and refurbished by the Riddell Co. of
Somerville.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of nice things have happened,'' said Stewart. ``With the
golf tourney, some of the people told us to keep the checks (for
the tourney slated for Aug. 7), and others said they would send in
a contribution to the Bill Stewart Foundation. But something that
has really hit me is the way so many people have responded just in
the past 24 hours when the news (of the cancer) got out. One of the
first calls I got was from Vancouver from a rookie in the league
last year. I called his first game in the NHL. Now he was telling
me how concerned he was about me. I told him, `Don't worry. I'll be
back. And it won't be any easier for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, battling again, in the face of his greatest
adversity.

US'S ALEXIS CAN BE CALLED FOR TRAVELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Back in those glory days when you're kicking butt in
high school and college, you just don't see yourself bouncing
around the world. No, no, no. The only thing on your mind is the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Alexis can tell you all about it.
</P>
<P>
   He never saw himself playing in five countries. When he left
Syracuse 12 years ago, he never remotely imagined that one of the
big things on his resume would be his selection as Player of the
Year in Germany's first division. He surely never thought that he
would be spending his 34th birthday (tomorrow) representing the
United States of America in the World Basketball Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea about what was ahead of me,'' he says. ``I just
knew I wanted to play basketball. I didn't know where it was going
to take me.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken him to teams in Italy, France, Spain, Israel, and
Germany. And now it has taken him to Athens, where he is the oldest
and savviest of the 12 players Rudy Tomjanovich is trying to direct
to the very necessary gold in place of the seven- and eight-figure
NBA stars who opted out of this tournament when the Great Lockout
deteriorated in status from probable to inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   If the sport's elite choose to stay home over a dubious
principle, that is quite all right with Wendell Alexis. He is very
happy to put on the red, white, and blue uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to do something I never thought I'd
have a chance to do,'' says the 6-foot-7-inch forward. ``When I
found out that I was going to be invited to try out, my only
questions were, `When do the tryouts start, and where do I have to
go?'''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis was home in Bridgewater, N.J., when he got a call from
USA Basketball representative Jim Tooley asking him if he'd be
interested in trying out for this team. ``The first talk was of
getting a team together of ex-NBA players (Dominique Wilkins,
etc.),'' Alexis points out. ``Then I heard they were talking about
CBA and European players and I was very happy to get the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to refresh some memories: Wendell Alexis was a very
reliable four-year player for Jim Boeheim back in the early to
mid-'80s. He was one of those guys who just kept getting better,
peaking as a senior when he scored 15 points a game while shooting
54 percent from the floor. He was the team captain and MVP, and he
made the all-tournament team at the Portsmouth Invitational. The
Warriors took him in the third round, and at that point, Phase II
of the Alexis career began. He was the last man cut.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, he would keep trying and trying. He
twice went to camp with the Knicks. He went to camp with the
Pacers. He went to camp with the Clippers. He went to camp with the
76ers. By 1991, he sat himself down and delivered the sad, bad
news, the gist of which was, ``Son, they just don't want you.
Accept the fact that you are a European ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an acceptable life for the right person, and Wendell Alexis
is clearly the right person. ``It's not easy,'' he reports. ``You
come in somewhere alone. You don't know anyone. They always expect
you to carry the ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   You need patience. You need a facility for language. You need a
strong sense of self-worth, because sooner or later, you're going
to hear some ridiculous stuff from people who have no idea what
they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexis has mastered the system as well as any American ever
has. He is a mature professional, and that is why it came as no
surprise Wednesday that the game against Brazil sort of changed
direction when he entered it. He helped settle down a jumpy
American team, and before the afternoon was over, he had
contributed 13 points (on everything from driving 3-point plays to
soft 3-point shots) and eight rebounds as the US rolled to an 83-59
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy hasn't really set down a role for me,'' Alexis says. ``I
think he just wants me to come off the bench and be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis is the personification of this European- and CBA-laden
team, which must win the gold in order to save the US from the
aggravation of somehow having to qualify for the Sydney Olympics
two years up the road. ``There is a lot of individual pride here,''
Alexis explains. ``We know we're capable of winning the gold. I
think a lot of guys were taken aback by the reaction back home,
with people thinking the only team capable of doing it was the
Dream Team. A lot of guys wouldn't say so publicly, but they really
were upset. So this is a team that is going to play with a lot of
emotion and extra oomph.''
</P>
<P>
   His many triumphs haven't even made the newspapers back home.
But if the US wins the gold, people will not be able to ignore this
one. He and his teammates will have saved the USA's hide, big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider it the highlight of my career,'' Alexis says,
``but it's not going to be the end.'' Of course. The birthday in
question is 34, not 44.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Alexis is proud of his career. ``I've persevered,'' he
says. ``I've stayed determined. It would have been easy for me to
quit and take another job, but I've been able to make a living
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any team, they've all got stories. But nobody's going to
top his. Nobody on this team has paid more dues than Wendell
Alexis, and nobody deserves a gold medal more.

   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Uh-oh, thought Patriots safety Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   He had just put a licking on wide receiver Terry Glenn coming
across the middle, and on the next play, he'd done the same to
running back Sedrick Shaw breaking through the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   His blue-shirted mates on defense whooped it up. The fans
ringing the practice field came alive.
</P>
<P>
   And here came the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete came over to me in a hurry,'' Milloy said. ``I thought he
was going to get in my ear and chew me out a little bit about my
hitting. I was ready to plead my case.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to plead.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll came to praise, not upbraid. He wasn't here to give
Milloy a hard time about dumping the team's highest-profile
receiver as he chased a high pass from Drew Bledsoe. He wasn't
about to get on him about belting the guy who is scheduled to line
up as the starting halfback in Sunday's exhibition opener at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought I was coming up to dog him for being too physical,
but it was just the opposite,'' Carroll said. ``I thought that was
a tremendous indication or example of leadership on the field. One
guy with his effort and performance lit up not only our football
team but people watching practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy got them going early in Wednesday's morning session at
Bryant College.
</P>
<P>
   And just think what he might have done if he had been out of the
lineup a week or more.
</P>
<P>
   The strong safety hasn't missed a game with the Patriots and
said he was a little antsy after missing a day and a half of
practice after twisting his ankle Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a competitor, and the way I see it, when I'm sitting on
the sidelines, someone else is moving in on my position,'' Milloy
said. ``I came out here today, my first day back, and I was ready
to go out there and rock-and-roll a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   He rocked and socked.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn came through on an early play, and Bledsoe's pass was up
and the receiver never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't throw that, Drew; don't throw that, Drew,'' said Milloy
as he got back in position for the next play.
</P>
<P>
   The offense then tried a different tack. Shaw carried to the
left side, found a little running room, and Milloy quickly _ and
crunchingly _ took it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young running back with a lot of potential,'' Milloy
said. ``He broke through the hole and he was looking sweet. But in
the NFL, you're not really free untl you cross the goal line. He
was running a little high and I had a chance to make a hit on him,
and that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is his game. Last year Milloy was second on the team in
tackles with 112, behind Ted Johnson. In the postseason, he had 14
more.
</P>
<P>
   He came out of the University of Washington and was third on the
Patriots in tackles with 85 as a rookie in 1996. He started the
final 13 games of the regular season that year and the three
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, he played three years of baseball, too, and in
1995, he was in the NCAA regionals against the Georgia Tech team of
Red Sox Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek. He was drafted out of
high school and then college in baseball. The Patriots took him in
the second round in 1996, and soon he had established himself in
the secondary _ hitting running backs and receivers rather than
fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hitter,'' Milloy said. ``I love to hit. There's nothing
fancy about my game. I love to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That suits Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just played the plays full speed all out and represented
what he believes about the game,'' the coach said. ``You hit the
crud out of everything you can hit and and give great effort and be
a tough nut.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy is looking forward to hitting someone other than
teammates when the Patriots take on San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   With a full year of defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell's system
behind them and coming off a season in which the defense was
getting better and better as it ended, Milloy sees no reason that
the unit should not start at a high level this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll be flawless,'' he said. ``But we should be
somewhere close.''
</P>
<P>
   High expectations? Sure. Milloy takes the same approach to
training camp. He takes it seriously. He thinks everyone else
should, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is fighting for a position,'' he said. ``I don't care
if it's Drew Bledsoe, Lawyer Milloy, or anyone else. That's the way
they should take this. That's the only way we're going to be a
championship team.''

THE TROPICAL LOOK IS HOT, HOT, HOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer's hot look in home gardening would have been
nominated for a Bad Taste Award by most homeowners only a short
time ago. Gardens with tropical foliage plants, unruly vines, and
perennials that are bigger than you are can leave you disoriented.
So does this look really translate into a garden, or is it the set
for a theatrical production of ``Alice in Wonderland Lost in the
Rain Forest''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tropicalismo'' gardening is one term for the sudden revival of
passion for tropical plants that aren't supposed to be grown here.
Others call it ``zonal denial.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``the banana-canna garden'' by Horticulture
magazine's Nan Sinton, who told gardening professionals at the
Perennial Plant Association Symposium in Boston last month that
it's ``the newest, most exciting trend in gardening today.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's just something intrinsically fin de siecle about
cannas and coleus, whose last wave of popularity was a century ago.
Coleus varieties were the big seller this season at Avant Gardens
in North Dartmouth. ``A few years ago nobody would have a coleus in
their garden. They used to be ditzy small plants but now there's a
whole new line available that grows bigger,'' said owner Kathy
Tracey.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly bigger is better. Especially big leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Cannas, big plants with big leaves, are enjoying the biggest
career comeback since John Travolta made ``Pulp Fiction.'' Catalog
companies like White Flower Farm have suddenly found their sales of
cannas far outstripping expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Sinton, who is always on the road scoping out other people's
gardens as the director of Horticulture magazine's tours and
educational programs, said she first noticed the style in the
Northwest five years ago, where African banana trees and Tasmanian
tree ferns and ginger lilies were becoming landscape linchpins.
</P>
<P>
   Any zone-conscious local gardener's first response is going to
be, ``Well, you can't do that here!''
</P>
<P>
   But indeed you can, says Kevin Doyle, a designer whose Dover,
Mass. garden looks as lush as a Hawaiian hideaway, with a back-yard
terrace bedecked with pots of variegated oleander, black sugar
cane, tropical vines, and 8-foot palms.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle uses his new greenhouse to winter these over. But he also
grows tropical-looking plants that are hardy here, such as aralia,
a tree with thorns so sharp it's called ``the devil's walking
stick,'' and big-leafed magnolias with 16-inch flowers. Some other
tropical plants, such as cannas, dahlias, banana plants, daturas,
and brugmansias can be cut to the ground, dug up, and wintered over
in the basement, he said. Others that require lower light levels,
such as tropical hibiscus, double as houseplants in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   So, with a lot of effort, you can do it here. But why would you
want to? Doesn't a tropical look clash with the whole English
Colonial aesthetic of much of our New England landscape and
architecture?
</P>
<P>
   ``You would probably feel more comfortable designing with more
traditional plants with a Colonial style home, but if you have a
modern architectural home, bolder color and foliage go well,'' said
Tracey.
</P>
<P>
   One motivation seems to be consumer boredom with the status quo.
``For a long time everything was pink and blue and white and very
sedate,'' said Tracey. ``Last year we saw orange becoming more
popular. It's a reaction. You couldn't sell orange before.''
</P>
<P>
   If the term ``tropicalismo'' gardening sounds a bit like a
guerrilla assault, the term does challenge the traditional northern
European plant lists and design concepts that have guided the
flower gardening resurgence in New England. Tropical foliage plants
from equatorial Asia, South America, and Africa bring aesthetic
diversity to gardens while throwing out the old rule book. They are
to gardens what curry is to cuisine, what world music is to pop.
</P>
<P>
   Horticulture magazine editor Tom Cooper embraces the
vegetational giganticism of a 10-foot Canna musafolia in his
Watertown, Mass. garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of English-style borders tend to be finished by the
middle of the summer,'' Cooper explained. ``With tropical plants,
people are making gardens that are exciting throughout the summer.
It's a trend that is hitting throughout the US wherever there's
enough heat and enough creative gardeners who are becoming more
confident and less bound by the notion of making little
Sissinghursts,'' Cooper said, citing a much-visited British garden.
``England doesn't get enough heat to make a lot of these things
splashy. We do have hot summers here, so why not grow plants that
love that?''
</P>
<P>
   Shade gardeners in particular are taking notice because many
tropical plants are foliage plants that are native to forest
understories.
</P>
<P>
   Though a walk through the Doyle garden suggests an instant trip
to an exotic resort, the designer says he's motivated by his
eclectic love of plants, not a need to disguise his New England
locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 2,000 types of plant in this garden, and only
about 25 are tropical,'' Doyle said. But the addition of even a few
well-chosen tropicals has a strange way of transforming everything
around them.
</P>
<P>
   The pesty pokeweed in Doyle's front yard looks mysteriously
gothic growing next to the over-the-top white trumpets of a
tropical datura. A ho-hum apple tree invites a second look when
Spanish moss dangles from a branch. The ruby-red leaves of a tender
banana tree planted in Doyle's perennial border highlight day
lilies and phlox like a flashlight in a darkened room. When
captured by unexpected forms, the eye looks anew even on familiar
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Though Doyle maintains you don't need a greenhouse to have a
garden with a tropical flavor, winter is the bete noir for this
kind of gardening. At the end of each year, Doyle finds himself the
recipient of gift plants from people who have enjoyed them all
summer and have no idea what to do with them once Jack Frost
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   One anonymous would-be gardener even left two palms and several
poinsettias at the foot of Doyle's driveway one fall, like a litter
of abandoned kittens. Doyle still has the palms.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't want to bother wintering over tropicals can buy
new ones in the spring, giving the garden a different look each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy is to find hardy analogs, frost-proof plants
that look tropical. There are many of these.
</P>
<P>
   Since we can't winter over Portuguese Senna didymobotrya,
Westwood, Mass. designer Gary Koller suggests the northern
look-alike relative, Senna marilandica. Hibiscus moscheutos has
both the big leaves and big flowers of its tropical cousin, yet is
native to New England. Petasites Japonica is a giant-leaved
substitute for gunnera.
</P>
<P>
   Other hardy plants that look tropical, according to Koller,
include old-fashioned orange trumpet vine and kiwi vine (you might
even get some fruit). Persicaria polymorpha, now becoming a hot
perennial, is a well-behaved Japanese knotweed with a long
flowering period. Sinton has trimmed the lower branches from
cut-leaf staghorn sumac in her South Shore garden to make it
resemble a New Zealand tree fern.
</P>
<P>
   Houseplants are another resource. Koller suggests integrating
them in the garden during the summer instead of parking them in an
out-of-the-way corner of the yard, as is often done.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are not going to rip out their old rose garden and
fill it with cannas and other flashy tropicals, as English
gardening guru Christopher Lloyd did a few years ago, to the shock
of the horticultural establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more bright-orange potted cannas perched on Boston
terraces this summer. And fewer garden lovers who wince when they
see them.

NOVELIST JACQUELYN MITCHARD FINDS A SECOND HOME ON THE CAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Wis.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARWICH, Mass. _ It took novelist Jacquelyn Mitchard much longer
than she expected to find a vacation home on Cape Cod: three days.
She saw the house she wanted on the evening of the third day of
hunting and bought it the following morning.
</P>
<P>
   She likes making quick decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Such decisiveness served her well after the sudden death of her
husband in 1993. She knew she couldn't support her family of three
young boys and a stepdaughter on a freelancer's income. So she
picked herself up, headed to an artists colony and wrote the first
100 pages of ``Deep End of the Ocean'' _ her best-selling 1996
novel and Oprah Winfrey's first selection for her television book
club.
</P>
<P>
   She then decided to adopt a daughter from an agency in Texas.
Bought the house on the Cape. Is moving to a larger, six-bedroom
home in Madison, Wis., next month after her stepdaughter's wedding.
Awaits the movie premiere of ``Deep End'' in September. And has
just completed a 17-city book tour for her latest novel, ``The Most
Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as if her life wasn't busy enough, she met a man on March
13 and married him on May 13. He's 32. She's 45.
</P>
<P>
   Some may call her impulsive. But she says she's just a ``T-type
personality.'' A thrill seeker. And thrill seekers, she says, fear
tedium and boredom. But they do not fear taking risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a risk taker,'' says Mitchard, a Susan
Sarandon look-alike with more flesh on her bones. ``You can't be 40
years old and become a first-time novelist or single mother who
adopts a baby if you aren't a risk taker. My husband's early death
reinforced my beliefs _ act now, not tomorrow. And I understand
that by taking risks there's a 50/50 chance that things won't work
out. But I don't ever again want to make a decision based on fear.
An excess of caution is what douses most people's dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she bought the three-bedroom house on a cul-de-sac here
with great alacrity, she admits she did entertain the negatives.
Was it too far from Madison? Too expensive to fly her large family
to the East Coast several times a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to buy a second home, it was going to be on the
Cape or nowhere,'' says Mitchard, talking to a visitor in the
dining area of her kitchen. ``This house was the first splurge
after my book became so successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchard received $500,000 for a two-book contract with Viking
based on the 100 pages she wrote while at Ragdale, the artists
colony in Lake Forest, Ill. After its release, ``Deep End'' sat
comfortably at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for
seven months. Close to 3 million copies have been sold to date. She
got another $300,000 for the movie rights _ a film that stars
Michelle Pfeiffer, Whoopi Goldberg, and Treat Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a million-dollar jewel on the water, however, the
Cape house is a modest, compact home that Mitchard has made
virtually childproof. The kitchen/dining room and the living room
comprise the first floor _ hardwood floors, unadorned furniture, no
frills or knickknacks. There are three small bedrooms upstairs and
the boys bunk in the basement recreation room.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the interview, Mitchard's 23-year-old
stepdaughter was back home preparing for her July wedding and her
oldest boy, Robert, 14, was at camp. So that left Martin, 9, and
Dan, 11, who flew in and out of the front door and straddled the
railing of the small deck outside until Mitchard's new husband,
Chris Sornberger, took them on an adventure to the local hardware
store. Francie, 2, was being cared for by two ``assistants,'' Pam
and Kerry, who take care of the house and the kids both here and in
Madison. There are no television sets in this house so the children
rely on board games, going to the beach, reading, listening to
music, and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Cape Cod for several reasons,'' says Mitchard. ``My
best friend, who I met five years ago at Ragdale, lives in Chatham.
I chose this house because I'm only seven minutes away from Ann
(Dickinson Le Claire). I think the Cape is the most beautiful place
on earth _ I spent a summer working in Provincetown after
graduation and I loved it here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Cape, she sets aside time to write, usually in the
afternoons, at a small desk in her bedroom; back home she writes in
her office from 9 to 5. After her stepdaughter's wedding, she'll
return to the Cape for a few weeks and then come back in the fall,
after Christmas, and again in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Her children, Mitchard says, were surprised at how swiftly she
married Sornberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really knocked my children off their pins. My older boy's
comment was, `Oh sure, and hell freezes over next week.' But I
spent five years as a widow. I served my time. I'd come close to
falling in love but something always stopped me, perhaps it was my
agent's advice to always settle for more,'' says Mitchard. ``I was
certain about Chris in about one day.''
</P>
<P>
   A carpenter and landscaper, Sornberger had come to her Wisconsin
home to lay tile in a bathroom. They ended the day by talking about
books. After a week, they knew they were attracted to each other.
Two weeks after they met they knew it was more than that. Their
experience mirrors a relationship in Mitchard's new book, where a
younger, blue-collar worker revitalizes an older woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a spiritual person but it wasn't lost on me that what
was happening to me was very similar to what I wrote about in my
book,'' says Mitchard. ``Chris is the most peaceful human being
I've ever met. He balances me. He has such character and patience.
He approaches life as an art form _ every day is different. Oh my,
I'm sounding like a newlywed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchard still writes a column once a week for the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel &UR;  &LR; but has cut back on her speaking engagements,
``unless they are ridiculously lucrative,'' and essays and features
for magazines. She remains a contributing editor to Ladies Home
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't do the column for money,'' says Mitchard,
whose columns were syndicated 18 months ago and now appear in more
than 200 papers. ``The emotional demands of fiction are so great
that writing the column is like mind oxygen. Plus I don't want to
forget where I came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchard grew up in Chicago, the daughter of a plumber. She
graduated from the University of Illinois and became a newspaper
reporter for several weeklies before working for the Capital Times
in Madison. From 1984 to 1988 she was a metro reporter for the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. From 1989 to 1993 she was the speech
writer for Donna Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin
before becoming US secretary of Health and Human Services. Her
husband, Dan Allegretti, was editorial page editor of the Madison
paper before his death from colon cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that she was encouraged by writer and friend Jane
Hamilton to apply for a writing fellowship at Ragdale. That is
where she began ``Deep End.'' Both that book and her most recent
novel took shape from dreams _ the first was about a kidnapped
child and the second about a young girl who falls in love with an
older man who is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Her next book? Either ``a contemporary story about the
conversion from cynicism'' or one that ``is almost like a ghost
story.'' These days, the downside to her busy life is that she does
not have enough time for her close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends say I married Chris because I didn't have time to date
him,'' says Mitchard with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   But she has made time to come to the Cape, to her ``tribal
house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to rent it out,'' says Mitchard. ``I want it to
be here for family and friends and their children. I want everyone
to come here and relax.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Everyone, it seems, knew the secret except
the little girl. The family in Japan knew. The family in
Mississippi knew. Even the family in Puerto Rico knew. In fact, so
many people knew that it really wasn't a secret at all. Except to
the little girl.
</P>
<P>
   But the little girl grew up, eventually becoming a highly
regarded feminist and theologian who now, at the age of 48, runs
the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College. She's been a high
school cheerleader and prom queen, earned a PhD, served as a
college instructor, gotten married and divorced, and landed here as
the director of a prestigious think tank for women. But probably
nothing Rita Nakashima Brock has done has changed her self-image as
much as the document she found in a small metal box in a small
bedroom of a small house in Barstow, Calif., 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God!'' Brock remembers saying loudly as she stared at
the paper that contained the secret everyone else knew. ``I'm
adopted!''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as Brock struggles to write her memoir of that day and
what she calls the ``massive mystery'' that it revealed, she still
seems startled by the discovery that her mother's husband, the man
who had taught her how to tune the engine of a car and had taken
her fishing and camping so many times, was not her biological
father. When former US Army enlisted man Roy Grady Brock had passed
away seven years earlier, not even Rita Brock's Japanese mother,
Ayako, had whispered the secret. ``I thought my father had died
that day,'' Rita Brock recalls. ``No one at his funeral said
anything to me that would have led me to believe he wasn't my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she was dying &UR;  &LR; of cancer in 1983, Ayako Brock clearly
had a change of heart. Inside the metal box of documents she knew
that her three children would open shortly after her death, she
placed an official document headed FAMILY REGISTER. And indeed, on
the day before her mother's funeral, the 33-year-old Rita Brock
found herself staring at the typewritten piece of paper. Translated
into English from Japanese and dated July 3, 1954, it named her as
the person ``to become an adopted child of an American citizen
named Roy Grady Brock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're what?'' Rita's younger sister, Jo Ann, asked her on
that day in Barstow as they sat on their mother's bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm adopted!'' Rita Brock repeated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Brock sits in her large corner office at Radcliffe on an
early summer afternoon today, there is still a tremor of
astonishment in her voice. In a heartbeat, she recalls of that late
summer's day in 1983, she had been redefined. But as whom? There
were the practical implications of the discovery, of course,
matters such as her medical history. ``But mostly I was just very
curious,'' she recalls. ``Did my mother not know she was pregnant
when my father left her? And then maybe she couldn't find him? Or
did he know about me and disown me? Had he been disgraced? Had
there been a falling out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it was like my mother wasn't who I'd thought she was. I
mean, my image of my mother was as a rather conventional Japanese
housewife. It turns out she had this whole other life she didn't
tell us about.''
</P>
<P>
   And what to think about Roy Brock? True, father and daughter had
had a parting of the ways when the latter was in college, even
coming to blows at one point. (``I won,'' Rita Brock points out
impassively.) But the fight was a typical coming-of-age
confrontation, inflamed by the times: Offspring of a World War II
POW and Vietnam veteran becomes involved in the antiwar movement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brock clearly has a great deal of respect for her
adoptive father's accomplishments and for what he gave her. ``He
invested a lot in me,'' she says. ``He grew up in rural Mississippi
and had an eighth-grade formal education. He joined the Army,
fought in World War II, was in a Nazi POW camp, joined the Army
again, went to Japan, married my mother, and did a good job raising
me.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, she still refers to Roy Brock as ``My father.''
</P>
<P>
   But now there was another father to be found. Adopted kids often
search for years for their biological parents, chasing down false
leads and wandering through mazes that lead only to dead ends. But
a few hours after her mother's funeral, Brock not only got her
first clue to her father's identity, but also an indication of the
fact she was clearly among the last to know the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a picnic table in her mother's back yard, chatting
with an ex-GI and his Japanese wife who were old family friends,
Brock mentioned her discovery. Almost as casually, the couple
explained that they'd always known she was adopted. They told her
that her father was Puerto Rican, but that they didn't know much
more. The only thing that seemed to surprise them was the fact Rita
Brock herself hadn't known about her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean your mother didn't tell you?'' they asked
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now she had a new nationality _ ``I always knew I wasn't half
white,'' she muses today _ but not a name to go with it. That came
within weeks, when her sister found among their mother's belongings
what appeared to be a Japanese birth certificate on which three
words were written in English characters: Clemente Morales Torres.
More digging produced an address book with an entry for a Maria and
Miguel Torres in Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico. Brock wrote to the
address, but her letter was returned unopened. ``I thought my
father had died or didn't want to see me,'' she says.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Turning reform into abuse
 &HT;    (A bonus Short Takes column for use at will.)
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two U.S. Capitol cops are gunned down by a man so deranged that
it's considered in doubtful taste to mention gun control. The
responsibility for mental health care rested with the states until
the mid-1970s, when the states figured a way to get out from under.
This is one reason we have a federal government, to do things
correctly when states can't be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   The opening wedge was benign. I remember it well. The idea was
to protect the civil and legal rights of the mentally ill. Mental
health treatment should not be used as a form of law enforcement
and the mangling of sick people's rights. Sounded good to me. I
commissioned a depthy newspaper series on the legal rights of the
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   State governments were overjoyed. Return mental health care to
the local community, where it belonged, went the cry. Great idea
except it didn't happen. States closed down a raft of mental
hospitals, kicked a lot of mental patients out on the streets and
turned them into the homeless. Then they cut their state budgets.
The previously flawed system was replaced with precisely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions caught up with us the other day at the Capitol
when two cops were gunned down by an abuse posing as a reform. A
grateful Congress is naming a door for the cops.

   SWEETHEART-SCAM (Undated). Law authorities and families are
struggling to deal with so-called ``sweetheart'' scams in which
young Gypsy women find vulnerable old men, become their
sweethearts, financees or wives and clean out their bank accounts
and other assets. A Bellevue, Wash., dentist and his sister have
petitioned Thurston County, Wash., Superior Court to overturn the
will of their late father, who died at 76 after after marrying a
20-something Gypsy woman from the Steve family (the one involved in
a massive welfare fraud case). He changed his will several times,
with the final one leaving the woman something between $500,000 and
$750,000.

the book is private investigator Fay Faron, who donated nearly five
years of her life trying to bring the perps to justice. The larger
story is that Gypsy crime rings are operating across the country
with almost identical MO's. PHOTO

insensitivity to minorities and all-around bad taste? There's more

performance of Witold Gombrowicz' ``Operetta.''

`SWEETHEART SCAMS' FLEECE THE ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some lonely old men in the Tacoma, Wash., area, what seemed
like true May-December love has turned to heartbreak, leaving them
financially drained and alienated from their families.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a Bellevue, Wash., dentist is fighting to overturn
his late father's will, which left an estate worth up to three
quarters of a million dollars to a bride in Lakewood, Wash.,
roughly 50 years his junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a very generous man who was taken advantage
of,'' said Dr. Lester Peterson. ``It was so well-orchestrated, this
whole scenario. When I look back on it, it was so smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a Kentucky woman named Suzanne Cheaney says her
lovestruck elderly father, who lives in Lakewood, has been bled
financially by a family. She's furious at the lack of police
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they sit back and watch all these old people go down
the tube and not do anything?'' Cheaney said. ``As far as I'm
concerned, it's just as bad as child abuse, because these men
become like children.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say they know of about half a dozen
sweetheart scams in the Tacoma-Lakewood area in the past few years.
In each case, the elderly person was involved with a member or
members of an extended Gypsy family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been aware of those for a long time,'' said Pierce
County, Wash. Deputy Prosecutor Tom Moore, ``but we can't prove
anything because the victims willingly go along. It's been a
problem in my office for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Police Lt. Dennis Marlock, who founded an
international group called Professionals Against Confidence Crime,
said no one knows the extent of these crimes nationally.
</P>
<P>
   However, news reports on con games, especially those perpetrated
by families of Gypsies, have earned national headlines in recent
years and been featured on TV newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetheart scams _ typically nonviolent, predatory crimes _
often go unreported because of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll do what they do very quietly, very methodically, and
they'll make a lot of money in the process,'' Marlock said.
``Unless you look for it, you're not going to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle's King County, officials say most allegations of
financial elder abuse involve relatives or neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the Tacoma-Lakewood area, sweetheart scams involving
Gypsies ``just has not been something that we've seen a lot of in
King County,'' said Patrick Sainsbury, chief deputy prosecuting
attorney in the fraud division.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police detective John Lewitt, who has investigated
fortune-telling scams, noted that elder scams are an
equal-opportunity crime. ``There's scams going on by other people,
not just the Gypsies,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable to me, there's
just so much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Lester Peterson, the Bellevue dentist, he and his
half-sister, Betty Iannicelli, have filed a petition in Thurston
County Superior Court to nullify the latest in a string of wills
made by their father, Clarence L. Peterson, who died last October
at age 76.
</P>
<P>
   They also are trying to overturn their father's 1995 marriage to
a young woman named Victoria Steve, saying it was a sham union she
entered into as part of a fraudulent scheme, according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said his father's troubles began six months after his
first wife died of cancer in 1989, leaving him lonely and
distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father mentioned that he'd met somebody,'' he said, ``but
he was really unspecific about who this somebody was.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition identifies this new friend as Lisa Steve, a woman
about 40 years younger than Clarence Petersen. At one point in the
relationship, according to the petition, she stood to inherit
$100,000 from him. However, Lester Peterson's attorney said the
elder Peterson later dropped her from his will.
</P>
<P>
   After that relationship soured in 1993, the petition says, Lisa
Steve passed the elderly man on to her niece, Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Peterson says his father, who lived in Olympia, Wash.,
met Lisa at a shop or restaurant in Lakewood. Later, Peterson says,
his father moved to an apartment in Lakewood to be closer to
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   His father's final will, executed in August 1996 with a February
1997 codicil, left his Olympia home to his son William. But most of
the remainder of the estate _ which Lester Peterson values at
$500,000 to $750,000 _ was earmarked for Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   The court petition says Victoria Steve was about 25 at the time
of the marriage, never spent a night with her elderly husband and
continued to live with her parents in Lakewood.
</P>
<P>
   It also alleges that Victoria and some of her relatives
fraudulently claimed to have cancer, then persuaded Clarence
Peterson to give each of them $10,000 for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And it claims they bought several cars with the elderly man's
money, then sold them and kept the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Steve Peterson's lawyer, Dale B. Sawyer of Federal Way,
Wash., wants the petition dismissed on grounds the filing came
after the four-month statute of limitations for probate challenges.
His motion is scheduled for hearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer declined to discuss the particulars in the petition but
said, ``My client's position is there was no fraud, that it was a
valid and good marriage that was consummated.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Victoria Steve Peterson would speak with a reporter, he
said, ``I doubt she wants to be bugged at this point. Her life's
been made unpleasant enough by their inaccurate allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Lisa Steve for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The petition identifies Victoria Steve Peterson _ ``alias
Samantha Perry and Anne West''_ and Lisa Steve as members of the
Steve Gypsy family in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also notes that some of those family members are
awaiting trial in Pierce County on charges of running an organized
welfare-fraud ring. Lisa Steve and Victoria Steve Peterson were not
among those charged, and Sawyer said his client, Victoria, is being
tarred by guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Peterson said that after his father died, he and other
family members paid for a private autopsy because they suspected
foul play might have been involved in his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion of the pathology report was he had died of a
heart attack,'' Peterson said, adding that indications of
Alzheimer's disease also were found.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations in the Clarence Peterson case have similarities
to other cases familiar to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore, the Pierce County deputy prosecutor, said police
often are reluctant to pursue cases involving Gypsy suspects
because the cases are time-consuming. There's often a convoluted
paper trail and many of the suspects have multiple aliases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to pin these people down,'' he said, adding
that police tend to get discouraged after handling one or two cases
and say, ``I don't do them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Rob Floberg, of the Lakewood branch of the Pierce
County Sheriff's Department, said suspects often have a keen sense
of the limits of the law and can afford talented attorneys who can
easily outclass overworked prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any person with money can take a criminal case and stretch it
out to where it's unbearable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Floberg rationalizes that in some cases, the elderly victims are
at least getting some attention and companionship.
</P>
<P>
   He said one 84-year-old man, now bedridden and hooked up to
oxygen and a urinary catheter, had been taking his Gypsy sweetheart
out to dinner three times a week and paying her about $100 a shot
for her time. He said the man also paid for her sports car and cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he added, when the old man fell one day, his
Gypsy girlfriend helped him to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got no relatives _ nothing,'' the detective said.
</P>
<P>
   The man is now being looked after by caregivers from the
Catholic church, which will inherit his house when he dies. When
Floberg and a newspaper reporter visited him recently, the old man
said his girlfriend is now out of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped her about six months ago,'' he said weakly.
</P>
<P>
   But some old men cling to the relationships despite warnings
from relatives and police. That's the case with 88-year-old
Theodore Newell of Lakewood.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Newell's daughter, Suzanne Cheaney, flew from
her home in Louisville, Ky., in hope of ending Newell's
relationship with a local Gypsy family. She and her sister, Judith
Conway of Portland, Ore., have stuck a For Sale sign on his home,
which they legally own. They hope to persuade him to move out of
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney said her father was first approached by a young woman
named Lisa Marie Stevens at a local supermarket around Thanksgiving
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy talks to everybody, like a lot of old people do,'' she
said. ``They were talking about turkeys, and one thing led to
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney said she and her family tried to warn Newell away from
his new friend. But she said her father, a retired teacher,
replied, ``She doesn't know how to read and write and I'm going to
teach her.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, 1996, Newell married Lisa Marie Stevens in Washoe
County, Nev. Four months later, at the urging of his daughters, he
filed a petition in Pierce County Superior Court asking to have the
marriage declared invalid. The petition said Newell was
fraudulently induced to marry Lisa Marie Stevens and that the
couple had never lived together.
</P>
<P>
   Newell's attorney, Gary Wallis, says he told the court in oral
arguments that Lisa Marie had drained Newell financially. He says
he never had an exact accounting but he believes Newell's loss
exceeded $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis also says he told the court that Lisa Marie ``had no
intention of consumating the marriage and basically married him to
take advantage of an old man financially.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, 1997, the court overturned the marriage in a default
judgment. The court said Lisa Marie had committed fraud against
Newell's personal property and in inducing him to marry her.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Marie was not present at the 10-minute proceeding. Earlier,
she had filed a handwritten response in which she denied everything
in the petition _ including matters of fact, such as names,
addresses, date of marriage and the lack of dependent children in
the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Her handwritten note said, ``I dont want a Divorce. I am very
much in love with my husband and I feel I need him very much, so
for my sake (and) his dont grant this decree. Reason for this
request is We have changed our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Newell's family told police that Lisa Marie had claimed to have
ovarian cancer and said the only doctor who could treat her was in
Las Vegas. Newell paid for air fare to Las Vegas, plus food and
hotel charges, for Lisa Marie and four others, according to a
police report based on conversations with Newell and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney said her father's new friends also took out a
half-million-dollar insurance policy on his life, but the paperwork
was returned, she said, because it ``wasn't up to snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month Cheaney and her sister secured a new, unlisted
phone number for their father, but they still worry that he'll be
talked into giving it out, as he has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Newell says he hasn't seen his Gypsy friends lately and doesn't
know where they are.
</P>
<P>
   With his two dogs nestled by his side, the old man vowed
recently that he was through with Lisa Marie and her family,
especially since his credit card bill for June _ a year after the
marriage was overturned _ showed the unauthorized purchase of six
airline tickets, including one in the name of Lisa Newell.
</P>
<P>
   Conway is dubious that her father will make a complete split
from the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really believes that he's in love with this girl,'' she
said. ``Every time we say anything about her, he protects her. When
we were (visiting him), he got real upset. He said he was tired of
us snooping into his business. We gave him an ultimatum _ the
Gypsies or us.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking slowly and heavily, Newell said he isn't sure anymore
what to think about Lisa Marie and her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're friends or enemies,'' he said
gloomily. ``Sometimes I wonder.''

`EVER AFTER' DOESN'T LACK AUDACITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one thing you can say about ``Ever After,'' the movies'
latest and umpteenth retelling of the Cinderella story, is that
it's not lacking in audacity.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it strip the story of its magical elements and
rework the character into a take-charge feminist, it casts the
dramatically questionable Drew Barrymore in the part, and throws in
Leonardo da Vinci as the Fairy Godmother figure.
</P>
<P>
   It's so bizarre that it almost works, though a grumpy critic
could certainly have a field day with it, and especially with the
performance of Barrymore, who often seems to doing ``Scream 3'' and
speaks throughout with a glaringly fake English accent, even though
the story is set in France.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a prologue in which an aged French countess
(Jeanne Moreau) calls the Brothers Grimm to her chateau and takes
them to task for getting the Cinderella story all wrong. Producing
a glass-studded slipper, she tells them it's a true story, and she
wants ``to set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to a few hundred years earlier, and we met Danielle
(Barrymore), whose happy life with her beloved father (Jeroen
Krabbe) comes to a halt when he remarries a countess (Anjelica
Huston) with two daughters, and promptly drops dead of a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle becomes a servant in her own house, and the rest of the
movie follows the outline of the myth, except that this Cinderella
is both rebellious and highly capable, the prince falls in love
with her keen mind more than her buxom beauty, and the visiting Da
Vinci plays cupid.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, obviously, was to modernize the myth for modern
audiences, removing what feminists have long charged is an
abhorrent central theme (that women should wait around for a Prince
Charming to come along and change their lives for the better) and
otherwise portraying the cardboard characters as more recognizable
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one appears to have told Anjelica Huston what was
going on in the humanizing of characters department, because she
plays the Evil Stepmother with nostrils flaring and no holds
barred. She's such a portrait of menopausal meanness that she makes
Glenn Close's recent turn as Cruella De Vil look like Melanie
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's hard to ever know for sure when this film is being
deliberately tongue-in-cheek and when it's being straight.
Barrymore is so contemporary in manner and the script is so
littered with modernisms (``Un-bee-lieveable!'' Danielle exclaims
at one point of frustration) that it often plays more like a
``Airplane!''-style parody of ``Cinderella'' than an affectionate
re-interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Ever After. Directed by Andy Tennant. Screenplay by Susannah
Grant, Tennant and Rick Parks. Cast: Drew Barrymore, Anjelica
Huston, Dougray Scott. 20th Century-Fox. 121 minutes. Rated PG-13
for no obvious reason.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rigor mortis had already set in when 83-year-old Hope Victoria
Beesley was found dead in her bed, apparently of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The irascible San Francisco dowager looked both eerie and
pathetic _ eyes open, scalp naked without its wig, arm pointed
defiantly toward the ceiling in a clenched-fist salute.
</P>
<P>
   Her death left a number of loose ends _ one being private eye
Fay Faron of the Rat Dog Dick Detective Agency.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Beesley's attorney had hired Faron to trace a
handyman named Danny Tene, who abruptly disappeared after allegedly
sweet-talking his way into co-ownership of Beesley's
half-million-dollar home.
</P>
<P>
   With Beesley dead, the case was moot. But Faron, nicknamed ``Rat
Dog'' for her persistence as an investigator, couldn't stop
wondering ... Who was this Danny Tene?
</P>
<P>
   Thus began Faron's five-year quest to halt a byzantine series of
alleged ``sweetheart scams'' against the elderly _ an old game that
may have taken a murderous twist within one Gypsy family suspected
of poisoning its ``clients.''
</P>
<P>
   While Faron was tailing suspects in her neon-green junker called
the Frog Prince, crime journalist Jack Olsen was tailing her. The
Bainbridge Island writer, an Edgar Award-winner, knew he had a
great story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw right away,'' said Olsen, 73, words spilling out
rapid-fire in his enthusiasm. ``The combination of Gypsies and Rat
Dog _ holy moley! My kid could have written it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is detailed in Olsen's newest true-crime saga,
``Hastened to the Grave: The Gypsy Murder Investigation'' (St.
Martin's Press, 276 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Tene and others were suspected of cozying up to elderly people
and bleeding them dry financially. In some cases their deaths may
have been hastened by sprinkling their food with the heart medicine
digitalis, which can be fatal in high doses, producing what appears
to be a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust cleared, the bodies of four alleged victims had
been exhumed and tested for traces of digitalis. Beesley's remains
were not tested, however. She had already been cremated, with the
ashes and bone fragments scattered at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Last November four suspects were indicted on charges of
conspiracy to commit murder. Danny Tene (pronounced ``TEE-ney'')
faced lesser charges of grand theft and stealing from a dependent
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen says most of the suspects, who are awaiting trial, are
relatives of the Tene Bimbo family featured in Peter Maas' 1975
book, ``King of the Gypsies.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's book grew out of a Vanity Fair story that ran in May.
The article was greeted by protesters outside Vanity Fair's New
York office, who distributed fliers headlined: ``Vanity Fair! Stop
`Gypsy' bashing!!!'' Over a photo of Gypsies in a Nazi
concentration camp were the boldfaced words, ``We will not be
gassed again!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Auntie's bookstore in Spokane hired security
last month after being warned that a prominent local Gypsy planned
to attend Olsen's book signing and be ``in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Olsen defused the protest by reading passages
detailing the Gypsies' long history of persecution. According to a
newspaper account, it was enough to wring tears from his would-be
antagonist. Olsen said they later had a few friendly drinks
together.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, a New York Times review of his book
accuses Olsen of too much ethnic sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly reminded that Gypsies are an oppressed
people,'' wrote critic Judith Newman. ``Olsen sometimes feels
compelled to equivocate by making politically correct excuses for
their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's book describes Gypsies, or Rom, as descendants of a
nomadic people in the Punjab region of India who left their
homeland around 1,000 A.D. and faced discrimination and cruelty
wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen has been informed that Gypsies unhappy with the book have
placed a curse, or ramya, on him. He laughs it off. ``I do know
that I bought a lottery ticket and didn't win, so it's working
already,'' he said. ``If you take these things seriously, you'll
never get any work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen may chortle about the curse, but he's dead serious about
the skulduggery detailed in ``Hastened to the Grave.'' No one could
dream up a case this complex and bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the least imagination of anybody I've ever met,'' Olsen
said. ``That's why I write non-fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero is Faron, a sweet-but-spunky private eye whose previous
careers include driving an ice-cream truck, filming a travelogue on
the River Kwai and selling vacuum cleaners in a part of Appalachia
without electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's by far the most fascinating character I've ever written
about _ bar none,'' said Olsen. ``She's also just about the most
noble person I've ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Faron, 49, who donated five years of unpaid labor to the case,
said she was motivated by a desire for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elders have been discovered as the perfect victims,'' said
Faron, who flew to Seattle recently to discuss the a local TV
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're piggy banks walking around waiting to be smashed.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Faron founded a non-profit advocacy group called
ElderAngels in an effort to prevent such scams. She said Olsen's
book has given her the clout to lobby for legal change and has
alerted the public to similar cons around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's important,'' Faron said, ``is we're hearing
from people all over the United States. The suspects are different
from here but the M.O. is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the elderly are prey to all kinds of cons, the
sweetheart scam is especially cruel and lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sweetheart scam is the lottery,'' Faron said. ``When you
do a sweetheart scam, you can get half a million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Hastened to the Grave'' spotlights a case involving one
family, it also suggests there's a well-entrenched criminal
subculture within the Gypsy community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Gypsy mafia and it's all over the country and it's
just as together as the Italian Mafia ever was,'' Olsen said.
``They have their own territories, just like the Mafia. They have
safe houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's comment is seconded by Lt. Dennis Marlock of the
Milwaukee Police Department, who founded an international group
called Professionals Against Confidence Crime. Marlock, who has
worked with the Gypsy community for 30 years, is author of a 1994
book, ``License to Steal: The Traveling Con Artist'' (Paladin
Press, 403 pages, $30).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's organized crime _ bottom line,'' Marlock said, adding
that most of the crimes are non-violent. ``It's a
multibillion-dollar enterprise. They're so cocky. For so many years
they have gone unchallenged and there's no serious law-enforcement
attempt to stop them from doing what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlock noted that there are many honest Romani people who don't
have ties with the criminal subculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to the Sicilian Mafia in the sense that all Mafia
members are Sicilian, but not all Sicilians are criminals,''
Marlock said. ``It's identical with the Gypsies.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said San Francisco police ignored evidence and dragged
their feet on the case detailed in his book, resulting in
interdepartmental charges. Given the alleged missteps by police,
Olsen said, ``I don't think the case is going to be won. It's
probably going to die on a technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the elderly are sitting ducks for financial schemers
of all stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A doddering 90-year-old man is every bit as vulnerable as a
5-year-old child,'' Olsen said. ``The only difference is the
90-year-old man has an estate.''

`EVERY LITTLE THING' IS A BIT LIKE WATCHING GRASS GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Every Little Thing,'' the new film by noted French
documentarian Nicolas Philibert (``In the Land of the Deaf''), is
set in La Borde, a stunning chateau in the Loire Valley that was
converted into a minimum security mental institution back in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   His camera is a roving fly-on-the-wall as the staff and inmates
of the institution go through a laborious rehearsal process and
finally perform their annual musical revue for 1995, a performance
of Witold Gombrowicz' ``Operetta.''
</P>
<P>
   If the viewer is very, very patient, the film modestly pays off
by ultimately communicating some of the sense of pride and
self-worth the patients get from having a focus, and engaging in a
creative act. We also gradually feel some of the sense of community
both the patients and the staff achieve in this unique environment.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of this worthy movie is a bit like watching
the grass grow. Philibert's camera lingers endlessly on people and
scenes that never seem particularly interesting, significant or in
any way revealing: a man walking across the lawn, a woman
struggling to memorize a song, a cat sitting at the side of the
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   We never really get to know any of these characters on a
personal level, never know what their particular problems are, and
never learn the answers to any of the natural questions that arise.
Such as: who pays to incarcerate these handicapped people in this
Five Star Loire Valley chateau without bars? And where do you sign
up?
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it stubbornly refuses to ``tell'' its audience anything
about what it's seeing along the way, apparently relying on
reviewers who've read the press notes to inform viewers where and
what the institution is, how it operates, just what is going on
with this rehearsal and play, and even what the title means.
</P>
<P>
   (According to the notes: When asked to explain the unique brand
of ``institutional psychotherapy'' practiced at La Borde, the
institution's founder, Jean Oury, replied that it is not a
punishment: it is ``every little thing.'' If that makes any sense
to you.)
</P>
<P>
   Philibert had much more success using his enigmatic, stand-back
method with his multi-award-winning 1992 documentary, ``In the Land
of the Deaf,'' an extremely touching journey into the world of the
deaf. This film will also be playing at the Grand Illusion as a
double-bill with ``Every Little Thing'' through Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Every Little Thing. Directed by Nicolas Philibert. Photographed
by Philibert and Katell Djian. Documentary. International Film
Circuit. Grand Illusion Cinema. In French with English subtitles.
105 minutes. Unrated.

   SWEETHEART-SCAM (Undated). Law authorities and families are
struggling to deal with so-called ``sweetheart'' scams in which
young Gypsy women find vulnerable old men, become their
sweethearts, financees or wives and clean out their bank accounts
and other assets. A Bellevue, Wash., dentist and his sister have
petitioned Thurston County, Wash., Superior Court to overturn the
will of their late father, who died at 76 after after marrying a
20-something Gypsy woman from the Steve family (the one involved in
a massive welfare fraud case). He changed his will several times,
with the final one leaving the woman something between $500,000 and
$750,000.

`POLISH WEDDING' WASTES A GOOD CAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good cast is wasted in ``Polish Wedding,'' the latest
low-budget American indie to try _ and fail _ to come up with that
same distinct mixture of ethnic charm, whimsical characters and
subtle romance as 1987's ``Moonstruck.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting is Hamtramck, the working-class, Polish American
community of Detroit, which is depicted in the film as much more
than just another Motown neighborhood, rather as literally a
self-contained Polish village within the huge American city.
</P>
<P>
   The Pzoniak family is led by its matriarch, the hot-blooded and
beautiful Jadzia (Lena Olin), who works as a cleaning woman by day
and spends many of her evenings having clandestine assignations
with her wealthy businessman lover (Rade Serbedzija).
</P>
<P>
   Her patient, long-suffering husband, Kris (Gabriel Byrne), is a
baker who looks the other way at his wife's persistent infidelity
and apparent lack of respect for him, and mopes through his days
muttering bits of philosophy and chain-smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Jadzia also has four sons and an equally hot-blooded teenage
daughter, Hala (Claire Danes), who has dropped out of high school,
spends her days taking care of her older brother's baby, and is
having her own sexual affair with a rookie cop (Adam Trese).
</P>
<P>
   The ambience and the ethnic eccentricities of these characters
are presumably highly authentic, since the film's writer-director,
Theresa Connelly, grew up in the same Detroit neighborhood where
the film was shot, and hails from a family much like this one.
</P>
<P>
   And presumably her script makes a remarkably good read, since it
won her the financial and moral support of the prestigious Sundance
Institute, attracted an impressive cast, and earned her a shot at
directing _ no small feat for a first script.
</P>
<P>
   But _ even though Olin and Danes each sparkle in several of
their scenes _ the elements don't add up to anything especially
interesting, charming, humorous or believable. Like so many in
today's glut of mediocre independent films, this one simply never
clicks into place.
</P>
<P>
   Polish Wedding. Directed and written by Theresa Connelly. Cast:
Lena Olin, Claire Danes, Gabriel Byrne, Adam Trese. Fox
Searchlight. Seven Gables. 101 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual
situations.

DREW-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ Drew Barrymore certainly didn't have a
fairy tale childhood. But she knows a thing or two about happy
endings and that made her a pretty good choice to play Cinderella
in ``Ever After,'' a charming, romantic update of the the classic
children's story. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
FESTIVAL-FILM (Los Angeles) _ So many films, so little time. UCLA
Film and Television Archive's annual Festival of Preservation,
which opens Saturday night, not only brings to light the artful
restoration of reels, but also exhibits some notable films that
haven't been seen in a long while _ at least not like this. By Bob
McCarthy. 
. 
BASEKETBALL-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``BASEketball'' gives us
vulgarity without any biting wit. The generational comic graft
simply doesn't work, although the movie isn't without some funny
moments. But, it's all geared toward 17-year-old adolescents or
guys who shop for bed linens at the ESPN Store and don't believe
you can have TOO MANY shots of people getting kicked in the groin.
2 Stars. By Glenn Whipp.

GOVERNESS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``The Governess,'' a sensuous,
visually astute British period piece, uses a Jewish woman's
deception to secure her a job in a Scottish household as a central
motif for a story about people who are not what they seem. And it
gives Minnie Driver the opportunity to break out of supportive
girlfriend purgatory. 3 Stars. Bob Strauss. 
. 
JOURNEY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Portugal's world-class director
Manoel de Oliveira reflects on his life and the search for home in
this melancholy, charming film ``Voyage to the Beginning of the
World,'' with the great Marcello Mastroianni in his last movie
appearance. 3{ Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
EVER-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Ever After'' is a Cinderella story
minus the fairy tale trappings but drenched in '90s style romantic
fantasy. A set of natural, witty performances complement the
illusion of realism created by director Andy Tennant and his
first-class design team. 3 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
PRESENT-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Garry Essendine, the bad-boy hero of
Noel Coward's ``Present Laughter,'' is a good example of what today
we'd call the Peter Pan syndrome. Handsome, charming, effortlessly
witty and on the wrong side of 40, he's a West End idol and
man-about-London who'd just as soon never grow up. By Reed
Johnson. 
. 
COHEN-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Some say Adam Cohen only got his record
deal because he's the son of rock icon and poet Leonard Cohen.
Surprisingly, though, the 25-year-old Cohen doesn't really mind
that perception. ``You don't get a record deal until the company
feels it can make a buck off you,'' he said. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ It's hard to believe Atlanta-born r&AMP;b diva
N'dea Davenport has just released her first solo album. That's
because Davenport's voice is so familiar. As a session singer, she
collaborated with everyone from Natalie Merchant to Malcolm McLaren
to hip-hop icon Guru. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC _ Yes, we know ``Backstreet Boys'' has been on the
charts for a year. But that's no reason why we can't take a second
look, especially since this Florida r&AMP;b harmony quintet's
self-titled debut just rocketed straight back into the top 10. By

   BACKSTREET BOYS/``Backstreet Boys'' (Jive)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we know it's been on the charts for a year. But that's no
reason why we can't take a second look, especially since this
Florida r&AMP;b harmony quintet's self-titled debut just rocketed
straight back into the top 10. It's state-of-the-art stuff, full of
first-class, well-produced material that ranges from solid funk to
sturdy ballads and soulful hip-hop cuts. Best moments here are
numerous, including ``Quit Playing Games (With My Heart),'' ``We've
Got It Goin' On,'' ``All I Have to Give,'' the uplifting current
smash ``Everybody (Backstreet's Back)'' and a wonderful cover of PM
Dawn's ``Set Adrift on Memory Bliss.'' Backstreet Boys will be
around for a while. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
KANE &AMP; ABEL/``Am I My Brothers Keeper'' (No Limit/Priority)
</P>
<P>
   Rap mogul Master P has never made a good album and all his CD
covers look the same. Yet, he keeps churning 'em out under his or
other names and they inexplicably sell millions. This one, full of
the usual shoot-'em-up scenerios and predictable odes to the hood,
resembles everything else on the label, which follows a strict but
terribly dull gangsta-rap formula. Cameos from new signing Snoop
Dogg don't help matters. True to form, the album recently reached
No. 5. Who buys these things? 1 Star. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUBLIME/``Stand by Your Van _ Live'' (Gasoline Alley/MCA)
</P>
<P>
   As the Sublime trough runs dry, here's the dreaded and sometimes
even dreadful live album, recorded almost entirely at a 1994 date.
While the Sublime record to get is still ``40 Oz. to Freedom,''
this disc has a couple of reasons to exist, such as the tracks
``Poolshark'' and ``DJs.'' On the whole, however, avoid it unless
you're a fan, completist or bug collector. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHERRY POPPIN' DADDIES/``Zoot Suit Riot'' (Mojo)
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's Daddies insist they don't do retro even though the band
plays horn-fueled swing and jump blues in the style of Cab Calloway
and Louis Jordan. This 14-track collection compiles the best of the
group's three previous indie releases and adds four new songs,
including the title song which is a staple at radio stations like
KROQ. It's a thoroughly entertaining disc that benefits from loads
of extra players who stretch the band's horn section to almost a
cast of thousands. The familiar ``Zoot Suit Riot'' isn't the only
good cut here by any means. Other strong swingers: ``Master and
Slave,'' ``Dr. Bones'' and ``Brown Derby Jump.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
QUEEN LATIFAH/``Order in the Court'' (Motown)
</P>
<P>
   Although she divides her time between acting and making music,
the Queen hasn't lost her microphone or street smarts. This bold
new release features the sort of raps that made her famous almost
10 years ago and she even tries singing with mixed results on a
couple of tracks. She's best on the strong hip-hop cuts such as
``Bananas (Who You Gonna Call?)'' and the perfectly realized old
school/new school hybrid ``Paper.'' 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ETTA JAMES/``Life, Love &AMP; the Blues'' (Private)
</P>
<P>
   The title sums it all up. Etta's best album in ages offers a
wealth of pungent blues and convincing Southern soul gems,
including marvelous covers of the late Johnny ``Guitar'' Watson's
``I Want to Ta Ta You, Baby,'' Al Green's ``Here I Am (Come and
Take Me),'' Willie Dixon's ``Spoonful'' and Marvin Gaye's ``Inner
City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)'' with Leo Nocentelli from the
Meters on guitar. The best cut here is also the most obscure _
Perry Jordan's ``Running Out of Lies'' _ but the entire album is
worth investigating. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUNTRACK/``Saving Private Ryan'' (DreamWorks)
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual approach to the use of music in film, the first
notes heard during this movie come some 15 minutes into the
narrative. Oscar-winning composer John Williams' lyrical score,
recorded by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is sweeping and grand
but also ominous in places. Taken apart from the film, the mood
here is reflective, even during segments featuring the Tanglewood
Festival Chorus, one of the country's most renowned vocal
ensembles. Clearly one of Williams' most memorable works. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUNDTRACK/``BASEketball'' (Mojo)
</P>
<P>
   Fans of slacker-rock and ska-punk can chalk up another winner in
this 13-track sampler tied to the current comedy about a fictional
sport which combines baseball and basketball. The best tracks
include Cherry Poppin' Daddies' cover of Harry Belafonte's ``Jump
in the Line,'' the Supersuckers' ``Psyched Out'' and, best of all,
Plastiscene's ``Lemon Yellow.'' Ultimately, the soundtrack is
bogged down by less-than-stellar offerings from Reel Big Fish,
Goldfinger and Smash Mouth. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NICHOLAS PAYTON/``Payton's Place'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Payton's best work has come with challenge. Last year's
collaboration with the late Doc Cheatam was marvelous, as was his
trio recording with Christian McBride and Mark Whitfield that
celebrated the music of Herbie Hancock. Here he shines with fellow
trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Wynton Marsalis on a swinging ``The
Three Trumpeters'' and with saxophonist Joshua Redman on the
energetic ``A Touch of Silver.'' Elsewhere, Patyon plays with his
regular quintet on his compositions that loosely tie together funk,
blues and swing with occasionally memorable results. 2{ Stars. _
Glenn Whipp &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ELIANE ELIAS/``Sings Jobim'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Elias has been paying tribute to fellow Brazilian Jobim
throughout her career, frequently playing his songs in concert and
on albums. This is her second album completely devoted to the
brilliant composer's music, and although the results are pleasant
enough, they won't make you forget the brilliant source material.
Elias uses her voice more or less as another instrument to deliver
the melody. She's limited in range, much like ``Ipanema''
standard-bearer Astrud Gilberto. But unlike Gilberto, Elias'
singing never manages to be memorable. But her piano work does do
justice to Jobim's incomparable melodies, making this a worthwhile
disc for bossa nova diehards. 2{ Stars. _ Glenn Whipp &QL;

DAD ASIDE, IT'S ADAM'S TURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some say Adam Cohen only got his record deal
because he's the son of rock icon and poet Leonard Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though, the 25-year-old Cohen doesn't really mind
that perception. In fact, he's thankful for any attention paid to
his music, regardless of the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a record deal until the company feels it can
make a buck off you,'' he said. ``The fact that I am who I am has
definitely raised an eyebrow, but I've benefited from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The well-mannered, thoughtful Cohen is as comfortable talking
about his dad as he is discussing the Greek islands, one of several
places _ along with Canada and France _ where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's self-titled debut was released this week by Columbia,
his father's longtime label. The disc was produced by Leonard Cohen
producer Steve Lindsay, with backing from high-profile session
musicians such as guitarists Dean Parks and David Baerwald, bassist
Larry Klein, and drummers Jim Keltner and Matt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always taught to be suspicious of the record company,
but the label you end up knowing the most about is the one you hear
the most about from your pops,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen co-wrote all of the album's 12 tracks, including six with
Phil Roy and three with Tonio K. The material ranges from the
catchy pop of ``Tell Me Everything'' to the sweet ballad
``Beautiful as You'' and the bitter ``Quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Corson, Columbia's senior vice president of marketing, says
Cohen is an artist in his own right, despite his background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone that says he got signed because of his dad hasn't heard
the record or seen him perform,'' Corson said from New York. ``He's
a musician and personality. As people get to know him, they'll find
he exceeds expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cohen isn't shy about discussing his father's
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's given me a high standard by which to live,'' Cohen said.
``I've definitely inherited his sensibility. He's given me so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to Los Angeles, Cohen fronted a band in New York
with Chris Stills, son of Stephen Stills. Other friends include
Rufus Wainwright, son of Loudon, and Teddy Thompson, son of
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music business today is frightening,'' Cohen said.
``There's a real battle between art and commerce that's being lost.
It's tough to battle commerce because it's the instrument by which
art gets discovered these days. I'm trying to infuse a commercial
sensibility to my music while at the same time not compromising.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was primarily raised by his mom, Suzanne Elrod, pictured
on the cover of Leonard Cohen's 1977 album, ``Death of a Ladies
Man.'' Yet, the younger Cohen says his father made an effort to
spend time with him.
</P>
<P>
   As for the spate of recent articles lumping together the newly
signed sons and daughters of rock icons, Cohen says it also doesn't
bother him much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK with me,'' he said. ``By putting us all together, it
almost sets up a tone of solidarity that I'm not averse to at all.
To resist is to fuel people's intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Jakob Dylan's disinterest in speaking about his father is
the main catalyst for people wanting to speak exclusively about
that.''

A COWARD-LY PETER PAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Garry Essendine, the bad-boy hero of Noel
Coward's ``Present Laughter,'' is a good example of what today we'd
call the Peter Pan syndrome. Handsome, charming, effortlessly witty
and on the wrong side of 40, he's a West End idol and
man-about-London who'd just as soon never grow up.
</P>
<P>
   So he hides behind his suave stage persona. He keeps dangerous
emotions at bay by affecting a world-weary, self-dramatizing
attitude. When friends or his ex-wife drop by his London studio,
they usually find Garry in a silk smoking jacket, tickling the
ivories or fixing a drink, his latest nubile conquest stashed
safely away in a spare bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he's acting _ which is always _ Garry can be the star
of his life, reciting his own best lines to a supporting cast of
co-dependents that includes his astute ex-wife Liz, his blustery
business associates, a faithful Cockney valet and a chain-smoking
housekeeper with a bent for spiritualism.
</P>
<P>
   Garry, of course, is Coward's midlife self-portrait (or maybe
Hugh Hefner's airbrushed one). And as played by Robert Curtis Brown
at the Pasadena Playhouse it's a portrait of a lively, engaging
fellow, though not quite the irresistibly rakish bon vivant Coward
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty with this role is that while Garry is constantly
performing, the actor playing him somehow needs to let the mask
slip now and then so we can glimpse the real man underneath. Brown
finds a certain wistful melancholy and a dash of anger behind
Garry's coolly amusing facade, but not much of genuine emotional
insight.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, director Richard Seyd's production offers a pleasant
summer divertissement with no particular edge _ a wine cooler
instead of a full head of champagne. While one recent,
controversial New York production of ``Present Laughter'' attempted
to spice things up by ``outing'' Garry _ and, by implication, the
famously closeted Coward _ Seyd prefers to play things straight, so
to speak. He emphasizes the play's farcical side, an approach that
works rippingly well in the Act 2 scene in which various ingenues,
cuckolded husbands and jealous lovers converge on Garry's studio in
a door-slamming frenzy of romantic recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   It's less effective in providing an emotional context for
Coward's droll ripostes, which here too often come across as mere
icy put-downs. Actors gesticulate, wag fingers at each other and
leap onto furniture to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   But these antics, combined with several wobbly British accents,
prove more distracting than fun. The first place Seyd needs to turn
down the volume is Scott Lowell, who tears up the stage in the role
of a ``serious'' playwright who comes to berate Garry for selling
out, then ends by fawning all over him.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the supporting cast are Keith Langsdale, as Garry's
flustered, straight-man manager Morris, and Kaitlin Hopkins, whose
performance as the wickedly seductive Joanna puts some much needed
bite into this fizzy affair.

`A SERIOUS LABOR OF LOVE' FOR HEAVIES' DAVENPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's hard to believe Atlanta-born r&AMP;b diva N'dea
Davenport has just released her first solo album.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Davenport's voice is so familiar. As a session
singer, she collaborated with everyone from Natalie Merchant to
Malcolm McLaren to hip-hop icon Guru.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, as featured vocalist with the funky British
combo the Brand New Heavies, she cut four albums and helped usher
in the retro-soul era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was giving so much to everybody else, I forgot to give to
me,'' said Davenport, whose self-titled album was just issued on
the V2/Delicious Vinyl label.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport wrote and produced all the disc's tracks with the
exception of four cuts produced by hitmaker Dallas Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the suggestion of Daniel Lanois, I produced myself since I
wanted to go into production,'' Davenport said from her home in New
Orleans. ``It was a serious labor of love with lots of ups and
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport recorded in such locales as North Louisiana and
Oxnard, where Lanois owns a studio in a converted theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person who likes to do things nontraditionally, from how
I dress to how I make my music,'' Davenport said. ``So, it made
sense that I make my album in an environment that was very
comfortable and natural.''
</P>
<P>
   MANSON DEFECTOR: Guitarist Zim Zum says he left Marilyn Manson
last week on good terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the realization that if I was going to do everything
I wanted to do, there was no better time than now to step away,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-bred Zim Zum (he won't give his real name) played on
the majority of tracks on Manson's forthcoming album, ``Mechanical
Animals,'' due Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was handled as professionally as could be,'' the guitarist
said. ``We sat down and talked about it, and Marilyn understood
that maybe everyone in the band will get to this point sooner or
later. I left on good terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Zim Zum, who lives in Hollywood with Manson keyboardist Pogo,
plans to produce tracks for others, record a solo album and put a
band together.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old guitarist said he was thankful to all the fans
he met during his two years with Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very positive about this decision,'' he said. ``It's
far from over, and I'll see you all very soon.''

CURTAIN CALL FOR UCLA FILM PRESERVATIONISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So many films, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lament of the film preservationist who races against
time, corrosion and the chemicals in the reels themselves as he
labors to save remnants of this 20th-century art form. The men and
women committed to this endeavor are technicians, film lovers and
detectives all rolled into one. Because to restore a film, you have
to track down an original first.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA Film and Television Archive's annual Festival of
Preservation, which opens Saturday night, not only brings to light
the restorative work being done by the archivists but also some
titles that haven't been seen in a long while or at all. Others are
recognized classics. What all have in common is they'll be seen
again as they were the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A film restorer strives to become invisible _ to find original
footage of such impeccably high quality and to use the arts and
sciences of film preservation so effectively that it seems as if a
work from the distant past has been passed on to the present
untouched by human hands,'' writes Robert Rosen, director of the
UCLA Film and Television Archive.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, American audiences will view ``Joan of Arc''
in its original cut for the first time in 50 years. Disapproval of
co-stars Ingrid Bergman and Jose Ferrer's affair tainted this
controversial 1948 production that led to a recut. That version
reduced Ferrer's dynamic performance and downplayed the trial,
adding narration and a chorus of angels in its place.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation festival runs through August, and 35 films will
be presented. They run the gamut from newsreels to animation,
television specials to Spanish-language feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   ``LOST HORIZON'' _ From a preservationist's standpoint, Frank
Capra's 1937 story of paradise found presented its own challenges.
The director's cut ran six hours and was shortened with each
re-release. Also, seven minutes cut in the late 1930s were not
retrieved, so stills now take their place in the restored version;
7:30 p.m. Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FRESHMAN'' _ Harold Lloyd goes off to college to become
the Big Man on Campus and becomes the tackling dummy for the
football team instead in this 1925 satire that showcased Lloyd's
comedy skills; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``MACBETH'' _ Orson Welles downsized in this 1948 production in
exchange for autonomy from studio meddling. Working for the smaller
Republic Pictures, he employed simple, rough sets that ``convey a
primitive, dreamlike strangeness'' that serves Welles'
interpretation of this Shakespeare classic; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``WORKING GIRLS'' _ Director Dorothy Arzner puts two Indiana
sisters in the Big Apple, tosses out sexual innuendos and engages
in some playful gender confusion in this 1931 romp that was clearly
ahead of its time; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``HEARST METROTONE NEWS COLLECTION: Restored Newsreels from the
1930s in America'' _ Before television news, audiences witnessed
the events of the day at the movies. This collection, restored by
UCLA archivists under a grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, covers the period from the stock market crash of 1929
to President Franklin Roosevelt's ``Day of Infamy'' speech after
the attack at Pearl Harbor; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``DINAH SHORE: THE NBC YEARS'' _ The easy charm, warm smile and
engaging manner of the late variety-show hostess are remembered in
this tribute, compiled by UCLA and Research Video. Her interviewing
style put stars from Frank Sinatra to Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald
to Groucho Marx at ease on the NBC sets, where she worked from
1951-63. Show time is 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences, 5230 Lankershim Blvd., North
Hollywood. Admission is free for this event only, but reservations
must be made by calling (310) 206-8014.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for all other screenings are sold one hour before show
time nightly at the James Bridges Theater box office, on the UCLA
campus near Sunset Boulevard and Hilgard Avenue. Tickets cost $6
general admission, $4 for students and seniors. Passes for five
screenings cost $25 general, $17 for students and seniors.

   CLINTON-WHY _ WASHINGTON _ Why did President Clinton choose the
perilous course of voluntarily testifying before Ken Starr's grand
jury? If he has been truthful in denying an affair with Monica
Lewinsky, the answer is that he has nothing to fear from Starr. If
he has been untruthful, the answer may be that he has made a
political calculation that his transgressions won't prove
impeachable. We ask legal and political experts for their views.
(Deans, Cox News Service).

   NC-CLINTON _ President Clinton travels to Boone and Raleigh,
N.C. Catching up with him in Boone, a talk of the town on reaction

<P>
   IMMIGRATION _ WASHINGTON _ A House Judiciary subcommittee meets
to mark up a bill to establish the Bureau of Enforcement and Border
Affairs within the Justice Department. The new agency would take

Science Foundation's Coordinator for Computing, discusses an

</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRATION _ WASHINGTON _ A House subcommittee is expected to
vote Thursday to split the immigration service, creating an agency
that would deal solely with new citizens and a separate law
enforcement bureau that would be responsible for guarding U.S.
borders. The Justice Department today reiterated its opposition to
the plan, but some Democratic lawmakers find the division of labor
attractive. ``The agency has become too big,'' says Rep. Silvestre
Reyes, D-Texas, a former Border Patrol chief. (Harlan, Cox News

   SKOLVIOLENCE-HOTLINE _ It appears that Georgia may be the only
state that has a statewide school system hotline that allows
students, parents, etc., to anonymously call in tips about
potential campus violence. Typically, individual schools or school
districts usually have these kinds of lines. They are another
measure to curb school violence in light of recent schools at
schools nationwide. National safety experts, as well as some local
educators applaud the hotline idea, but say the mechanics of how it
works should be well thought out. (Badie, Atlanta

   STAMP _ DAYTON, Ohio _Postal Service put 200 million stamps on

Powerball has meant to Georgia. The state dropped out of the

and the jackpots began climbing.

   SINCLAIR _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Sinclair Community College is in the
early stages of a collaboration with seven other similar colleges
across the country to offer distance-learning courses to students
anywhere. This would make full use of the college's
computer-integrated learning center that is nearing completion in
the heart of campus. (Fisher, Dayton Daily News)

   TEXAS-HEAT _ AUSTIN _ It's hot. It's dry. And nobody knows when
it's going to rain. Environmental officials have put 213 of the
state's 4,201 community water systems on a ``watch list'' because
their pumps and pipes are under strain or supplies are being
depleted. The human toll is mounting, with 96 deaths since June 1.
The latest victim was Tommy McDeane, 48, of Dallas, who died
recently at a hospital after an apparent heat stroke about two
weeks ago. In Central Texas, temperatures have broken the century

`THE THIEF' IS JOYLESS, RELENTLESSLY SAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Admittedly, there are some buoyant Russian movies. ``Burnt By
The Sun'' brimmed with vitality and ``The Ascent'' evoked the
austere beauty and extreme closeups of a Carl Dreyer classic.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, recent Russian cinema still thrives on
the belief that life is bleak. Efforts like ``Mother and Son,''
which admittedly have been visually astounding, dramatize the
ordeal of living in an economically beleagured Russia before and
after Perestroika and the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thief,'' which was nominated in 1997 for an Oscar in the
best foreign film category and won top honors at the 1997 NIKAs
(the Russian equivalent to the Academy Awards), is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   It's a joyless, dour and relentlessly sad movie metaphor for
life during Stalin's reign over post-war Russia in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   That life is seen through the eyes of a young boy, Sanya (Misha
Philipchuk), as his beautiful young mother, Katya (Ekaterina
Rednikova) falls instantly in love with a dashing, renegade
military officer named Tolyan (Vladimir Mashkov), who she meets on
a train.
</P>
<P>
   Tolyan turns out to be a fraud; in truth he's nothing but a
common thief (who sports a tattoo of Stalin on his chest and a
panther on his shoulder) and who alternately dotes on and abuses
both mother and boy. He's even stolen his uniform from an unknown
soldier in order to acquire lodging and the opportunity to ravage
his neighbor's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dismal life but, because living is a trial in itself
under Comrade Stalin, Katya stays with Tolyan. Ultimately the woman
pays a terrible price for her loyalty. As their relationship
deteriorates, it's inevitably 6-year-old Sanya who comes to adore
and worship Tolyan and think of him as ``daddy.'' Just when Katya
has had enough of pain and crime and is intent upon leaving her
lover, Tolyan suffers a surprising fate _ one that will tear the
``family'' apart.
</P>
<P>
   Chukhrai ultimately beats us to death with the downbeat crisis
that prevail over the character's lives. There's no relief in ``The
Thief'' and more, the ending betrays everything that is interesting
in the story. Who wants to watch a depressing film about life in a
bygone era that has no resolution and redemption? Perhaps that's
precisely the point Chukhrai is trying to make _ there is no point.
</P>
<P>
   The Thief. Directed and written by Pavel Chukhrai. Cast:
Vladimir Mashkov, Ekaterina Rednikova, Misha Philipchuk.
Stratosphere Entertainment. 90 minutes. Rated R for language,
violence, sexual content. In Russian with English subtitles.

`BASEKETBALL' IS LOW AND DUMB 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Are this summer's Hollywood comedies aiming lower than ever
before in terms of bathroom humor, cruelty jokes, insensitivity to
minorities and all-around bad taste?
</P>
<P>
   That's the argument several critics have made recently, and
based on the evidence of such films as ``Mafia!,'' ``There's
Something About Mary,'' and even ``Dr. Doolittle,'' it's hard to
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still more evidence for the prosecution in
``BASEketball,'' a harrowingly dumb comedy that combines the
talents of writer-director David Zucker (``Airplane!'' ``The Naked
Gun'') with the creators of trash-TV's ``South Park,'' Trey Parker
and Matt Stone.
</P>
<P>
   This one is about two Milwaukee underachievers (Parker and
Stone), who inadvertently invent a backyard game that combines
elements of both basketball and baseball, with an added ``psyche
out'' factor in which opponents deliberately try to rattle each
other's concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to five years later, and the sport is the rage of America,
largely because it has forbidden all the things we hate about
professional sports in the '90s _ players aren't highly paid, they
can't change teams and corporate money is kept out.
</P>
<P>
   It's rather a clever idea for a sports satire, on the basis of
which sports-enthusiast Zuker apparently managed to recruit a slew
of famous sports announcers (Bob Costas, Tim McCarver, Curt Gowdy
and Al Michaels), and such sports legends as Reggie Jackson, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Dale Earnhardt to take part.
</P>
<P>
   But, not content to make merely a clever satire, he's junked up
the movie far beyond anything he's ever dared in the past. It's one
flatulence, urination and vomit gag after another; juvenile attacks
on gays (the San Francisco team is ``the Ferries''), Hispanics and
the blind; cruelty jokes that go on for agonizing lengths of screen
time.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, despite his successful track record as a comedy
director, Zuker proves himself not especially adept at
low-low-humor _ not half as imaginative as, say, the Farrelly
Brothers (``Kingpin,'' ``Dumb and Dumber''). At least three-fourths
of his gags fell absolutely flat with the audience Universal
recruited for the Seattle preview showing. Barely a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   But the real tragedy is that, by spending so much of its time
heaping up the most abysmal kind of adolescent humor,
``BASEketball'' fails to live up to whatever small potential it has
as a sports comedy. The script doesn't even have time to tell us,
for instance, how this game is played. We're forced to keep staring
at these numbskulls throwing basketballs and running around some
weird shaped court without ever really knowing what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball. Directed by David Zucker. Cast: Trey Parker, Matt
Stone, Yasmine Bleeth, Robert Vaughn. Universal. 100 minutes. Rated
R for gross humor.

`WATER' IS A CLEVER COMEDY ABOUT HOMOSEXUAL PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first half hour, this gay soap opera runs amok as far as
tone and technique. The acting is so amateurish and over the top,
we initially wonder if we'll ever be able to engage with the
caricatured characters who inhabit the upscale and elite Southern
town, Azalea Springs.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the film comes back down to Earth and transforms
itself into a clever, spry comedy about homosexual panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Water'' is like watching ``Steel Magnolias'' on
speed. But fortunately, the core couple-to-be in the movie move
center stage and ground the story within its overblown peripheral
chaos and camp.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Stratton (Keri Jo Chapman) is in an unhappy marriage with a
too-busy husband. Worse, her society mother, Lily (Barbara
Lasater), intrudes in her life _ and her wardrobe _ on a
too-regular basis. Alex stoicly goes about her business despite
their constant carping and disapproval. Only her friends at the
town's new AIDS facility, gay Spencer (John Hallum), and old high
school chum, Grace Miller (Teresa Garrett), keep her spirits
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   When the town's country club-like Women's League surprisingly
votes to do its volunteer work at the hospice, the decision upsets
several of the snooty women and causes controversy when Spencer
drunkenly jokes at the Azalea Ball that he became gay ``after
drinking the town's water.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the whole burg turns upside down and is in a frenzy; Alex
falls in love with Grace, and newspaper reporter Mark Anderson
(Derrick Sanders) defies his old-school dad and announces that he,
too, is gay. Even Brother Daniel (John Addington), who runs a
``Homo-No-Mo'' support group, inadvertently gets caught in the
craziness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Water'' features two attractive lead characters.
Chapman and Garrett inhabit their parts with quiet assurance and
gravity and they hold our attention by offering welcome relief from
the rest of the insanity. Unfortunately, most of the other actors
push the envelope as far as perpetuating old stereotypes _ both of
gays and Southern belles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, director and writer Kelli Herd has made a pleasant and
moving comedy that sprung from her astonishment over ``the lack of
films about gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   She manages to poke fun at conservative, right-wing factions yet
isn't vicious or mean in her humor. That allows the film to
transcend being pigeon-holed. It has a more universal appeal. In
fact, ``It's in the Water'' played two years ago at the Seattle
International Film Festival, where it packed the house and was
well-received.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's not perfect _ the look of the film has no real style
or originality _ it does have an eclectic charm. And Chapman, who
has appeared on ``Baywatch,'' is terrific as a society wife who has
been beaten down by marital and parental pressure. She retains a
resilience that is compelling.
</P>
<P>
   As Alex begins to take control of her life, the actress visibly
blooms onscreen. While Patricia Rozema's ``When Night Is Falling''
is still the best film about a woman's coming out, ``It's in the
Water'' is a feel-good addition to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the Water. Directed by Kelli Herd. Written by Kelli
Herd. Cast: Keri Jo Chapman, Teresa Garrett, Derrick Sanders,
Timothy Vahle. Herd Film Co., 100 minutes. Unrated with nudity,
language, gay themes.

`WHATEVER' COPS AN ATTITUDE EARLY ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This movie about high school girls on the fast track to hell in
1981 cops an attitude early on and maintains its facade of
hopelessness and apathy throughout. Like ``Girls Town'' and ``All
Over Me,'' its main characters are opposites who attract.
</P>
<P>
   Anna (Liza Weil) lives with her mom and bratty little brother.
She's up for admittance to art school _ Cooper Union in Manhattan _
and has genuine artistic talent. Brenda comes from an abusive
household and she's full of rage and self-loathing. She doesn't
care about anything but having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever'' opens with a distasteful scene of three boys
``running a train'' on Brenda as she lies drunkenly in a field.
It's an unsettling and revolting moment that sets the tone for
things to come.
</P>
<P>
   But Anna is the film's real protagonist. She's shy and unsure
and mouths off to everyone in authority in an effort to be
accepted. Only in art class under the guidance of Mr. Chaminsky (an
over-the-top Frederic Forrest) does she find her footing. Deep down
she desperately wants to be admitted to college. She's fragile,
ackward and at the age where any rejection could break her in half.
</P>
<P>
   The girls slum from party to party; Brenda grows continually
more reckless, picking up older boys, and Anna follows behind,
picking up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The unfocused world of teenagers at a breaking point is captured
beautifully in ``Whatever.'' Anna admits she's ``afraid of being
ordinary'' and writer/director Susan Skoog and Liza Weil, the young
actress who astonishingly inhabits Anna, ensure she's anything but.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad the same can't be said for Skoog's script, which
relies upon banalities, overused trademarks of teenage angst and
rebellion and that old red herring, abuse, as the impetus for
Brenda's sullen rage.
</P>
<P>
   The party scenes are perfectly recreated, with the miasma and
lethargy of youth wasting their lives and brain cells with too much
alcohol and drugs, and not having a very good time in the process.
It almost feels like a documentary in some instances, which would
have been a fascinating premise, but Skoog forces her narrative
into conventional dramatic structures and it hurts the film.
</P>
<P>
   Had she just let the camera roll and not pushed the story into
such convenient, cliched and obvious slots, the film might have
been revelatory. But it opts to follow a more traditional path and
despite two exceptionally fine performances from Weil and Morgan,
``Whatever'' is, well, just whatever itself.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and written by Susan Skoog. Cast: Liza Weil, Chad
Morgan, Mark Riffon. Sony Pictures Classics. 112 minutes. Rated R
for language, sexual content, nudity, scenes with drugs and
alcohol, violence.
</P>

   Grade: C+

OF GYPSIES, SCAMS AND DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rigor mortis had already set in when 83-year-old Hope Victoria
Beesley was found dead in her bed, apparently of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The irascible San Francisco dowager looked both eerie and
pathetic _ eyes open, scalp naked without its wig, arm pointed
defiantly toward the ceiling in a clenched-fist salute.
</P>
<P>
   Her death left a number of loose ends _ one being private eye
Fay Faron of the Rat Dog Dick Detective Agency.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Beesley's attorney had hired Faron to trace a
handyman named Danny Tene, who abruptly disappeared after allegedly
sweet-talking his way into co-ownership of Beesley's
half-million-dollar home.
</P>
<P>
   With Beesley dead, the case was moot. But Faron, nicknamed ``Rat
Dog'' for her persistence as an investigator, couldn't stop
wondering ... Who was this Danny Tene?
</P>
<P>
   Thus began Faron's five-year quest to halt a byzantine series of
alleged ``sweetheart scams'' against the elderly _ an old game that
may have taken a murderous twist within one Gypsy family suspected
of poisoning its ``clients.''
</P>
<P>
   While Faron was tailing suspects in her neon-green junker called
the Frog Prince, crime journalist Jack Olsen was tailing her. The
Bainbridge Island writer, an Edgar Award-winner, knew he had a
great story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw right away,'' said Olsen, 73, words spilling out
rapid-fire in his enthusiasm. ``The combination of Gypsies and Rat
Dog _ holy moley! My kid could have written it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is detailed in Olsen's newest true-crime saga,
``Hastened to the Grave: The Gypsy Murder Investigation'' (St.
Martin's Press, 276 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Tene and others were suspected of cozying up to elderly people
and bleeding them dry financially. In some cases their deaths may
have been hastened by sprinkling their food with the heart medicine
digitalis, which can be fatal in high doses, producing what appears
to be a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust cleared, the bodies of four alleged victims had
been exhumed and tested for traces of digitalis. Beesley's remains
were not tested, however. She had already been cremated, with the
ashes and bone fragments scattered at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Last November four suspects were indicted on charges of
conspiracy to commit murder. Danny Tene (pronounced ``TEE-ney'')
faced lesser charges of grand theft and stealing from a dependent
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen says most of the suspects, who are awaiting trial, are
relatives of the Tene Bimbo family featured in Peter Maas' 1975
book, ``King of the Gypsies.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's book grew out of a Vanity Fair story that ran in May.
The article was greeted by protesters outside Vanity Fair's New
York office, who distributed fliers headlined: ``Vanity Fair! Stop
`Gypsy' bashing!!!'' Over a photo of Gypsies in a Nazi
concentration camp were the boldfaced words, ``We will not be
gassed again!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Auntie's bookstore in Spokane hired security
last month after being warned that a prominent local Gypsy planned
to attend Olsen's book signing and be ``in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Olsen defused the protest by reading passages
detailing the Gypsies' long history of persecution. According to a
newspaper account, it was enough to wring tears from his would-be
antagonist. Olsen said they later had a few friendly drinks
together.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, a New York Times review of his book
accuses Olsen of too much ethnic sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly reminded that Gypsies are an oppressed
people,'' wrote critic Judith Newman. ``Olsen sometimes feels
compelled to equivocate by making politically correct excuses for
their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's book describes Gypsies, or Rom, as descendants of a
nomadic people in the Punjab region of India who left their
homeland around 1,000 A.D. and faced discrimination and cruelty
wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen has been informed that Gypsies unhappy with the book have
placed a curse, or ramya, on him. He laughs it off. ``I do know
that I bought a lottery ticket and didn't win, so it's working
already,'' he said. ``If you take these things seriously, you'll
never get any work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen may chortle about the curse, but he's dead serious about
the skulduggery detailed in ``Hastened to the Grave.'' No one could
dream up a case this complex and bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the least imagination of anybody I've ever met,'' Olsen
said. ``That's why I write non-fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero is Faron, a sweet-but-spunky private eye whose previous
careers include driving an ice-cream truck, filming a travelogue on
the River Kwai and selling vacuum cleaners in a part of Appalachia
without electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's by far the most fascinating character I've ever written
about _ bar none,'' said Olsen. ``She's also just about the most
noble person I've ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Faron, 49, who donated five years of unpaid labor to the case,
said she was motivated by a desire for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elders have been discovered as the perfect victims,'' said
Faron, who flew to Seattle recently to discuss the a local TV
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're piggy banks walking around waiting to be smashed.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Faron founded a non-profit advocacy group called
ElderAngels in an effort to prevent such scams. She said Olsen's
book has given her the clout to lobby for legal change and has
alerted the public to similar cons around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's important,'' Faron said, ``is we're hearing
from people all over the United States. The suspects are different
from here but the M.O. is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the elderly are prey to all kinds of cons, the
sweetheart scam is especially cruel and lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sweetheart scam is the lottery,'' Faron said. ``When you
do a sweetheart scam, you can get half a million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Hastened to the Grave'' spotlights a case involving one
family, it also suggests there's a well-entrenched criminal
subculture within the Gypsy community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Gypsy mafia and it's all over the country and it's
just as together as the Italian Mafia ever was,'' Olsen said.
``They have their own territories, just like the Mafia. They have
safe houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's comment is seconded by Lt. Dennis Marlock of the
Milwaukee Police Department, who founded an international group
called Professionals Against Confidence Crime. Marlock, who has
worked with the Gypsy community for 30 years, is author of a 1994
book, ``License to Steal: The Traveling Con Artist'' (Paladin
Press, 403 pages, $30).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's organized crime _ bottom line,'' Marlock said, adding
that most of the crimes are non-violent. ``It's a
multibillion-dollar enterprise. They're so cocky. For so many years
they have gone unchallenged and there's no serious law-enforcement
attempt to stop them from doing what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlock noted that there are many honest Romani people who don't
have ties with the criminal subculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to the Sicilian Mafia in the sense that all Mafia
members are Sicilian, but not all Sicilians are criminals,''
Marlock said. ``It's identical with the Gypsies.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said San Francisco police ignored evidence and dragged
their feet on the case detailed in his book, resulting in
interdepartmental charges. Given the alleged missteps by police,
Olsen said, ``I don't think the case is going to be won. It's
probably going to die on a technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the elderly are sitting ducks for financial schemers
of all stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A doddering 90-year-old man is every bit as vulnerable as a
5-year-old child,'' Olsen said. ``The only difference is the
90-year-old man has an estate.''

`EVER AFTER' DOESN'T LACK AUDACITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one thing you can say about ``Ever After,'' the movies'
latest and umpteenth retelling of the Cinderella story, is that
it's not lacking in audacity.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it strip the story of its magical elements and
rework the character into a take-charge feminist, it casts the
dramatically questionable Drew Barrymore in the part, and throws in
Leonardo da Vinci as the Fairy Godmother figure.
</P>
<P>
   It's so bizarre that it almost works, though a grumpy critic
could certainly have a field day with it, and especially with the
performance of Barrymore, who often seems to doing ``Scream 3'' and
speaks throughout with a glaringly fake English accent, even though
the story is set in France.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a prologue in which an aged French countess
(Jeanne Moreau) calls the Brothers Grimm to her chateau and takes
them to task for getting the Cinderella story all wrong. Producing
a glass-studded slipper, she tells them it's a true story, and she
wants ``to set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to a few hundred years earlier, and we met Danielle
(Barrymore), whose happy life with her beloved father (Jeroen
Krabbe) comes to a halt when he remarries a countess (Anjelica
Huston) with two daughters, and promptly drops dead of a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle becomes a servant in her own house, and the rest of the
movie follows the outline of the myth, except that this Cinderella
is both rebellious and highly capable, the prince falls in love
with her keen mind more than her buxom beauty, and the visiting Da
Vinci plays cupid.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, obviously, was to modernize the myth for modern
audiences, removing what feminists have long charged is an
abhorrent central theme (that women should wait around for a Prince
Charming to come along and change their lives for the better) and
otherwise portraying the cardboard characters as more recognizable
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one appears to have told Anjelica Huston what was
going on in the humanizing of characters department, because she
plays the Evil Stepmother with nostrils flaring and no holds
barred. She's such a portrait of menopausal meanness that she makes
Glenn Close's recent turn as Cruella De Vil look like Melanie
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's hard to ever know for sure when this film is being
deliberately tongue-in-cheek and when it's being straight.
Barrymore is so contemporary in manner and the script is so
littered with modernisms (``Un-bee-lieveable!'' Danielle exclaims
at one point of frustration) that it often plays more like a
``Airplane!''-style parody of ``Cinderella'' than an affectionate
re-interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Ever After. Directed by Andy Tennant. Screenplay by Susannah
Grant, Tennant and Rick Parks. Cast: Drew Barrymore, Anjelica
Huston, Dougray Scott. 20th Century-Fox. 121 minutes. Rated PG-13
for no obvious reason.

<P>
   MET-UNICORN (New York) _ The branch of the Metropolitan Museum
known as the Cloisters is, in every sense, one of the high points
of art in New York City. An impressive jumble of Romanesque scraps
and American prewar masonry, and a monument to American
philanthropy, it sits atop a rocky outcrop over the Hudson near the
upper tip of Manhattan. If location is one of the Cloisters'
outstanding attractions, the magnificent trove of medieval art it
houses is another. Burgundian carvings, illuminated manuscripts and
one of the greatest of all early Netherlandish paintings are among
the treasures. But surely the most famous work is the set of
tapestries long known as ``The Hunt of the Unicorn.'' By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   MAINE-SHAKERS (Undated) _ The peninsula encompassing the
downtown area of Portland, Maine., is a pleasantly compact place,
with neighborhoods that invite strolling and a harbor full of
islands reached by a ferry ride that can feel like a vacation in
itself. The chance to visit such a manageable maritime city and do
a little exploring along the coast nearby lured my wife, Margaret,
and me on a recent weekend. But we also went out of curiosity about
a living link to an unusual chapter in American religious history.
For more than two centuries, a Shaker community has made its home
on a farmstead less than an hour's drive away from Portland, and
the six believers living there now are the last remnant of this
sect in the United States. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   NY-OUTDOOR-DANCE (New York) _ A young girl dressed in a
scalloped tunic and kerchief jumps awkwardly on a makeshift outdoor
stage beneath the Queensborough Bridge in the late 1960s. Seven
shambling young avant-gardists spread the 1970s gospel of
fashionably untutored and untheatrical dance performance on a city
sidewalk. Ballroom dancers spin and fly through countless nights in
the parks of New York City in the 1940s and '50s. Charming
photographs from ``Stepping Out: A Century of Dance in New York
City Parks,'' an exhibition at the Central Park Arsenal Building,
suggest that outdoor dance performances have long been with us. But
those performances have changed a great deal, to judge by the
attractions offered by festivals this summer in the city and
beyond. By Jennifer Dunning.

STEVENS STICKS WITH VICTORY GALLOP

   (EDs: Stands for RACING)

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ When Victory Gallop goes to the races
early next month, Elliot Walden, his trainer, has absolutely no
doubts that Gary Stevens will be the jockey on his colt's back. And
Stevens backs the trainer up on that.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, who hasn't raced since depriving Real Quiet of
winning the Triple Crown by edging out his rival in the Belmont
Stakes last month, is scheduled to run next in the $1 million
Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in New Jersey on Aug. 9. The
Jim Dandy, the traditional Travers prep at Saratoga Race Course, is
scheduled for the same day.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, Victory Gallop, second in the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, will go from the Haskell to the
Travers.
</P>
<P>
   Walden, who has Victory Gallop stabled at Saratoga, said he was
never concerned that Stevens might jump off his colt. Stevens, who
is based at Del Mar near San Diego, decided to bypass Saratoga and
remain on the Left Coast. That decision came after Bob Baffert, who
trains Real Quiet, gave Stevens an offer he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert told the jockey that if stayed at Del Mar for the
summer, he would give Stevens first call on all of his horses,
including Real Quiet. Seeing as Real Quiet is scheduled to face
Victory Gallop in the Haskell, Walden may have been staring at a
problem. Speculation was running high about just who would pick up
the mount.
</P>
<P>
   `I am not concerned now,'' Walden said Wednesday. ``Gary told me
he was going to be on Victory Gallop on Haskell Day.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walden heard that Stevens was going to bypass Saratoga and
stay as Baffert's No. 1 guy in California, he did raise his
eyebrows. He knew that Stevens would have his choice of riding his
colt or Real Quiet, who has been being rode by Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, speaking by phone from the jockey room at Del Mar
Wednesday, said the option was there to ride Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an issue,'' Stevens said. ``But after a lot of
thought and consideration, I decided to stay on Victory Gallop.
Those people (Victory Gallop's owners Art, Jack and J.R. Preston)
have been so good to me over the years and I have had a good
working relationship with Elliot Walden. I felt fortunate to be
chosen to ride their horse in the Preakness and then the Belmont
Stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens rode Indian Charlie to a third place finish in the
Kentucky Derby. After that colt was declared out of the Preakness,
Stevens picked up Victory Gallop and has been there since and
apparently will stay there.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Stevens wants to make sure people know is that he is
not staying on Victory Gallop because of the sentimental hogwash it
seems to reek of. He said he did not talk to Desormeaux about this
and he and Baffert are apparently OK with this decision.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens did work Real Quiet in California earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't keep the mount because I thought I was obligated
to,'' Stevens said. ``I really think Victory Gallop is a very good
racehorse; I am confident he is one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary won the Belmont, a Grade I race, with Victory Gallop,''
Walden said. ``It wasn't like I had to ask him what he was going to
do. We did have some discussion because we obviously wanted to make
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he was not sure when he would be making an
appearance at Saratoga; the first time could be when and if Victory
Gallop runs in the $750,000 Travers here on Aug. 29.

PRESIDENT PORKER AND THE SLEAZE PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This week Monica Lewinsky and her mom got
immunity. Columnists lost it. We have to write about this stuff
whether we like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like it, and until this week have been avoiding the
subject for months. But the whole country is asking the question:
``Huh? Aren't people supposed to lie about sex?''
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago I gave Clinton the first break I've given him in
this column since a month after his inauguration, asking why we'd
destroy a president because he couldn't keep his zipper up and his
lip zipped afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Can't we get this guy on bigger stuff, like being a
sanctimonious shyster who doesn't solve problems but just starts
national conversations about them?
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend immediately accused me of giving Clinton a free
pass. ``He may have done good things for women,'' she said. ``But
he's a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't respond without feeling like part of the piggie club.
This is despite the fact that, according to surveys and overheard
conversations, men have been tougher on Clinton for his
peccadilloes than women have.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because men are envious of Clinton's attractiveness
to women. As a female I know once said: ``He's a babe.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the name of a pig, too. A cuter and straighter-talking
one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can be described with a slew of ``sl-'' words like
``slick,'' ``slimy,'' ``sleazy'' and ``slippery,'' as shown by how
he wriggled out of the draft in the '60s to how he dodged taking a
position on affirmative action in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   He's been trying to wriggle out of this one too, ever since that
bit about oral sex not being adultery. OK, he's a greased pig, or a
member of that all-male species known as the horn dog.
</P>
<P>
   But so were many presidents. Recent accounts by former Secret
Service officers show that our most revered recent president, John
F. Kennedy, turned the White House into a bordello with himself as
the only john.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Lyndon Johnson was envious and bragged, ``I've had
more women by accident than he's had on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Or something to that effect. If Clinton is a pig, he's living in
a big white sty with porticos.
</P>
<P>
   My friend is genuinely offended that Clinton, a married man with
a child, would have sex with a then-21-year-old intern in the house
the American people rent to their highest public servant.
</P>
<P>
   If it's true, as all the leaks and sources assure us, it does
make Clinton a pig of a different stench. Monica Lewinsky seems
like a nice young woman, but insecure and impressionable.
</P>
<P>
   At least Kennedy had the good taste to bed mobster molls. What
the hell was Clinton thinking? This intern was barely older than
his daughter, and a woman you couldn't exactly ditch. She worked in
the next office.
</P>
<P>
   Does Clinton toss back Stoly with Boris Yeltsin and then play
Russian roulette with the nuclear button, too?
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is a young woman who, if all reports are accurate,
regularly talked with her own mother about her affair with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   For the life of me, I don't know what Monica Lewinsky needs
immunity from, but I wish her mother didn't have it.
</P>
<P>
   Even at my age, if I told my mom I was having an affair with the
first lady, she'd never let me sleep in my old room again.
</P>
<P>
   The other night David Letterman's Top 10 List were the questions
special prosecutor Ken Starr plans to ask Monica Lewinsky. They
included the usual puerile jokes, but No. 3 was ``Are you mad at me
for ruining your entire adult life?''
</P>
<P>
   How does she maintain her sanity, now that she's keeping five
networks and the entire Internet in business?
</P>
<P>
   My wife, ever the realist, says: ``One word: Theresabookinit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the best-seller will come dozens of made-for-TV movies,
and then an entire life known as Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking at a color picture of Lewinsky in the Los Angeles
Times. She is surrounded by gawkers and cameramen, yet she stands
apart like a serene Renaissance beauty.
</P>
<P>
   What are all these jokes about Lewinsky's appearance? Maybe this
is some kind of guy thing _ putting down a woman who did it with
another guy.
</P>
<P>
   Below the picture of Monica with the Mona Lisa smile is a
picture of Ken Starr with his Mr. Toad smile. One line comes to
mind, the kind always spoken by neighbors: ``He always seemed like
a nice, quiet guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A nice quiet guy who has spent $50 million trying to get the
president. As Gerald Seib of the Wall Street Journal has pointed
out, Starr was appointed four years ago _ when Monica Lewinsky was
still in college _ to investigate a real-estate deal in backwater
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   He could have saved her a lot of headaches, and us a lot of
money, by nailing the president back then.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky family now has a spokeswoman. Every family needs a
spokeswoman, especially hers. After the immunity deal, the
spokeswoman said that Monica's parents ``are relieved their
daughter is out of harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. What was Ken Starr going to do? Send a 25-year-old to
jail for falling for our babe of a president? She still has a life
sentence as the woman who launched a billion jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started a national conversation all right. What a
porker, and we've all followed him and Ken Starr into the mud.

INTERIM 49ERS BOSS FOCUSES ON FINDING A SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ It was in 1992 that Larry Thrailkill made his
first serious connection with the DeBartolo family.
</P>
<P>
   He started out handling financial dealings, working closely with
Edward DeBartolo Sr. until DeBartolo's death in 1994. Shortly after
that, 49ers owners Eddie DeBartolo Jr. and Denise DeBartolo York
invited Thrailkill to Super Bowl XXIX in 1995 in Miami, offering
him the job of chief operating officer of the Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of adjustment and Thrailkill was the man for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill finds himself in the same position today, only this
time it is with the 49ers and his title is interim president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie and Denise invited me to be COO of the corporation in
order to help them get through a transition period,'' Thrailkill
said. ``That was my role then, to work through that period, and
that's what I'll be doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill held a news conference Wednesday, a week after Carmen
Policy resigned as president of the San Francisco team. Now
Thrailkill is in charge and must face most of the questions about
the uncertainty of the 49ers' ownership.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he will be doing that Policy didn't in his last months
on the job is keeping Eddie DeBartolo Jr. more apprised of the
organization's operations. DeBartolo removed himself from team
management in December after becoming the subject of a federal
probe into gambling in Louisiana. Policy started answering directly
to York at that time and also stopped talking to DeBartolo about
team business.
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill will still answer to York, but he also will be
talking to her brother regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie stepped away from management of the team, but he's still
an owner of the organization,'' he said. ``I'll talk to him as much
as I talk to Denise because he's a shareholder in the organization
that owns the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill's attitude toward his input into the daily operations
of the team hasn't changed. That responsibility still falls on
executive vice president of football operations Dwight Clark, coach
Steve Mariucci and chief financial officer Bill Duffy. Thrailkill
apparently plans on ensuring that things run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest tasks will be monitoring the progress of plans for
the team's new stadium and finding a permanent successor for
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that Policy, who is now part of an ownership group
bidding for control of the expansion Cleveland Browns, supplied all
the attributes the team could covet in a top executive.
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill and Policy are good friends, and saw each other early
Wednesday in Youngstown, Ohio, where Policy was cleaning out his
office at the DeBartolo Corp. headquarters. The company's business
holdings include shopping centers and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Policy pointed out that his name had been removed from his
parking space, replaced by Thrailkill's.
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill currently wears three hats _ his titles with the
49ers and the DeBartolo Corp. as well his role as a partner in a
Nashville law firm. He harbors no plans to turn this job into a
permanent one.

CAST-IRON: HEAVY-METAL MEALS  
 (PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SEND TO NYTNS PHOTO CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - All you need to cook, all you really, really need, is
a cast-iron skillet. And maybe a knife and a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, you inherited a piece of cast-iron cookware
from a grandmother. Be proud of it. Martha Washington left some to
her descendants, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cast iron has many uses around the home kitchen, but it's also
especially wonderful for camping and outdoor use. Chef Robert
McGrath of the Roaring Fork in Scottsdale, Ariz., serves Green
Chile Pork at the restaurant in individual cast-iron cauldrons, but
he's also had vast experience with cast iron around campfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up camping,'' McGrath said as he poked the fire for a
photo shoot. ``I've been going to Colorado (for an annual rafting
trip) since 1972. That's how the restaurant got its name.''
</P>
<P>
   He piled rosemary on the fire to scent the food, and seasoned
boneless trout fillets with kosher salt, cracked black pepper and
yellow cornmeal. He set them to sizzle in a cast-iron skillet in
hot shortening, his preferred frying medium for camping purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to transport. When we're out rafting and so on, we
use shortening,'' McGrath said. ``And when I'm cooking in cast
iron, when I'm doing chicken, that's what I use.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried chicken cooked in a cast-iron skillet _ is there anything
else that qualifies quite so readily as nectar of the gods?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. McGrath's Green Chile Pork is way up there, too. He uses
three kinds of chiles, including roasted dried green chiles. If you
can't get them or don't want to dry your own in a dehydrator,
substitute fresh or canned roasted chiles.
</P>
<P>
   The pork is made into a stew, which is a classic use of a
cast-iron Dutch oven. ``Dutch oven'' is a term used to describe two
different kinds of pots, so pay attention here.
</P>
<P>
   Many cooks call their large covered pot a ``Dutch oven.'' It has
a flat bottom and a domed lid.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dutch oven'' also refers to a cast-iron pot that actually
will cook like an oven, with heat from above and below. This kind
of Dutch oven has short legs to sit over coals, and a flat lid with
a flanged top so hot coals or charcoal briquettes can be held on
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner Cast Iron calls this a ``cowboy pot.'' Lodge, another
maker of cast iron, calls it a Dutch oven.
</P>
<P>
   We liked McGrath's biscuits baked in a cast-iron skillet. (He
put it in the oven, not over coals or on a grill.) He put balls of
dough in the skillet and when they baked, they grew together into
one mass. It was easy to break off the biscuits and eat them. You
can use your favorite biscuit recipe or biscuit mix to duplicate
this.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath uses smoked red and yellow onions and leeks in Barbecued
Onion Soup, another delectable creation served in cast-iron
cauldrons at the Roaring Fork. You can use any kind of smoker for
the onions, or, if you're in camp, McGrath suggests that you cut
the onions into thick slices, put them on the grill, and put a
cast-iron lid or inverted cast-iron pot over them to trap the smoke
and infuse them with flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The soup is topped with fine slices of onion tossed with chili
powder and flour, and fried until crisp.
</P>
<P>
   You can cook almost anything in a Dutch oven. At the World
Championship Dutch Oven Cookoff on Aug. 8 at the Festival of the
American West in Logan, Utah, contestants will prepare three
entrees in three Dutch ovens: one a meat dish, one a bread with
yeast or sourdough, and one dessert. The winning team of two gets
$500.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a cornbread baking tip that your grandmother knew: Put a
small amount of butter or fat in a cast-iron skillet and preheat it
in the oven before adding cornbread batter. The hot skillet will
make a crisper crust.
</P>
<P>
   Carol McClain of Wagner Manufacturing, makers of cast-iron
cookware since 1891, said the company still makes several of its
original pieces. Newest are fat-free fryers, with raised grids in
the bottom of the pan to sear the food and cook it above the
drippings.
</P>
<P>
   You can find cast-iron skillets in all sizes, round and square,
with grids in the bottom or not; Dutch ovens in medium and huge
sizes; cornbread pans in interesting shapes, including the
ever-popular one shaped like ears of corn; griddles that fit across
one or two burners. Cast-iron pans also are made for unusual
specialties such as Swedish pancakes and the puffy round Dutch
balls of dough called ableskivers.
</P>
<P>
   One new cast-iron pan even has a lid with grids underneath,
which is made to be heated separately from the skillet, which also
has grids. It is used on the stove top or on a grill, and the
heated lid is pressed onto the meat to give it those grill marks
and make it cook faster.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Clark, who listed their Dutch oven as one of the most
important pieces of equipment they had on their westward
exploration trek, would be proud. &QL;

IRON WARE NEEDS CARE, SEASONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Cast iron cookware has many advantages. It wears like,
well, cast iron. And it's inexpensive. You can buy a skillet for
$15 or so and use it throughout the rest of your culinary life. The
handle will never fall off.
</P>
<P>
   A properly seasoned cast iron skillet will become non-stick
through use. But there's the rub, so to speak. How do you season
cast iron? It's not mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   New pans are dark gray in color and will eventually darken to
black with use. Pans are shipped with a coating of wax sealant to
keep them from rusting in transit, explained Carol McClain, manager
of consumer services for Wagner Manufacturing, an Ohio company that
has made cast iron cookware since 1891.
</P>
<P>
   The wax coating should first be scrubbed off the entire surface
of the pan with hot water and a soapy steel-wool pad. Now, you have
to seal the porous surface of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, apply a thin coat of fat over all the pan, inside
and out, with a paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to use solid vegetable shortening, such as Crisco.
Your grandmother probably used lard or bacon grease to season pans.
Now, it's not recommended because it might become rancid over time.
</P>
<P>
   Lodge Manufacturing, a Tennessee cast iron cookware company,
recommends a good grade of olive or vegetable oil for this purpose.
McClain tells consumers she doesn't advocate using peanut oil.
Whatever you choose, don't use a lot of it because overseasoning
can make a pan sticky instead of slick.
</P>
<P>
   Sources recommend varying times for heating the pans for
seasoning, but the consensus is to stick the coated skillet in an
oven heated to 250 to 350 degrees. Either turn the pan upside down
to let the excess fat drip off (put something underneath to catch
it) or take the pan out after 15 minutes and pour off the excess.
Then put it back in.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the pan in the oven to bake for at least an hour. Two to
three hours is fine. Then turn off the oven and remove the pan, or
leave it in there until it's cool.
</P>
<P>
   Your pan is seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   New pans will probably smell while cooking in your oven. It is
not unpleasant, but you might want to turn on an exhaust fan.
</P>
<P>
   Don't store cast iron pieces with the lids on, because it might
trap moisture that causes rust.
</P>
<P>
   One ``rule'' about cast iron cookware is that you're never
supposed to wash it with soap. As with all rules, this one is meant
to be broken. Chef Robert McGrath of Roaring Fork in Scottsdale
always uses soap and water to clean cast iron, and then rubs it
down with oil and salt, which he wipes out with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   If you make cornbread in your skillet or Dutch oven, it will pop
out easily and you can simply wipe out the pan with paper towels.
If you make stew, that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape out all the food residue, then use hot water (never cold)
and a plastic scrubber or stiff natural fiber brush to remove the
rest. If you use steel wool or a metal brush, you'll have to
reseason. Rinse well in hot water and dry thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Drying is important because of the rust risk.
</P>
<P>
   Many cooks put their cast iron, at this point, back into a warm
oven or on a warm burner to make sure it's completely dry.
</P>
<P>
   Some sources say not to use cast iron cookware to prepare
recipes with high-acid foods, such as tomatoes, because this will
take off the coating. Nutritionists have said for years that this
very thing can be a good source of iron in the diet.
</P>
<P>
   If your cast iron rusts, McClain said, scrub it off with steel
wool or run it through a self-cleaning oven cycle. Then reseason.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same thing if you find old cast iron that has
black crusty flakes. In the old days, pioneers would stick it right
into the fire. &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED- Lodge Manufacturing gives these directions for baking
in a Dutch oven. As with anything else, it gets easier with
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ignite briquettes 15 to 20 minutes before you need them, or get
a fire going 30 to 45 minutes before if using hot coals. Prepare
food and ovens for cooking. If your dish takes longer, you will
need additional coals or briquettes to replenish those used.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange briquettes under oven bottom in a circular pattern at
least { inch inside the oven's edge. Put briquettes on top of the
lid in a checkerboard pattern. Bunching briquettes can cause hot
spots and burn the contents. To prevent small hot-spot problems,
lift and rotate the oven one-quarter turn every 10 to 15 minutes
and then rotate the lid one-quarter turn in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Check food occasionally, but be careful when removing the lid.
If adding briquettes, do so in equal portions to top and bottom. &QL;

GROUP TO MARK ANNIVERSARY OF PEDAL-POWER PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bicyclists who advocate two-wheeled commuting
plan to mark the first anniversary Friday of a disruptive
pedal-powered protest for improved biking conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers and the police say this year's action should be
quieter than a year ago, when 105 people were arrested in an event
that paralyzed vehicular traffic during the afternoon rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say as many as 5,000 bicyclists are expected to mark
the one-year anniversary of Critical Mass, which launched bicycle
politics in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to be big,'' said Leah Shahum of the San
Francisco Bicycle Coalition. ``I think there is a lot of anger out
there ... We expect to see a lot of creative energy on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Ackerson, a spokesman for the police, said the bicycle
ride might slow traffic, but he expected no confrontations. The
department in recent months has tried not to antagonize the cycling
community but promises to arrest anyone who goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate it will be peaceful,'' Ackerson said. ``There
are no special preparations. We don't plan to throw lots of troops
at this thing. ... They've been behaving themselves. We hope it
stays that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bicyclists are seeking more accommodations, including bike lanes
on busy streets, to encourage people to leave their cars and pedal
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some anger lingers at the way cyclists took over downtown on
July 27, 1997. Also, many bike riders remain bitter over actions by
the police last July and in subsequent rides. Although 105 people
were arrested last year, charges were dropped against all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycle advocates are far from satisfied, but they as well as
city officials agree that Critical Mass has given bike riders
political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the chaotic last year, Mayor Willie Brown vowed to
make ``San Francisco the nation's most bicycle-friendly city.''
</P>
<P>
   But cyclists are disappointed with a number of policy decisions
by the city, especially the rejection of most of their Bicycle
Route Network plan designed to encourage more people to ride bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really noticing that the mayor hasn't followed through
on what he promised a year ago,'' Shahum said. ``We're seeing a
lack of commitment from a year ago. The rejection of improvements
to eight of the 10 streets in our proposed bicycle route shows that
there is no commitment to true accessibility for bicyclists in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyclists did praise the installation of hundreds of new bicycle
racks in the city. They also have praised efforts to add bicycle
lanes.

   MET-UNICORN (New York) _ The branch of the Metropolitan Museum
known as the Cloisters is, in every sense, one of the high points
of art in New York City. An impressive jumble of Romanesque scraps
and American prewar masonry, and a monument to American
philanthropy, it sits atop a rocky outcrop over the Hudson near the
upper tip of Manhattan. If location is one of the Cloisters'
outstanding attractions, the magnificent trove of medieval art it
houses is another. Burgundian carvings, illuminated manuscripts and
one of the greatest of all early Netherlandish paintings are among
the treasures. But surely the most famous work is the set of
tapestries long known as ``The Hunt of the Unicorn.'' By Holland
Cotter.

   MAINE-SHAKERS (Undated) _ The peninsula encompassing the
downtown area of Portland, Maine., is a pleasantly compact place,
with neighborhoods that invite strolling and a harbor full of
islands reached by a ferry ride that can feel like a vacation in
itself. The chance to visit such a manageable maritime city and do
a little exploring along the coast nearby lured my wife, Margaret,
and me on a recent weekend. But we also went out of curiosity about
a living link to an unusual chapter in American religious history.
For more than two centuries, a Shaker community has made its home
on a farmstead less than an hour's drive away from Portland, and
the six believers living there now are the last remnant of this

   NY-OUTDOOR-DANCE (New York) _ A young girl dressed in a

stage beneath the Queensborough Bridge in the late 1960s. Seven
shambling young avant-gardists spread the 1970s gospel of
fashionably untutored and untheatrical dance performance on a city
sidewalk. Ballroom dancers spin and fly through countless nights in
the parks of New York City in the 1940s and '50s. Charming
photographs from ``Stepping Out: A Century of Dance in New York
City Parks,'' an exhibition at the Central Park Arsenal Building,
suggest that outdoor dance performances have long been with us. But
those performances have changed a great deal, to judge by the
attractions offered by festivals this summer in the city and
beyond. By Jennifer Dunning.

`LOLITA' FINALLY FINDS A WILLING PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. - Cable television has also become a home for
projects that the mainstream movie industry can't accommodate. On
Sunday, Showtime will premiere director Adrian Lyne's adaptation of
Vladimir Nobokov's 1954 novel, ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobokov's story is about a middle-age college professor's
obsessive romantic relationship with a teenage girl. Made as a
feature film two years ago, it failed to find a distributor that
would play it in theaters. (Lyne's deal with Showtime allows for a
limited theatrical release).
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Irons (``Reversal of Fortune,'' '`The Man in the Iron
Mask``) plays the professor, Humbert Humbert. Newcomer Dominique
Swain, a Malibu High School senior, plays the title character.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Stanley Kubrick directed an earlier adaptation,
starring James Mason and Sue Lyon, but Lyne's directing credits _
which include such slick, sexually charged movies as ``Fatal
Attraction'' and ``Indecent Proposal'' _ made this version suspect
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   There are many interpretations of Nabokov's book, of course. Not
all of them say it's just about titillation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's about many things, like any great work,'' said
Irons, who was interviewed via satellite by members of the
Television Critics Association, meeting here recently for their
twice annual TV publicity tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tragedy. I think it's a love story. I think
it's a portrait of America at a certain time. It has many levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any great work, you can take it for what you want. For
me, because I was the protagonist, it is a love story, and a
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little wary of playing Humbert Humbert because I felt
I played enough oddballs for one career. And so I fought against it
for a while. Adrian was very passionate that I should do it, which
is very flattering, and then accused me of being politically
correct by turning it down, which made me think because I felt that
one of the functions of the arts is to stir up debate, to make
people question things in life, and standards, and make people see
situations from a different viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I felt, `This is a film that should be made.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Making it might've been as difficult as getting it distributed.
Swain was 15 during filming. Accompanied on the set at all times by
her mother, Swain couldn't directly participate in many of the more
intimate scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's technically illegal to portray some such scenes
with an adult body double standing in for a minor. Lyne told the
critics that he spent six weeks in an editing room, with an
attorney at his side, to deliver a legally releasable film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, from my point of view, incredibly difficult, but
incredibly useful, that difficulty, in that I was supposed to be
obsessed with somebody, who, of course, I couldn't be obsessed
with,'' said Irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you're acting, it's a strange sort of thing. You play
with reality. And this was a reality I couldn't play with, so I
felt like somebody said to me, `Try and do ``Raging Bull,'' but
don't hit the guy, and certainly don't hurt the guy, and really
don't even touch the guy. Don't even think about touching the guy.
But make it look as if you're killing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite difficult, but, of course, useful because
Humbert was aware that what he was doing was damaging, that what he
was doing was wrong. And so I was able to use that difficulty. But
it wasn't an easy shoot.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   OAXACA, Mexico _ On the eve of Mexico's gubernatorial elections
here, it was business as usual down at the offices of the
Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   Three old farmers in weather-worn hats sat patiently waiting for
their turn to talk to party representatives. They needed an
electric water pump for their town, and they were turning to those
who they believed knew best how to get it for them.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the men will do what they do every election day:
They will vote for the candidate of the PRI, the same political
party that has dominated life here for the last 70 years and, for
many, is still synonymous with government and country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other parties say they don't have the money to help us,''
shrugged Celso Moreno, 75, who views the PRI -- not an impartial
public sector -- as the generous entity that built a high school in
his town and is now paving roads.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political landscape is shifting dramatically and
becoming more pluralistic with each election. Yet for many Mexicans
a vote against the PRI is still unfathomable, even unpatriotic.
Sunday's showdown in the southern state of Oaxaca (pronounced
Wa-HA-ka), will test the PRI's strength -- and its grip on the
party faithful -- as its candidate for governor competes with a
strong challenger from Mexico's burgeoning left-center movement,
the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   PRI contender Jose Murat is a party loyalist and senator who has
an edge in the polls. The PRD's Hector Sanchez is also a senator
and a full-blooded Zapotec Indian, a heritage that matters in a
state of extreme poverty where 40 percent of three million
residents speak an Indian language.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez views his candidacy as the result of 25 years of fierce
grassroots Indian struggle against the PRI, whose patronage he
believes has failed miserably to meet the needs of Oaxaca's poorest
Indians. Sanchez was one of the original leaders of a militant
anti-PRI organization, the Worker, Peasant, Student Coalition of
the Isthmus (COSEI), which fights for basic services and political
plurality.
</P>
<P>
   The group claims that 50 of its members have been assassinated
and more than 600 jailed on various bogus charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation only began to change with the birth of the PRD
in 1989,'' said Sanchez, who was himself jailed and forced to leave
the state to save his life in the late 1970s. The party, Sanchez
said, has given many disgruntled Indians whose living conditions
have deteriorated a vehicle for political expression.
</P>
<P>
   When Oaxacans went to the polls in 1992 to select federal
deputies, for example, the PRD captured only 10 percent of the
vote. Last year that figure leaped to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great civic awakening among people who are
tired of lies and abandonment,'' Sanchez said in an interview with
the Cox News Service. He said poverty has become so grinding some
Oaxacans have chosen ``the wrong path'' and joined the armed
Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), a mysterious Marxist guerrilla
group that has skirmished with the Mexican Army in Oaxaca and
neighboring Guerrero state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has only created more repression, and less democracy,''
Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   And bad publicity for the PRD, which the PRI has sought to link
to the guerrillas. In a PRI election ad aired on local radio
stations, listeners are treated to fiery PRD speeches designed to
portray the leftist opposition as irresponsible and violent.
``Don't get burned by the sun,'' a voice warns, referring to the
party's Aztec sun symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the PRD imported some of its top national leaders to
attend a closing rally and boost Sanchez's profile. Many in a
throng of supporters were Indians who wore traditional Zapotec
clothing, and Sanchez offered part of a campaign speech in Zapotec,
which is his native language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI doesn't work anymore. We need a change,'' said
supporter Ignacio Morales, a 68-year-old peasant wearing leather
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   He said PRI officials in his hometown of Salina Cruz(CQ) used to
``sell'' water to residents. He grew weary of the corrupt practice
and supported the COSEI, which he credits with fighting for basic
water delivery to homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Morales said, he receives water twice a week. But he still
only makes about 25 pesos -- less than $3 -- a day, and he doesn't
feel the PRI cares about his plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of hope that Hector will win, although people
believe the PRI is ready to unleash fraud on Sunday,'' added Aurora
Pineda, a COSEI loyalist for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD has complained that the PRI is up to old tricks, out
buying votes by offering bundles of money while also engaging in
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he was barred from entering San Agustin Loxicha, a
rural town, by masked PRI supporters who gave him a letter
declaring that ``we do not want any incursions from any other party
than the Official Party'' because the other parties ``only come to
provoke problems and divisiveness among our Indian brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he doesn't believe fair elections can be held under
such circumstances, and that fraud is sure to occur.
</P>
<P>
   PRI campaign spokesman Carlos Velasco dismissed the allegations
as sour grapes because the PRI is ahead in the polls. ``When the
PRD won in Mexico City last year, nobody complained there was
fraud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Velasco also said the PRD has been hurt by its association with
the COSEI, which many Oaxacans view as too radical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the triumph of the PRI this Sunday will be very
clear,'' Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, during a separate round of gubernatorial races, the
PRI proved it can make a comeback from where it previously lost
ground. In the border state of Chihuahua, its candidate recaptured
the governor's seat from the more conservative Party of National
Action (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, it is expected to win the governor's race in
Veracruz, but it is fighting a close race in Aguascalientes state
against a popular PAN candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Also on July 5, the PRI lost a governor's seat in Zacatecas
state to the PRD. But the PRD's candidate had only recently
defected to the PRD from the PRI because he was angry that the
party brass failed to select him as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for Sanchez in Oaxaca would be a much greater triumph
for the PRD's peasant supporters. But even if Sanchez loses the PRD
stands to pick up more local deputies on Sunday and gain more
experience in the electoral arena in a critical state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remember that if the coin falls on one side it doesn't
mean that the other one disappears,'' warned the generally pro-PRI
columnist Juan Ruiz Healy, writing in Novedades, a Mexico City
newspaper.

BARNEY'S VERY, VERY, VERY BAD WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA and TERRY LEE GOODRICH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For a dinosaur who lifted his theme song
from ``This Old Man,'' you could say it's a case of The Chicken
coming home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   Barney, TV's purplest and most litigious Tyrannosaurus rex, lost
a copyright suit on Wednesday to a feathered foe.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any barnyard bird, mind you, but The Famous San Diego
Chicken, a celebrity fowl known to pummel a Barney look-alike as
part of his comedy routines at professional sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Even before a Fort Worth federal judge threw out the suit, it
was a bad week for Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity was slipped into a news release touting his new
sing-along cassettes as ``perfect for a short or long car trip
anywhere!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having those little s---- clamoring to stop at the
next McDonald's, or those interminable whines of `When we gonna get
there?' or `I really gotta go, Mommy,' plug their ears with these
latest banalities ... and you're guaranteed to arrive free of
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Barney says computer hackers targeted his Los Angeles-based PR
firm, Nina Stern Public Relations Co., and inserted the naughty
language into the news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too close to it to think it's funny,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Barney didn't think The Chicken was funny either when, in 1994,
he added a purple-and-green reptile to the antics he'd been
performing for two decades at professional sports matches.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-minute act _ one of more than 100 routines The Chicken
hatches at an average game _ the Barney clone joins him for a rap
dance. After a clumsy start, the dinosaur outdances ]The Chicken.
The bested bird turns him into a prehistoric punching bag, but not
before Mr. I-Love-You-You-Love-Me throws a few punches himself.
</P>
<P>
   The free-lance _ make that free-range _ mascot has performed the
routine all over the country, including at Texas Rangers games.
</P>
<P>
   The Richardson, Texas, company behind Barney, Lyons Partnership,
sued The Chicken, a k a Ted Giannoulas. The company alleged that
the routine violated its copyright and trademark on the ``purple,
highly stylized Tyrannosaurus rex-type dinosaur character with a
friendly mien, a swath of green down his chest and stomach, and
green spots on his back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern has always been that young children in an
audience at a sporting event don't realize it's not the real Barney
and some of those children become visibly upset when they see
Barney beaten up,'' said Kelly Lane, public relations director for
Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge John McBryde said the routine is clearly
parody and is not likely to cause trademark confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``By placing the putative Barney character in an ego-driven,
urban-style rap dance competition and wrestling match, he portrays
the character in an original and unexpected light,'' McBryde wrote.
`` ... Spectators at sporting events would not normally expect to
see the real Barney and the Chicken performing together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken could not be reached to comment. He was performing
at a minor-league baseball game on the East Coast, where, his
lawyer said, he was likely doing the Barney routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will continue to do so, so long as it makes people laugh,''
said Kenneth Fitzgerald, The Chicken's San Diego attorney. ``The
show must go on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   COZUMEL, Mexico _ When huge cruise ships belly up to a new
concrete pier off this Caribbean island, it's a bitter reminder to
Dora Uribe of an opportunity lost.
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity, she says, to use the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) to mount an 11th-hour campaign to stop the pier
and save Paradise Reef. Environmentalists had long argued that the
reef would be broken to pieces and eventually destroyed by visiting
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Uribe and other Mexican environmentalists were
the first to file a complaint with a special commission established
by NAFTA's environmental side agreement. By arguing that Mexican
laws had been ignored or violated in the pier's planning, the
petitioners had hoped the commission would fine or at least
chastise Mexico enough to embarrass officials into stopping the
pier's construction.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting nearly two years, they received ``a beautiful''
report from the commission last October, peppered with facts to
back up the environmentalists' position, Uribe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there wasn't one recommendation,'' said Uribe, a lawyer on
this small Mexican island 40 miles south of Cancun. ``The only
conclusion you can make . . . is that this is another bureaucracy
with no power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cozumel experience is one of the hard lessons learned by
environmentalists who have tried to use the NAFTA side agreement to
ensure that laws in each country are followed, not flouted or
downgraded, as free trade spreads in Mexico, the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal-based Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC)
is charged with reviewing citizen complaints in each country, but
the process doesn't allow the commission to penalize a nation for
failing to enforce its own laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another institution set up to accompany NAFTA, which went into
effect in 1994, is the San Antonio, Texas-based North American
Development Bank (NADBank), established to make or secure loans for
water and sewage treatment projects in Mexico and the United States
that would clean up the troubled border region.
</P>
<P>
   Although NADBank counts 21 projects for which it is actively
helping find financing, not a single water or sewage-treatment
plant has been built using a bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank also has a sister institution, the Border
Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC), a binational agency
based in Juarez, Mexico, that reviews applications for NADBank
assistance and decides if the proposals are well-designed and
financially feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The BECC, critics say, has limited power because it doesn't have
purview over toxic waste, pollution that threatens the operation of
sewage treatment plants built along the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the CEC in Montreal, director Greg Block said, ``I'm very
aware there are mixed and divisive views among the public'' on the
environmental side agreement's efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, he said, was not granted the power through NAFTA
to take a side when reviewing citizens' complaints, although some
people may have mistakenly believed this.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reviews ``let the facts speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Block defended the CEC, arguing that it is successfully
pursuing a North American-wide program to phase out dangerous
pesticides and funding small environmental research projects and
businesses in each country. And, he added, the CEC has had some
success responding to environmental crises.
</P>
<P>
   When 40,000 migratory birds in Mexico perished in 1995 at a
poisoned reservoir, Block said, the CEC investigated -- ``with a
good deal of cooperation from Mexico'' -- and recommended methods
to curtail pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, the NADBank has found its work stymied, in part,
because private financing for infrastructure projects proved
difficult to secure and Mexican municipalities were virtually
blocked from accepting loans by federal constraints. What's more,
few Mexican cities have experience at instituting user fees to
guarantee that loans for projects would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
   The $400 million that Mexico and the United States have
contributed to the bank so far is insufficient to directly finance
costly infrastructure projects, according to NADBank director
Victor Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is still trying to obtain loans, but it has retooled
its mission.
</P>
<P>
   It is now focusing heavily on administering a program offering
$170 million in grants supplied by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to help get critical projects built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without grants, this system doesn't work,'' said Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're barely beginning,'' he added. ``If we haven't built
anything in five years, I'll be on the critics' side.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage are still
flowing into rivers and oceans off Texas and California, along with
toxic chemicals from the growing number of ``maquiladoras,'' or
Mexican export factories.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people living along the border lack basic
water delivery and sewage disposal systems. Environmentalists worry
that without careful planning, projects to address these festering
problems won't keep up with border population growth that's
expected to double by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
   All of the NAFTA environmental agencies enjoy defenders --
including environmentalists -- who say that the institutions are
vital to free and fair trade, and must be given a chance to mature.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank is working on relaxing Mexican bureaucratic
obstacles that have prevented municipalities from getting direct
loans, said Mark Spalding, a University of California at San Diego
lecturer who wrote a report on the bank called ``Promising
Potential'' for the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The CEC, Spalding acknowledged, has no power to stop
environmentally-damaging projects, something that is ``one of the
big criticisms.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, media coverage over the CEC probe into the
Cozumel pier ``embarrassed Mexico,'' and has paved the way for more
transparent reviews for other controversial proposals in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Alanis, director of the Mexican Center for Environmental
Law, was among those who filed the citizen complaint over the
Cozumel pier.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned to the CEC to register other complaints, he said,
because the commission's international spotlight provides objective
information that encourages wider debate in Mexico. The CEC's
attention to the pier, he added, forced Mexico to improve its laws
to protect endangered reefs and prompted an environmental plan for
the island of Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, was disappointed that after many months of waiting
-- while construction went ahead on the pier -- ``you end with
this: a report, only facts, and no conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Seligman of the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C. is more
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was sold a bill of goods (with the NAFTA side
agreement),'' he said. ``As a general matter, there was more
promise than could possibly be delivered by these institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank was a flawed concept, Seligman said, because it was
expected to lure private capital to finance, in Mexico, the type of
infrastructure projects that Americans had to build with government
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another underlying problem, he said, was that border factories
in Mexico -- many of them American _ are not being sufficiently
taxed by Mexico to contribute to water and sewage projects in the
communities where they dump waste and use resources.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Seligman said, United States EPA money, ``American
taxpayers' money,'' is now being used to help finance projects
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrisome, Seligman and other environmentalists agree, is
the specter that NAFTA-backed infrastructure projects along the
Texas-California-Arizona border with Mexico will suffer because of
toxic chemicals, explosive population and industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego-Tijuana border region, where millions of
gallons of raw sewage from Tijuana are dumped into the ocean each
day, a highly touted binational sewage treatment plant that opened
earlier this year to dispose of Tijuana's waste is failing acute
toxicity tests.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: sludge from Tijuana contains a toxic stew of various
industrial chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and other agencies managing the plant, which was started
before NAFTA, are conducting tests to figure out what the poisons
are, and will need cooperation from Tijuana to identify sources and
prevent businesses from dumping chemicals into sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   The toxic substances ``could be coming from U.S. companies in
Tijuana,'' said Elizabeth Borowic, EPA's project manager for the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects supported by the BECC and the NADBank is an
upgraded sewage-treatment center in Tijuana that currently treats
only about half the sewage it receives.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA-backed Tijuana project is slated to be connected to
the San Diego binational plant, but the plan will end up a disaster
if authorities in Mexico don't come up with an adequate program to
prevent toxic dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are upset because they predicted the San Diego
binational plant would be overwhelmed by toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were really expecting to use this as a model for
binational cooperation,'' said Cesar Luna of San Diego's
Environmental Health Coalition. ``It would like a jewel of NAFTA.
Instead, it's like a cubic zirconium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has no right-to-know laws that require public disclosure
of toxic substances, and in the past it has been reluctant to
reveal that information publicly on the American side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years after NAFTA,'' Luna said, ``this sort of thing
should have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Texas-Mexico border, raw sewage is still flowing into the
Rio Grande river despite a sewage-treatment plant inaugurated in
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in 1996 with much fanfare from both
countries' governments.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators discovered that the plant, which President Clinton
cited as a NAFTA success story, will require millions of dollars
more in construction costs so that it can capture sludge from
growing communities that were not properly connected to the system
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. authorities are trying to determine how to pay
for the costs, given that Nuevo Laredo is financially-strapped.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects planned for the border cities of Juarez, Acuna,
Reynosa and Matamoros could face similar problems if such obstacles
are not anticipated, said Cyrus Reed of the Texas Center for Policy
Studies in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building things now to take care of problems that have
accumulated for years,'' Reed said. ``But the growth on the border
continues.''

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ Norberto Cordoba says he was fired from Han
Young, a Korean-owned auto parts factory here, for a simple reason:
``They told me I was a 'political man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old welder didn't take his unjust dismissal lightly.
</P>
<P>
   He, and Mexican and American labor activists have taken his
grievance and a range of others alleging unfair treatment at the
Han Young export, or ``maquiladora'' factory in Tijuana, all the
way to Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a high-profile battle that is dampening free-trade
support in the U.S. capital, straining U.S.-Mexican relations and
testing a promise that the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) would benefit -- rather than exploit -- laborers in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   When NAFTA was enacted in 1994, a special side agreement set up
offices in the labor departments of the United States, Mexico and
Canada where people could submit complaints charging that member
countries were failing to enforce their own labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Kantor, former U.S. Trade Representative in the Clinton
administration, promised then that the side agreement would have
``real teeth.'' But NAFTA opponents were skeptical because the pact
-- the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation -- included
only limited provisions for penalizing a country for refusing to
change bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mexican and U.S. labor activists have been teaming up
to submit complaints and use the agreement as a forum for
spotlighting abuses, especially in Mexico's maquiladora industry.
Maquiladoras employ about 1 million people in nearly 3,000
factories that assemble export goods for U.S. consumers. Han Young,
for example, welds truck chassis for Hyundai Precision America, the
automobile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work, if labor rights are not respected, then
this was all a deception and the labor agreement was simply a way
to protect cheap labor,'' said Tijuana labor organizer Enrique
Hernandez, a leader in the Han Young dispute who has been
threatened with arrest for his activities and whose office has been
vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department has received nine petitions alleging
unchecked abuses in Mexico, ranging from discrimination against
pregnant women in maquiladoras to reprisal against independent
labor unions attempting to organize in these factories.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Labor Ministry, for its part, is investigating
complaints filed against the United States, including one alleging
that U.S. officials have failed to protect Mexican apple workers in
Washington state from anti-union intimidation and health and safety
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young complaint is twofold: It charges that Mexico
failed to enforce laws protecting health and safety, as well as the
workers' constitutional right to organize an independent union.
</P>
<P>
   Independent unions are a sensitive subject in Mexico's
maquiladoras, a sector dominated only by unions that are affiliated
with Mexico's ruling political party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). Han Young's maquiladora workers are
among the first in Mexico to successfully obtain recognition for
their independent union.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy, according to an ongoing U.S. probe into
Han Young. Today, despite requests from U.S. officials to address
harassment of the Han Young workers, the independent union is still
battling to represent the employees at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement depends on cooperation, and the Mexican
government is not cooperating,'' said Mary Tong, director of the
San Diego-based Support Committee for Maquiladora Workers, one of
the groups that filed the Han Young complaint.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Hernandez and a group of Han Young workers
upset with working conditions and wages as low as $8 a day tried to
organize their independent union. They were foiled, they say, by
the company, which dismissed sympathetic workers and hired and
intimidated new ones. In addition, the Tijuana labor authorities
conducted poorly-run union elections and then refused to recognize
an independent union victory.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote that upheld the independent union's victory was
held after federal government intervention -- and after President
Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo discussed the Han
Young dispute at the urging of U.S. House Democratic Whip David E.
Bonior of Michigan, a NAFTA opponent who has seized on Han Young as
an example of worker abuse in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the independent union, assisted by American labor
activists, filed its complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor.
And in late April, the department issued a diplomatic but
devastating report that criticized Mexico and backed up the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The report challenged Mexican officials' impartiality and
commitment to enforcement of its laws, and found that
government-affiliated unions enjoyed more legal protection than
independent unions. It also recommended that Mexico's labor
secretary meet with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's initial response was hostile, according to published
reports, with the Mexican Labor Ministry accusing the United States
of taking sides and a Tijuana labor official calling the report ``a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials are silent on the matter now, saying they are
waiting for a second report on health and safety at Han Young to be
issued by the United States before commenting. No meeting between
the labor secretaries has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the request for consultations, the relationship between
the independent union and Tijuana labor officials has deteriorated
further. Police have clashed with pro-union workers, attempting to
break up a strike that a judge declared was legal under Mexican
law. After a government-affiliated union said it wanted to regain
its hold on the factory, officials held two more questionable
elections whose results were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Labor organizer Hernandez had to obtain a court order to prevent
Tijuana authorities from arresting him. Anti-American banners were
hung up at the plant, urging ``gringos'' to stay out of Han Young.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior issued a blunt statement from Washington, accusing Han
Young management, Tijuana labor officials and the Mexican
government of ``a systematic effort to deny Han Young workers their
right to an independent union through harassment, intimidation and
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the outcome of the dispute ``a test for the Mexican
government,'' and warned that it ``could have long-term
implications for U.S. trade policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior also used the Han Young case to defeat President
Clinton's bid for continued ``fast-track'' authority to negotiate
new free-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young case is so sensitive that Irasema Garza, the
secretary of the office that produced the U.S. report, won't
comment on it other than to say that she is concerned and
monitoring developments.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. Labor official familiar with the case said despite
the chilly reception from Mexico, the dispute shows how the NAFTA
side agreement is working to pressure Mexico to enforce its own
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That union that is currently struggling (in Tijuana) right now
would not exist were it not for the process,'' said the official,
who asked not to be identified. ``I can't say it any clearer than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Garza said, ``The Mexican government, to be quite
honest with you, has been cautious (about the side agreement). I
think this is not an experience they have enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The second report on Han Young, focusing on alleged health and
safety violations and due to be released before summer's end, could
be even more explosive than the first.
</P>
<P>
   These accusations, if left unaddressed by Mexican officials,
could lead to U.S. trade sanctions against Mexico, including up to
tens of millions of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA countries can only face sanctions if they are found to
have flagrantly violated their own child-labor, health and safety
or minimum-wage laws. There are no provisions for sanctions for
violating the right to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Garza acknowledged that getting to sanctions could take years of
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is designed in such a way to try to convince a
government to do the right thing . . . ,'' she said. ``Ultimately,
that's what this is about. It's not about penalizing governments.
It really is about governments being convinced to enforce their own
labor laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though sanctions are unlikely, Garza defended the NAFTA
side agreement for opening up ``public debate'' in Mexico through
public hearings that have been held to gather testimony on various
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on union organizing in Mexico City, she said, ``the
workers would come up to me and say, 'Miss Garza, this is historic
. . . We don't have access to our government officials like you do
in the United States. This is an opportunity we've never had.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said Mexico, through a new five-year plan, is addressing
problems that have been raised some complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Gualde, who studies maquiladoras at the College of the
Northern Border in Tijuana, said the NAFTA side agreement has
``symbolic import'' and puts companies under pressure to comply
with existing laws or face public criticism, especially bad reviews
in Washington, D.C. and in the American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of the substantial change,'' he said, ``has to come
from within Mexico itself.''

projects have been built yet using bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Border Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC)
</P>
<P>
   Based in Juarez, Mexico, the commission is supposed to recommend
which water and sewage treatment proposals the NADBank should help
finance. The commission has no purview over toxic waste, which
threatens to hinder sewage treatment plants being built along the

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many do-it-yourselfers overdo texturing and create wall surfaces
that look like cake frosting. The key to creating a pleasing
textured surface is to use restraint and subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Texturing consists of troweling on a layer of texturing
compound, called ``mud'' by professionals, then manipulating it
with shaping tools, like long-napped rollers and long-bristled
brushes, that can be purchased at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   Texturing compound is simply a binder, usually plaster or paint,
with added aggregate materials. The most common aggregate is silica
sand. Other aggregates, like glitter and mica chips, are added to
catch the light and give sparkle to the final finish. You can buy
ready-made texturing compounds at paint stores and home centers.
Paint texturing compounds can be applied with a brush or roller.
Other compounds, like veneer plaster (available through mail order
suppliers), are thick and must be troweled onto the surface.
</P>
<P>
   You can also make your own texturing compound by adding
aggregate to standard drywall joint compound. The amount of
aggregate you add depends on the textural effect that you are
trying to create. For very subtle patterns, you may not need to add
any aggregate. Do not use taping compound for texturing. It is not
formulated for application in thick layers and will crack as it
dries.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to estimate the amount of compound needed for a
job because the quantity depends largely on the thickness of the
application. Commercial preparations usually have coverage data
printed on the label. If you mix your own mud, figure that a
5-gallon bucket will cover about 32 square feet if applied about
1/4-inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Texturing compound can be used to cover minor discrepancies and
blemishes in a wall surface. On newly installed drywall, all the
nailheads and joints should be spackled and taped over. Also prime
or paint the wallboard with an alkyd or latex-based primer.
</P>
<P>
   Wash painted surfaces with a mild detergent to remove all dust,
dirt and grease. Remove any mildew by scrubbing the surface with a
bleach solution (one part bleach to three parts clean water). Wear
rubber gloves and safety goggles when using this solution. Stains
should be painted with a primer to prevent them from bleeding.
Finally, apply a liquid bonding agent to the entire surface. This
will help the texturing compound adhere to the surface. Depending
upon the consistency of the mud, you can apply it with a brush,
roller or trowel.
</P>
<P>
   Two popular troweled textures are the California and the
Spanish. To create the California texture, load the trowel with a
generous amount of mud, then apply it to the wall in a series of
short, random passes. Do not attempt to blend the strokes; instead
allow them to show as a vague, artless pattern. When you've covered
about half the wall surface, wait about five minutes for the
compound to set slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Then go over the surface again with a clean wet trowel, this
time sweeping the trowel in regular vertical strokes. Working from
bottom to top, skim the surface lightly to knock down the high
spots and subdue the pattern. Finish the rest of the wall in the
same manner.
</P>
<P>
   With the Spanish pattern, the mud is applied, then textured with
a round, soft-bristled, commercial windowwasher's brush. Press the
brush into the wet mud, twist it in place, then pull it away. The
result will be a series of peaks in a random, swirling pattern.
Texture the surface, then allow a few minutes setting time before
skimming over it with a clean, wet trowel.
</P>
<P>
   When the surface is dry, you can paint it, but allow at least
three days' drying time. Use a long-napped roller to apply the
paint.

ROY DISNEY: THE MAN BEHIND WALT AND MICKEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walt Disney could have attributed much of his amazing career and
business success to one character _ and it wasn't Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Roy Disney, was the financial genius behind the
entertainment mogul.
</P>
<P>
   From the day in 1923 when he left the Midwest to join his
brother in California, Walt was dreaming big expensive dreams. Roy
went looking for money for his little brother while trying to keep
Walt's creative perfectionism in check with accounting realities.
</P>
<P>
   Roy ``was the bookkeeping man, the money man, the man trying to
keep Walt under control,'' an early Disney art director said.
``Walt was like a spinning flywheel, spinning revolutions that kept
the thing going. When Walt wanted to spend everything on the next
picture, Roy would say, `Let's keep a little sinking fund _ in case
we sink.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And sink they often did. It is hard to imagine, considering the
company's golden touch today, that Disney classics such as
``Bambi'' and ``Fantasia'' were originally box office flops.
Start-up financing problems, a garage-based workplace and
stress-related illnesses made the business look like most typical
entrepreneurial efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Later, union strikes, budget overruns and World War II would
create major headaches for the struggling studio.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney story is chronicled in a fascinating new book,
``Building a Company: Roy O. Disney and the Creation of an
Entertainment Empire'' (Hyperion, 359 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned Hollywood author Bob Thomas, who also wrote a biography
of Walt, uses sources including friends, relatives, co-workers and
the Disney Archives, a collection begun in 1970 by UCLA
bibliographer David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a candid, close look at the other pillar of the
Disney empire, a man few knew was so integral to the success of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy O. Disney's life was as private as his younger brother's
was public,'' Thomas writes.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only dichotomy between the two brothers, who
were 8 1/2 years apart in age. Their differences led to countless
arguments, even times of estrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``During one basic disagreement late in their lives, they did
not speak to each other for more than two years, communicating only
through emissaries,'' Thomas writes. ``The Disney family was Irish
and subject to stubborn temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   But dispite the friction and business fluctuations, the two
brothers worked magic.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas documents the creation of the first Mickey Mouse cartoon;
the first feature-length cartoon, ``Snow White;'' and the
Disneyland theme park. He has an eye for story and detail, making
readers feel as if they are in on the real moments.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomas chronicles Roy Disney's pivotal role for perhaps
the first time, he concentrates more on each brother's influences
on the company, as well as those of their wives, parents and
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Roy's family ties that got him into his brother's
business so much as his health. Roy had a bout with tuberculosis,
and at 30 could not get a job because of the stigma the disease
carried at that time, Thomas writes.
</P>
<P>
   Then Walt showed up.
</P>
<P>
   As Roy recalls in the book: ``I was in the hospital at Sawtelle.
By correspondence (Walt) sold somebody in New York on a series of
pictures. One night he found his way to my bed, which was on a row
of beds on a screened porch. It was eleven or twelve o'clock at
night, and he shaked me awake and showed me a telegram of
acceptance of his offers. He said `What can I do now? Can you come
out of here and help me to get this started?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Roy left the next day, against medical advice, and spent the
next 48 years helping his brother create the magic of Disney.

<P>
   COZUMEL, Mexico _ When huge cruise ships belly up to a new
concrete pier off this Caribbean island, it's a bitter reminder to
Dora Uribe of an opportunity lost.
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity, she says, to use the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) to mount an 11th-hour campaign to stop the pier
and save Paradise Reef. Environmentalists had long argued that the
reef would be broken to pieces and eventually destroyed by visiting
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Uribe and other Mexican environmentalists were
the first to file a complaint with a special commission established
by NAFTA's environmental side agreement. By arguing that Mexican
laws had been ignored or violated in the pier's planning, the
petitioners had hoped the commission would fine or at least
chastise Mexico enough to embarrass officials into stopping the
pier's construction.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting nearly two years, they received ``a beautiful''
report from the commission last October, peppered with facts to
back up the environmentalists' position, Uribe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there wasn't one recommendation,'' said Uribe, a lawyer on
this small Mexican island 40 miles south of Cancun. ``The only
conclusion you can make . . . is that this is another bureaucracy
with no power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cozumel experience is one of the hard lessons learned by
environmentalists who have tried to use the NAFTA side agreement to
ensure that laws in each country are followed, not flouted or
downgraded, as free trade spreads in Mexico, the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal-based Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC)
is charged with reviewing citizen complaints in each country, but
the process doesn't allow the commission to penalize a nation for
failing to enforce its own laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another institution set up to accompany NAFTA, which went into
effect in 1994, is the San Antonio, Texas-based North American
Development Bank (NADBank), established to make or secure loans for
water and sewage treatment projects in Mexico and the United States
that would clean up the troubled border region.
</P>
<P>
   Although NADBank counts 21 projects for which it is actively
helping find financing, not a single water or sewage-treatment
plant has been built using a bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank also has a sister institution, the Border
Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC), a binational agency
based in Juarez, Mexico, that reviews applications for NADBank
assistance and decides if the proposals are well-designed and
financially feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The BECC, critics say, has limited power because it doesn't have
purview over toxic waste, pollution that threatens the operation of
sewage treatment plants built along the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the CEC in Montreal, director Greg Block said, ``I'm very
aware there are mixed and divisive views among the public'' on the
environmental side agreement's efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, he said, was not granted the power through NAFTA
to take a side when reviewing citizens' complaints, although some
people may have mistakenly believed this.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reviews ``let the facts speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Block defended the CEC, arguing that it is successfully
pursuing a North American-wide program to phase out dangerous
pesticides and funding small environmental research projects and
businesses in each country. And, he added, the CEC has had some
success responding to environmental crises.
</P>
<P>
   When 40,000 migratory birds in Mexico perished in 1995 at a
poisoned reservoir, Block said, the CEC investigated -- ``with a
good deal of cooperation from Mexico'' -- and recommended methods
to curtail pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, the NADBank has found its work stymied, in part,
because private financing for infrastructure projects proved
difficult to secure and Mexican municipalities were virtually
blocked from accepting loans by federal constraints. What's more,
few Mexican cities have experience at instituting user fees to
guarantee that loans for projects would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
   The $400 million that Mexico and the United States have
contributed to the bank so far is insufficient to directly finance
costly infrastructure projects, according to NADBank director
Victor Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is still trying to obtain loans, but it has retooled
its mission.
</P>
<P>
   It is now focusing heavily on administering a program offering
$170 million in grants supplied by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to help get critical projects built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without grants, this system doesn't work,'' said Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're barely beginning,'' he added. ``If we haven't built
anything in five years, I'll be on the critics' side.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage are still
flowing into rivers and oceans off Texas and California, along with
toxic chemicals from the growing number of ``maquiladoras,'' or
Mexican export factories.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people living along the border lack basic
water delivery and sewage disposal systems. Environmentalists worry
that without careful planning, projects to address these festering
problems won't keep up with border population growth that's
expected to double by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
   All of the NAFTA environmental agencies enjoy defenders --
including environmentalists -- who say that the institutions are
vital to free and fair trade, and must be given a chance to mature.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank is working on relaxing Mexican bureaucratic
obstacles that have prevented municipalities from getting direct
loans, said Mark Spalding, a University of California at San Diego
lecturer who wrote a report on the bank called ``Promising
Potential'' for the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The CEC, Spalding acknowledged, has no power to stop
environmentally-damaging projects, something that is ``one of the
big criticisms.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, media coverage over the CEC probe into the
Cozumel pier ``embarrassed Mexico,'' and has paved the way for more
transparent reviews for other controversial proposals in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Alanis, director of the Mexican Center for Environmental
Law, was among those who filed the citizen complaint over the
Cozumel pier.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned to the CEC to register other complaints, he said,
because the commission's international spotlight provides objective
information that encourages wider debate in Mexico. The CEC's
attention to the pier, he added, forced Mexico to improve its laws
to protect endangered reefs and prompted an environmental plan for
the island of Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, was disappointed that after many months of waiting
-- while construction went ahead on the pier -- ``you end with
this: a report, only facts, and no conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Seligman of the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C. is more
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was sold a bill of goods (with the NAFTA side
agreement),'' he said. ``As a general matter, there was more
promise than could possibly be delivered by these institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank was a flawed concept, Seligman said, because it was
expected to lure private capital to finance, in Mexico, the type of
infrastructure projects that Americans had to build with government
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another underlying problem, he said, was that border factories
in Mexico -- many of them American _ are not being sufficiently
taxed by Mexico to contribute to water and sewage projects in the
communities where they dump waste and use resources.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Seligman said, United States EPA money, ``American
taxpayers' money,'' is now being used to help finance projects
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrisome, Seligman and other environmentalists agree, is
the specter that NAFTA-backed infrastructure projects along the
Texas-California-Arizona border with Mexico will suffer because of
toxic chemicals, explosive population and industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego-Tijuana border region, where millions of
gallons of raw sewage from Tijuana are dumped into the ocean each
day, a highly touted binational sewage treatment plant that opened
earlier this year to dispose of Tijuana's waste is failing acute
toxicity tests.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: sludge from Tijuana contains a toxic stew of various
industrial chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and other agencies managing the plant, which was started
before NAFTA, are conducting tests to figure out what the poisons
are, and will need cooperation from Tijuana to identify sources and
prevent businesses from dumping chemicals into sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   The toxic substances ``could be coming from U.S. companies in
Tijuana,'' said Elizabeth Borowic, EPA's project manager for the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects supported by the BECC and the NADBank is an
upgraded sewage-treatment center in Tijuana that currently treats
only about half the sewage it receives.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA-backed Tijuana project is slated to be connected to
the San Diego binational plant, but the plan will end up a disaster
if authorities in Mexico don't come up with an adequate program to
prevent toxic dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are upset because they predicted the San Diego
binational plant would be overwhelmed by toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were really expecting to use this as a model for
binational cooperation,'' said Cesar Luna of San Diego's
Environmental Health Coalition. ``It would like a jewel of NAFTA.
Instead, it's like a cubic zirconium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has no right-to-know laws that require public disclosure
of toxic substances, and in the past it has been reluctant to
reveal that information publicly on the American side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years after NAFTA,'' Luna said, ``this sort of thing
should have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Texas-Mexico border, raw sewage is still flowing into the
Rio Grande river despite a sewage-treatment plant inaugurated in
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in 1996 with much fanfare from both
countries' governments.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators discovered that the plant, which President Clinton
cited as a NAFTA success story, will require millions of dollars
more in construction costs so that it can capture sludge from
growing communities that were not properly connected to the system
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. authorities are trying to determine how to pay
for the costs, given that Nuevo Laredo is financially-strapped.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects planned for the border cities of Juarez, Acuna,
Reynosa and Matamoros could face similar problems if such obstacles
are not anticipated, said Cyrus Reed of the Texas Center for Policy
Studies in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building things now to take care of problems that have
accumulated for years,'' Reed said. ``But the growth on the border
continues.''

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ Norberto Cordoba says he was fired from Han
Young, a Korean-owned auto parts factory here, for a simple reason:
``They told me I was a 'political man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old welder didn't take his unjust dismissal lightly.
</P>
<P>
   He, and Mexican and American labor activists have taken his
grievance and a range of others alleging unfair treatment at the
Han Young export, or ``maquiladora'' factory in Tijuana, all the
way to Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a high-profile battle that is dampening free-trade
support in the U.S. capital, straining U.S.-Mexican relations and
testing a promise that the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) would benefit -- rather than exploit -- laborers in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   When NAFTA was enacted in 1994, a special side agreement set up
offices in the labor departments of the United States, Mexico and
Canada where people could submit complaints charging that member
countries were failing to enforce their own labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Kantor, former U.S. Trade Representative in the Clinton
administration, promised then that the side agreement would have
``real teeth.'' But NAFTA opponents were skeptical because the pact
-- the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation -- included
only limited provisions for penalizing a country for refusing to
change bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mexican and U.S. labor activists have been teaming up
to submit complaints and use the agreement as a forum for
spotlighting abuses, especially in Mexico's maquiladora industry.
Maquiladoras employ about 1 million people in nearly 3,000
factories that assemble export goods for U.S. consumers. Han Young,
for example, welds truck chassis for Hyundai Precision America, the
automobile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work, if labor rights are not respected, then
this was all a deception and the labor agreement was simply a way
to protect cheap labor,'' said Tijuana labor organizer Enrique
Hernandez, a leader in the Han Young dispute who has been
threatened with arrest for his activities and whose office has been
vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department has received nine petitions alleging
unchecked abuses in Mexico, ranging from discrimination against
pregnant women in maquiladoras to reprisal against independent
labor unions attempting to organize in these factories.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Labor Ministry, for its part, is investigating
complaints filed against the United States, including one alleging
that U.S. officials have failed to protect Mexican apple workers in
Washington state from anti-union intimidation and health and safety
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young complaint is twofold: It charges that Mexico
failed to enforce laws protecting health and safety, as well as the
workers' constitutional right to organize an independent union.
</P>
<P>
   Independent unions are a sensitive subject in Mexico's
maquiladoras, a sector dominated only by unions that are affiliated
with Mexico's ruling political party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). Han Young's maquiladora workers are
among the first in Mexico to successfully obtain recognition for
their independent union.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy, according to an ongoing U.S. probe into
Han Young. Today, despite requests from U.S. officials to address
harassment of the Han Young workers, the independent union is still
battling to represent the employees at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement depends on cooperation, and the Mexican
government is not cooperating,'' said Mary Tong, director of the
San Diego-based Support Committee for Maquiladora Workers, one of
the groups that filed the Han Young complaint.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Hernandez and a group of Han Young workers
upset with working conditions and wages as low as $8 a day tried to
organize their independent union. They were foiled, they say, by
the company, which dismissed sympathetic workers and hired and
intimidated new ones. In addition, the Tijuana labor authorities
conducted poorly-run union elections and then refused to recognize
an independent union victory.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote that upheld the independent union's victory was
held after federal government intervention -- and after President
Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo discussed the Han
Young dispute at the urging of U.S. House Democratic Whip David E.
Bonior of Michigan, a NAFTA opponent who has seized on Han Young as
an example of worker abuse in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the independent union, assisted by American labor
activists, filed its complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor.
And in late April, the department issued a diplomatic but
devastating report that criticized Mexico and backed up the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The report challenged Mexican officials' impartiality and
commitment to enforcement of its laws, and found that
government-affiliated unions enjoyed more legal protection than
independent unions. It also recommended that Mexico's labor
secretary meet with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's initial response was hostile, according to published
reports, with the Mexican Labor Ministry accusing the United States
of taking sides and a Tijuana labor official calling the report ``a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials are silent on the matter now, saying they are
waiting for a second report on health and safety at Han Young to be
issued by the United States before commenting. No meeting between
the labor secretaries has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the request for consultations, the relationship between
the independent union and Tijuana labor officials has deteriorated
further. Police have clashed with pro-union workers, attempting to
break up a strike that a judge declared was legal under Mexican
law. After a government-affiliated union said it wanted to regain
its hold on the factory, officials held two more questionable
elections whose results were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Labor organizer Hernandez had to obtain a court order to prevent
Tijuana authorities from arresting him. Anti-American banners were
hung up at the plant, urging ``gringos'' to stay out of Han Young.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior issued a blunt statement from Washington, accusing Han
Young management, Tijuana labor officials and the Mexican
government of ``a systematic effort to deny Han Young workers their
right to an independent union through harassment, intimidation and
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the outcome of the dispute ``a test for the Mexican
government,'' and warned that it ``could have long-term
implications for U.S. trade policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior also used the Han Young case to defeat President
Clinton's bid for continued ``fast-track'' authority to negotiate
new free-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young case is so sensitive that Irasema Garza, the
secretary of the office that produced the U.S. report, won't
comment on it other than to say that she is concerned and
monitoring developments.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. Labor official familiar with the case said despite
the chilly reception from Mexico, the dispute shows how the NAFTA
side agreement is working to pressure Mexico to enforce its own
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That union that is currently struggling (in Tijuana) right now
would not exist were it not for the process,'' said the official,
who asked not to be identified. ``I can't say it any clearer than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Garza said, ``The Mexican government, to be quite
honest with you, has been cautious (about the side agreement). I
think this is not an experience they have enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The second report on Han Young, focusing on alleged health and
safety violations and due to be released before summer's end, could
be even more explosive than the first.
</P>
<P>
   These accusations, if left unaddressed by Mexican officials,
could lead to U.S. trade sanctions against Mexico, including up to
tens of millions of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA countries can only face sanctions if they are found to
have flagrantly violated their own child-labor, health and safety
or minimum-wage laws. There are no provisions for sanctions for
violating the right to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Garza acknowledged that getting to sanctions could take years of
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is designed in such a way to try to convince a
government to do the right thing . . . ,'' she said. ``Ultimately,
that's what this is about. It's not about penalizing governments.
It really is about governments being convinced to enforce their own
labor laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though sanctions are unlikely, Garza defended the NAFTA
side agreement for opening up ``public debate'' in Mexico through
public hearings that have been held to gather testimony on various
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on union organizing in Mexico City, she said, ``the
workers would come up to me and say, 'Miss Garza, this is historic
. . . We don't have access to our government officials like you do
in the United States. This is an opportunity we've never had.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said Mexico, through a new five-year plan, is addressing
problems that have been raised some complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Gualde, who studies maquiladoras at the College of the
Northern Border in Tijuana, said the NAFTA side agreement has
``symbolic import'' and puts companies under pressure to comply
with existing laws or face public criticism, especially bad reviews
in Washington, D.C. and in the American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of the substantial change,'' he said, ``has to come
from within Mexico itself.''

GOODBYE, JERRY; HELLO SHOWS ABOUT SOMETHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The legacy of ``Seinfeld'' is the pursuit of
nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   The recently retired sitcom, which emphasized the sub-trivial
pursuits of young, urban singles, spawned a generation of
broadcast-network comedies targeted at the young, urban audience
that seemed to share the ``Seinfeld'' world-view.
</P>
<P>
   That audience is greatly desired by advertisers, and,
accordingly, big broadcast networks, who've mostly abandoned older
viewers to cable in pursuit of ever more specific younger
demographics. But the field of topics for most current comedies _
dating, dining out and dead-end jobs _ leaves a lot of life
experience untouched. If those topics aren't nothing, they're
nothing much.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a comedy sameness has come over the big networks,
and grown-up comedy makers have begun to turn elsewhere for
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, two cable nets not known for original
comedies will debut four shows that appear to be about something.
The premium network Showtime goes first, with ``Linc's'' and ``Rude
Awakening,'' which debut on Saturday. Lifetime rolls out its new
comedies, ``Maggie'' and ``Oh, Baby'' on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think is the definition of `cutting edge'
right now?'' asked Diane English, the creator of ``Murphy Brown,''
speaking here recently with TV critics. ``It's a show about
something. It's a show that has a point of view, that has a voice.
Do you know how rare that is?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to cable, maybe not so rare. The four new shows:
</P>
<P>
   - ``Linc's``: Set in a bar in Washington, D.C., Showtime's
``Linc's'' casts Pam Grier (``Jackie Brown''), Steven Williams
(``The X-Files``) and Georg (cq ) Stanford Brown (Tyson) in an
African-American ensemble comedy that promises to address grown-up
concerns, including politics.
</P>
<P>
   The series creator is Tim Reid, known to most as Venus Flytrap
in the classic sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati, and remembered by many as
one of the creative forces behind ``Frank's Place,'' which aired
briefly in the 1987-88 TV season and was one of the best little
shows that ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Rude Awakening``: Sherilyn Fenn (``Twin Peaks``) stars as
Billie Frank, a sobriety-challenged actress just beginning to deal
with recovery. Lynn Redgrave (``Georgy Girl,`` ``Shine``) plays her
mother, whose own capacity for drink explains a lot about her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The show is based largely on the life of its creator and
executive producer, Claudia Lonow (``Knot's Landing``), the product
of a show-business family (her father Mark, co-owns Hollywood's
famed Improvisation comedy club).
</P>
<P>
   Here's an indication of where this one might go: Frank's boss,
the least-neurotic character in the cast, is played by Richard
Lewis. (Who, it was revealed at the show's session at the
Television Critics Association (TCA) Summer publicity Tour,
actually once baby-sat Lonow, then later dated her.)
</P>
<P>
   - `` Maggie``: Ann Cusack plays Maggie Day, a seemingly happily
married woman about to turn 40. She's got a successful husband of
19 years, a teenage daughter who doesn't appear to be too troubled,
and enough ambition to want to return to school to become a
veterinarian. She's also got very vivid fantasies about soap stud
Jack Wagner, and is showing symptoms of approaching midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   This series will display zany daydream sequences that will seem
familiar to Ally McBeal fans, but Cusack (out of the fabled Cusack
acting family, she's worked in ``From the Earth to the Moon'' and
``The Jeff Foxworthy Show'') seems highly likable.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Oh, Baby``: Cynthia Stevenson plays Tracy, who's single and
successful but thirtysomething and childless. Her otherwise fine
boyfriend has commitment problems, so a discussion with pal
Charlotte (Joanne Gleason) leads Tracy to the local sperm bank.
</P>
<P>
   The single-momhood premise will be a challenge to sustain, but
Stevenson (``Hope &AMP; Gloria, ``Bob``) and Gleason (``Love and War)''
should be terrific together.
</P>
<P>
   (Lifetime also debuts an original hourlong drama Aug. 18.
Starring Annie Potts (``Designing Women,'' ``Dangerous Minds'') and
Lorraine Toussaint (``Law and Order,`` ``Leaving LA``), the series
observes, via the relationship of two lifelong friends, the
evolution of race relations in the South.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
An old argument &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the quality's-on-cable conversation began long ago,
especially on the topic of original movies and miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks' ``From the Earth to the Moon'' recently got more Emmy
nominations for HBO than any program from the 1997-98 season.
Overall, cable's recent Emmy nominations increased - thanks to
prestige projects from TNT (``George Wallace''), USA (``Moby
Dick``) and Showtime (``Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the
City``) - during a year in which HBO's numbers fell.
</P>
<P>
   And an early contender for a big Emmy haul next season is sure
to be ``The Baby Dance,'' a Showtime film based on the play by Jane
Anderson. Starring Stockard Channing and Laura Dern - and
co-produced by new mom Jody Foster - ``The Baby Dance'' debuts Aug.
23.
</P>
<P>
   When Hanks and Foster - perhaps the two most powerful
actor-director-producer hyphenates in Hollywood - are taking
passion projects to cable, the medium's standing as a prestige
destination appears secure.
</P>
<P>
   With a few rare exceptions, however - HBO's ``Dream On,'' say,
or ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' which a couple of weeks ago won
another best-comedy award from the Television Critics Association -
cable hasn't made episodic comedy much of a priority.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks' pursuit of young viewers isn't the only
factor driving studios and their producers to cable. Networks have
shown favoritism to shows they ``own'' _ and will profit from in
syndication - over series owned by other production entities, such
as big Hollywood studios, who deficit-finance most shows betting on
the prospects of huge back-end profits in syndication.
</P>
<P>
   Networks pursuing a specific young-demographics business plan
also are more likely to meddle in the creative details of show
production. Some cable networks, especially pay services, also
offer writers and producers more freedom to explore adult
situations. Rough language and even a little tame nudity _ both
features of Showtime's ``Rude Awakening,'' for example - sometimes
allow a script to escape the three-jokes-per-page rhythms of
mainstream network fare.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, cable networks generate revenue in ways other than
selling ad time, which allows them to be less dependent on
assembling the largest possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave believes the intrusion of network executives in the
day-to-day composition of a series is one of the nuisances of
working for a broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them restraints-and-practices police, who live in some
curious room and send down edicts to the floor _ when you're
rehearsing very hard and working a scene - very often based on a
table reading that somebody's heard or a memo from some mysterious,
never-identified person,'' she said. ``And it is the most
frustrating thing for performers.''
</P>
<P>
   At Showtime, she added, ``We don't get that sense of being
policed by people who probably haven't seen us bring a scene to
life.'' And, aside from a crack about Bill Clinton's personal life,
when was the last time you heard a network comedy even mention
politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a network would be the place for this show,''
said Reid of ``Linc's``. ``It is really a show that would find a
home on cable. About five years ago, I realized that if ``Frank's
Place'' had been on Showtime that it would probably have stayed on
about five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ``Linc's'' is too political for network. God, the
first show, the sponsor would be calling: `I mean, you've got a guy
coming in saying, `There's too much persecution of the tobacco
industry. Don't they know that they've employed more people than
they've killed?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would create a problem for a network.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A focus on youth &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even producers of successful mainstream comedies have begun to
grouse about the constraints of getting a comedy that's not a
permutation of the ``Seinfeld/Friends'' model on one of the larger
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Finestra, supervising producer on ``The Cosby Show'' and
co-creator of ``Home Improvement, ``Soul Man'' and the new Fox
comedy ``Costello,'' told the TCA members that his mother had
called him to protest ABC's cancellation of ``Soul Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I called (ABC programing chief) Jamie Tarses and told her
that my mother, a 78-year-old woman, was upset that she canceled a
show, she'd be thrilled,'' he said. ``The networks are choosing to
lose that audience'' while ``going to that which is profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   (The 20-second explanation of why young demographics are so
important: According to Madison Avenue, your product-selection
glands dry up at age 50, freezing until death the brand of auto
tire you will buy. In theory, consumers age 12-34 can still be
wooed to make the big switch from Mountain Dew to RC. Accordingly,
advertisers pay a premium to reach that demo. True, the population
is aging, and folks in the upper demographics have the most
disposable cash. CBS has claimed it is having some success in
selling its older audience to ad buyers, who are, according to
legend, all twentysomething women.)
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Lorre, creator and executive producer of ``Grace Under
Fire,'' ``Cybill'' and ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' said cable's comedy
emergence is ``wonderful, great for TV,'' he said. ``There'll be
more of a Sundance mentality, where television is developed with
less stringent controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monopoly is over. That's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   For producers, some drawbacks remain. The audiences for
individual cable programs remain minuscule compared with even the
lesser-rated efforts of broadcast networks, and budgets for cable
shows generally are correspondingly lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the trouble of creating a show, you want a lot
of people to see it,'' said Peter Casey, a writer and supervising
producer for ``Cheers,'' co-creator of ``Wings,'' ``Frasier'' and
``Encore! Encore!``, a new-for-fall NBC sitcom starring Nathan
Lane. ``There's nothing more frustrating than going through all of
that sweat, and nobody came to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Valentine, CEO and president of the fledgling UPN
network, said the narrowcasting approach of his broadcast
competitors is ultimately ``doomed to failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences have been shrinking for years, and, of all the big
networks, only NBC made money last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the sameness of network programing is driven by
narrowcasting, by targeting the same 18- to 35-year-old audience,
and doing one show after another where there's somebody working at
a magazine office or an advertising office or some glamorous job,''
said Valentine, whose network is offering a new fall schedule
targeted at a wider audience than its startup competitor, the WB,
which has evidently targeted suburban teen girls as its core
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, shows like ``Roseanne'' and ``Home Improvement''
are getting harder for people to find on network television as it
abandons the adult audience and family audience and every au dience
that's not that one audience.'' &QL;

`EVER AFTER' LEAVES A NUTRA SWEET TASTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Set in 16th-century France, ``Ever After'' is such a politically
correct rendering of the Cinderella story that the stepmother isn't
even evil anymore. She's just snippy. Fortunately, she is played by
Anjelica Huston, who cruises through ``Ever After'' like a slumming
diva; her insouciance is such that the movie achieves a state of
grace when she is onscreen. As Danielle, the Cinderella figure,
Drew Barrymore is such a contemporary embodiment of Girl Power that
she might as well be working at the Gap. Director and co-scripter
Andy Tennant did make a funny movie. Sometimes, it's even funny on
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle is thrilled when her father brings home his new wife
(Huston) and a pair of stepsisters. Daddy dotes on young Danielle.
Having taught his little girl to read, he gives her a copy of
``Utopia.'' It's not exactly the most suitable reading for an
8-year-old, but he doesn't have long to live, so who's gonna hold
it against him? He tumbles off his horse, after grasping his left
arm in pain for his entire time onscreen. He doesn't get to shout,
``Elizabeth, I'm comin' to join ya, honey,'' but he might as well;
his heart attack is as underimagined as almost everything else.
</P>
<P>
   A flash-forward shows a young adult Danielle (Barrymore) going
at her chores, and winning over the servants with her charm and
guilelessness. Meanwhile, the pouty Prince (Dougray Scott) has fled
the palace in a fit of pique over being forced into a marriage of
convenience. The two meet when he tries to steal the horse that
belonged to Danielle's father _ and she knocks him off with a
well-flung apple. Danielle falls in love with the prince anyway,
even though he's so dim and self-involved he doesn't recognize her
when she masquerades as a noblewoman. Maybe it's the absence of the
carefully applied soot from her face that throws him off; it's the
only thing that's the slightest bit different about her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore is a bold good sport. She may be the first actress to
gain baby fat in her early 20s instead of losing it _ the planes of
her face have disappeared _ but she is a charming dumpling. She's
spunky and self-assured, a straightforward answer to the waifish,
victimized Cinderella of most fairy tales. Barrymore's
groundedness, and Huston's brittle theatricality, give ``Ever
After'' a lilt, even though the movie doesn't deserve them. This
story is all business, debunking the fairy godmothers and
dreaminess, and determined to add egalitarianism to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Such an updating makes sense. What doesn't make sense is ``Ever
After's'' trailer, which positions the movie as an overwrought
romantic fantasy of the ``Great Expectations'' variety, complete
with a loamy low-fi alt-rock song scoring the flash-cut images. In
fact, sense is the order of the day _ so much common sense has been
packed into the story that it doesn't quite hold together anymore.
Danielle seems to have been transported to the locale from another
time, or cobbled together by an Action for Children's Television
subcommittee. All this meddling to make the story palatable, and
inspire a young girl audience, gives it a Nutra Sweet aftertaste.
With all of the current references and attitudes _ at one point,
the King growls, ``It's not about love!'' to his overprivileged son
_ ``Ever After'' loses a fairy tale's ability to enchant, as well
as the streak of cruelty that makes a fairy tale stick with you. If
you rob a magic trick of its mystique, it's not magic anymore.

FIRST-TIME, SECDOND-TIME PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Aug. 6)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Diaper Genie. The black-and-white developmental mobile. The
battery-powered baby swing that goes through a six-pack of size D
batteries each week. The six-generation family genealogy tree
chart.
</P>
<P>
   Some baby accessories are destined to be purchased only by
first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that diaper commercial on television, where the mother
and babe are in soft focus, with classical lullabies playing in the
background. Then, with the second and third child, the stark light
of day falls on a family running around the back yard, kids yelling
and rolling around laughing and parents trying to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the fantasy and the reality is often
bridged by taking seconds at the parenting picnic.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Unisar Inc. came out with Bebe Sounds, a prenatal
listening kit that allows pregnant women to ``have the excitement
and thrill of hearing and recording a baby's heartbeat prior to
birth,'' I thought immediately: first-time parent product.
</P>
<P>
   Bebe Sounds ($29.99, at Babies R Us or Toys R Us, or calling
800-430-0222) is an amplifier similar to ones obstetricians use to
check the baby's heartbeat during prenatal exams.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit to being thrilled the first time I heard both my
children's rapid heartbeats. But once was plenty. To sit at home
and listen would have been an exercise in paranoia. Is the rate
faster today? Slower? What if the baby turned and I couldn't find a
beat at all? Doctors should be thankful more pregnant women don't
own home monitoring devices.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I'm sure Bebe Sounds will find its niche among
those first-timers who crave more prenatal contact with their
baby-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bebe Sounds ... by the end of the second trimester,
hiccups, kicks and even the heartbeat can be heard,'' says the
Unisar Inc. press release. ``These precious sounds will help bring
the mother and family even closer to their coming baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The device won the U.S. Consumer Electronics Show Innovations
Design and Engineering Award and Great Britain's Child and Nursery
Fair Top Gold Award.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge Bebe Sounds' appeal to new parents, I showed the
release to a colleague who has a 3-month-old daughter. Now, this
dad had been a bit cynical about the whole baby marketing trend
before he and his wife had a child, and I thought he would dismiss
the Bebe Sounds monitor as a techno-gadget for overly involved
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Quite the contrary.
</P>

   ``This would have been great,'' he said enthusiastically. ``I
tried to rewire my computer microphone to use it as a listening
device, and I bought a stethoscope, but neither was sensitive
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded me that, being the one who was pregnant, I never had
the ``outsider'' experience that expectant fathers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife could feel the baby kicking and moving and doing
stuff, and I couldn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he's getting plenty of contact hours with baby
Riley.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's the reason I think second-time parents wouldn't
be nearly as interested in Bebe Sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Amplification just doesn't hold the same appeal it once did.
After the infant comes out, the sounds he makes are quite loud
enough, thank you. Especially the ones that mean, ``I'm hungry;''
``I'm wet;'' ``I'm overly tired;'' or ``It's 3 a.m. and I'm
bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine months of blissful silence seems like a pretty good deal.

HOSTAGE DRAMA NOT MUCH OF A BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``The Negotiator'' must have sounded like a hot idea
when it was first pitched to the movie studio: Two hostage
negotiators engage in a battle of wits when one of them switches
sides and becomes a hostage taker.
</P>
<P>
   But as the writers and director F. Gary Gray labored to
construct a scenario in which that idea would make sense, they must
have used a shovel instead of a pen. They dug themselves an
ever-deeper hole as the plot implodes.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, you're going to reach the point where you
think: Yeah, right, like that could actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson) is the first hostage negotiator,
a dedicated hero working for the Chicago police.
</P>
<P>
   But when Danny's partner uncovers a major criminal scandal
within the police department and is murdered, Danny is framed for
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone turns against Danny so quickly that he feels his only
recourse is to take the chief investigator and several other people
hostage within the city administration high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   The story plummets down the believability scale right there _
especially when his lawyer says, ``There's nothing I can do for
you,'' even before Danny is arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The plot machinations get more convoluted and less believable as
the long hostage night wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Danny's plan is to hold the hostages long enough to prove his
innocence. Exactly how he's going to do that, he has no idea.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the second police negotiator, Chris Sabian (Kevin
Spacey), shows up to persuade Danny to release the hostages. But
Chris has an even tougher job: trying to keep dozens of rabid SWAT
cops from blasting into the office and killing Danny.
</P>
<P>
   Do they want to kill him because they're the real bad guys? Or
just because that's their passion in life?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an implausible plot, ``The Negotiator'' digs itself
into dramatic trouble from the beginning. We know Danny is
innocent, so we know he's not going to kill any of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, we spend most of the movie watching him run bluffs on
Chris and the other cops, bluffs we don't believe for a second.
</P>
<P>
   Director Gray ``(Set It Off)'' tries to smooth off the rough
edges of the story with psychological insights into the work of
police negotiators, who try to defuse violent situations using
their minds instead of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those insights are interesting, but not interesting
enough to keep you from picking the story apart as you watch it.
</P>
<P>
   Gray does maintain some on-screen tension once the bullets start
to fly, and the final showdown has its moments. Jackson is sweaty
and tense throughout, but his performance has none of the subtlety
he brought to ``Eve's Bayou'' or ``Pulp Fiction.'' Jackson's Danny
is more of a plot device than a real character.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey ``(L.A. Confidential``) remains unexpressively enigmatic
for most of the movie, which works in contrast to Jackson's heated
performance. But it's also a plot device, to keep us unsure about
who's side he's on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator'' would have worked better as an hourlong
episode on ``NYPD Blue'' or one of the other cop shows. Stretching
it over two hours exposes the holes in the plot and the dramatics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator'' is rated R for profanity and violence. 2
stars. &QL;

GET YOUR KICKS FROM `BUFFALO 66'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can you not be fascinated with a movie that features a tap
dance musical number staged in a bowling alley? Especially when
it's done by the kittenish Christina Ricci, who plays the
saucer-eyed but loving dimwit kidnapped by Billy Brown (Vincent
Gallo) to impress his folks in ``Buffalo 66.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy's an angry loser _ he vibrates with rage like a tuning
fork _ who seems in danger of exploding on his first day out of
prison. Not only was he in for a crime he didn't commit, he was
extorted into doing the crime because he lost a bet. A bet he made
to, yep, impress his parents, who wouldn't notice him if he were
set on fire and flung out of a moving plane into their house.
Probably the only thing that could make his mother (Anjelica
Huston) pay attention to him is if he hit the field as a member of
the Buffalo Bills; she still blames Billy because his birth made
her miss an important game. She's obsessed with the Bills, whose
pathetic NFL streak could make them the subject of a Verdi opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66'' is about anger and obsession. Gallo, who wrote,
directed, and stars in the film, in addition to composing its
music, plays it all for comedy. So, even when the volume level is
jacked all the way up _ which is almost all the time _ ``Buffalo
66'' is funny.
</P>
<P>
   His Billy is an infant, who stomps and snarls when he isn't the
center of attention. He's also quite a naif, despite his tough-guy
act. When he snatches Layla _ whom he renames Wendy, after the love
of his life who got away _ he bellows at her, occasionally toning
the derision down to a mere bark. He drags her to his folks' house,
where initially he makes her pretend to be his wife, and she
sweetly warms to the task, bragging outrageously and unbelievably
about him. And here we see that he just treats her the way they
treat him.
</P>
<P>
   It's a modest spectacle, ``Buffalo 66,'' but it IS a spectacle.
The movie's all of a piece as well; it benefits Gallo's own
obsession with detail of every sort. He gets a soft, winning
performance from Ricci, dressed in powdery pastels that match her
makeup perfectly. She's a kind of kewpie doll, and she sparkles
under his care. In the movie, he eventually glows under her purity;
she's as devoted to him as a duckling, and clatters clumsily after
him in her 2-story platform tap shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo maintains consistency of tone by crafting the movie as a
series of long takes, so that the characters' behavior is the most
important aspect of the film. Even the musical numbers, such as
they are _ and ``Buffalo 66'' uses as much music as any full-blown
musical _ are one-take wonders. Ben Gazzara, as Billy's father,
gets to sing right into the camera in a scene as silly as it is
touching. ``Buffalo 66'' seems a combination of Dennis Potter,
cinema verite and the Three Stooges. (At a couple of points, when
Rosanna Arquette, Mickey Rourke and Jan Michael Vincent are
produced for cameos, it feels like the Where Are They Now? section
of ``People'' magazine, too.) It's an original combination of
elements, and it helps that Gallo knows exactly what he wants to
achieve. He does it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66'' is unrated. It contains nudity, adult language,
sexuality and scenes of violence.

IN `BASEKETBALL,' BEING A GOOD SPORT IS FOUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``BASEketball'' is the type of movie that few people will see
once. They'll either avoid it, driven away by previews and ads that
make it look aggressively stupid (which it often is), or go back
for repeat viewings to catch all the dialogue and cameos they
missed the first time _ and eventually, rent the video so they can
memorize it.
</P>
<P>
   Couples break up over movies like this. If it's early in your
relationship, and you're not laughing and your date is, it's a
pretty good sign that you're not destined for eternal bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Director David Zucker and his co-writers certainly have their
target audience firmly in mind. Any movie that mixes sports,
``South Park,'' Yasmine Bleeth and Jenny McCarthy isn't going to be
fighting ``Hope Floats'' for fans. (Although you don't have to be
male to enjoy it, as evidenced by the two young women at the
preview screening who laughed loudly at every joke that's been
spoiled by the trailers.)
</P>
<P>
   In a summer when theaters could promote the Lowbrow Comedy of
the Week, ``BASEketball'' falls somewhere between the Farrelly
Brothers' ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Mafia!,'' which
was directed by Jim Abrahams, Zucker's former partner. Like
``Mary,'' it's politically incorrect and sometimes mean-spirited,
featuring gags at the expense of gays and terminally ill children.
Like ``Mafia!,'' it takes an anything-for-a-laugh approach, and how
much it succeeds depends on how much you share its sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the closest thing we've had in a while to a true slob
comedy, that anarchic genre that ``Animal House'' all but invented
20 years ago. ``Mary,'' for all its flouting of convention, doesn't
aim at any establishment targets. ``BASEketball'' takes a direct
bead on the increasingly corrupt and greedy world of professional
sports, with the help of an amazing number of real-life
sportscasters and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to a nonsensical combination of baseball and
basketball concocted by two slackers ``(South Park'' creators Trey
Parker and Matt Stone; Parker's the blond guy) as a way of showing
up some Dockers-clad neighborhood jocks. It's a noncontact sport,
but players are allowed to do ``psych-outs'' _ which are anything
the player can think of to mess up his opponent's shot, and which
make for many of the movie's funniest gags.
</P>
<P>
   After BASEketball becomes a neighborhood sensation, a
Stetson-wearing millionaire (Ernest Borgnine) persuades the guys to
turn it into a professional sport. Although anything goes on the _
field? court? _ the league is a model of integrity, in which teams
aren't allowed to move between cities and players aren't allowed to
sell out, refreshing bylaws in a business where real-life teams
have been known to move out of their hometowns overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But then another millionaire (Robert Vaughn) comes into the
picture, threatening to split up the duo with a Faustian deal;
their partnership is also threatened by a pretty charity worker.
Bleeth plays the good-hearted woman with good-natured humor.
McCarthy is wasted _ if, as an actress, she ``can'' be wasted _ as
the woman who hooks up with both millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans have a head start on everyone else here; the movie
is so loaded with cameos and in-jokes that you practically have to
be an ESPN junkie to get them all. Respected sportscaster Bob
Costas and Al Michaels deliver many funny moments with some fairly
demented play-by-plays; you have to wonder how many takes it took
before they stopped cracking up.
</P>
<P>
   For guys not known as actors, Parker and Stone do a decent
enough job, and they play off of each other well (although in slow
moments you're tempted to tally how many times they say ``Dude!'').
Even though they were cast before ``South Park'' became a
phenomenon, there still are a couple of ``Park''ish moments that
had the show's fans hooting and hollering at the preview screening.
The movie even features a hard-luck supporting character named
Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   Like his crony Abrahams, Zucker often runs out of momentum;
there are a lot of dead spots between the laughs, and the ratio of
successes to flops could generously be put at 50-50. At nearly an
hour and 40 minutes, the movie is too long for this kind of goofy
material, but people with the patience to sit througl`:he clo.Z7

`AVENGERS' STILL HIP ON THESE SHORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON RENFROE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - By March 1966, the Beatles had forever changed pop
music and hairstyles. Miniskirts and knee-high boots were the rage.
And America was about to get hit by yet another British invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``The Avengers,'' an unlikely import that shortly would
have grown-ups captivated and adolescent boys in a swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Americans quickly fell for the attractive pair of spies: John
Steed, who was very British, very polite, and always wore a bowler
and trim Pierre Cardin suit; and his partner, Mrs. Emma Peel, who
was young, smart, kittenishly sexy and always ready with a karate
chop for some evildoer.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to hear a lot about ``The Avengers'' in the next few
weeks. The big-screen, updated version opens in theaters nationwide
on Aug. 14 and stars Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. A&AMP;E Home Video
is releasing, for the first time Friday, 12 episodes from 1967. And
the cable network also will present ``The Avengers: The Journey
Back,'' hosted by one of the original stars, Patrick Macnee, on
Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a brief history of this tongue-in-cheek, kooky spy spoof
for those who missed this camp classic the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avengers'' began in Britain in 1961. Initially broadcast
live, it starred Ian Hendry and Macnee as top-secret agents. Their
mission was to ``avenge'' evil deeds committed against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The series continued, virtually unknown here, until 1966, when
ABC brought it to American prime time. By then Hendry was out, and
Macnee had assumed the starring role. Joining him was Diana Rigg,
playing ``talented amateur'' Emma Peel to Macnee's ``top
professional'' John Steed.
</P>
<P>
   Together they made quite a charming pair. Their chemistry made
the series work, and it's for them American fans have been eagerly
awaiting the video releases. The show hasn't been seen in the
United States since 1990, when the Arts and Entertainment cable
network ran some episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Like many series from the 1960s, it's the ``furniture'' that
would come around every week that's memorable:
</P>
<P>
   _The theme music. Laurie Anderson's bouncy-yet-elegant opening
and closing tune is hard to get out of your head. It's not often
you hear bongos, horns and violins all blended dramatically in one
minute.
</P>
<P>
   _The fashions. Steed's swagger was one part self-confidence, two
parts smart Edwardian dressing. But it was Mrs. Peel's outfits that
got adolescent boys' blood stirring. They included hip-hugging
pantsuits and of course, The Leather Suit, which will be updated by
Thurman in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   While it's the leather one remembers, it was used only
occasionally, as the outfit tended to tear during the action
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mrs. Peel _ we're needed.'' For 16 episodes (beginning in
fall 1967), Steed would find novel ways to let Mrs. Peel know they
were to be required on a case. These included a dashed line painted
on her floor, which led to the front door, which led to Steed
sticking his trademark umbrella through the door with an
invitationlike note attached: ``Mrs. Peel _ we're needed!''
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``The See-Through Man,'' Mrs. Peel looks into a
microscope and finds the usual message.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lots of drinking. Hitting the booze was still exotic in the
late '60s. Emma and Steed did lots of it. Champagne flowed.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cars. Emma preferred a cute Lotus Elan (there would be an
auto chase scene in almost every episode). Steed had a stable of
classic roadsters from the 1920s and '30s. After the denouement,
the two would climb aboard one of Steed's favorites and do a bit of
silent comedy as a way of saying goodnight to the viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   These bits from 30 years ago are still fun. But to those viewing
the tapes for the first time, be forewarned: This is not James
Bond. That is, all is low-key. The series moves along at its own
pace, thank you very much. Remember, this was before MTV, and most
TV series moved slower than what we expect today.
</P>
<P>
   Violence is there, but it's mannerly and short-lived. The
villains and their henchmen get knocked out remarkably fast and
with relative ease. And not much blood.
</P>
<P>
   Sex is there, too, but very tame by today's standards. Often the
villain lusts in some kinky way for Mrs. Peel, who is often put in
bondage _ tied to railroad tracks and chairs. In one episode, her
hands and feet are put in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   There was no romance between Steed and Mrs. Peel; rather a
mutual affection. She was married, after all, although the hubby
doesn't figure until Diana Rigg, and our beloved Emma, left the
show at the end of the 1967 season.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Rigg usually tries to opt out when it comes to reevaluating
the series. In previous interviews, she makes it clear that while
``The Avengers'' was a good career move and one that she enjoyed,
she doesn't have much to say on the subject. She has returned to
her first love, the stage, and also has hosted ``Mystery'' on PBS,
along with authoring books on the theater.

<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ A dusty tankard of jelly beans sits on a
corner table in the den of Rancho Del Cielo, near a window
overlooking the pond where Ronald and Nancy Reagan used to unwind
from Washington by paddling about in a canoe, sharing laughs and
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   The home looks as if the former president could walk in at any
moment, sore from chopping wood by the barn, although he hasn't set
foot at the ranch since late 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It's quiet and peaceful at the rustic mountaintop retreat about
30 miles northwest of Santa Barbara. Because it's fully furnished,
the home makes the rare visitor feel a sense of walking in on
Reagan's private life.
</P>
<P>
   His riding boots are in the closet, next to White House jackets
and monogrammed shirts. There's his favorite Ralph Lauren Polo
shirt that he often wore while horseback riding, its navy blue
threads with horizontal white pinstripes worn thin.
</P>
<P>
   Still in the lemon-yellow master bedroom are sheepskin rugs, a
bedspread with the initials ``NRR,'' for Nancy and Ronald Reagan,
and two leather-bound Bibles gracing a wooden side table adorned
with cowboy statues.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the nation has seen little of Reagan's ranch, except
for television footage and newspaper photos of press conferences,
and of him riding horseback and doing chores 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners, who bought the ranch April 21, want to
eventually give visitors unprecedented access to the ranch, to
offer insights about Reagan's lifestyle. So far, they have invited
a few reporters to take a peek.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is modest. The bookshelves in the living room are not
lined with the classics but with Westerns, paperbacks, copies of
Arizona Highways magazines and a hardcover of Larry McMurtry's
``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the kitchen stands a bumper-pool table. Paintings of the
couple's favorite horses hang on the walls. The kitchen spice rack
is well stocked with seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   This 1,200-square-foot house and its furnishings don't meet
one's expectations of a presidential home. It's just so plain,
ordinary and simple.
</P>
<P>
   No plush pile carpeting, only cracked faux-brick red linoleum
and Indian-style throw rugs. No framed portraits of the Oval Office
or handshakes with foreign leaders, just macrame and numerous
paintings of cowboys and Western landscapes above bright orange
Naugahyde wingbacked chairs straight out of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   A SIMPLE LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   The house has a Spartan feel with its aluminum-framed windows.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the Reagans lived. It's a world apart from the
formality and exhibits under glass at the Reagan Library a couple
of hours south in Simi Valley that opened in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And it's going to stay this way. No ropes and posts to keep
visitors shuffling in single file from room to room.
</P>
<P>
   The 688-acre spread, owned by the Reagans since 1974, is now
owned by the Young America's Foundation, a conservative outreach
group for college-age students. The ranch was listed for $5.95
million but the purchase price is a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reagans really put a lot of themselves into this place,''
said 28-year-old Marc Short, foundation executive director. ``This
really was their spot. You really get a feeling for who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation intends to use the ranch as an inspirational,
educational and historic backdrop, making it the focal point of its
new Ronald Reagan Leadership Development Program. It hopes to
obtain conference facilities nearby and begin bringing students
there in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, it must buy more land, secure county approval and
permits, and will likely be asked to help repair the crumbling,
winding road that snakes up the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tremendously excited to share President Reagan's
vision,'' said Kristen Short, foundation conference director and
Marc's wife. Two weeks ago the Young America's Foundation opened a
West Coast office in Santa Barbara.

<P>
   A VISIT FROM NANCY
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the purchase _ done with Nancy Reagan's direct
approval _ the former first lady paid a visit and met the Shorts at
the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought a lot of knickknacks and paintings and saddles
from storage, and spent hours going through each room with us,
sharing stories and adjusting the pictures on the walls and the
statues and plates on the tables,'' Kristen Short said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so fortunate to have Mrs. Reagan assisting us,'' she
said. ``She took it upon herself to gather more from the Reagan
Library and brought it here. She did all this on her own will, and
we learned so much from her. It's really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Such inside knowledge is incomparable. After all, Mrs. Thomas
Jefferson wasn't around to tell stories to the caretakers and
docents at Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a look inside the president's personality,'' Marc Short
said. ``And we're meeting people who personally knew the Reagans _
Secret Service agents and Cabinet members who are sharing their
memories and stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Short _ a Wake Forest University graduate _ shows a
visitor through the house and around the grounds like a pro,
relating endless anecdotes about the furnishings, clothing and how
Reagan hand-built the fences from telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   The Shorts do not pretend to be as famous as the Reagans, though
they represent the next generation of Reaganites. Rather, they
respect their new role as caretakers of this historical property
and pledge not to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranch will offer students a unique opportunity to view the
simple lifestyle and hard-work philosophy that made President
Reagan the great leader that he was,'' Marc Short said.
</P>
<P>
   DETAILS OF THEIR LIVES
</P>
<P>
   The Shorts, children during the Reagan administration, say that
Reagan's legacy has been distorted by academics and the media. The
foundation will bring speakers to the ranch. Former Attorney
General Edwin Meese, former Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger
and Marine Col. Oliver North are among the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But just as powerful for future generations, they say, is the
opportunity to walk through the house and the horse barn, to absorb
the simplicity and natural surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   On the front porch are the stones that Reagan himself hefted
from around the ranch. A round wooden table out front was used by
Reagan to sign tax cuts into law in August 1981.
</P>
<P>
   To the left of the front door is the bell that Nancy Reagan
would sound to call her husband in for lunch. Up by the barn is an
old train bell that Ron would ring in the mornings to call Nancy
when her horse was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging on the hat rack inside the front door, stained with
sweat from chopping wood and building fences, is a worn navy blue
baseball cap embroidered in gold thread: ``United States Mounted
Secret Service.''
</P>
<P>
   The main house, built in the 1890s, has two large rooms, a
master bedroom and bath, a kitchen and a small maid's suite.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttered from view on the bottom shelf of a towering armoire
sits a bulky Zenith ``space command'' TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted on the wall next to the simple bar with its pewter mugs
and glasses are two ``jackalopes'': stuffed heads of jackrabbits
affixed with pairs of antlers. One has fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the master closet is a snazzy white Stetson hat; the
hatband is inscribed with a notation that it was made personally
for the president.
</P>
<P>
   And atop the four-drawer bureau in the closet are Reagan's two
Rancheros Visitadores leather patches, noting his donor membership
of 1984 and honorary membership of 1986. The local horse-riding
group makes annual treks to a camp in the Santa Ynez Valley.
</P>
<P>
   There are reminders of how the remote ranch was once ringed by
cameras, motion sensors, surveillance lights and roving Secret
Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   On the master bedroom's side table are two telephones, one with
a rotary dial and one without any dial or buttons. That white phone
was connected directly to the Secret Service command post on the
knoll above the house, so agents could alert the president in any
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   A few steps from the main house is the two-bedroom guest cottage
used by Queen Elizabeth II, Mikhail Gorbachev and other guests.
</P>
<P>
   Up a hill is a pet cemetery, with headstones Reagan carved. One
is for Nancy Reagan's horse, No Strings.
</P>
<P>
   These are the stuff of memories that visitors to the ranch will
take home.

FOR GARY BUSEY, IT'S GOOD TO BE ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Anything good?''
</P>
<P>
   You hear this while you're skimming a newspaper article about a
17-year-old stabbed to death in summer school, and the answer is
obvious. No. Life basically stinks, our kids are cold-blooded
killers, our adults are innately corrupt, our society is too
materialistic and intolerant, and it's difficult to flip to the
next page for fear of delving even deeper into depression.
</P>
<P>
   When the voice quips, ``You're alive, aren't you? Isn't THAT
good?'' it's time to look up and connect a scratchy voice with a
face. Standing in the corner of the elevator is Gary Busey, actor
and drug rehab poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   He's wearing this goofy, crooked grin, knowing that he'd said
the right thing and was the right person to say it.
</P>
<P>
   Being stuck with Gary Busey on even a moving elevator counts as
an intriguing experience, but there's more. Because we were going
to the same place as interviewer and interviewee, we walk down the
hotel corridor together. He says hello and looks deep into the eyes
of everyone he encounters: the surprised young man painting a door,
a maid carrying a vacuum cleaner, a hotel executive wearing an
expensive double-breasted suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless,'' he says. Or ``Are we good today?'' Or ``Wonderful
day, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful, sure, for Busey. By most accounts he should be dead,
a statistic, a member of the celebrity drug overdose club. Three
years ago in May, he was found slumped in a chair at his home,
filled with steroids, cocaine and tequila. He'd been up and down
through most of his career, one that was filled with promise after
his fine performance in ``The Buddy Holly Story'' and as a heavy in
``Lethal Weapon,'' ``Drop Zone'' and ``Under Siege,'' among others.
But he simply couldn't handle fame.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before Busey appeared at the television critics'
press tour, Burt Reynolds had declared Hollywood a cold,
calculating place that kicks you when you're down and leaves you
for dead. He was talking about his treatment as a has-been, before
``Boogie Nights,'' before he snagged that Oscar nomination, before
he fell into Hollywood's favor again.
</P>
<P>
   Busey makes no such claims, saying he has been welcomed back by
Hollywood, that it is generous and good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's forgiving when somebody gets back up on their
feet, dusts themselves off, and says, `Let's go again, and do it
the right way,' '' Busey says. ``And that's the glory that I'm
having in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   One supposes that Busey considers E! Entertainment, the cable
channel that pushes coverage of sex, drugs and lingerie models as
entertainment, to be generous: It took on his life story in its
popular tabloidish profile series.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. Sunday, Busey will be the latest catch of its
salacious ``E! True Hollywood Story,'' a popular series that
doesn't pretend to be A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' or even Lifetime's
``Intimate Portrait.'' It chronicles the rise and fall of stars,
with or without their input. So it's truly a special moment that
Busey is here, in person, thanking his exploiter.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fluffy, though legitimate, entertainment channel ``(E!
News Daily'' and ``Talk Soup'' are still worth a look), E! has
found its niche in peddling cheesecake TV, a collection of programs
featuring scantily clad women, from models scurrying down runways
to shows involving Victoria's Secret lingerie and specials on
``Playboy'' playmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``E! True Hollywood Story'' is on something of a roll, having
dipped into the turbulent lives of Mackenzie Phillips and Liberace
last month, and with Tommy Lee, Brett Butler and that wayward
``Diff'rent Strokes'' cast set for Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell whether Busey considers this a needed
catharsis or a chance to tell Hollywood that, hey, he's sorry and
he's back. ``It's nice to let people know what a man in the
celebrity position has gone through and come through,'' he says.
``And it will help others to see that it can be done. To heal
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Busey is now ``a full-blooded Christian'' who witnesses to
inmates in juvenile detention halls, viewers of ``The 700 Club''
and Promise Keepers.
</P>
<P>
   And to prove this E! tell-all isn't a plea for sympathy and
work, he points to such accomplishments as his roles in ``Fear &AMP;
Loathing in Las Vegas'' and in an upcoming children's film.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to believe a man who has seen a snapshot of a tortured
life and lived to tell about it, but you have to wonder how and why
he's telling it. One supposes it's also easy for him to trust
others, to think that his best interests are being cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a tape of Sunday's show, I'd say E! got more out of
this than Busey.

DAVIS FAVORED OVER LUNGREN IN CALIF. GOVERNOR'S RACE, POLL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``a'' and ``p'' categories)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ California Lt. Gov. Gray Davis is favored over
Attorney General Dan Lungren, particularly among women and
independent voters, in the state's race for governor, according to
a new poll by the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of Californians likely to vote in the Nov. 3 election
found Davis, a Democrat, was the choice of 48 percent of those
surveyed while 39 percent favored Republican Lungren. Thirteen
percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the candidates were most pronounced
among women, who said they favored Davis by 53 percent to 34
percent for Lungren. And the fastest-growing group of California
voters _ independents _ favored Davis 51 percent to 31 percent,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey comes as Davis and Lungren prepared to debate Friday
evening in San Diego, the first of five televised forums scheduled
before the election, and as Davis prepares to launch in August his
first post-primary series of TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis has clearly seized the early advantage,'' said Del Ali,
senior vice president of Mason-Dixon Political-Media Research of
Columbia, Md., which conducted the Examiner poll. ``I think it's
going to be very important for Lungren to portray himself as a
centrist. For him to throw a bone to the far right between now and
November would be suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The random telephone poll of 832 Californians was conducted
Sunday through Tuesday. All those surveyed said they regularly vote
in state elections. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus
3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the poll showed Davis with strong support in the
San Francisco Bay Area and metropolitan Los Angeles, traditional
Democratic strongholds. Lungren had a smaller margin of support in
traditional Republican areas _ rural northern California, the
Central Valley and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Most people surveyed viewed Davis more favorably than Lungren,
although more than a third of those polled picked ``neutral'' when
asked their opinions about the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's ``unfavorable'' rating _ 19 percent of those surveyed
_ has remained the same since the last Examiner poll, conducted in
May shortly before the June 2 primary. But fewer people viewed
Davis unfavorably in the latest Examiner poll _ 13 percent compared
with 16 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   While the June primary campaign was dominated by the massive
amount of money being spent on negative TV ads, the November
election threatens to be about issues: abortion, offshore oil
drilling, assault weapons, tobacco, education, crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat multimillionaires Al Checchi and Rep. Jane Harman,
D-Calif., the duo who helped make the June primary the most
expensive in U.S. history, endorsed Davis after they lost. An
estimated $64 million was spent on the primary by the three
Democrats and Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   The Lungren campaigners may not be worried about The Examiner's
poll results since during the summer of 1990, polls showed Democrat
Dianne Feinstein with a 5-point edge over Republican Pete Wilson in
the gubernatorial race. She lost. Four years later, polls showed
Democrat Kathleen Brown supported by more voters than Wilson during
the summer, as well. Wilson was re-elected by 55 percent to 41
percent over Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Puglia, campaign manager for Lungren, said the campaign's
own polls show Davis and Lungren in a dead heat, with Lungren
competing strongly for female voters and gathering support from
independents.

evening in San Diego, the first of five televised forums scheduled
before the election, and as Davis prepares to launch in August his
first post-primary series of TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis has clearly seized the early advantage,'' said Del Ali,
senior vice president of Mason-Dixon Political-Media Research of
Columbia, Md., which conducted the Examiner poll. ``I think it's
going to be very important for Lungren to portray himself as a
centrist. For him to throw a bone to the far right between now and
November would be suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The random telephone poll of 832 Californians was conducted
Sunday through Tuesday. All those surveyed said they regularly vote
in state elections. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus
3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the poll showed Davis with strong support in the
San Francisco Bay Area and metropolitan Los Angeles, traditional
Democratic strongholds. Lungren had a smaller margin of support in
traditional Republican areas _ rural northern California, the
Central Valley and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Most people surveyed viewed Davis more favorably than Lungren,
although more than a third of those polled picked ``neutral'' when
asked their opinions about the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's ``unfavorable'' rating _ 19 percent of those surveyed
_ has remained the same since the last Examiner poll, conducted in
May shortly before the June 2 primary. But fewer people viewed
Davis unfavorably in the latest Examiner poll _ 13 percent compared
with 16 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   While the June primary campaign was dominated by the massive
amount of money being spent on negative TV ads, the November
election threatens to be about issues: abortion, offshore oil
drilling, assault weapons, tobacco, education, crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat multimillionaires Al Checchi and Rep. Jane Harman,
D-Calif., the duo who helped make the June primary the most
expensive in U.S. history, endorsed Davis after they lost. An
estimated $64 million was spent on the primary by the three
Democrats and Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   The Lungren campaigners may not be worried about The Examiner's
poll results since during the summer of 1990, polls showed Democrat
Dianne Feinstein with a 5-point edge over Republican Pete Wilson in
the gubernatorial race. She lost. Four years later, polls showed
Democrat Kathleen Brown supported by more voters than Wilson during
the summer, as well. Wilson was re-elected by 55 percent to 41
percent over Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Puglia, campaign manager for Lungren, said the campaign's
own polls show Davis and Lungren in a dead heat, with Lungren
competing strongly for female voters and gathering support from
independents.

ELUSIVE PREY IN A COURTLY PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The branch of the Metropolitan Museum known as the
Cloisters is, in every sense, one of the high points of art in New
York City. An impressive jumble of Romanesque scraps and American
prewar masonry, and a monument to American philanthropy, it sits
atop a rocky outcrop over the Hudson near the upper tip of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The island's last stand of virgin forest is just to the north
beyond a geological fault line; to the south the terrain gradually
descends toward midtown.
</P>
<P>
   If location is one of the Cloisters' outstanding attractions,
the magnificent trove of medieval art it houses is another.
Burgundian carvings, illuminated manuscripts and one of the
greatest of all early Netherlandish paintings are among the
treasures. But surely the most famous work is the set of tapestries
long known as ``The Hunt of the Unicorn.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember them from my first trip to the Cloisters when I was
10 and visiting New York from Boston with my parents. It was
December, a few weeks before Christmas, and snowing hard. The river
below was ice-gray; inside the museum, decorous stone virgins and
angels leaned stiffly from the walls.
</P>
<P>
   But the tapestries, over 12 feet high and hanging floor to
ceiling in their wood-paneled gallery, seemed to offer a different
vision, one of almost tumultuous vivacity and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   What was the source of this impression? In part, it lay in the
vivid, though somewhat illogical story they seemed to tell in a
succession of cinematically scaled episodes. In the story, a
charismatic and valiant beast was harassed by a passel of
aristocratic hunters, and finally killed, only _ or so it appeared
_ to be brought back to life and enclosed, as docile as a pet,
within a pretty garden fence.
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic texture of the narrative, with its blend of
pageantry and adventure, harsh facts and a happy ending, was
instantly appealing to a child. So was the eye-catching wealth of
visual details.
</P>
<P>
   A complete miniature world was crowded into these fabrics:
meticulously rendered flowers; birds whirring up from streams;
squirrels and panthers keeping incongruous company in the lush
underbrush, and a fairy tale cast of characters, from knaves and
nobles to gawky, embarrassed-to-be-here everyday folk.
</P>
<P>
   The Unicorn tapestries aren't at the Cloisters this summer. They
have traveled downtown and are now on display at the Met's main
headquarters on Fifth Avenue, in an exhibition organized by Timothy
B. Husband and Mary B. Shepard. Their stay will be brief, lasting
just a few weeks while their uptown room is refurbished. (The rest
of the Cloisters is open as usual.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Met is celebrating the visit with the release of a
freshly researched catalog, written by the art historian Adolfo
Salvatore Cavallo, offering a revised interpretation of the
tapestries' meanings.
</P>
<P>
   The historical information presented isn't, for the most part,
new. Although the seven tapestries are among the most celebrated
surviving examples of their kind, their origins remain elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the costumes depicted, they date from between 1495
and 1505. Their designs were probably produced in a Parisian
workshop and draw on a pool of contemporary images that also turn
up in illustrated books and stained glass. The actual weaving may
have been executed in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tapestries are conspicuously monogrammed with the
initials AE, their patron is unknown. The first mention of them was
in 1680 when they were listed as belonging to La Rochefoucauld,
author of the ``Maxims.''
</P>
<P>
   During the French Revolution, they were looted from the family
estate and vanished. But in the 1850s, six of them turned up on a
farm where they were being used as coverings to protect potatoes
against frost. After some restoration, they were returned to the
family's chateau.
</P>
<P>
   In 1922, the La Rochefoucaulds allowed a Paris art dealer to
ship the works to a New York gallery for exhibition. John D.
Rockefeller Jr. saw them there and snapped them up. Rockefeller
later gave New York City the land the Cloisters stands on, and
financed its building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he purchased a sizable chunk of the Palisades
across the river to insure an unspoiled view from the museum. He
gave the tapestries to the Met, and they were installed in their
new quarters in 1937, together with two remnants of a seventh
hanging, which the museum had acquired from the la Rochefoucauld
family.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Unicorn tapestries were displayed as a unit,
Cavallo's research confirms that they do not, in fact, form a
sequence, but are parts of two or three separate sets, which differ
in symbolic import.
</P>
<P>
   Two pieces stylistically distinct from the rest, for example,
are of a type known as mille-fleurs, referring to the unbroken
fields of flowers that form their backgrounds. (The other
outstanding example of this type is the ``Lady With the Unicorn''
series at the Cluny Museum in Paris.)
</P>
<P>
   And one of the pair, the renowned image of the unicorn confined
to his tiny pen and leashed to a pomegranate tree, may have been
intended as a self-contained emblem of marriage, with the beast
standing for a bridegroom captivated by love.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cavallo's research, the fragments from the seventh
tapestry seem to illustrate another allegory, the Mystical Hunt of
the Unicorn. The legend was that the creature, independent and
fierce, could be subdued only by a virgin, in whose lap he would
lay his head.
</P>
<P>
   The virgin was often taken to be Mary and the unicorn Christ,
tamed through the Incarnation. In the damaged tapestry, the virgin
is missing; but a hunter crashing in from the left may represent
the angel Gabriel, while the crafty young woman in the blood-red
gown supervising the capture could be the biblical figure of Eve.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The four tapestries that unquestionably belong together also
invite religious readings, as depictions of the Passion, framed in
terms of the elaborate etiquette of the courtly chase. In one
scene, the fleeing unicorn plunges his horn into a stream,
miraculously purifying its water for the thirsty woodland creatures
gathered around him.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters permit him to escape, but he is soon cornered and
killed, his body delivered into the hands of a waiting lord and
lady, perhaps the sponsors of the hunt, who here look remorseful at
its outcome
</P>
<P>
   That a bit of fiction like the unicorn myth can yield so many
complex meanings is perfectly plausible in works that lie, as these
tapestries do, so close to the extraordinary spiritual and
intellectual universe of the Middle Ages. It was an environment in
which the supernatural and the natural ceaselessly and almost
casually interacted, in which daily life was a mirror of the
divine, and in which every image, however prosaic, was coded with
moral implications.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, several of the birds and animals shown here carry biblical
references, and plants embody meanings derived both from Christian
thought and from the folklore of pagan Europe. Of the nearly 100
different types of flowers and fruit trees depicted, more than 80
have been identified. Many had special significance to the medieval
eye. Roses and lilies were revered as Marian emblems; pomegranates
and apples spoke of the pleasures and the pitfalls of carnal love.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this multilayered, metaphorical perspective on the
earthly existence gives the tapestries much of their interest for a
modern audience, for whom such thinking is distant but by no means
forgotten. At the same time, the artists who created them did
everything possible to project a charge of theatrical vitality,
with each scene conceived as a kind of tragicomic tableau vivant.
</P>
<P>
   The characters, though drawn from stock types, are carefully,
often hilariously, detailed. Most are hunters who share an
extravagant period style, one which includes cloddish round-toed
Earth Shoes, striped hose, rakish caps and modified Farrah Fawcett
haircuts. But despite the fashion-victim look, personal
distinctions abound: one man has a five o'clock shadow, another a
surplus of chins, yet another is in serious need of orthodontia.
</P>
<P>
   Personalities, too, stand out. The noblewoman who greets the
unicorn's corpse comes across as a sympathetic figure, decorously
doleful as she fingers the thick rosary beads at her waist. And the
chap who delivers the coup de grace at the end of the hunt is a
Judas if ever there was one, with an ostentatious gold coat and a
craven, no-goodnik squint.
</P>
<P>
   The animals depicted are, in many cases, more human than the
humans themselves. The hunting dogs _ greyhounds, mastiffs _ are at
once adamant and deferential, many reacting with an odd, empathetic
probity to the mortal ritual to which they are supporting players.
The unicorn himself has true star presence, projecting a kind of
Billy-Buddlike innocence in life, and in death a seraphic
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the work's appeal is its matchless craftsmanship. The
dyes are still bright and true; the weaving of fine wool, silk,
silver and gilt thread is of surpassing skill, marked by a
painter's eye for modeling forms and for capturing the feel of
surfaces, from the nap of an animal's coat to the sheen of light on
the fold of a silk sleeve. Here and there, see-through slits have
even been incorporated into the weave to enhance an illusionistic
play of shadow and light.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition at the Met may give this visual spectacle a
larger audience in a matter of weeks than it has drawn in years
uptown. But a trip to the Cloisters, either now or after the
tapestries have returned in early September, remains an essential,
and unfailingly delightful, part of any experience of medieval art
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the plants and flowers found in the tapestries are
cultivated in the Cloisters courtyards and terrace gardens; birds
sing in the trees of the surrounding parkland; fountains splash
with cool water. Most important, almost everything in the
collection belongs to the spiritual world of the unicorn
tapestries.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ultra-refined, courtly world, but one saturated with
what the historian Johan Huizinga called ``the extreme excitability
of the medieval soul.'' Here the beautiful and grotesque, the real
and the fanciful, the human and divine dynamically coexist. And
art, as both a category of exquisite worldly objects and as a lens
of perception, reveals a memory of innocence lost and a promise of
final perfection to come.
</P>

   Early on a sultry summer morning, a caravan of recreational
bicyclists pulls out of a parking lot at Brookdale College in
Lincroft, N.J., for a 25-mile ride through the country lanes of
Monmouth County. We are a dozen people, ages 30 to 60, men and
women _ including one couple on a tandem _ heading out to Holmdel,
Colts Neck, Marlboro and Freehold for a marvelous workout,
camaraderie, tips on bike handling and the consuming power that
comes from riding together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need someone to stay back and watch out for the last
rider,'' summons the group leader, Patty Dyer, of the Jersey Shore
Touring Society, which is sponsoring this ride on what it calls the
Cranberry Sauce Lite Route. Someone immediately volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a friendly contingent. As we briefly hit a main
thoroughfare about 8 a.m., everyone finds a partner the way
schoolchildren on a class trip do. We hug the shoulder riding two
abreast with traffic (bikes are considered ``vehicles''). Up ahead,
Patty checks for cars, announces all is clear, and we snake left
across the road toward miles of pasture.
</P>
<P>
   I recognize another cyclist, Steve, and we ride side by side in
conversation. Invigorated by the fragrant smells of summer filling
the air, Steve and I feel an immediate connection and spill out our
life stories, on work, family, bicycling background, or whatever
comes up. I'm amazed to learn that Steve met his wife through the
personal ads in New York magazine, and he charms me with tales of
their first date.
</P>
<P>
   I've been cycling for more than a decade, but this is my first
group ride in a couple of years and I'm eager to feed off the
energy of the group. I'm also eager to test my new Trek 5200, a
snazzy road bike with an up-to-date carbon-fiber frame, and see how
it responds in tight quarters. While this day's ride is sedate, I
still must be alert to other riders and how the group stops and
starts like an accordion at corners. It's an opportunity to sharpen
my instincts on drafting (positioning myself closely behind another
cyclist to reduce wind resistance), turning, taking hills and
grabbing a bite of the bagel in my back pocket while holding my
bike steady.
</P>
<P>
   In a group, you have a responsibility to keep up, to prize
safety and assist fellow riders and do the right thing. Brazenly
trying to beat a motorist at an intersection _ something I might
foolishly do on my own _ is bad karma. Wearing a hard-shell helmet
is a safety must. I also recommend a side-view mirror that sits on
your handlebars, a bike timer that shows pace and distance, and
authentic, padded bike shorts for support.
</P>
<P>
   Group rides, plentiful on summer and autumn weekends throughout
the New York City area, usually fall into one of two categories:
fast-paced rides of close to 20 miles an hour for racers and others
seeking to emulate the peloton in the Tour de France; and
moderately paced rides of 10 to 15 miles an hour for recreational
riders who want to burn calories and enjoy the scenery without the
fear of being ``dropped'' by those in front.
</P>
<P>
   Novice cyclists, who may consider themselves unathletic or who
are intimidated by riding in traffic, acquire the confidence and
skills to negotiate the open road. These tools expand your
bicycling horizons and, with patient progress, you can eventually
cover distances of 50 miles and more, earning a rare feeling of
freedom. Just get on your bike and . . . go!
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine and his wife, both teachers, participate in an
organized weeklong group ride in a different state every summer.
Typically, the couple are among several hundred riders covering 50
to 75 miles a day, enjoying the best of Iowa or Vermont from top to
bottom. This summer, they're headed for Montana.
</P>
<P>
   It's never too late to get started. A gentleman in his 70s I
often see at the local YMCA told me recently that he had biked
round-trip to his high school reunion at Choate Academy in
Connecticut. Using some public transportation, the man covered over
200 miles in less than a week. He told me he had plotted his course
around the best places to stop for apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   Eating and bicycling do go together. A vigorous ride builds up a
ravenous appetite, and many rides are routed around essential food
stops. Stick-to-your-ribs snacks like a peanut butter sandwich or a
banana fill the bill. In addition to my bagel (and, of course,
water bottle), I've stuffed a Power Bar into my bike jersey. My
take-along meal proves to be insurance. Patty tells us we'll be
stopping at a deli midway.
</P>
<P>
   We travel two-lane back roads past the lush horse farms of Colts
Neck. I work at smoothing out my riding style for comfort and
efficiency. I pedal in a circular motion, lowering my heels, while
aiming for 90 to 100 revolutions a minute. I change hand positions
on the handlebars, setting my elbows at almost a right angle and
relaxing my neck and shoulders. I try to keep my torso still and
let my legs do all the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car back!'' Patty cries every so often, and the alert is
repeated down the line like an echo at a ball park. We move into
single file, then fan out again once the motorist passes. The 13-
to 14-miles-an-hour pace is a little slow for my taste, and I pull
to the front and stay there as we travel through farmland as far as
the eye can see. My shirt is moist, and I take sips of water.
Roadside fruit stands with fresh peaches _ gifts from heaven _ will
pop up later in the summer.

`EVER AFTER': PART SPOOF, PART SOAP OPERA, PART FEMINIST PEP TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sooner or later Cinderella was bound to be re-invented as a
resourceful young woman whose ascent from rags to riches depended
on her own pluck and not on the magical intercession of a fairy
godmother. Andy Tennant's bland, sappy costume comedy ``Ever After:
A Cinderella Story,'' portrays the most popular of all fairy-tale
characters as a kind of 16th-century Olympic hopeful going for the
gold on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Her happily-ever-after involves a lot more than marriage to a
handsome prince. Once she's got her man, her in-laws promise, per
her desires, to found a university with a library available to all
the people. Hubby even agrees to stop automatically assuming the
worst about Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being delivered from a life of oppression by a bland,
infatuated Prince Charming, this Cinderella, named Danielle (Drew
Barrymore), saves the life of her wimpy future husband, Prince
Henry (Dougray Scott), when the pair, while strolling through the
forest, are menaced by a band of outlaws. Danielle is in such
tiptop physical shape from all her menial chores that at one point
she actually picks up her dreamboat and slings him over her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they've wed, she has tutored him in the ugly
political realities of the world that his life of privilege has
prevented him from grasping. You see, Danielle's father, who died
when she was a child, used to bring home stacks of books including
Sir Thomas More's ``Utopia,'' which was instrumental in shaping her
vision of 16th-century France as an enlightened monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing the movie offers to a fairy godmother is
kindly Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey), who just happens to be
traipsing around in the French forest with a canvas of the ``Mona
Lisa'' under his arm. Old Leonardo (although the movie couldn't get
Leonardo DiCaprio, it at least gets to drop his first name) is
forever spouting icky platitudes about following your heart and
believing in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever After'' might have succeeded had it had a modicum of
historical consistency. But the dialogue (spoken by French
characters with English accents) sounds like a flattened-out
Anglicized version of contemporary teenspeak. Although the
screenplay puts its heroine in mortal peril more than once, the
rescues it contrives are unconvincing and anticlimactic. Veering
wildly between farce and suds, the movie never makes up its mind
whether it's a spoof, a soap opera or a feminist pep talk. The
overbearingly glutinous soundtrack by George Fenton relentlessly
pushes the movie toward mush.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most orthodox characters are Danielle's evil
stepmother, Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston), and two stepsisters, the
cold, conniving Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and the homely, gawky
Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey). Ms. Huston's Rodmilla could be a
cousin of Morticia Addams. Haughty and poker faced, with a streak
of cruelty, she is chilly and ambitious but a long way from truly
evil.
</P>
<P>
   The most contemporary element is Ms. Barrymore's Danielle.
Twinkly eyed and saucy in a tomboyish way, she is the very model of
a smart, modern college girl who knows how to stand up for herself
and remains resolutely undazzled by the make-over mentality. Ms.
Barrymore's buoyant, unaffected performance is the best thing about
the film. From Danielle's first meeting with the rather slow-witted
prince, it's obvious she's far too good for him.

<P>
   If this weren't the 16th century, you could almost swear that
Danielle had memorized ``The Rules: Time-Tested Secrets for
Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right,'' Ellen Fein and Sherrie
Schneider's best-selling guidebook for snaring men in suits.
Without hurting a man's feelings, this Cinderella knows exactly
when and how to say no.

VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY JUMPS TO THE TOP OF ITS CLASS

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ten months after the California Virtual
University popped up on the World Wide Web, making the audacious
claim it could link students worldwide with unrivaled educational
opportunities, CVU looks like the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, CVU has more than doubled, to 1,600, the
number of courses available electronically. At launch time, 65
accredited California colleges and universities appeared in the CVU
catalog. Now, there are 95.
</P>
<P>
   This growth, Gov. Pete Wilson said Wednesday, is only the
beginning. He believes there is almost unlimited potential for
long-distance higher education in California.
</P>
<P>
   California Virtual University _ a state-run Web catalog of
college courses offered on-line _ was turned over Wednesday to a
nonprofit foundation formed by educators.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson proposed the virtual university more than a year ago,
selling the project as a marketing tool for colleges and as a
career and skill booster to workers and employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that when we speak of an information age, that is
not just a glib phrase,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all our wishes are granted, there will be a work force that
is better educated and has better access to higher education _ a
citizenry that can gain the skills to function in the knowledge
society which is upon us,'' said Carol Tomlinson-Keasey, vice
provost of the University of California and chairwoman of the CVU
Foundation Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
   From the inception of the Web catalog, the state has believed
that its role should be minimal and that CVU should be directed by
educators. In its nascent period, it was given shape by teams of
teachers from the University of California, California State
University, California community colleges and the Association of
Independent California Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   An infusion of money accompanied Wednesday's spinoff from state
control. Redwood Shores-based Oracle Corp., with a $75,000
contribution, joined Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, Pacific Bell
and International Thomson Publishing as a founding corporate
sponsor of CVU.
</P>
<P>
   On-line courses have been available for some years, but are
growing rapidly in number and diversity. As many as 240 colleges
are expected to participate in the CVU within three years, said Jim
Highsmith, a CVU planner and immediate past president of the
Academic Senate of the California State University system.
</P>
<P>
   CVU's catalog (at www.california.edu) pulls into one
interactive, searchable forum the many on-line courses available.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The variety is extraordinary:
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of Southern California's Andrus Gerontology
Center (www.usc.edu/go/AgeWorks) is offering the nation's first
graduate gerontology program over the Internet. Topics include
successful aging and death and dying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beginning this fall, Stanford University will offer courses
that lead to a master's degree in electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, a community college, has
three offerings: World Civilization Since 1500, PC Care &AMP; Upgrade,
and Financial Accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The CVU catalog lists more than 100 certificate and degree
programs. Most are in engineering, technology and sciences, but
there also are programs in the humanities, general education,
business, health, education, environmental studies, vocational
education and agriculture.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no
self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug
dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the
second (to bear arms).
 &HT;    Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th
(powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the
states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one
of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling
Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few
people tried to ``take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow
travelers ``took the fifth.''
 &HT;    But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it
in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run.
Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words
of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt
Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of
power from the federal to the state level.
 &HT;    Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis
thought up for them, ``laboratories of democracy.'' And Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to
be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying
in the wilderness for many years.
 &HT;    The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities
are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting,
altering or killing programs.
 &HT;    _ In education, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers
for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in
colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant
children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to
teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to
gather on public grounds.
 &HT;    _ In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and
passed ``three strikes'' laws. They have experimented with ``truth
in sentencing'' (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative
sentencing and victims' compensation.
 &HT;    _ In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps,
mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the
control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
 &HT;    _ On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills
on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners'
benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
 &HT;    _ On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job
training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or
compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for
mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
 &HT;    _ On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new
protected areas and successfully defied federal regulations (for
example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York vs. United
States in 1992).
 &HT;    _ On health, they have considered regulations on assisted
suicide, HMOs, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS
patients.
 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,
since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place
after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed
to term limits: ``If you have people dumb enough to keep running
for office, like me, you should let the people decide.''
 &HT;    Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the
California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not
so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a
traffic jam of election ballots.
 &HT;    In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters'
choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco,
there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice
that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of
campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure
(Proposition 73) outlawing it.
 &HT;    Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for
plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in
20 states. The referendum too is becoming more important, as
Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
 &HT;    The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's
central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a
single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic
bad thing (the federal government). Local government can be
improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything
in between.
 &HT;    Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means
cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general
strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget
submitted by the Legislature. He has used the line-item veto more
than 1,500 times.
 &HT;    Advocates of direct democracy, such as Robert Wiebe, the
political historian and theorist, oppose ``government by experts,''
and Thompson sometimes makes fun of Washington ``know-it-alls'' who
could not pass his ``Elroy test'' (what his little hometown knows
is good for it). But Thompson also boasts of his reliance on
experts, called in from all quarters to help him with planning.
 &HT;    One of those experts, Lawrence Mead, wants to make welfare ``the
new paternalism,'' frankly telling people what is good for them.
Temperamentally, Thompson is inclined to such hectoring certitude,
despite his populist campaign rhetoric.
 &HT;    I recently followed Thompson, who was out to greet some
constituents at the state environmental center. With men, he has
some of Mario Cuomo's locker-room bluster. (``Don't be a wimp.'')
With women, he is a palsy chin-chucker.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that both his parents were teachers and his
wife still is (sixth grade in Elroy), he uses what must pass as
``street talk'' in rural Wisconsin _ ``setting'' for sitting,
``oncommon'' for uncommon, ``secatary'' for secretary.
 &HT;    He presents himself as embattled and with few allies: ``I'm the
only one still talking devolution.'' The Republican Congress is
``as bad as the president.'' He feels that he has the spirit of
Fighting Bob La Follette, the Wisconsin progressive _ except that
La Follette went after big business and Thompson is a sworn foe of
big government (at least in Washington). If one of Thompson's
projects fails, he wants us to believe, it will be because of his
encirclement by foes.
 &HT;    To get a ``top down'' view of the states' new activism, I
interviewed President Clinton in April. He had just come in from a
Rose Garden announcement of his education program. Clinton, the
policy wonk, was eager to talk governmental relations even when
aides were trying to move him to the next event. He finds the
states'-rights activism a healthy development.
 &HT;    On the one hand, Clinton does not see the states shoving the
federal government off the scene so much as interacting with it in
new ways. But Clinton takes a surprisingly benign view of state
initiatives that express popular feeling rather than court-imposed
mandates.
 &HT;    ``I don't agree with a lot of those votes,'' he said, ``but I
think they're votes that people have the right to make as long as
they don't contravene a federal statute or the Constitution.
Usually there is a legitimate concern that these referenda are
designed to address. Either representative government is going to
have to move quickly into the breach when one of these proposals is
on the ballot, so that it is not necessary by election time, or the
progressive populists are going to have to put their own
counterproposals on the ballot. I don't think you can stop this
movement any time soon when people want to have a more direct say
on public issues.''
 &HT;    We can see, by counterpointing the remarks of the governor and
the president, that there is little prospect of agreement in detail
on the future of states' rights. The president is well disposed
toward ballot initiatives, the most direct form of democracy.
Thompson is uneasy about uncoordinated proposals that might intrude
on his master strategy.
 &HT;    Thompson thinks Washington has been too slow and niggardly in
turning over money. Clinton's liberal critics, by contrast, think
he was too quick to untie strings over welfare programs. The
president himself considered the Republican bill he signed too
sweeping on some matters, but feels he remedied that by restoring
food stamps and child-care provisions.
 &HT;    I asked him if he thinks that state welfare programs, spotty in
their success even during a prosperous time, will stand up when
economic reverses come.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely, as long as we keep the fundamental protection for
children. We had, in my view, state-by-state settling of
reimbursement for welfare families anyway.
 &HT;    ``Before I signed the welfare bill, the reimbursement schedule
for a family of three on welfare went from a low of $185 in
Mississippi and Texas to a high of $660 in Vermont, and most states
had welfare payments that were lower in real dollar terms,
considerably lower, than they had been in the early '70s, because
they had not kept up with inflation. So the Congress, long before I
came along, had de facto ceded the monthly payments to the states
anyway. Now the states are responsible.
 &HT;    ``In the old days, nobody had to take responsibility for the
welfare of the family and of the children, or whether there was a
work-based program. Everybody could always kick the responsibility
around. They could say that 'in our state the federal government
has all these rules _ and, oh, by the way, it's operated by the
county.' I think that locating responsibility and fixing it with
the states will be more positive than negative.''
 &HT;    It is here that Thompson gets heated in his comments on the
president. ``President Clinton has done everything he possibly can
to stymie what we're trying to do in Wisconsin.''
 &HT;    He has words just as harsh for Donna Shalala of Health and Human
Services. ``I could get matching grants'' for new programs,
Thompson complains _ but the government will not turn over the
money he feels he needs. On this point Thompson will get no help
from the federal courts. They have repeatedly ruled that states
have to observe federal conditions if they accept federal money.
 &HT;    So far, with the help of a booming economy in Wisconsin, the
governor has kept on top of things. When I suggest that federal
oversight might be justified by less commendable showings in other
states, he is dismissive.
 &HT;    ``They're always saying that, that the states were going to be
having a race to the bottom. I told them: 'You're wrong. That may
have happened in the '40s and '50s. But right now you've got
governors who are so darn competitive. They don't want to read that
they're not taking care of the poor, and they're not going to let a
governor in an adjoining state get ahead of them. We're very
competitive.'''
 &HT;    But the states are vulnerable to national forces too. Clinton
ended our interview by noticing how the hard line between domestic
and foreign policy is being dissolved. There is a parallel
softening of the division between state and national life, not just
in government but in every sphere.
 &HT;    This does not mean that states are not better at handling some
things or at conducting experiments not easily tried on a national
scale.
 &HT;    There will be, as Clinton says, new kinds of interaction,
dialogue and dispute. All that is healthy. But a 10th Amendment
fundamentalism that looks back to the muscular states of the
Jacksonian era is, by now, an exercise in nostalgia for ``good old
days'' that were not all that good.

 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,
since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place
after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed
to term limits: ``If you have people dumb enough to keep running
for office, like me, you should let the people decide.''
 &HT;    Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the
California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not
so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a
traffic jam of election ballots.
 &HT;    In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters'
choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco,
there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice
that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of
campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure
(Proposition 73) outlawing it.
 &HT;    Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for
plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in
20 states. The referendum too is becoming more important, as
Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
 &HT;    The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's
central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a
single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic
bad thing (the federal government). Local government can be
improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything
in between.
 &HT;    Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means
cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general
strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget
submitted by the Legislature. He has used the line-item veto more
than 1,500 times.
 &HT;    Advocates of direct democracy, such as Robert Wiebe, the
political historian and theorist, oppose ``government by experts,''
and Thompson sometimes makes fun of Washington ``know-it-alls'' who
could not pass his ``Elroy test'' (what his little hometown knows
is good for it). But Thompson also boasts of his reliance on
experts, called in from all quarters to help him with planning.
 &HT;    One of those experts, Lawrence Mead, wants to make welfare ``the
new paternalism,'' frankly telling people what is good for them.
Temperamentally, Thompson is inclined to such hectoring certitude,
despite his populist campaign rhetoric.
 &HT;    I recently followed Thompson, who was out to greet some
constituents at the state environmental center. With men, he has
some of Mario Cuomo's locker-room bluster. (``Don't be a wimp.'')
With women, he is a palsy chin-chucker.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that both his parents were teachers and his
wife still is (sixth grade in Elroy), he uses what must pass as
``street talk'' in rural Wisconsin _ ``setting'' for sitting,
``oncommon'' for uncommon, ``secatary'' for secretary.
 &HT;    He presents himself as embattled and with few allies: ``I'm the
only one still talking devolution.'' The Republican Congress is
``as bad as the president.'' He feels that he has the spirit of
Fighting Bob La Follette, the Wisconsin progressive _ except that
La Follette went after big business and Thompson is a sworn foe of
big government (at least in Washington). If one of Thompson's
projects fails, he wants us to believe, it will be because of his
encirclement by foes.
 &HT;    To get a ``top down'' view of the states' new activism, I
interviewed President Clinton in April. He had just come in from a
Rose Garden announcement of his education program. Clinton, the
policy wonk, was eager to talk governmental relations even when
aides were trying to move him to the next event. He finds the
states'-rights activism a healthy development.
 &HT;    On the one hand, Clinton does not see the states shoving the
federal government off the scene so much as interacting with it in
new ways. But Clinton takes a surprisingly benign view of state
initiatives that express popular feeling rather than court-imposed
mandates.
 &HT;    ``I don't agree with a lot of those votes,'' he said, ``but I
think they're votes that people have the right to make as long as
they don't contravene a federal statute or the Constitution.
Usually there is a legitimate concern that these referenda are
designed to address. Either representative government is going to
have to move quickly into the breach when one of these proposals is
on the ballot, so that it is not necessary by election time, or the
progressive populists are going to have to put their own
counterproposals on the ballot. I don't think you can stop this
movement any time soon when people want to have a more direct say
on public issues.''
 &HT;    We can see, by counterpointing the remarks of the governor and
the president, that there is little prospect of agreement in detail
on the future of states' rights. The president is well disposed
toward ballot initiatives, the most direct form of democracy.
Thompson is uneasy about uncoordinated proposals that might intrude
on his master strategy.
 &HT;    Thompson thinks Washington has been too slow and niggardly in
turning over money. Clinton's liberal critics, by contrast, think
he was too quick to untie strings over welfare programs. The
president himself considered the Republican bill he signed too
sweeping on some matters, but feels he remedied that by restoring
food stamps and child-care provisions.
 &HT;    I asked him if he thinks that state welfare programs, spotty in
their success even during a prosperous time, will stand up when
economic reverses come.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely, as long as we keep the fundamental protection for
children. We had, in my view, state-by-state settling of
reimbursement for welfare families anyway.
 &HT;    ``Before I signed the welfare bill, the reimbursement schedule
for a family of three on welfare went from a low of $185 in
Mississippi and Texas to a high of $660 in Vermont, and most states
had welfare payments that were lower in real dollar terms,
considerably lower, than they had been in the early '70s, because
they had not kept up with inflation. So the Congress, long before I
came along, had de facto ceded the monthly payments to the states
anyway. Now the states are responsible.
 &HT;    ``In the old days, nobody had to take responsibility for the
welfare of the family and of the children, or whether there was a
work-based program. Everybody could always kick the responsibility
around. They could say that 'in our state the federal government
has all these rules _ and, oh, by the way, it's operated by the
county.' I think that locating responsibility and fixing it with
the states will be more positive than negative.''
 &HT;    It is here that Thompson gets heated in his comments on the
president. ``President Clinton has done everything he possibly can
to stymie what we're trying to do in Wisconsin.''
 &HT;    He has words just as harsh for Donna Shalala of Health and Human
Services. ``I could get matching grants'' for new programs,
Thompson complains _ but the government will not turn over the
money he feels he needs. On this point Thompson will get no help
from the federal courts. They have repeatedly ruled that states
have to observe federal conditions if they accept federal money.
 &HT;    So far, with the help of a booming economy in Wisconsin, the
governor has kept on top of things. When I suggest that federal
oversight might be justified by less commendable showings in other
states, he is dismissive.
 &HT;    ``They're always saying that, that the states were going to be
having a race to the bottom. I told them: 'You're wrong. That may
have happened in the '40s and '50s. But right now you've got
governors who are so darn competitive. They don't want to read that
they're not taking care of the poor, and they're not going to let a
governor in an adjoining state get ahead of them. We're very
competitive.'''
 &HT;    But the states are vulnerable to national forces too. Clinton
ended our interview by noticing how the hard line between domestic
and foreign policy is being dissolved. There is a parallel
softening of the division between state and national life, not just
in government but in every sphere.
 &HT;    This does not mean that states are not better at handling some
things or at conducting experiments not easily tried on a national
scale.
 &HT;    There will be, as Clinton says, new kinds of interaction,
dialogue and dispute. All that is healthy. But a 10th Amendment
fundamentalism that looks back to the muscular states of the
Jacksonian era is, by now, an exercise in nostalgia for ``good old
days'' that were not all that good.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last fall, the high-tech industry lost another
battle in its quiet legislative war against the nation's top
crime-fighters and code-busters.
</P>
<P>
   Four House committees had failed to agree on one of the
industry's top priorities: a bill to allow the export of powerful
software to protect electronic data with virtually unbreakable
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the setback, industry lobbyists began exploring a new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   It started with tentative discussions and a few phone calls.
Just 10 months later, it has grown into the biggest, best-funded
lobbying army in the tech industry's history, commanded by a
bipartisan team of political heavyweights and wielding a nationally
televised ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now the coalition, under the market-tested name of Americans for
Computer Privacy, may be on the verge of extracting compromise
language from federal security agencies that could lead to new
legislation or a favorable re-interpretation of existing export
laws.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the effort may someday be cited as a textbook case of how
an interest group can use the traditional levers of Washington
power _ money, lobbying, public opinion and political connections _
to make the system work for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the tech industry has sought federal permission
to export technology that will protect electronic messages and
records with the newest and strongest codes possible.
</P>
<P>
   They watched enviously as foreign software companies threatened
to capture markets around the world with powerful encryption
programs similar to ones that U.S. companies sell at home, but are
forbidden by federal law to sell abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robust foreign encryption is being so widely used that if U.S.
companies can't sell their products with encryption in it, they'll
either move production offshore or export product with a 'hole' in
it, so the user can plug in foreign encryption,'' said Jeffrey
Smith, a leading lawyer for the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and the Defense Department's National Security
Agency have different priorities. They object to widespread sales
of codes so strong that they are unbreakable not just by
competitors, crooks and hackers, but also by law enforcement
agencies and American spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I'm going to agree to is that American
encryption gets used by terrorists overseas without any effort on
our part to control that,'' Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre
warned Fortune 500 technology officials in Aspen, Colo., last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors are ``very much concerned about
commercially available encryption products being manufactured for
use in or imported into the United States that do not allow for
access to plain text by law enforcement pursuant to court orders,''
said FBI special agent Barry Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such objections, Congress has consistently rebuffed
the tech industry's pleas to loosen export restrictions, including
the House committees' impasse last September.
</P>
<P>
   After that setback, Ira Rubinstein, a senior Microsoft Corp.
attorney in Redmond, Wash., and his colleagues conceived the idea
of a powerful new coalition to educate public officials on the
issue and put pressure on them to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of phone calls, the lobbyists from the world's
biggest software company refined the idea with their counterparts
at the biggest chip maker, Intel Corp., and the biggest computer
network firm, Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   They were encouraged by calls to and from other giants of the
high-tech industry and their network of allies among senators,
House members and congressional employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein was reluctant to claim personal credit for ramping up
the discussions, saying only that ``a lot of the people who staff
this issue know each other and talk to each other on a regular
basis.'' But others said Rubinstein took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-tech firms stayed aloof. They included IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, and other companies with more sympathy for the
views of their government customers or less interest in
mass-marketed encryption.
</P>
<P>
   But the coalition signed up many other high-tech firms whose
leaders see stronger codes as a key selling point for the next
generation of hacker-resistant communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications, both among
the fiercest competitors of Microsoft, jumped on board.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was formally launched March 4 as Americans for
Computer Privacy, after focus groups responded well to the name's
positive connotations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel and Cisco agreed to be the coalition's biggest
funders. Representatives of 10 other high-tech companies and the
Business Software Alliance, which represents software manufacturers
in 65 countries, joined them on ACP's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had in common is, we all were being screamed at by our
customers ... who want us to fix this so that they can have secure
networks.'','' said lobbyist Dan Scheinman at the headquarters of
Cisco Systems in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the customers were eager to join as well. One was the
American Automobile Manufacturers Association. Its member firms
would like to cooperate on a cheap, more efficient system for
communicating with their suppliers around the globe _ but only if
each competitor could be absolutely certain that the other firms
couldn't decode its messages.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-industry trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber and
the National Association of Manufacturers, which together had 23
staff lobbyists working on the issue, joined. So did some smaller
business groups, like the Small Business Survival Committee, where
the only paid lobbyist is its president, Karen Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of small businesses in high-tech, and we're
concerned that government restrictions on entrepreneurs would crimp
job creation, so we agreed'' to join, Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Issue-oriented interest groups also climbed aboard. One early
member was Americans for Tax Reform, a Republican-subsidized
lobbying group whose president, Grover Norquist, has worked as a
part-time lobbyist for Microsoft. ``Our people don't want
government getting into their computers and reading their e-mail,
and they don't want overbearing, intrusive government regulations
destroying their sense of privacy,'' said Audrey Mullen, the
group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Other ACP members include the National Rifle Association and a
pro-gun, antiregulatory group it helped start that bears the
politically useful name of Law Enforcement Alliance of America.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition organizers had a little less luck at the left end of
the political spectrum. The American Civil Liberties Union and two
leading cyber-libertarian groups, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, endorsed
the coalition's efforts but refused to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important to keep an independent voice for the
user community, and we differ with them on some details,'' said
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit
spin-off started by former EFF and ACLU staffers, overcame similar
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined because we agree with their desire to fight against
any domestic controls on encryption and to promote export relief,''
said Alan Davidson, the center's staff counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in ACP has been so intense that the coalition, which
had only 26 potential members as recently as mid-February, has now
grown to embrace 40 associations, more than 90 companies and more
than 2,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the deep pockets of its main corporate sponsors, ACP
has spent about $2 million since March, about half of it on cable,
print and Internet ads. It has enough corporate pledges left in its
war chest to spend another $3 million to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ACP has assembled a top-dollar team of lobbyists, consultants,
lawyers, ad agencies, academics, webmasters and cybercasters from
the pool of professionals in the capital who shift smoothly between
government jobs and private for-profit and non-profit posts.
</P>
<P>
   The group's budget is not much by Washington standards _ no more
than half the annual lobbying budget of just one of its members,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce _ but many of its members are already
well-connected. In addition to supporting ACP, they have given more
than $7 million in federal campaign contributions in the last year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of ACP's organization chart sit a bipartisan pair of
generals, a typical feature of large-scale lobbying campaigns aimed
at both the Republican-controlled Congress and the
Democratic-controlled White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican operative Ed Gillespie, ACP's executive director,
plays a ``Mr. Outside'' role involving public appearances and work
with sympathetic members of Congress. A veteran House staffer,
Gillespie is president of a public relations firm chaired by former
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, a lobbyist
whose clients include Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic attorney Jack Quinn, ACP's general counsel and a
partner in the powerful Washington law firm of Arnold and Porter,
is ``Mr. Inside,'' in charge of executive-branch strategy. His most
recent government jobs include general counsel to President Clinton
and chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of its well-connected leadership, ACP has
focused its efforts where they could do the most good.
</P>
<P>
   Its lobbyists have conducted briefings in the offices of 230
House members and 30 senators, and its representatives have held
closed negotiations on a possible encryption compromise with a team
of officials from the White House and the Departments of Commerce,
Justice, Treasury and Defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one session at the headquarters of the
National Security Agency in Maryland, those meetings have been held
in downtown Washington at the Madison Hotel or in the law offices
of Arnold and Porter.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to disclose the contents of the talks because
the government participants were assembled by the Office of
Management and Budget and the National Security Council. As parts
of the White House bureaucracy, OMB and the NSC are exempt from
laws requiring open meetings and disclosure of information.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are co-chaired by OMB technology chief Bruce
McConnell and Smith, the ACP lawyer who is a colleague of Quinn's
at Arnold and Porter. Smith served as counsel to the Senate Armed
Services Committee when its chairman was Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
his most recent government job was general counsel of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the administration's attitude was that they could
block any legislation that didn't like, which was probably true,''
Smith said. ``But the marketplace is putting them under pressure to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACP submitted its latest compromise offer in early May, and
posted a copy on its World Wide Web page
(http://www.computerprivacy.org). McConnell expects the
administration to respond by announcing a new position in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in intense discussions not only with ACP, but with other
industry groups,'' said an administration official who declined to
be quoted by name. ``They have come up with some creative ideas for
addressing law enforcement's requirements, but we think that there
are are also national security issues left to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That is consistent with the public comments of Hamre, the second
highest official in the Defense Department, which houses the
National Security Agency's vaunted code-busting machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is working very actively with law enforcement
and with (the) Commerce existing export laws.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the effort may someday be cited as a textbook case of how
an interest group can use the traditional levers of Washington
power _ money, lobbying, public opinion and political connections _
to make the system work for it.

networks.'','' said lobbyist Dan Scheinman at the headquarters of
Cisco Systems in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the customers were eager to join as well. One was the
American Automobile Manufacturers Association. Its member firms
would like to cooperate on a cheap, more efficient system for
communicating with their suppliers around the globe _ but only if
each competitor could be absolutely certain that the other firms
couldn't decode its messages.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-industry trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber and
the National Association of Manufacturers, which together had 23
staff lobbyists working on the issue, joined. So did some smaller
business groups, like the Small Business Survival Committee, where
the only paid lobbyist is its president, Karen Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of small businesses in high-tech, and we're
concerned that government restrictions on entrepreneurs would crimp
job creation, so we agreed'' to join, Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Issue-oriented interest groups also climbed aboard. One early
member was Americans for Tax Reform, a Republican-subsidized
lobbying group whose president, Grover Norquist, has worked as a
part-time lobbyist for Microsoft. ``Our people don't want
government getting into their computers and reading their e-mail,
and they don't want overbearing, intrusive government regulations
destroying their sense of privacy,'' said Audrey Mullen, the
group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Other ACP members include the National Rifle Association and a
pro-gun, antiregulatory group it helped start that bears the
politically useful name of Law Enforcement Alliance of America.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition organizers had a little less luck at the left end of
the political spectrum. The American Civil Liberties Union and two
leading cyber-libertarian groups, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, endorsed
the coalition's efforts but refused to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important to keep an independent voice for the
user community, and we differ with them on some details,'' said
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit
spin-off started by former EFF and ACLU staffers, overcame similar
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined because we agree with their desire to fight against
any domestic controls on encryption and to promote export relief,''
said Alan Davidson, the center's staff counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in ACP has been so intense that the coalition, which
had only 26 potential members as recently as mid-February, has now
grown to embrace 40 associations, more than 90 companies and more
than 2,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the deep pockets of its main corporate sponsors, ACP
has spent about $2 million since March, about half of it on cable,
print and Internet ads. It has enough corporate pledges left in its
war chest to spend another $3 million to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ACP has assembled a top-dollar team of lobbyists, consultants,
lawyers, ad agencies, academics, webmasters and cybercasters from
the pool of professionals in the capital who shift smoothly between
government jobs and private for-profit and non-profit posts.
</P>
<P>
   The group's budget is not much by Washington standards _ no more
than half the annual lobbying budget of just one of its members,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce _ but many of its members are already
well-connected. In addition to supporting ACP, they have given more
than $7 million in federal campaign contributions in the last year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of ACP's organization chart sit a bipartisan pair of
generals, a typical feature of large-scale lobbying campaigns aimed
at both the Republican-controlled Congress and the
Democratic-controlled White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican operative Ed Gillespie, ACP's executive director,
plays a ``Mr. Outside'' role involving public appearances and work
with sympathetic members of Congress. A veteran House staffer,
Gillespie is president of a public relations firm chaired by former
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, a lobbyist
whose clients include Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic attorney Jack Quinn, ACP's general counsel and a
partner in the powerful Washington law firm of Arnold and Porter,
is ``Mr. Inside,'' in charge of executive-branch strategy. His most
recent government jobs include general counsel to President Clinton
and chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of its well-connected leadership, ACP has
focused its efforts where they could do the most good.
</P>
<P>
   Its lobbyists have conducted briefings in the offices of 230
House members and 30 senators, and its representatives have held
closed negotiations on a possible encryption compromise with a team
of officials from the White House and the Departments of Commerce,
Justice, Treasury and Defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one session at the headquarters of the
National Security Agency in Maryland, those meetings have been held
in downtown Washington at the Madison Hotel or in the law offices
of Arnold and Porter.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to disclose the contents of the talks because
the government participants were assembled by the Office of
Management and Budget and the National Security Council. As parts
of the White House bureaucracy, OMB and the NSC are exempt from
laws requiring open meetings and disclosure of information.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are co-chaired by OMB technology chief Bruce
McConnell and Smith, the ACP lawyer who is a colleague of Quinn's
at Arnold and Porter. Smith served as counsel to the Senate Armed
Services Committee when its chairman was Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
his most recent government job was general counsel of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the administration's attitude was that they could
block any legislation that didn't like, which was probably true,''
Smith said. ``But the marketplace is putting them under pressure to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACP submitted its latest compromise offer in early May, and
posted a copy on its World Wide Web page
(http://www.computerprivacy.org). McConnell expects the
administration to respond by announcing a new position in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in intense discussions not only with ACP, but with other
industry groups,'' said an administration official who declined to
be quoted by name. ``They have come up with some creative ideas for
addressing law enforcement's requirements, but we think that there
are are also national security issues left to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That is consistent with the public comments of Hamre, the second
highest official in the Defense Department, which houses the
National Security Agency's vaunted code-busting machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is working very actively with law enforcement
and with (the) Commerce (Department) on a strategy that we think
will help break through this,'' Hamre said. He dropped hints that
in the administration's internal debates, he has argued that
foreign sales of the stronger encryption technology should be
phased in over several years.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Hamre told the Fortune 500 technology executives:
``I think that in the next several weeks, we'll be able to finally
hammer this out.''

   THE U.S.-COLOMBIA CONNECTION:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. exports to Colombia, dominated by chemicals, were $5.2
billion in 1997 compared to $4.6 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. imports from Colombia -- mostly petroleum, coffee and cut
flowers -- were $4.7 billion in 1997, up from $3.7 billion in 1995.

million in aid this year. The United States has about 200 military
advisers in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Trade between Florida and Colombia totaled $4.09 billion in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An estimated 1 million Colombians live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   --About 50,000 Colombians live in the states of Georgia,

</P>
<P>
   --About 60,000 Colombians live in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some of the U.S. companies operating in Colombia include
American Airlines, the Coca-Cola Co., General Motors Corp.,
Gillette, IBM, Microsoft, Mobil, and Xerox Corp.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL FACTS &AMP; FIGURES ABOUT COLOMBIA:
</P>
<P>
   The land: About the size of Texas and New Mexico combined at
439,735 square miles, Colombia is in the northwestern corner of
South America, bordered by Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and
Venezuela. It is the fourth largest country in South America with
coast lines on both the Caribbean and Pacific. The capital, Bogota,
has a population of 6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The people: Colombia has a population of 36 million, of whom
about 58 percent are Mestizo, 20 percent are Caucasian, and 14
percent are Mulatto. At least 95 percent of the population is Roman
Catholic. The language is Spanish and the literacy rate is 87
percent. Education is free and supposed to be compulsory, but many
children in rural areas don't go to school.
</P>
<P>
   The government: The Senate has 102 members and the Chamber of
Representatives has 161. The president, who appoints his 13
ministers, is elected by popular vote for a term of four years. The
president-elect is Andres Pastrana, who will replace Ernesto Samper
when he takes office Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The history: Almost from its inception, Colombia has been a
scene of strife. Leftist rebels, that number about 15,000 today,
have fought the government for 34 years. One leftist group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), is Latin America's
largest and oldest guerrilla force. About 35,000 people have been
killed in the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The economy: Chief crops are coffee, rice, tobacco, cotton,
sugar, and bananas. As well as oil and gas, Colombia has the
largest coal reserves in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT PRESIDENT-ELECT ANDRES PASTRANA:
</P>
<P>
   Age: 44.
</P>
<P>
   Personal: Married to Norha Puyana; three children.
</P>
<P>
   Party: Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   Background: Born in Bogota, Pastrana is the son of the late
former President Misael Pastrana. He was once the mayor of Bogota,
a senator, and a television journalist. He narrowly lost a bid for
president in 1994 against Ernesto Samper.

   MIAMI _ The South American country of Colombia is a land of
music, emeralds, riotous carnivals, and breathtaking snow-capped
peaks, the exotic land of Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez and
his modern classic ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a land of murder and violence, where more people are
kidnapped for ransom -- or because they work for foreign oil
companies -- than anywhere else on the planet, the land where a
grinding civil war has killed some 35,000 Colombians in three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Friday(Aug. 7), it will become a land of rare optimism
when Andres Pastrana, the photogenic, blue-eyed former mayor of
Bogota, Colombia's capital, is sworn in as the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana had run a lackluster campaign against Horacio Serpa,
the candidate hand-picked by outgoing President Ernesto Samper. So
much so, that the election easily could have gone either way.
</P>
<P>
   But since his surprising win on June 21, Pastrana, 44, has
rattled his critics and delighted his supporters by improving the
image of his country even before taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Last month(July), when Colombians thought Pastrana was
celebrating his victory in France by watching the World Cup final,
he was traipsing through the jungle for secret talks with leaders
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Latin
America's oldest and largest rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC -- and the smaller Cuban-inspired National Liberation
Army (ELN) -- number nearly 20,000 fighters. Demanding a
more-responsive government and increased social spending, they've
tried to topple the Colombian government since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But now the FARC and the ELN say they will launch peace talks --
the first in six years -- with Pastrana during his first 90 days in
office, a sign that bloodshed may be nearing an end. Officials with
the Colombian military, which has traditionally wielded great
influence over the government, have not indicated whether they will
participate.
</P>
<P>
   In still another positive sign -- this one indicating a thaw in
icy U.S.-Colombia relations -- Pastrana is scheduled to meet
Monday(Aug. 3) with President Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, White House press secretary Mike McCurry was asked
whether the meeting signals an improvement in U.S.-Colombia
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it will. It will certainly be a chance for them to
address a broad range of issues on the bilateral agenda, including
narcotics cooperation, as well as President-elect Pastrana's
efforts to begin a peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States held such an aversion for Samper, Pastrana's
predecessor, it revoked his tourist visa in 1996 after allegations
surfaced that he knowingly accepted $6 million in campaign
contributions from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But how fast and how far Pastrana can go remains to be seen in a
nation so mired in political and economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is still the cocaine capital of the world, where up to
80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States -- and a
growing amount of heroin -- is produced.
</P>
<P>
   And it's still a place where violence mars daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, a dozen bombs exploded outside banks in
Medellin, once home to the world's most powerful drug cartel,
shattering windows and blowing off doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the money involved, drug traffickers are able to
corrupt every level of society, and so nothing's going to improve
in Colombia as long as that's the case,'' said Larry Birns, head of
the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based
research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for drugs in the United States isn't going away,''
he said. ``There still isn't an alternative for farmers who grow
coca.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an ineffectual Samper administration, the country's rebel
forces expanded their influence, and have taken control of nearly
40 percent of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   These guerrillas have kidnapped hundreds of civilians, among
them four American tourists who were on a bird-watching vacation in
late March.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have clear links to the drug trade, and are thought
to provide protection for airstrips, cultivation fields, and the
processing plants that produce heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its anti-narcotics effort, the United States has
given $100 million to the Colombian military this year, or more
than three times the total two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's military forces are 147,000-members strong -- some
19,500 of whom are properly trained in anti-guerrilla tactics --
but have been ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   This ineffectiveness is why Pastrana's incoming administration,
although working toward peace, announced Thursday a 59-percent
increase in defense and security spending next year, to $4.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But that may only make it harder for the administration to boost
social spending, sure to be one of the rebels' key demands during
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Pastrana inherits a troubled economy, in which the
inflation rate tops 20 percent, the gap between the rich and poor
is widening and the unemployment rate is at an all-time high of
14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters say Pastrana, who comes from a long line of
politicians and is the son of a former president, may have the
background and the determination to turn the tide in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Pastrana was kidnapped by the Medellin drug cartel
during his mayoral campaign, then was freed a week later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the fluent English-speaker narrowly lost a bid for
president to Samper. Then, three days later, he blew the whistle on
his opponent by playing a taped phone conversation in which a
leading Cali cartel drug trafficker discussed contributing to the
Samper campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to June's election, which ended the ruling Liberal Party's
12-year lock on the presidency, the Conservative Party's Pastrana
campaigned on an anti-corruption platform. He vowed to improve
U.S.-Colombia relations, engage the rebels in peace talks, and
better the lot of the 18 million Colombians who live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My foreign policy will aim to restore Colombia's lost dignity.
To regain the respect that our people deserve in the international
community so that once again we can be proud to pronounce
Colombia's name in all corners of the world,'' Pastrana said
following the election.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good, according to his fans.
</P>
<P>
   Following Pastrana's historic face-to-face meeting with FARC
leaders, Colombian guerrillas and civilian organizations agreed
that they will hold a national convention before Oct. 12 to discuss
economic and social reforms that could pave the way for a permanent
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Equally as important, leaders of the main right-wing
paramilitary groups, which for years have imposed a reign of terror
in rural Colombia, said they would be willing to join peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists say that state abuses have increased in
recent years, with the number of extra-judicial killings and
disappearances climbing from 2,036 in 1996, to 2,416 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And following exploratory peace talks last month in Germany with
Colombian business, social, and church leaders, the ELN, the
country's second-largest rebel group, promised to stop at least
some military activities, most notably against foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana also has vowed to remove security forces from 16,000
square miles of southern Colombia after he takes office. This was a
stumbling block to formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Colombian military remains an important wild card in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana will need the United States to apply pressure on the
Colombian military to get them involved,'' said Coletta Youngers,
an expert on Colombia at the Washington Office on Latin America, a
liberal think tank. ``Unless the military's involved, the process
won't be successful, and the military's been pretty quiet.''

 By JONATHAN VAN METER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Long before ``South Park'' became the national phenomenon that
it is today, David Zucker had approached its creators _ Trey Parker
and Matt Stone _ with ``Baseketball,'' the first film he had
written in seven years.
 &HT;    Back in 1980, Zucker and his brother Jerry, outsiders in
Hollywood, had become something of a sensation with their first
movie, ``Airplane!'' _ a classic, with its memorably offensive
one-liners and ridiculous sight gags.
 &HT;    Over the years since, Zucker had grown frustrated by a climate
that seemed increasingly afraid of the outrageous, taboo-busting
humor that made ``Airplane!'' so fresh and funny. He sat out much
of the '90s before finally writing ``Baseketball,'' a goofy comedy
that aspired to be a satire about our national sports culture.
 &HT;    ``I think the best thing that happened to me,'' Zucker says,
``was to have Matt and Trey come along and say, `Well, you know,
``Baseketball'' is a great idea for a movie, but it's tame.' I just
went bananas. I was so embarrassed.''
 &HT;    ``We went to a couple of read-throughs,'' Stone says, ``and we
peppered a few lines with our humor, and it would get a big laugh.
We felt we had nothing to lose, so Trey and I started going off:
`This is a guy's movie. It's a sports parody. This is what every
guy lives through _ the whole sports, buddy, triumph-glory bull _
and we're making fun of a lot of that, and this is the way guys
talk.''
 &HT;    Zucker, who was a fan of Parker and Stone's student films and
had worked with them on a couple of shorts, had originally wanted
Parker to direct ``Baseketball,'' but he turned it down because he
was in the midst of starting work on ``South Park.''
 &HT;    One day, when Zucker and a producer were casting the film _
looking through a pile of head shots _ the producer said, ``What
about Trey Parker?'' Zucker thought it was an inspired idea, not
realizing that the producer meant the other Trey Parker _ a
modestly successful character actor. No matter. The mixup had
turned on a light: Zucker could hire Parker and Stone to play the
two buddies around whom the film turns and, for the same price,
exploit the spontaneous shenanigans that lie at the heart of the
Parker-Stone bond.
 &HT;    Because the two know each other and their idiosyncrasies so
well, Parker, 28, and Stone, 27, suggested things that no one else
could have thought of, things that predictably racheted up the
gross-and-shocking quotient. In one scene, for example, the two of
them are talking in the dugout and Parker is chewing a chaw of
tobacco. It was his idea to give it to Stone, who puts the tobacco
in his mouth and keeps right on chewing.
 &HT;    Jenny McCarthy, the former star of MTV's ``Singled Out,'' plays
a sort of young Zsa Zsa Gabor in ``Baseketball.'' No stranger to
grossness herself, McCarthy once posed for a shoe ad sitting on the
toilet reading a newspaper. ``They're kind of like any guy next
door _ just with a whole lot of talent,'' she says. ``We try to
battle each other to see who can talk the most disgusting. They're
so in line with my kind of humor, which is where I hope comedy is
going. They did a lot of improv in 'Baseketball.' It has a lot of
'South Park' touches to it.''
 &HT;    If ``Baseketball,'' which opens July 31, is a hit, it will be in
no small part because of Parker and Stone, who are in the odd,
perhaps unprecedented, position of being famous unknowns.
 &HT;    ``They come to it with the aura of their success,'' Zucker says.
``They have all that cachet because they're the authors of `South
Park.' People are already set to cheer for them. But they're
behind-the-scenes guys.''
 &HT;    Shortly before the release of `Baseketball,' I ask Stone if he's
looking forward to becoming a movie star. ``I'm totally
unprepared,'' he says. ``I hate the fact that I can't walk down the
street already without people looking at me. I went to this cheesy
bar last night and no 21-year-old Hollywood person was coming up
and going: `Heeey! Matt Stone!' I had the best time just sinking
into obscurity again, which is especially hard to do in LA.'' He
heaves a big sigh. ``We're going to Las Vegas this weekend, and I
know it's just going to be awful, walking around with everyone
yelling: `Hey! South Park! Can we get a picture?'''
 &HT;    No one could ever have guessed that ``South Park'' _ a crude,
funny, disturbing, adorable, obnoxious little cartoon on a cable
channel that millions of Americans still can't get _ would become
so huge so fast. What made the success of ``South Park'' different
from that of other adult animated series like ``The Simpsons'' and
``Beavis and Butthead'' is that it happened all at once.
 &HT;    The show made its debut last August and by December it was the
highest-rated show ever, by far, on Comedy Central _ as well as the
inspiration for the top-selling T-shirt in America. Parker and
Stone employ scatological humor fairly regularly; last year's
Christmas special, for example, featured a piece of talking,
singing feces named Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo.
 &HT;    The most striking thing about ``South Park,'' which centers on a
group of boys in third grade, however, is its ability to pluck the
strings of fear and hatred in a surprisingly serious way. The show
plays with phobias in lines such as, ``Your mom's a Jew,'' ``Could
we get rid of all the Mexicans?'' and ``Asian culture has plagued
our fragile earth for many years. We must end it.''
 &HT;    These lines _ usually spoken by Parker and Stone and coming out
of the mouths of cartoon children _ are truly subversive. And yet,
nestled amid all the carnage (the same character dies a bloody
death in every episode) and hate speech, there is always a moral _
often of the touchy-feely, can't-we-all-just-get-along variety.
 &HT;    One of their best shows _ and Parker and Stone's favorite _ is
titled ''Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,'' and features the
exaggerated, lisping character known as Big Gay Al. Stan, one of
the third-grade characters on the show, finds out that his dog is
gay and suffers endless mortification at the hands of his friends,
who shout, ``Stan's dog's a homo!''
 &HT;    Eventually, Stan learns about tolerance from Big Gay Al, and in
the end, all is well in South Park. What often keeps the show from
being offensive is this kind of sweetness _ and that it's funny.
 &HT;    In a recent, dicier episode, the four main characters travel to
China for a dodge-ball tournament. The Chinese announcers are drawn
in what can only be described as cartoon yellowface, while their
voices mock Asians speaking bad English. The twist is that the
Chinese announcers are making fun of American accents and ``big
eyes.'' It's a tricky game Parker and Stone are playing, and it
doesn't always work. ``That was a deep one,'' Stone says.
 &HT;    ``It's totally offensive. But we did it in a way to make a
point: turning it around. So it's us doing Chinese accents, making
fun of the Chinese, who are doing accents making fun of Americans.
It's just to say, `Who cares?'''
 &HT;    Good question, though a more precise inquiry might be: Does
everyone get it? Are some of the ``South Park'' fans simply
laughing at Jew jokes or goofy Chinese accents or gay stereotypes,
without the layers of irony that exist at the point of creation?
Probably. As with all comedy that dares to articulate the things
that people don't for fear of sounding mean or hateful, there's
always a chance that it might be dangerously misinterpreted _ or
misused.
 &HT;    Or, as they say, What about the children? Stone, who is Jewish,
says that people do get it, especially children _ who technically
aren't supposed to be watching. (The show comes on at 10 p.m.) He
cites, for example, a child who wrote to him that when he and his
classmates reenacted the Rosa Parks story in school, they imagined
the bus driver to be Cartman, the character on the show who says
the most horrible things.
 &HT;    Point: Kids know that Cartman is not be emulated, even though
repeating Cartman's offensive lines for laughs in school the next
day has become an adolescent pastime.
 &HT;    In some ways, it's like the Howard Stern debate of a few years
back: If Howard Stern is a good guy _ not the racist, sexist
homophobe his radio character so often is _ isn't it OK for him to
pretend that he's a terrible person? Just for laughs? The
difference, Parker and Stone would argue, is that their jokes have
context, where Stern's don't.
 &HT;    ``It comes back to telling a story,'' Stone says. ``The
combination of sweetness and real emotion and this totally bizarre
post-politically correct kind of brutality. Without one, you can't
have the other. That's how you suck people in _ with character and
story and emotion. We take a totally weird idea and try to mold it
into an afterschool-special kind of story.''
 &HT;    He mentions a scene that takes place at a football game. ``We
had the announcer say, 'Oh, I haven't seen a Jew run like that
since 1938.' Just a horrible thing to say. But there's a history of
sports announcers getting busted for things like that. The other
announcer says: `Dude! You can't say that! That's not cool!' If you
did that in the wrong way it would be very offensive. But I think
it's obvious when you watch `South Park' that we're saying we know
this is a stereotype and we're messing with that. When you don't
wink at the audience you really are guilty of perpetrating
something.''
 &HT;    One reason it is hard to be offended by the Parker-Stone
sensibility is that they are so earnest.
 &HT;    ``As bizarre as it is,'' says Parker of the show, ``there's this
overlying sweetness to it all. Like: `Hey, you know what? The
world's all right.' And I think that's because Matt and I are
really very happy and optimistic. It wouldn't work if we were
really dark, coffee-drinking, leather-jacket-wearing guys. It would
just be us making all these crass remarks about the world and it
would get old.''
 &HT;    Because ``Baseketball'' is the first Parker-Stone enterprise to
hit the street since ``South Park,'' there is intense excitement
among the show's legion of fans.
 &HT;    ``I haven't laughed that hard (intentionally) during a movie
since I saw `Airplane!' for the first time,'' wrote one young
critic on the Internet who saw an early test screening in
California. ``The movie was not (expletive) P.C.!!!!!! . . . This
movie is incredibly offensive. Many will hate it and will want it
banned.''
 &HT;    Part of what appeals about Parker and Stone is their spirit of
youthful rebellion, their desire, as Stone puts it, ``to flip off
the Man.''
 &HT;    Doug Herzog, the president and CEO of Comedy Central and the
person responsible for putting the show on the air, has given this
a lot of thought.
 &HT;    ``One of my late-night theories,'' he says, ``is that Matt and
Trey grew up on MTV, David Letterman - they're cool. But they've
been programmed to be cool. What they've never really had, because
their coolness is sort of marketed to them, is something to rebel
against. They don't get it in their rock music. I think you could
probably make the argument that `South Park' is rebellious. It's
something that your parents might not understand.''
 &HT;    Parker and Stone are members of a group of enlightened young
white guys who grew up being sensitive as a matter of course. Part
of what it means to be a New Young White Guy is to be assiduously
not racist, sexist or homophobic _ which is why Parker and Stone
give themselves permission to make insensitive jokes: They know
they're kidding. What they're rebelling against is being told to be
sensitive.
 &HT;    But where Herzog sees healthy rebellion, many critics see
immaturity. And while there is an undeniable intelligence at work,
the most disturbing thing about ``South Park'' isn't so much the
show itself as the horse it rode in on, what you might call Creep
Culture.
 &HT;    ``The Howard Stern Show,'' ''Beavis and Butthead,'' ``Dumb and
Dumber'' and ``South Park'' are all populated by jerks who say mean
things and treat people badly. You get the sense that the creative
minds behind these ventures were all picked on as children and _
deep down _ learned to identify with their tormentors. Only now, as
adults, hidden behind the characters they invent, can they get back
at the bully.
 &HT;    What pushes ``South Park'' above the fray is that the characters
Parker and Stone have invented are third-grade boys _ a group for
whom such obnoxious behavior is to be expected, perhaps even
forgiven.

 By JONATHAN VAN METER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Long before ``South Park'' became the national phenomenon that
it is today, David Zucker had approached its creators _ Trey Parker
and Matt Stone _ with ``Baseketball,'' the first film he had
written in seven years.
 &HT;    Back in 1980, Zucker and his brother Jerry, outsiders in
Hollywood, had become something of a sensation with their first
movie, ``Airplane!'' _ a classic, with its memorably offensive
one-liners and ridiculous sight gags.
 &HT;    Over the years since, Zucker had grown frustrated by a climate
that seemed increasingly afraid of the outrageous, taboo-busting
humor that made ``Airplane!'' so fresh and funny. He sat out much
of the '90s before finally writing ``Baseketball,'' a goofy comedy
that aspired to be a satire about our national sports culture.
 &HT;    ``I think the best thing that happened to me,'' Zucker says,
``was to have Matt and Trey come along and say, `Well, you know,
``Baseketball'' is a great idea for a movie, but it's tame.' I just
went bananas. I was so embarrassed.''
 &HT;    ``We went to a couple of read-throughs,'' Stone says, ``and we
peppered a few lines with our humor, and it would get a big laugh.
We felt we had nothing to lose, so Trey and I started going off:
`This is a guy's movie. It's a sports parody. This is what every
guy lives through _ the whole sports, buddy, triumph-glory bull _
and we're making fun of a lot of that, and this is the way guys
talk.''
 &HT;    Zucker, who was a fan of Parker and Stone's student films and
had worked with them on a couple of shorts, had originally wanted
Parker to direct ``Baseketball,'' but he turned it down because he
was in the midst of starting work on ``South Park.''
 &HT;    One day, when Zucker and a producer were casting the film _
looking through a pile of head shots _ the producer said, ``What
about Trey Parker?'' Zucker thought it was an inspired idea, not
realizing that the producer meant the other Trey Parker _ a
modestly successful character actor. No matter. The mixup had
turned on a light: Zucker could hire Parker and Stone to play the
two buddies around whom the film turns and, for the same price,
exploit the spontaneous shenanigans that lie at the heart of the
Parker-Stone bond.
 &HT;    Because the two know each other and their idiosyncrasies so
well, Parker, 28, and Stone, 27, suggested things that no one else
could have thought of, things that predictably racheted up the
gross-and-shocking quotient. In one scene, for example, the two of
them are talking in the dugout and Parker is chewing a chaw of
tobacco. It was his idea to give it to Stone, who puts the tobacco
in his mouth and keeps right on chewing.
 &HT;    Jenny McCarthy, the former star of MTV's ``Singled Out,'' plays
a sort of young Zsa Zsa Gabor in ``Baseketball.'' No stranger to
grossness herself, McCarthy once posed for a shoe ad sitting on the
toilet reading a newspaper. ``They're kind of like any guy next
door _ just with a whole lot of talent,'' she says. ``We try to
battle each other to see who can talk the most disgusting. They're
so in line with my kind of humor, which is where I hope comedy is
going. They did a lot of improv in 'Baseketball.' It has a lot of
'South Park' touches to it.''
 &HT;    If ``Baseketball,'' which opens July 31, is a hit, it will be in
no small part because of Parker and Stone, who are in the odd,
perhaps unprecedented, position of being famous unknowns.
 &HT;    ``They come to it with the aura of their success,'' Zucker says.
``They have all that cachet because they're the authors of `South
Park.' People are already set to cheer for them. But they're
behind-the-scenes guys.''
 &HT;    Shortly before the release of `Baseketball,' I ask Stone if he's
looking forward to becoming a movie star. ``I'm totally
unprepared,'' he says. ``I hate the fact that I can't walk down the
street already without people looking at me. I went to this cheesy
bar last night and no 21-year-old Hollywood person was coming up
and going: `Heeey! Matt Stone!' I had the best time just sinking
into obscurity again, which is especially hard to do in LA.'' He
heaves a big sigh. ``We're going to Las Vegas this weekend, and I
know it's just going to be awful, walking around with everyone
yelling: `Hey! South Park! Can we get a picture?'''
 &HT;    No one could ever have guessed that ``South Park'' _ a crude,
funny, disturbing, adorable, obnoxious little cartoon on a cable
channel that millions of Americans still can't get _ would become
so huge so fast. What made the success of ``South Park'' different

</P>
<P>
   Would you like to find the greatest teacher in the world? The
one who could teach you what you most need to learn at this moment?
</P>
<P>
   You can, and it's easier than you may think. Just look around
you. Your teachers are everywhere. Your life is set up to teach you
what you need to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you recognize it or not, you possess an inner wisdom
that is capable of showing you who your teachers are and what they
have to teach you.
</P>
<P>
   To find those teachers, look at those closest to you -- your
family, your friends, your co-workers. The people you spend the
most time with can tell you much about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   How? One way is that, quite often, what we see in others is, in
some way, a reflection of something within ourselves. What we most
admire in another may be a quality we possess but have failed to
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, what we dislike most in another may also reflect
some trait within ourselves that we weren't aware was there. This
can be especially true when we have very strong feelings, positive
or negative, about someone.
</P>
<P>
   Other people can be our teachers, not necessarily because of
what they themselves know or do, but rather because of the way we
react to them. In other words, other people can serve as mirrors to
teach you about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   President James Garfield stated in an address to Williams
College alumni in New York in 1871, ``I am not willing that this
discussion should close without mention of the value of a true
teacher. Give me a log hut, with only a simple bench, Mark Hopkins
on one end and I on the other, and you may have all the buildings,
apparatus and libraries without him.'' (Mark Hopkins was president
of Williams College).
</P>
<P>
   The way people respond to us can add to our self-knowledge as
well. This doesn't mean that if we aren't popular we're ``bad,'' or
that if a lot of people like us we're necessarily ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   How people respond to us is certainly their choice; yet we can
use their reactions to learn something about ourselves. This is
especially true when we see several people responding to us in a
similar manner.
</P>
<P>
   Another way we can learn from others is simply to look at the
characteristics of the people we choose to associate with. We may
need to allow ourself to be sufficiently imaginative and
sympathetic to see through a crust of self-consciousness or fear to
the inner person. There can be goodness waiting to be released. We
may be in a position to teach as well as be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this becomes not a matter of judging anyone as good or
bad but rather recognizing there could be something within
ourselves that may be attracting us to these persons, and them to
us.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be helpful to look at those activities you spend the
greater part of your time pursuing. What do your time priorities
tell you about yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Also examine yourself in other areas: How do you spend your
leisure time? On what do you spend most of your money? What
thoughts do you most often hold in your mind? What feelings do you
experience most often?
</P>
<P>
   These things -- indeed, everything in your life around you and
within you -- can teach you a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   We may have difficulties, sometimes a crisis, and once in a
while we may have to go through some experience that seems like a
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the point to remember is that we can meet what we have to
meet and go through it if we use our will power to keep on keeping
on. Sometimes what seems to be a most difficult experience can
become one of our greatest teachers as we gain the wisdom and
understanding contained in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Socrates wrote, ``The Delphic oracle said I was the wisest of
all the Greeks. It is because that I alone, of all the Greeks, know
that I know nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, these are the words of a teachable man. The truth is,
you are teaching yourself, and as you use your life and the world
around you as your textbook and your classroom, you can become your
own greatest teacher.

 By MICHAEL SPECTER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As one of the few remaining people with frequent access to the
increasingly volcanic president of Russia, Valentin Yumashev knows
when to step lightly.
 &HT;    So it was with careful planning _ and a slightly queasy stomach
_ that the Kremlin chief of staff decided to present an important
document to Boris Yeltsin one day this spring.
 &HT;    It happened to be a thick budget plan, chock-full of graphs,
income statistics and other data that would have sent Bill Clinton,
Al Gore and the rest of the C-Span crowd into spasms of geeky
delight. But Yeltsin is not that kind of guy. He sees himself as a
man of history. Budgets bore him. So do spreadsheets, meetings and
three-point plans.
 &HT;    Yumashev knew all that, and so he wasn't terribly surprised the
next day when he saw the packet sitting, unread, in Yeltsin's
outbox. He was, however, taken aback when he found out why.
 &HT;    ``Silver paper clips,'' Yumashev later muttered to a friend in
Moscow's financial community. ``The president won't read any
document unless it is held together with a gold paper clip. I used
silver.''
 &HT;    As Russia's economy once again veers desperately toward the
precipice, you have to wonder what on earth happened to this man.
How did the father of Russian democracy become an autocrat who
refuses even to glance at essential documents unless they are
fastened together with the right color metal? The parallels to
capricious czars and senile Soviets are too obvious to ignore.
Yeltsin has dismissed more than 30 senior officials in the past
five years. Often he fires them, denounces them, hires them back
into better jobs and then fires them again (with even greater
gusto).
 &HT;    The 67-year-old president has been largely absent _ addled
repeatedly by mysterious respiratory infections _ while a small
group of predatory capitalists have done their best to plunder his
nation. Yet in March, just days before his country's economy
entered its most recent crisis, Yeltsin found time to assure an
Internet chat group that he was ``taking care'' of his thick white
hair.
 &HT;    Yeltsin has always thrived on his ability to confound his
enemies and keep his allies off balance. But lately his behavior
comes across simply as bizarre. As a result, the man who destroyed
communism in Russia, helped vanquish the Soviet Union and pushed
the century's great totalitarian monolith toward the free market
has become a joke, abroad and at home. Recently on the Russian TV
satire ``Kukly'' _ which is a cross between ``60 Minutes'' and
``Saturday Night Live'' _ he was depicted as a senile and
incontinent hospital patient, begging the nurses to give him a
second chance to remain on the ward.
 &HT;    Still, he remains a hard man to ignore. Yeltsin rules through
contradiction, confusion, subversion. As a leader, he has two great
desires, and you can watch them at war with each other nearly every
day.
 &HT;    First, he wants to bring Russia into the league of Western
nations, to be taken seriously, to be embraced by the organizations
_ NATO, the European Union, the G7 (which he alone refers to as the
Big 8) _ that were largely invented to keep his country out. So his
speeches are laden with cliches about his love of democracy and his
lack of patience for fools who don't love it too.
 &HT;    Yeltsin's second desire often cancels out the first. Clinging to
the notion of Russia as a great power, he wants somehow to rescue
his nation from its well-deserved place in the Third World and to
restore its imperial greatness. But that requires him to pander to
a different crowd completely: the many powerful nationalists at
home.
 &HT;    Like the Soviet leaders he so defiantly replaced, Yeltsin
believes in carrying a very big stick. Most world leaders are
besieged by contradictions. But as Russia flirts yet again with
social chaos and economic disaster, it is reasonable to ask some
pointed questions about the country's first freely elected
president. Is the man who led Russia away from communism now
dragging it toward the abyss? Has Yeltsin become so reckless that
he is destined to bankrupt the country he saved? Perhaps most
important of all, does he now represent any cause but his own?
 -0- 
 &HT;    I arrived in the Moscow bureau of The New York Times in 1994,
not long after Yeltsin resolved an impasse with the petulant and
reactionary Russian Parliament by pounding it for days with
machine-gun and mortar fire _ and then locking up the leaders of
the revolt and trying to close the opposition press. He then forced
through a Constitution that allocated real power almost solely to
himself.
 &HT;    I also lived in Russia while the president waged a useless war
in Chechnya that killed tens of thousands of his own citizens,
savaged a beautiful region, humiliated his once-great army and
resolved nothing. Having witnessed all that _ and then watched in
1996 as he won re-election through lies, payoffs and the sheer luck
of running against a doctrinaire Communist who was tone deaf to the
changing mood of the Russian people _ I may not be the most
objective judge of Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    To me he will always be a selfish, arrogant bully who believes
the only good advice is advice he gives. I once watched him lecture
the bosses at a metal plant in southern Russia _ in front of about
1,000 of their employees. Times were tough, so he told them to
raise wages and provide better pensions. And to do it today. His
economic advisers cowered hopelessly in the background.
 &HT;    It hardly mattered that this cheap promise _ and many others
like it _ would help drive Russia into its current financial black
hole. Nor did it matter to Yeltsin that every one of his advisers
told him that.
 &HT;    He did not always seem so arrogant. An earlier generation of
correspondents compared Yeltsin favorably with the repugnant and
brutal leaders of the Soviet Union. He was different, of course,
and better. People often stood in awe of his genuine courage. Many
will always remember Yeltsin as the man who climbed to the top of a
tank in 1991 _ truly one of the most powerful political gestures of
recent times _ to banish the Communist past with a wave of his
meaty arms.
 &HT;    My colleagues and I, however, tend to remember the man who
appeared on television one grim morning in December 1994 to
announce that his air force had stopped bombing the citizens of
Grozny for good _ the first of many times he lied openly to the
world about wanting to end the carnage. Later that day, I saw the
results when a squadron of unchallenged Su-27 bombers destroyed
Chechnya's biggest orphanage. I remember the leader who took one
quick trip to Chechnya during a 21-month war. He spent three hours
on a highly protected air base and told the dazed, starved and
defeated soldiers there that they ``had won the war'' that they
knew they had lost. Then he got on his plane and flew back to
Moscow.
 &HT;    ``Boris Yeltsin is so obsessed with being one of the Western
leaders it's pathetic,'' said Aleksandr Prokhanov, the philosopher
of the extreme anti-Western old guard. ``But you know what? He acts
like a Soviet. He always has. He knows what people want to hear,
but he couldn't care less about democracy.''
 &HT;    Americans can't accept that simple fact. We love to see Yeltsin
as the savior of a savage land. Hey, if he's a little rough around
the edges _ as a senior White House official once suggested to me _
then George Washington was too. American leaders are so invested in
believing in the good Boris that they are willing to say anything
to support him, as long as Yeltsin continues to believe in the
stock market and to refer to Clinton as ``my friend Bill.''
 &HT;    That is why Clinton could put on his most earnest expression in
1996, appear at a news conference in Moscow and say with a straight
face that the brutal slaughter in Chechnya was similar to ``a civil
war in our own country'' and that Yeltsin's merciless assault on
the Chechen people reminded him of Abraham Lincoln's efforts to
keep the United States from falling apart in the 19th century.
 &HT;    If a Soviet leader had acted with such clear aggression, any
American president would have led an international call for
sanctions. But Yeltsin is our guy. And people like Clinton are so
relieved about it that they let him get away with almost anything.
And he clearly knows that.
 &HT;    Recently Yeltsin met with Michel Camdessus, the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, which is trying to
help Russia cure itself of its fiscal ills. The IMF is seen _ with
some justification _ as a Western control agency, and nobody in
Russia gets much pleasure in remembering that their country is weak
and the West is not.
 &HT;    Yeltsin's aides and those of Camdessus dreaded what might have
come from this encounter: The rectitude of the IMF chief in direct
conflict with the raging ego of a Russian ruler who needs the
support of the West. The possibility for confrontation was
enormous.
 &HT;    As usual, Yeltsin was crafty and surprising. He started off by
admitting his sins: Russia hadn't always tightened the belt when it
should have, Yeltsin said. And he was now going to take an interest
in the details, not just the landscape. Then he grew
conspiratorial.
 &HT;    ``They even say I'm too sick to run this country,'' one of the
meeting's participants recalls a grinning Yeltsin telling an
astonished Camdessus. ``Maybe it's not such a bad idea if people
think I am too sick to do my job sometimes. Maybe it keeps people
guessing.''
 &HT;    In the end, that's what Yeltsin _ so desperate to retain power _
cares about more than anything: keeping people guessing. Like many
successful politicians, he is a human mood ring, a man whose
ideology changes with the seasons, with the country he is visiting,
with the phases of the moon.
 &HT;    Such tactics work in Russia, which has never really decided
whether it belongs in Europe or Asia. The debate has lasted for
more than 200 years _ Dostoyevsky railed against what he considered
the false pull toward the West _ and nobody milks that ambivalence
like Yeltsin. Who else could sell nuclear technology to Iran, seek
to moderate world opinion about Serbian war criminals and lecture
his own Parliament about the need for currency reforms and open
markets?
 &HT;    Yeltsin resembles no one more than Nikita Khrushchev, who also
wanted to make Russia more acceptable to the West _ and didn't mind
resorting to some earthy theatrics to get the job done.
 &HT;    In late March _ acting after a few words placed in his ear by
his daughter Tanya, who has become singularly powerful within the
cloistered walls of the Kremlin _ Yeltsin decided to dismiss his
government. He did it mostly so he could get rid of its slavishly
loyal leader, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who after five years of
dedicated service was starting to look a bit too much like a leader
to suit the first freely elected president of Russia.
 &HT;    So one morning, Yeltsin went on television and told an
astonished nation that his prime minister would have to go.
 &HT;    At first, he tried to appoint himself as acting prime minister.
When his lawyers sheepishly told him that such an action was
against the law that Yeltsin himself had created, he turned
reluctantly to an untested young reform politician who had only
spoken with the president once and who heard about his new job
while eating breakfast that morning.
 &HT;    By creating a political crisis, Yeltsin was back where he loves
to be: unquestionably and single-handedly in charge of his country.
 &HT;    ``It now seems pretty clear that the most primitive and vulgar
explanation for all that was true,'' says Tanya Malkina, a
well-known political journalist in Moscow who has followed
Yeltsin's career through nearly every one of its many tortuous
turnings. ``Boris Yeltsin cannot stand for anyone to share power or
even think about sharing power. He must have all the limelight.''
 &HT;    Even so, Yeltsin's most recent explosion with Chernomyrdin may
turn out to have made more sense than most people think. Sure,
firing Chernomydin was the work of a disloyal, selfish egomaniac.
Commentators were shocked when Yeltsin essentially offered to buy
off Parliament with better cars and apartments if they would
confirm Sergei Kiryenko, his new prime minister.
 &HT;    Yeltsin offered to ``solve the outstanding problems'' of
parliamentary officials who needed nice summer places. ``They know
what it's all about,'' Yeltsin said just before Kiriyenko was
confirmed. Do what I want, and I'll give you a nice big car and a
pretty little dacha.
 &HT;    So Yeltsin is corrupt, venal and has little regard for Robert's
Rules of Order. That's no surprise. But by getting rid of his
stolid old retainer, Yeltsin actually made the most decisive step
he has ever taken toward the road of reform.
 &HT;    Nothing got done when Chernomyrdin ran the government. He had a
magical ability to seek consensus in a Parliament whose most famous
members have been known to pull one another's hair or fling orange
juice in one another's faces during debate. He made the Communists
feel comfortable, and he made the reformers feel as if he was at
least on their side. The result was an endless stalemate.
 &HT;    For all its boorishness, then, Yeltsin's decision was ultimately
good for his country. And yet is that why he fired Chernomyrdin? Or
was it because _ as Kremlin insiders whispered _ he was upset as he
watched him at a meeting with Vice President Gore?
 &HT;    ``He looked like he was enjoying it,'' says one former Yeltsin
aide about Chernomyrdin's brief moment in the sun. ``And that was
really the end of him.''
 &HT;    There is supposed to be an election in the year 2000 _ an
election without Boris Yeltsin. It will be the president's ultimate
test. If he manufactures some reason to run again (nobody else is
ready; he alone can lead Russia through these troubling times), he
will have thrown away his last weak claim to greatness. He will
become the man who took Russia from communism to autocracy.
 &HT;    If Yeltsin becomes the first Russian leader to walk away from
the Kremlin without a push or a gun at his head, it will say a lot
about what kind of country he wants to see emerge in the 21st
century.
 &HT;    A few months ago, he announced that he would not run for a third
term. But he has said that before only to dance back into the ring.
Don't hold your breath this time either. Giving up power has never
been one of Yeltsin's strong suits.
 &HT;    He appointed Kiriyenko because he wants to rule unchallenged and
because he wants to move Russia toward markets and the West. After
all, if he doesn't succeed, how will history remember him?
 &HT;    Getting rid of communism is not a bad line on a resume. Turning
your country over to a bunch of greedy thugs, however, is.
 &HT;     -0- 
 &HT;    I never hung out with Yeltsin. By the time I got to Moscow,
Western reporters had gone from being good props in his campaign
for exposure to political poison. But I once watched him bound out
of his black Zil and wade into an angry Moscow crowd.
 &HT;    ``Boris Nikolayevich, we live worse than we did under
Brezhnev!'' they screamed. It was the most savage possible insult.
 &HT;    ``It's a Western plot,'' an old woman screamed. ``They are
driving us to ruin.''
 &HT;    Yeltsin took it all in. His eyes said, I feel your pain. Then he
responded with a quick, vulgar joke. I must admit I hardly caught a
word he said _ and no one would repeat it. But when I sidled up to
the old lady who attacked him and asked what she thought of the
president now, she broke into a smile as big as Siberia.
 &HT;    ``He's a muzhik,'' she said, using a term that describes a tough
peasant, a man of the people. ``I don't think you have those where
you're from.''

 By GERALDINE BROOKS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some sons bond with their fathers through baseball, some through
fishing. But for Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert, there has
only ever been the Business.
 &HT;    As a child in London, Lachlan remembers his mother waking him
for pre-dawn breakfasts before his father jetted off. As a
schoolboy in Manhattan, he recalls nights up late, listening to his
father at the dinner table hashing out strategies with famous
guests.
 &HT;    In 1990, when he was 19 years old, and a student at Princeton,
his father summoned him to London to stand at his side as scores of
lawyers haggled over the merger that created British Sky
Broadcasting.
 &HT;    Walking home afterward at 1 a.m. on a deserted Fleet Street,
Lachlan wondered why his father seemed so stressed and dispirited.
He didn't know that The News Corporation Ltd. _ the global giant
Rupert created out of an Australian newspaper _ had nearly
disintegrated under a crushing debt load.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to put my arms around him and hold him up,'' says
Lachlan Murdoch, running a long-fingered hand through gel-spiked
hair. In the weeks that followed, News Corp. successfully rolled
over its loans and went on growing, and Lachlan never again spoke
to his father of that moment.
 &HT;    ``We are a family that doesn't look back, always ahead,'' he
says, forming the long hands into an arrow-shaped probe and almost
lunging off the sofa of his Sydney office.
 &HT;    Ahead, for him, may be the job of running his father's empire _
if the decisions he makes as chief of News Ltd., the company's
Australian arm, are the right ones. A year ago Rupert Murdoch, 67,
called his children together in New York to put an end to the
speculation over who would succeed him. He said Lachlan, 26, the
third of his four children and his eldest son, would be the one to
eventually run a business that includes the 20th Century Fox film
studio, HarperCollins Publishers, The Times of London, the Los
Angeles Dodgers and Star TV, Asia's leading satellite broadcaster.
 &HT;    Public companies with revenues of $13 billion don't usually
operate like feudal fiefs, but the Murdochs, by keeping more than
30 percent of News Corp. stock under tight family control, have
tried to ensure that theirs can. Neither the recent, sudden
separation of Rupert and his wife Anna, after 31 years of marriage,
nor an upcoming public offering in News Corp.'s film, TV and sports
stock is likely to affect the succession.
 &HT;    For now, Lachlan runs the company's Australian outpost from a
drab office building at the shabby edge of Sydney's garment
district. When he enters the windowless conference room for a
meeting on a new printing plant, he is the youngest person at the
table by about two decades. The new plant gives the company a
long-awaited chance to break the grip of the printers' union. The
assembled executives, crusty newspapermen with years of labor
battles behind them, are gleeful at the prospect of a final
showdown.
 &HT;    But Lachlan is wary. Like his father, he is no fan of unions.
But unlike his father, who waged legendary wars with British
printers, he recoils from confrontation.
 &HT;    ``Roll up our sleeves and crash through _ that was the way we
used to do it,'' he tells the executives. ``But now we're talking
about a change of culture for both sides. You've got to convince
them they don't need the protection of the union. And the only way
you can convince them is if it's true. I don't want any more bully
boys and gorillas on the gates.''
 &HT;    When Rupert Murdoch stalked these Sydney headquarters back in
the 1960s, rolled-up shirt-sleeves were his trademark. He was just
21 when he inherited his father's Adelaide newspaper; employees
called him the Boy Publisher.
 &HT;    When the new Boy Publisher arrived in 1995 after a brief stint
running the company's Queensland newspapers, he too wore his
sleeves pushed up. But his rolled sleeves expose a serpentine
tattoo _ a chic circlet of blue-black swirls encompassing a
muscular forearm.
 &HT;    One Sydney executive remembers an early public unveiling of the
tattoo, at a corporate dinner just after Lachlan took over. ``It
was black-tie, average age of guests around 50, and Lachlan took
off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves. I thought it was quite
odd _ a young thing to do, as if he was with a bunch of 20-year-old
blokes at the pub.''
 &HT;    The executive, whose company is aligned with News Ltd., has
since had a chance to observe Lachlan closely. ``His business
instincts are terrifically honed. Here's this person who looks like
the copy boy _ when you first walk into a room you wouldn't pick
him as dominant. But within three minutes you're in no doubt who's
the boss.''
 &HT;    That dominance was too much for some of the company's most
senior managers. ``The first thing Lachlan did was knock the empire
down around him,'' says the executive, who watched with alarm as
the body count mounted.
 &HT;    The chairman, a lifelong Murdoch loyalist, unexpectedly took
early retirement. The chief operating officer defected to News'
Australian rival, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. Marketing executives,
the corporate spokeswoman and a number of senior editors also
either jumped or were pushed overboard.
 &HT;    ``It's hard when proprietors' sons turn up, clomping around in
size 11 shoes and breaking all the porcelain,'' one former
executive says.
 &HT;    But unlike his father, Lachlan has a light touch. ``He chatted
about football for 20 minutes before he got around to telling me
I'd been replaced _ I probably finished the sentence for him,''
says Malcolm Schmidtke, former editor of The Australian, the only
general-interest national daily. Now an editor at Fairfax,
Schmidtke, 49, praises Lachlan's conduct in editorial meetings and
thinks he's unlikely to play politics with the papers the way his
father has.
 &HT;    The 49-year-old Schmidtke says Lachlan's youth, underlined by
stylistic flourishes such as shaving his head, created tension
among some older staffers. ``Your first reaction is to say, `Why is
this very young man intruding on my space?'''
 &HT;    Schmidtke let that attitude show in a disagreement over
Lachlan's desire to hire copy editors from England. ``He said the
ones here were no good,'' Schmidtke recalls. ``I told him I'd been
in this business more than 26 years, that I'd seen that idea tried
before, and that the Brits had turned out to be no better than the
locals. He got very angry with me.''
 &HT;    He thinks Lachlan probably would have accepted a contrary point
of view more easily from a younger person.
 &HT;    Lachlan has only tactful praise for the departed executives. But
he says the younger people now filling those positions are more
willing to experiment and try new things. One, Peter Macourt, the
chief financial officer, worked with Rupert Murdoch as part of the
company's debt-restructuring team. ``You can sit with Lachlan for
hours in meetings and think, well, he's nothing like his father.
Completely different style, manner. And then suddenly he'll say or
do something and, my God, it could be Rupert.''
 &HT;    In social settings, Lachlan has a graceful manner that friends
say he inherits from his mother. Lachlan is famous for paying
attention to the least prominent person in the room, sitting with
employees' spouses and making polite chat about their children.
 &HT;    ``He has the lovely manners that Australian men don't have _ you
think of him as the young prince,'' says Caroline Morgan, whose
husband, Ian Frykberg, is more familiar with the prince's
Machiavellian side.
 &HT;    Frykberg quit News Corp. in London after a conflict over the
tabloidization of TV news. Lachlan rehired him to stanch losses
from the company's move into Super League, a rival to the more
established Australian Rugby League. ``The first time he
demonstrates his toughness it's a surprise to most people,''
Frykberg says. ``But he only has to do it once.''
 &HT;    Lachlan is fond of the family networking that can make News
Corp. seem like a mom-and-pop business. ``We're a private family.
We don't talk about our personal affairs,'' Lachlan says. ``But we
can talk about business forever.''
 &HT;    After one weekend of whirlwind work and travel, it was 2 a.m.
before he reached his father. In between, he called his other
consigliere, his sister, Elisabeth, 29, the general manager of the
company's satellite-broadcast business in Britain. His younger
brother, James, 25, recently appointed deputy publisher of The New
York Post, is a further sounding board.
 &HT;    James also remembers the early breakfasts with their father:
``Pop had precious little time to spend with us, so the breakfasts
were crucial. Of course,'' he adds, ``when we'd get to breakfast,
everybody would read the papers. There's still this incredible
jockeying for the papers whenever we get together.''
 &HT;    James dismisses talk of tension in the family over Lachlan's
ascendance, adding that none of them see the succession as a done
deal. (Elisabeth Murdoch didn't respond to a request for comment.)
``Pop's going to be around a long time and we're all very young,''
he says. ``News Corp. is a big public company with big shareholders
who'll ultimately decide.''
 &HT;    In recent months, as News Corp.'s stock has lagged behind that
of rivals such as Time-Warner and Disney, some of those
shareholders have become impatient, and have expressed unease at
the young man's ascension. The stock offering, in which News Corp.
will offer investors a chance to buy into the company's attractive
assets, such as Fox Television and 20th Century Fox, while avoiding
money-losers such as Star TV and HarperCollins, has eased some of
the pressure. Lachlan acknowledges that he will have to earn the
confidence of investors, and agrees that his father's decision is
``always open for review.''
 &HT;    In Sydney, Lachlan lives alone in the bohemian harborside
neighborhood of Elizabeth Bay, where the tiny old apartments of
artists and writers rub up against gracious mansions. His
multimillion-dollar house is shaded by palms, its veranda looking
down on his swimming pool and the glistening harbor beyond. In his
spacious garage, he has built a Fiberglas climbing structure over
the walls so that he can stay in shape for one of his favorite
pastimes, rock climbing.
 &HT;    At any public gathering in Sydney, you can always find Lachlan
Murdoch by following the flashes of photographers. His youth, good
looks and extreme eligibility make him paparazzi fodder, as does
his propensity for adding tattoos and subtracting hair.
 &HT;    ``He is media grist,'' says the director Baz Luhrmann, who
became a close friend after making ``William Shakespeare's Romeo &AMP;
Juliet'' for Fox. ``He's in the press every day, like JFK Jr.'' His
dates also tend to be exceptionally photogenic. The latest, the
Wonderbra model Sarah O'Hare, was his escort at the Oscars _ a big
night for News Corp., given the triumph of Fox's ``Titanic,'' in
which Fox had a major stake. But O'Hare is based in New York, and
when Lachlan is at home his one constant companion is Grace, his
Rhodesian ridgeback.
 &HT;    Australia wasn't an obvious choice for Lachlan. Born in London,
educated at Trinity School in Manhattan, Aspen Country Day School
and Princeton, he had been to Australia only on vacations, taking
summer jobs cleaning presses in Sydney or mustering sheep on the
company's spread in outback New South Wales.
 &HT;    ``Australia is the home of this company,'' he says. ``Not only
is all my family Australian,'' (news, perhaps, to Washington, which
made citizens of his father in 1985, his mother in 1989 and Lachlan
in 1993) ``but so are many of the executives in the company. It's
understood that there's a sort of egalitarian Australian culture
we've managed to keep.''
 &HT;    Lachlan is well advised to stress this Aussie-ness: News Corp.,
which dominates the Australian newspaper market, doesn't want to be
perceived as an alien force. The strategy, writes a Sydney media
critic, David Bowman, is to establish Lachlan ``as a sort of
honorary Australian.''
 &HT;    Lachlan, says his friend Luhrmann, finds this argument
disturbing. ``The idea that he's not dealt with as part of
Australian culture is upsetting to him. He chose where he wanted to
be, and he chose Australia.''
 &HT;    Every time he refers to his father, it is simply as ``my dad.''
He ends their frequent phone calls with ``Love you, Dad,'' no
matter who is in the room.
 &HT;    When I ask him what it is like to love someone who is so widely
hated, he leans forward on the sofa and clenches his rock-climber's
hands into tight fists.
 &HT;    ``When you know someone, when you know the truth about them _
what's good and right and true vs. what's misrepresented _ you
quickly learn to ignore it or shut it out. What the criticism in
Britain is about is an upper-class elite being scared of the
masses. In our papers they see a reflection of society that's not
Oxford or Cambridge and they don't like it. There's a fear of
democracy. My dad's Australian and that's where they sent everyone
they didn't want.''
 &HT;    Unlike most of his Princeton peers, Lachlan read three
newspapers a day in college: The Wall Street Journal (``a great
brand for its readership''), The New York Times (``a chore'') and
his father's New York Post (``a great sense of the energy of New
York'').
 &HT;    He has a simple explanation for the low numbers of young
newspaper readers in the United States: ``I don't think papers in
the United States are very good.'' He prefers the British press,
where he worked as a copy editor on the racy and often reckless
tabloid, The Sun.
 &HT;    Lachlan describes his political leanings as ``economically
conservative but libertarian on people's individual rights.'' Asked
for an illustration of his libertarianism, he talks about
cigarettes.
 &HT;    ``I don't smoke,'' he says. ``But I think taxes on cigarettes
are the most outrageous example of the Nanny State. It would be one
thing if every penny went to researching lung cancer, but in fact
it's greedy politicians using the money to pork-barrel roads or put
into the welfare state. People who want to smoke shouldn't be
burdened because of the political correctness of our times.''
 &HT;    Lachlan wasn't in charge of News Ltd. during Australia's last
round of Parliamentary elections. The next, expected later this
year, is likely to be one of the most divisive in history, with
racial issues such as Aboriginal land rights at the forefront.
 &HT;    While the temptation to meddle will be strong _ a friendly
government could do a lot for News Ltd. _ Lachlan insists it will
be up to his editors to report the election as they see it. In
fact, he adds, two of his papers are already at odds on Aboriginal
legislation. ``It's flattering to say I have a lot of power. But
the reality is, I don't.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the evening of Feb. 20, 1998, less than a week after the
much-heralded publication of her first novel in more than 20 years,
Gayl Jones, 48, was handcuffed and removed from her Lexington, Ky.,
home by the local police.
 &HT;    Inside the two-bedroom bungalow, her husband lay bleeding from a
self-inflicted knife wound.
 &HT;    The confrontation began just after 6 p.m., when police officers
knocked on the door at 440 Locust Ave., to serve a 15-year-old
warrant for the arrest of Bob Higgins, also known as Bob Jones. The
man opened the door a crack, but after a brief exchange with the
cops, he slammed it shut, ran to the rear of the house and
reappeared, holding two knives to his throat.
 &HT;    ``Don't come in,'' he screamed. ``I'll kill myself if you come
in here.''
 &HT;    At 8:45, the SWAT team arrived. The couple had barricaded
themselves inside, and Jones was calling 911. She insisted that she
too would kill herself if the police stormed the house, and then
she announced that they had turned on the gas.
 &HT;    Whether the couple intended to asphyxiate themselves or blow up
the neighborhood, SWAT members couldn't be sure. Having evacuated
surrounding residents to the end of the block, they decided to go
in. Two members of the five-man rapid-entry team managed to throw
themselves across Jones, who was on the couch less than 10 feet
from the door.
 &HT;    But the two assigned to Higgins did not get to him in time. He
thrust one of the knives into his throat with such force that it
lodged in his spine. A geyser of blood sprayed across the room.
 &HT;    Over the next month the outpouring of news articles predictably
focused on the brilliant black writer whose comeback had been
blasted by her husband's death _ and the hideous irony that it was
a flattering full-page article about Jones and her new novel, ``The
Healing,'' in Newsweek that had led the police to discover Higgins'
fugitive status.
 &HT;    Yet beyond the explanation that Jones was simply another victim
of an abusive, controlling husband was a more complex reality, and
the violence surrounding the couple was in fact the culmination of
the legacies that had wedded Gayl and Bob to each other.
 &HT;    If the question was why a woman as smart as Jones could be swept
away by a man like Higgins, then the answer lay not only in her own
lifetime but also in her collective past, in the blood of
generations that coursed through her writing. It was not just life
imitating art; it was that Jones and Higgins were united in the
conviction that a racist society had doomed them to repeat the
violent history of their forebears.
 &HT;    As she wrote in ``Wild Figs and Secret Places,'' a 1983 poem,
``Memory is a mosquito/pregnant again/and out for blood.''
 &HT;    Born Nov. 23, 1949, to Franklin and Lucille Jones, Gayl grew up
in a cramped, dilapidated house with no indoor toilet in Speigle
Heights, one of Lexington's more turbulent black neighborhoods. Her
father worked late hours as a restaurant cook, while her mother, an
aspiring writer, stayed home with Gayl and her younger brother,
Franklin Jr.
 &HT;    Most weekends Lucille took the children to visit her mother, who
lived on a small farm outside town. There the grandmother and
mother shared old family tales in the oral tradition of rural
blacks throughout Kentucky.
 &HT;    In the mid-'60s, the Jones children would have attended the
black high school, but Lucille made sure that Gayl and her brother
were among the handful of African-Americans enrolling at Henry
Clay, the white school known for its academic excellence. Painfully
shy to the point of muteness, Gayl seemed almost invisible to other
students, although several teachers took note of her.
 &HT;    Her Spanish teacher, Anna Dodd, who usually kept her distance
from students, often lent Gayl books and talked to her about her
adventures among the Paris expatriates in the '20s and '30s. Just
as she soaked up her grandmother's and mother's reminiscences, Gayl
absorbed Dodd's.
 &HT;    ``I want to write like Henry James,'' she told Sue Ann Allen,
her junior-year English teacher, and the final story she turned in
was, indeed, written in a Jamesian style.
 &HT;    But when she went to Connecticut College on a scholarship
arranged with the assistance of Dodd's friend Elizabeth Hardwick,
the writer and a Lexington native, Jones discovered a literary
legacy that was more her own.
 &HT;    The disparity between her background and that of white
classmates had been painfully evident in segregated Lexington.
 &HT;    ``She grew up in a town with two statues of Confederate generals
on the courthouse lawn,'' says Don Edwards, a veteran columnist at
The Lexington Herald-Leader who can trace his family to slave
owners. ``And then to go from that to the North, Gayl must have
felt like an astronaut shot into space.''
 &HT;    Connecticut College, then a small, elite women's school, was
another world entirely. Jones landed there during the turbulent
'60s, but while other African-American students were demonstrating
for more minority admissions and an all-black dormitory, she
remained on the periphery, quiet and withdrawn. At the same time,
she became engrossed in African-American literature and studied
with Robert Hayden, the esteemed black poet and literary historian
then visiting from the University of Michigan.
 &HT;    Her reading seemed as much a way of defining herself as protests
were for others, and when she returned home from college the summer
after her freshman year she told her former English teacher of a
new project. ``She said she was starting a `generational novel'
based on her family history,'' Sue Ann Allen says.
 &HT;    Graduating with a stellar record, Jones was accepted in 1971 to
Brown University's graduate writing program. By the end of four
years she had all but completed the manuscripts for two novels,
several collections of short stories and poetry and a play. And she
had been listening to the blues, which now became an affirmation of
her heritage as a black woman.
 &HT;    At Brown, Jones attracted another mentor: Prof. Michael S.
Harper, a prominent African-American poet and critic. Harper had
long been influenced by jazz and the blues and thus had a unique
appreciation of what Jones was attempting in her writing.
 &HT;    When Harper brought Jones' work to the attention of Toni
Morrison, then an editor at Random House, she signed Jones to a
book contract. With the publication of her first novel in mid-1975,
Jones was heralded as a significant, major new author.
 &HT;    In 1975, Jones became a visiting lecturer in English at the
University of Michigan and a year later was hired as an assistant
professor. Jones was the only African-American woman among the
department's 70 or so faculty members (two black female
predecessors had not been tenured), and Hayden, the
African-American poet whom she had met at Connecticut College, was
near retirement.
 &HT;    With her isolation and watchful alienation, she was, apparently,
altogether ripe for the picking by the time Bob Higgins, an
attractive, well-dressed African-American, happened into her life.
She was first seen around campus with him in the late '70s, about
the time of the publication of ``White Rat,'' which had followed
hard on the heels of her second novel, ``Eva's Man.''
 &HT;    Born in Cleveland in 1947, Higgins brought his own legacy of
racism and family suffering to the relationship. Having been
abandoned at a young age by his mother (who eventually died
homeless, a fatality of mental illness and alcoholism), he was
reared by relatives in Detroit as well as by several foster
families, including that of George Breitman, a leading Socialist
and a supporter of black nationalism.
 &HT;    Although he later earned a degree at the University of Michigan,
Higgins hung out in Detroit at Wayne State University, which in the
mid-'60s and early '70s was a hotbed of black activism, even more
so than Berkeley. He routinely proclaimed his own brilliance,
calling himself ``a true Hegelian'' and ``a math genius'' who
should be on the university's faculty. He was also writing a column
for Wayne State's student paper under the byline ``A. Violence.''
 &HT;    Higgins had already been married and divorced when, around 1970,
he began a relationship with Carolyn Ramsey that was a blueprint
for what happened with Jones. ``As a young black woman, I was
totally smitten,'' Ramsey says. ``I felt that he was misunderstood
by everybody but me.''
 &HT;    When his treatise on Hegel was turned down by publishers and
received an unfavorable reading from Breitman, Higgins, then living
on Staten Island, went bananas and sparked a police standoff at his
apartment. When the cops lobbed tear gas inside, Higgins took a
suicidal leap out the window, landing on the frozen ground six
floors below.
 &HT;    Miraculously, he survived and though he was to be sent to
Ypsilanti, Mich., for psychiatric treatment, his case fell through
the cracks, and in 1975 he showed up in Ann Arbor instead. There,
he announced to old acquaintances that his survival was evidence of
his ``godliness,'' even proof that he was the new Messiah.
 &HT;    Many who knew the couple were perplexed by Jones' infatuation
with a man who, by the early '80s, was no longer a Marxist and
black nationalist but was cloaking himself in capitalist dreams and
messianic religiosity. In addition to dressing in silk suits and
driving expensive cars, Higgins opened two Ann Arbor investment
businesses and took over as Jones' agent, which instigated the
withdrawal of Morrison as Jones' editor.
 &HT;    Still, Jones continued to progress in both her academic and
literary careers, and she was rewarded with tenure in 1982. She had
earlier contacted Naomi Long Madgett, a poet and the publisher and
editor of Lotus Press, the small Detroit house known for publishing
African-American poets.
 &HT;    Madgett eventually accepted three of Jones' collections, the
first of which was ``Song for Anninho,'' a rendering in verse of
the plot of her unpublished novel ``Palmares,'' in which two
enslaved lovers escape to northeastern Brazil. Jones' only requests
were that no author's photograph appear on the book cover and that
she not do readings to help sales.
 &HT;    The two communicated by letter or phone except for one brief
meeting in 1980. But after the publication of ``Song for Anninho''
in 1981 and ``The Hermit-Woman'' in 1983, the editor heard almost
nothing from Jones for about two years after the couple abruptly
fled Ann Arbor.
 &HT;    The precipitating event was a gay-rights parade at which Higgins
railed that he was God and that AIDS was a form of divine
punishment. One of the marchers, a woman, had punched him, and the
police refused to file an assault complaint; he returned to the
march with a shotgun and was arrested for felonious assault, a
charge that carried a potential sentence of four years in jail.
 &HT;    Neither Jones nor Higgins appeared in the courtroom to answer
the charges. Two days earlier, Jones had resigned from the
university and given vent to her long-seething rage: ``I reject
your lying racist (expletive), and I call upon God. Do what you
want. God is with Bob and I'm with him.''
 &HT;    Higgins was found guilty in absentia, and a bench warrant was
issued for his arrest.
 &HT;    Although in 1992 Jones emerged for a rare and successful public
reading and discussion of her work at the University of Kentucky,
for the most part the couple remained hidden from the world.
Higgins, in his escalating megalomania, was creating Web sites to
spread a new spiritualism, and by late 1996 Jones had completed
``The Healing'' and was almost finished with a draft of
``Mosquito.''
 &HT;    Professional as ever, in early 1997 she contacted Beacon Press
about reclaiming the paperback rights to ``Corregidora'' and
``Eva's Man,'' which the small Boston-based publisher bought from
Random House in the mid-'80s. To Helene Atwan, Beacon's director,
the novels were backlist gems, and she offered an additional
advance to keep them.
 &HT;    At first Jones refused, explaining that she didn't want those
books to be her only novels in print, presumably because of their
portrayal of black men as violent and abusive, a subject of heated
literary debate then. When Atwan asked if Beacon could publish her
latest writing, Jones seemed less adamant and soon gave Atwan
instructions for downloading the manuscripts of ``The Healing'' and
``Mosquito'' from a Web site.
 &HT;    The contract negotiations by e-mail went smoothly, although
Atwan sometimes suspected that it was Jones' agent, identified by
one of Higgins' many aliases, who was corresponding under Jones'
name.
 &HT;    At the same time, Higgins was taking ever greater risks for a
man dodging a felony warrant. Even though he had been going by the
name Bob Jones, clues to his identity were everywhere in his
cyberspace publishing. With the diagnosis of his mother-in-law
Lucille's throat cancer, he became even more convinced of his
omnipotence. He not only took control of her medical treatment but
used it as the occasion for a full-bore assault on the white
establishment.
 &HT;    During January and February 1997, Jones accompanied her mother
to radiation treatments at the Markey Cancer Center at the
University of Kentucky. On Monday, Feb. 24, 1997, with Lucille's
weight at 68 pounds, the attending physician hospitalized her and
recommended inserting a stomach feeding tube. Higgins objected to
the procedure, and because Lucille seemed so confused, the hospital
ordered a psychiatric evaluation and concluded that she was
``unduly and inappropriately manipulated by family _ especially
son-in-law.''
 &HT;    Banned from visiting, Jones and Higgins were ordered to leave;
when they refused, hospital security was called, and with Higgins'
further resistance, the campus police arrived and charged him with
disorderly conduct.
 &HT;    Higgins and Jones then e-mailed a document entitled
``Kidnapped/Held Incommunicado'' to the national press, and on
Monday morning, March 3, 1997, copies were faxed to the university
and federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies as well as to
President Clinton, the first lady and Vice President Gore.
 &HT;    The next day, Lucille indicated that she wanted to go home, and
again her doctors advised against it. Instead she was transferred
to Central Baptist Hospital, where Higgins and Jones agreed to the
surgery. Sent home on March 13, Lucille developed respiratory
problems and died on March 20.
 &HT;    Higgins' campaign against the medical center then went into high
gear. Jones had been keeping a low profile, but now her name
appeared on a 10-page communique on the Internet listing 50
``changes'' in Lucille after ``one week of U.K. kidnapping.'' The
document described the closeness between the mother and daughter _
undoubtedly Jones' sentiments _ yet the rambling prose was
obviously not hers.
 &HT;    Higgins' onslaught continued with more faxes, phone calls and
mailings to the university. Even Lexington's police chief, Larry
Walsh, had been receiving four or five calls a day, and by early
summer he noticed an increasingly menacing tone.
 &HT;    The police were especially concerned by his Feb. 20, 1998,
letter to the University of Kentucky's president, Charles T.
Wethington Jr.: a reference to ``checking out all the pipes and
fixtures in your system'' implied a bomb threat. Finally figuring
out after the Newsweek article that Bob Jones was Bob Higgins, the
cops had a legal basis for bringing him in.
 &HT;    With the SWAT team surrounding the house and Higgins threatening
to kill himself, Jones called 911. On the tape, she speaks quickly,
with uncharacteristic volume, her voice surprisingly firm.
 &HT;    Gayl Jones: My name is Gayl Jones and I am an author. ... You
killed my mother, Lucille Jones, and now you are trying to kill my
husband.. . .
 &HT;    Police: Ma'am, just try and relax, OK?
 &HT;    Finally, when the police took Jones out of the house, she was
barefoot and wearing sweatpants. Led to the next-door neighbor's
porch, she stood staring at the floor, whispering to herself.
 &HT;    At her side, Sgt. Joan Root asked, ``Who are you talking to?''
 &HT;    ``I'm talking to the spirit of my mother,'' Jones replied, her
eyes vacant and unfocused.
 &HT;    When the paramedics carried Higgins to the ambulance, the knife
still protruding from his neck, Jones lifted her eyes and watched.
She made no move to go to him but asked the policewoman where he
was being taken. When told the University of Kentucky Hospital, she
shook her head, moaning: ``Oh, no. They're going to kill him too.
That's what this is all about. Oh, no, no, no. Don't take him to
U.K.''
 &HT;    In fact, there was nothing that could be done to save him, and
he was pronounced dead later that evening. Jones was committed to
the state mental hospital for 72 hours of observation. Her
confinement was then extended until March 9, when it was deemed
that she was no longer a danger to herself.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Higgins was buried with only four people
present: two reporters, Jones' cousin Cynthia Gentry, and another
woman. Jones sent a eulogy.
 &HT;    Since her release, Jones, who refused several requests to be
interviewed for this article, has spoken only to family members, a
lawyer and Michael Harper, her mentor from Brown, who has managed
to stay her friend despite Higgins' attempt to cut off her ties to
him. Alone in the house, she has remained behind drawn blinds; it
is only at night that neighbors can see her vague form illuminated
by a flickering TV.

`BASEKETBALL': ATTENTION, SPORTS FANS _ THESE DUDES GOT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, through sheer overkill, ``BASEketball,'' will
put an end to the use of the word ``dude'' as an all-purpose comic
term of endearment shouted in each other's faces by hormonally
rampant, eternally adolescent movie pals.
</P>
<P>
   Should it do so, the flourishing genre of acne-challenged,
gonad-driven buddy comedy that came into its own with ``Wayne's
World'' could find itself facing a major identity crisis. What,
after all, could possibly replace ``dude?'' ``Darling?''
</P>
<P>
   This funny, gleefully offensive spoof of professional sports,
written and directed by David Zucker, does suggest a novel
alternative to the question of how overgrown teen-age sidekicks in
a gross-out comedy might better express their affection. Why not
have them actually kiss?
</P>
<P>
   After going through their ups and downs together, Coop (Trey
Parker) and Remer (Matt Stone), the inventors of a driveway game
called BASEketball that becomes a national obsession, kiss and make
up in what may be the slurpiest, most tongue-twisting, but least
erotic osculatory collision to be found in a recent movie. Imagine
two dogs licking each other's faces, and you'll get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The game that Coop and Remer improvise one evening is an
elementary basket-shooting contest in which successful shots landed
from varying distances become the equivalents of singles, doubles,
triples and home runs. The game's primary defense strategy is ``the
psyche out,'' in which you try to shock your opponent into
confusion as he's about to make a shot.
</P>
<P>
   One effective ploy is to pull down your shirt and squirt milk
into his face from concealed bulbs. Or you might suddenly appear in
a tee-shirt on which you've printed a doctored picture of yourself
having sex with his girlfriend. In short, anything goes, the
nastier, smuttier and more humiliating the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``BASEketball'' is essentially two movies stuck together like
chewing gum on a subway platform. One is a dumber-than-dumb teen
comedy crammed with farcical sight-gags and raunchy adolescent
humor, the other a no-holds-barred satire of professional sports,
and the greed, egotism and pomposity surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with a narrator delivering a grandiose
futuristic mini-history of the decline of professional sports
through over-commercialization. By the time the Preparation H Arena
was constructed, we learn, the audience for professional sports had
seriously shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   Enter BASEketball, a new populist sport that anyone can play and
whose by-laws forbid corporate sponsorship, commercial endorsements
and the trading of players. Its teams tend to have down-to-earth
names like the Milwaukee Beers (Coop and Remer's team), the Dallas
Felons and the Los Angeles Riots. Instead of letter-sweaters and
pompoms, The Beers' cheerleaders favor black leather-trimmed
lingerie accessorized with riding crops.
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball's purity is threatened when a sleazy sports
entrepreneur named Cain (Robert Vaughn) hatches an evil scheme to
take control of the sport and make millions. His plan involves
exploiting a charity called the Dream Come True Foundation, which
helps terminally ill children (its president insists on calling
them ``health challenged'' and ``survival impaired'') by gratifying
their dying wishes.
</P>
<P>
   One ailing 8-year-old youth named Joey (Trevor Einhorn), who is
about to have a liver operation, gets to spend a day hanging out
with the Milwaukee Beers. The little tyke eagerly participates in a
drinking contest at a bar showing the Jerry Springer Show. Every
fight that breaks out on the program requires the downing of
another round, and by the time little Joey is wheeled into the
operating room, he is beyond sozzled.
</P>
<P>
   As in his ``Naked Gun'' series, Zucker's comic strategy is to a
fire off a continuous machine-gun volley of jokes of all shapes and
sizes trusting that enough will hit home to keep an audience on the
edge of a giggle. Occasionally, as in a hospital sequence in which
Coop and Remer don surgical gowns and nearly destroy a ward in a
frenzied attempt to save a child's life, the movie tries for a more
sustained slapstick tone.
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball is at its looniest when it is content to be a
scattershot blitz of gags, jokes and insults puncturing the
pretensions of sports stars, sportscasters and fans alike. What are
professional sports anyway but pumped-up ritualized macho fantasies
of eternal youth and physical conquest invested with a
quasi-mystical import?
</P>
<P>
   With its goofy salaciousness and short attention span,
BASEketball illustrates an amusing parallel vision of athletics in
contrast to the one shown on television. Stripped of pomp and
ceremony, it all comes down to a bunch of ``dudes'' scrapping it
out in a driveway.
</P>
<P>

OUTDOOR DANCE IN ITS ADULTHOOD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young girl dressed in a scalloped tunic and
kerchief jumps awkwardly on a makeshift outdoor stage beneath the
Queensboro Bridge in the late 1960s. Seven shambling young
avant-gardists spread the 1970s gospel of fashionably untutored and
untheatrical dance performance on a city sidewalk. Ballroom dancers
spin and fly through countless nights in the parks of New York City
in the 1940s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Charming photographs from ``Stepping Out: A Century of Dance in
New York City Parks,'' an exhibition at the Central Park Arsenal
Building, suggest that outdoor dance performances have long been
with us. But those performances have changed a great deal, to judge
by the attractions offered by festivals this summer in the city and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor dance programs have grown more sophisticated and more
varied over the years. The major New York performing arts festivals
_ Lincoln Center Out of Doors, Celebrate Brooklyn and Central Park
Summerstage _ began with programming to draw specific ethnic groups
and provide a forum for local performers.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn festival, which began two decades ago with nine
performances, has more than 40 this year, ranging from works by
what Jack Walsh, the festival's director, called the dance icon
Twyla Tharp to pieces by relatively new choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Its setting, the Prospect Park Band Shell, is midway through a
$3.4 million upgrading that will improve sightlines and seating and
provide better lighting of the complex sort required for dance
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Successful outdoor programs made their mark on New York dance
history. Modern dance and ballet, a rarity outdoors, could be seen
regularly at Lewisohn Stadium, now the site of City College's Aaron
Davis Hall in Harlem, from the late 1920s through the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   The much-lamented Delacorte Dance Festival in Central Park
presented an astonishing variety of dance from the early 60s into
the 70s. But it is only in the last decade that the idea of outdoor
festivals, once dismissed as second-rate, suspiciously popular
entertainment, has caught on in a big way with donors, audiences,
reviewers and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences have grown as producers have broadened the programming
and become increasingly willing to take greater risks in their
booking, and sponsors have become more willing to support the
festivals. Major companies seem willing to appear more often
outdoors, too, though that may be in part a response to generally
dwindling performance opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the goals for all of us has been to make this be taken
more seriously,'' Jenneth Webster, program director of the Lincoln
Center festival, said. ``Not `Oh, it's free and it's outdoors so
it's nothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dance outdoors can present special challenges and rewards to
audiences and performers alike. Some things are irritating, like
the distractions of the world outside the magic circle of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Some are exuberantly liberating, like the sudden rain that
enabled the Pilobolus Dance Theater to skid into unplanned
children's high jinks years ago at the Delacorte, or simply the
size of the stage itself, so much larger than the circumscribed
spaces dancers tend to appear in.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, from dance greats to relative neophytes and from fans
to casual browsers, must come prepared for the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Big-name choreographers and dance companies will perform free
this summer in New York City for audiences that, unused to
attending formal theater or unable to afford the tickets, might
otherwise never see their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now get a lot of dancers coming out to see each other's
work,'' said Bill Bragin, executive producer of the Central Park
Summerstage festival. ``But we also get people who are seeing a
dance concert for the first time, without the intimidation factor
that can happen in other more formal settings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Moss, vice president for programming at Lincoln Center,
estimates that 75 percent to 80 percent of the audiences for the
festival and the Midsummer Night's Swing summer dance party have
never been there before. ``For a brief two months out of the year,
they change people's perceptions of Lincoln Center,'' Ms. Moss
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados have not been forgotten, though. Friday night, for
example, the modern-dance choreographer Molissa Fenley will present
two new works, intriguingly entitled ``La Muse Menagere'' and ``On
the Other Ocean,'' at the Central Park Summerstage festival. Ms.
Fenley will share the program with the Pascal Rioult Dance Theater,
a company founded by a former Martha Graham principal dancer, which
will also perform a premiere, ``El Mozote,'' based on events in the
civil war in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn Saturday night, two newer choreographers, Arthur
Aviles and Hernando Cortez, will perform new works commissioned by
the Celebrate Brooklyn festival in Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Merce Cunningham Dance Company will open the Lincoln Center
Out of Doors festival dance series next Friday with a new
``event,'' as Cunningham calls his site-specific works. There will
also be concerts of dance from Africa and the Dominican Republic
and participatory programs of African, American Indian, Korean and
Irish dancing. During the week, the festival will present concerts
by the New York Baroque Dance Company and the Dayton Contemporary
Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Jose Limon Dance Company will perform later in August at
Lincoln Center, as will Dance Alloy of Pittsburgh, a troupe of
aboriginal dancers from Formosa; Noche Flamenca; the Jose Greco II;
the Soweto Street Beat troupe, and Pepatian. There will also be
talks on Donald McKayle and other black contributors to American
modern dance by panels that include McKayle and Joan Myers Brown,
the founder and director of Philadanco.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn festival will present Twyla Tharp and Abdel
Salaam's Forces of Nature company in mid-August. Dance will also be
performed during the week, too, at Bryant Park and Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   In what promises to be the mother of all outdoor dance
performances, audiences will journey through the woods of the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., with Joanna Haigood
and her San Francisco-based Zaccho Dance Theater in ``Invisible
Wings'' in late August. Created at the Pillow, the multimedia piece
recreates the dangerous northward passage of American slaves along
the underground railroad, which included a stop on what are now
festival grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Open-air settings invariably become a part of outdoor dance. The
sun beats down, enclosing audiences as completely as any theater
walls and ceiling. Stars provide a dazzling nighttime canopy. Birds
dart and butterflies flutter across the line of vision.
</P>
<P>
   And the sounds _ whether of planes, sirens and car horns,
crickets or the mutterings and rustlings of seat-scavengers _ form
the kind of accidental music beloved by John Cage, Cunningham's
longtime collaborator. Such distractions must be endured and even
embraced. But often they suggest or reveal unexpected facets of a
dance or add to the pleasure of spontaneity that comes only with
live performing.
</P>
<P>
   Some things work better than others on an outdoor stage.
Intimate gestures and reclining bodies tend to be lost. Spoken text
in dance is sometimes difficult to follow. Ms. Webster of Lincoln
Center worries about the reverberations from the amplified sounds
of footwork in tap and flamenco.
</P>
<P>
   Live music can present a problem, particularly for dance
performances in the Damrosch Band Shell at Lincoln Center, a more
contained proscenium space than the crannies and open plaza spaces
that also serve as stages. Ms. Webster has a special fondness for
pieces created for those crannies, but how to balance atmospheric
lighting with the very real problem of audience members' tripping
and falling?
</P>
<P>
   But choreographers, even major ones, need little encouragement
to rework dances for these spaces. And dancers tend to love the
large stages and audiences that come with outdoor performing. The
stages are large in comparison to the small theaters where many of
the dancers usually perform. Celebrate Brooklyn, for example, can
accommodate an audience of 7,200 in theater seating and on the
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Munisteri, who performed with his dancers at Summerstage
this month, talked of the ``thrill of a 1,200-person audience, of
dancing on a 15-foot-high stage, using the San Remo as a spot for
pirouettes and feeling a breeze ripple through costumes that were
designed for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortez said it was profoundly freeing to ``look out at the
audience and beyond, to the trees and horizon,'' from the
Inside/Out stage at Jacob's Pillow, a rustic hillside space that
looks suspended among the trees and sky. Cortez, like Aviles a
resident choreographer at Celebrate Brooklyn this summer, found
himself responding similarly to the large rehearsal space of the
Picnic House at Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space is huge, unlike any other rehearsal studio,'' Cortez
said of the quaint, light-filled room. ``It allowed me the freedom
to expand, to do a lot of moving and sculpting of space. And the
slipperiness of the floor allowed us to do baseball slides. I'm
hoping they will work at the band shell.''
</P>
<P>
   He will present two new sections of ``Bittersweet Symphony,''
set to music by Simply Red and Sinead O'Connor, that should
contribute, he said, to a ``feel-good outdoor experience.'' He said
it promised to be a high for his company. ``The openness of a space
can enhance performing quality. You move bigger and project
expression more.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviles used the residency to ``go ahead and do something I've
wanted to do.'' His ``Narcissus,'' a replication in movement of the
cacophony of its score by Charles Ives, as Aviles described it, was
developed through separate conversations and improvisations with
two groups of performers whose dancing will be combined with a
mirror-image duet.
</P>
<P>
   Such a concept _ and the ebulliently outspoken messages of
Hispanic and gay pride that inform Aviles' choreography _ would
have been inconceivable in an outdoor festival a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Walsh and Rachel Chanoff, co-producers of the Brooklyn
festival, base their choices on their own extensive concertgoing as
well as advice they and the other festival producers seek from
artists and presenters. In addition, Walsh and Ms. Chanoff ask
artists whom they might commission work from to submit a one-page
treatment for a new piece.
</P>
<P>
   Are the producers aiming at entertainment or education? Both,
they say, in varying degrees. One of Walsh's concerns is that his
performers and audiences have the experience of a professional,
fully produced show. ``We're trying to present things that people
might not otherwise see,'' he said. ``It's been a journey.
Celebrate Brooklyn started with a very definite mission. It was a
time when there were very few performances in the outer boroughs.
The parks were considered unsafe. We were trying to change
attitudes about parks and Brooklyn and create a sense of
community.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Webster, the Lincoln Center festival is ``a wonderful
way for people to get together and see what other people are
thinking.'' For Ms. Moss, such festivals provide the increasingly
rare opportunity for people to do something together.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, it all seems to be working. Bragin said people used to
ask whether there would be a Summerstage the next year. ``Now it's
`What will you be presenting?' '' &QL;

SHAKER STYLE: AN ELEGANCE BEYOND TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.Y., Maine, Mass., Ohio, Ky., N.H.)   (See also BC-MAINE-SHAKERS)  
 (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marybeth Keene, a partner in Wayne Pratt Antiques of
Woodbury, Conn., recently interviewed 60 antiques dealers so she
could compile a list of what's in and what's out of fashion among
collectors. She concluded that Shaker is currently out.
</P>
<P>
   That may surprise the Shaker Museum and Library of Old Chatham,
N.Y. The museum, a 50-acre site with 12 buildings and 15,000
objects, receives 18,000 visitors a year. Saturday its 43rd annual
Antiques Festival opens (the $6 museum admission gets you into the
show), and several dealers there will be selling Shaker antiques.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the museum asked John H. Kirk, author of ``The
Shaker World: Art, Life, Belief'' (Abrams, 1997), to be the curator
for a large exhibition, ``The Shaker World,'' which is on view
through Nov. 1. The show includes what the museum is calling 60
masterpieces of Shaker furniture, textiles (including costumes,
shoes and crazy quilts), tools, printed journals and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Shaker's ``out'' status will probably also come as a surprise to
Shaker collectors, who include Oprah Winfrey, Bill Cosby, Adelaide
de Menil, Leo Castelli, Ellsworth Kelly and David Byrne of the
Talking Heads.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Shaker furniture was never really in, so perhaps Ms.
Keene is right. The Shaker world has always been its own world,
ever since the sect's origins in England in the mid-18th century.
</P>
<P>
   A member who later became a charismatic leader, Ann Lee, was
jailed, and when she got out, she and her followers immigrated to
America in 1774 and settled in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   In time, 19 Shaker communities were established, in New York
State, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio and Kentucky. They
all produced furniture, but never that much, as there were never
more than 6,000 adherents.
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, produce other things to sell to the outside
world. There are still six Shakers living in a Maine community,
Sabbathday Lake, but they are the last ones.
</P>
<P>
   Shaker furniture was designed to be strictly functional, but of
course it is much more. Its spare lines give it a timeless
elegance. The craftsmanship is superb, and the materials are fine.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the Shaker style is derivative; others consider it a
distinctly American style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shakers didn't create new forms,'' said Richard Russo, a
dealer in East Chatham, N.Y. ``They took vernacular styles and
refined them to the bare minimum. And they kept doing it for a
hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no extra turnings, no enhanced carvings, nothing
extraneous. They took the essence of a chair, for example, and
reduced it to its `chairness.' It was meant to do the job and be
esthetically pleasing, simple but elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Wilkins, a Shaker dealer in Austerlitz, N.Y., for 25
years, disagreed. ``Shaker is a truly indigenous American furniture
form,'' he said. ``It's the first American style.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who runs his shop with a partner, Suzanne Courcier,
recalled an incident at his booth at the Winter Antiques Show in
Manhattan a few years ago. ``We had a desk on display that was
strongly related to a Federal tambour desk,'' he said. ``It was
superbly organized and wonderfully constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   The antiques dealer Albert Sack, who sells top-of-the-line
American Queen Anne and Chippendale but dismisses Shaker antiques,
``strolled by and stopped dead in his tracks,'' Wilkins continued.
``He looked at the desk and saw something great in it. He turned to
me and asked, `Is that Shaker?' When I responded, `Yes,' he
quipped, `They must have excommunicated that guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins added: ``The Shakers were fond of believing that they
were not style-conscious; what they meant is not fashion-conscious.
Fashion comes from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hamel, a Shaker dealer for 33 years in Chichester, N.H.,
doesn't come down on either side. ``The Shakers probably did
develop a truly indigenous American style, but remember, a lot of
the furniture makers did not grow up as Shakers,'' he said. ``They
adapted what they knew.''
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is that Shaker furniture has wide appeal. ``It
appeals to everybody from schoolteachers to doctors and lawyers,''
Hamel said. ``Celebrities are the exception to the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, the curator of the museum's summer show, said the Shaker
style seemed to have appealed to the Minimalist sculptor Donald
Judd as much as to traditional collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, discussing collecting, said: ``Unlike the go-go era of
the 1980s, we don't have theatrics in the Shaker market. What
typifies it is the real sincere, dedicated collector. We discourage
people from buying Shaker from an investment point of view. It's
not a liquid investment, though new people are coming in all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Vandall, who owns American Decorative Arts in Canaan,
N.H., and is participating in the fair this weekend, is also a
clinical psychologist who has been collecting Shaker furniture
since he was 12. Its appeal is ``the simplicity and ability to go
with any piece of furniture in any style,'' he said. ``It works in
a dining room with Chippendale or Queen Anne. It's a movable feast
wherever you put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis Henry, the owner of Willis Henry Auctions of Marshfield,
Mass., is the man who sold Oprah Winfrey $494,000 worth of Shaker
furniture in one day in 1991. People find Shaker appealing because
they can see ``the thought and spirit behind it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a certain quality, like anything that is not made for
money,'' Henry said. ``Most of it was made by the Shakers for their
community, and they cared about each other a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Ingersoll, a skilled cabinetmaker in West Cornwall, Conn.,
has a workshop with 12 people. He has been making precise
reproductions of Shaker beds, chairs, desks and tables for 20
years, using cherry, tiger maple, birch and butternut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected demand for Shaker pieces, new and old, to fade
after the 1980s, but it hasn't,'' he said. ``Now Europeans and
Japanese are going gaga over it. I'm three months behind on my
orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaker furniture, Ingersoll added, was made by people who were
instructed to be humble. ``I have a feeling that people who buy
Shaker also have a level of humility,'' he said. ``My customers are
successful, but success hasn't gone to their heads. Otherwise,
they'd want gold leaf on everything. They like the furniture as
much for its lack of pretentiousness as for its fine
craftsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal McKusick, a jazz saxophonist who has been making Shaker
reproductions in Sag Harbor, N.Y., for 20 years, summed it up this
way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaker is organic and graceful. It's beautiful because it's
peaceful. It doesn't need curlicues. The mood is simple. The
joinery is honest, and the pieces are reliable. The Shakers did not
cut steps to save time. They worked like musicians in a band; all
the parts were integrated into the whole.''

`FULL TILT BOOGIE': BEHIND (SOME OF) THE SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The documentary ``Full Tilt Boogie'' may sound like a boon to
anyone with unanswered questions about the making of the
action-sleaze-and-vampire escapade ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' like
how Salma Hayek did all those erotic dance scenes with the big
snake.
</P>
<P>
   But forget that: Ms. Hayek isn't even here. Instead, this film
is mostly about watching stir-crazy actors and crew members doing
lots of nothing in 120-degree heat. Statements like ``my goal in
the industry is to make a lot of money'' accompany the news that
some members of the group prefer their cookies fat-free.
</P>
<P>
   Horsing around is the main event here, as Juliette Lewis is
heard singing in a karaoke bar after hours, George Clooney
practices the Danny Thomas spitting double-take and Quentin
Tarantino complains about a shortage of beer kegs.
</P>
<P>
   The neophyte director is Sarah Kelly, who was a production
assistant on ``Killing Zoe'' and counts Tarantino as one of her
mentors. Ms. Kelly dutifully watches everyone work without having
anything special to ask her interviewees (though a few, like the
actor Michael Parks, are unexpectedly eloquent anyway). Her film is
a modest, anecdotal look at filmmaking stretched out far beyond its
interest value to feature length.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly fares better at capturing the footloose energy of
young crew members than at finding anything interesting in, say,
the first delivery of lumber to the film's principal outdoor set.
</P>
<P>
   Topics of group interest include the jokey use of ghastly
monster effects in ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' the question of which
male crew member looks best from the rear and, somewhat jarringly,
the possibility of health benefits for these workers.
</P>
<P>
   While discussing on-the-set romances, what it's like to make
Tarantino's coffee for him and other ephemera, the documentary
touches on a serious dispute between the nonunion film crew and
labor organizers, which has threatened to interfere with the
production. Crew members who began the project without benefits
wind up receiving them as a byproduct of this standoff.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Predictably, Congress is rushing to reinforce its
own security after the killing of two police guards in a terrifying
shootout inside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Our elected worthies, shaken by their proximity to senseless
murder, are preparing to put up new barriers to protect the
building and themselves against any future such violence.
</P>
<P>
   This is natural and right. The seat of government in a powerful
nation must not be needlessly vulnerable to random assault.
</P>
<P>
   Although they may nail a few doors shut, the lawmakers insist
that they do not really want to interfere with voters' freedom to
dawdle under the Capitol dome and watch democracy in action. That,
of course, would be a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But they are increasing the number of police on Capitol Hill,
tightening access and studying new methods of controlling traffic.
And officials of both parties were suddenly enamored of an
elaborate plan for a single new entrance area a block away from the
Capitol that all visitors would be initially herded into.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are calling it a ``visitors center'' with educational
facilities, but it is really a holding pen where cops can keep an
eye on folks before granting them entry. It will inevitably be
inconvenient and time-consuming for tourists. And it will never
stop a determined nutcase, who will merely try some other way to
reach his or her target.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another awkwardness here. The new entrance idea
demonstrates that the old double standard is alive and well.
Shamefully, the lawmakers feel no comparable compunction to see
that the president of the United States, the head of the executive
branch, is similarly protected from terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1995 truck-bombing of the Oklahoma City federal
building that killed 168 people, the Secret Service ordered two
blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House closed in
order to keep potentially dangerous vehicles at a distance. For
decades there has been an iron fence around the property, and
concrete barriers were added along the curb years ago.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secret Service Director Eljay Bowron testified that if the
avenue is reopened, ``at some point they (terrorists) will destroy
the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, however, cavalierly declared the president in no
danger and the newly created pedestrian mall ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers whined about inconvenience to tourists and traffic
jams resulting from closing part of a major city artery. They
scoffed at the possibility of an assault on the White House, even
though a plane had crashed onto the White House lawn in 1994, a
gunman had gone berserk inches from the mansion gate later that
year and President Clinton had frequently received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that a timid president was being unnecessarily
coddled. During the 1996 presidential campaign, Clinton's GOP
rival, Sen. Bob Dole, even demanded that Pennsylvania Avenue be
reopened after the bombing in an Atlanta park during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   GOP congressional leaders pushed through a measure to reopen the
avenue but were stymied by a presidential veto. Instead, they have
repeatedly forbidden the National Park Service to spend funds to
transform the avenue into a graceful pedestrian park with walkways
and greenery. Thus, Congress has guaranteed that the White House
remains framed by an ugly, useless strip of asphalt _ petty
politics at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a penny for beautifying the avenue in the 1999
appropriations bill passed by the House last week. The Senate,
however, still has a chance to act responsibly. When it votes on
the bill, it could approve funds both for a fancy new congressional
entrance and the beautification of Pennsylvania Avenue. This is not
likely, but it would be fair-minded.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary branch would like more security as well, although
no violence has been reported there. The Supreme Court has asked
Congress for seed money to develop a design for a wall or some
other major security structure around its building, which is
located across a street from the Capitol. There is little
congressional enthusiasm for this project either.
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference a location makes. Congress is going to
give Congress the attention it denies the other branches.
</P>
<P>
   Our lawmakers have always been careful to avoid the appearance
of a hostile fortress. Proposals for a fence around the grounds
have been rejected. But after a bomb exploded in an alcove in 1983,
concrete roadway barriers were erected, vehicular traffic
restricted, delivery trucks searched, metal detectors installed at
all doors, the Capitol Police force expanded and staff and
reporters required to wear badges.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials proposed a visitors center nearly a decade
ago but arguments about its projected cost stalled the plan. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, then in the GOP minority, denounced it as an
expensive congressional perk.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to raise public funds for it produced only $23 million,
about a fifth of its estimated cost. Newly motivated, congressional
leaders of both parties are now talking about financing that might
come half from taxpayers and half from the private sector. It's not
a done deal, but for want of some better ideas it is moving that
way.

FINDING COURAGE AND ANGUISH ALONG THE ROAD TO GAY PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kelli Peterson, an articulate, likable lesbian high school
student in Salt Lake City, founded an extracurricular organization
called the Gay-Straight Alliance three years ago, she had no
inkling of the storm of hysterical outrage that would erupt in her
conservative hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's opponents went so far as to as pressure the
Utah State Legislature to pass a law banning all extracurricular
high school clubs. (The ban was later overturned.) At the same
time, Ms. Peterson's cause was taken up by thousands of sympathetic
students who marched in the streets to demonstrate their support.
</P>
<P>
   Her story, told largely in her own words, is the centerpiece of
``Out of the Past,'' a solemn, well-paced documentary written by
Michelle Ferrari, directed by Jeff Dupre and narrated by Linda Hunt
(in her best grand manner), which compares Ms. Peterson to several
unsung heroes of the gay liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens Friday at the Screening Room, is a
conscious attempt to extend the historical pantheon of gay and
lesbian luminaries to include political and literary voices that
have been largely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven with Ms. Peterson's story are concise biographies of
five men and women who prefigured the modern gay liberation
movement. The most mysterious and debatable for inclusion is
Michael Wigglesworth, a 17th-century Puritan cleric who kept a
tormented diary of his own homosexual longings.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the movie jumps ahead two centuries to the novelist
Sarah Orne Jewett, whose posthumously collected love letters to her
partner, Annie Adams Fields, in what was then known as ``a Boston
marriage'' were suppressed by her publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The film goes on to remember Henry Gerber, a Chicago postal
clerk who in 1924 founded America's first known gay rights
organization. One night the police raided Gerber's home,
confiscated his typewriter and other materials, and jailed him for
several days without formally charging him with a crime. Upon his
release, he was dismissed from his job for ``conduct unbecoming'' a
postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent unsung hero was Bayard Rustin, the charismatic
black, gay civil rights leader and chief organizer of the 1963
March on Washington, known as ``the lost prophet,'' whose
homosexuality was considered such a potential embarrassment to the
civil rights leadership that he never ascended to his rightful
place alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Barbara Gittings, a president of the early
lesbian organization Daughters of Bilitis, whose efforts were
instrumental in persuading the American Psychiatric Association to
remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiently edited 64-minute film has no loose ends. The
actors reading the words of these historical figures include
Stephen Spinella (Wigglesworth), Gwyneth Paltrow (Jewett), Cherry
Jones (Fields), Edward Norton (Gerber) and Leland Gantt (Rustin).
Ms. Gittings, who is still active in gay politics, speaks for
herself, with a clipped, composed eloquence. &QL;

 &HT;    Banking on a relaxed look
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If employees at Comerica Bank in Austin look
unlike those at any other bank, you're not imagining things.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the dark _ some people say somber _ pinstripe suits
that can be seen soaking up perspiration as bankers stroll down
Congress Avenue at lunch hour in triple-digit heat. Gone are the
skirts and heels, the ties and the stiff-starched, long-sleeve,
white shirts.
</P>
<P>
   For Detroit-based Comerica's 60 Austin-area employees, it's
casual dress day every day _ apparently a first for a big bank. A
golf shirt or short-sleeve collared shirt or blouse and a pair of
nice slacks will do for work.
</P>
<P>
   Austin was chosen in June for a pilot program that will keep
employees at Comerica's five bank offices in light-hearted attire
at least until Labor Day. Officials at the Austin operation _ the
first Comerica affiliate to dress down _ will decide after Labor
Day whether to continue with the casual duds permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what started it (was) our president in Dallas was
listening to our recommendation to change with the culture down
here,'' said Tim Gillespie, manager of the Austin branch offices.
``Austin is typically a little more laid back than the Dallas
business environment,'' he said. ``It's also been pretty hot this
summer, and it's been a morale booster for employees to come in
casually dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to Austin's free-spirit reputation, many local companies
have gone casual _ a few beyond just on Fridays. The Ernst &AMP; Young
accounting firm, for instance, has allowed its 100 employees to
dress casually every day for the past three years. At Ernst &AMP;
Young, men wear either a dress shirt or a golf shirt _ no jeans or
collarless shirts _ and women can exchange suits for slacks and
blouses.
</P>
<P>
   At Dell Computer Corp., 12,000 employees in the Austin area are
free to dress ``to do your job'' on every day of the week, said
spokeswoman Michele Glaze.That includes blue jeans and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, at the University of Texas, 120 employees of the
Administrative Computing Services Department also went casual
full-time last year. It was easy because ``there never has been a
dress code in the academic community,'' said Randy Ebeling,
department director. Ditto for most of the engineers working for
high-tech companies in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bank industry's statewide trade organization in Austin,
the Texas Bankers Association, has casual summers for its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But most big banks, being banks, have been reluctant to tone
down their threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a bank per se in Austin,'' that's bucking the
usual dress code, said John Heasley, counsel for the bankers
association. ``Bankers as a rule are pretty conservative folks.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of small community banks around the state do have
casual summers. Some, such as State Bank of Jewett in East Texas,
have given the OK to tennis shoes and blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the bankers association and others, Comerica is
the first big bank in Austin to dress down.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Comerica's policy has its limits. No tennis shoes,
sandals, jeans or T-shirts are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, causal dress is not only OK, it's promoted. As
a business bank, Comerica sells products to middle market and
small-business customers, most of whom dress in professional casual
attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have had some favorable responses from our customers
with comments like, `It's nice to know my banker can come out and
get down to my level in a relaxed atmosphere rather than showing up
in a stiff shirt and a jacket,''' Gillespie said. ``Ninety percent
of the people we are calling on are dressed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the banking culture is changing, whether other
Austin banks know it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the guy sitting in the office conservatively waiting
for the business to walk in,'' Gillespie said. ``You('ve) got to go
out and get the business.''

 &HT;    Sunbeam to keep open plant Dunlap wanted closed
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ In its first public reversal of
cost-cutting plans put in place by fired Chairman Al Dunlap,
Sunbeam Corp. said it will keep open an Ohio Mr. Coffee plant
Dunlap sought to close.
</P>
<P>
   The Delray Beach-based appliance maker said the plant, which was
slated to close Sept. 4, will operate at least until Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Sunbeam management is giving us time to . . . see if
we can develop a plan to demonstrate that our plant can be
cost-competitive,'' said Daniel Carlson, vice president of
operations for Mr. Coffee maker Signature Brands USA, which Sunbeam
bought this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenwillow, Ohio, plant's largely unionized work force of
about 315 protested the closure and appealed for help this week to
legislators and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was visiting
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, where workers assemble Mr. Coffee machines, was
among eight plants Dunlap planned to close in the consolidation of
Signature Brands, First Alert and Coleman Co. into Sunbeam.
</P>
<P>
   The board fired Dunlap on June 13, and successor Jerry Levin
said he probably would pull back from Dunlap's plan to centralize
all management at the company's headquarters and would possibly add
workers companywide.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dunlap had no comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam spokeswoman Maureen Bailey said Levin has been touring
plants and meeting with Sunbeam employees as part of an ongoing
review of Sunbeam's businesses. He has not announced plans for the
company, which is struggling to sort out bloated inventories as the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the company itself review
the accuracy of its 1997 results.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect to hear from Levin on the condition of the
troubled company some time after Sunbeam's second-quarter financial
results are released in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to change things in order to get some
positive momentum generated,'' said William Steele, an analyst with
Buckingham Research Group in San Francisco.

   ``There's definitely a new attitude on the team this year and
I'm starting with myself,'' Carter said. ``I've had a couple years
that weren't really productive. I didn't do too much. That's not
the kind of person I am. I've got too much pride in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Penn State All-American, whose rookie year was ruined
by torn left knee ligaments in a preseason game at Detroit, showed
great promise in '97 with a 79-yard touchdown run at Denver on
Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   His 104-yard effort that day snapped a Bengals' streak of 67
games without a 100-yard rusher. Afterward, he was diagnosed with a
torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder, but decided to rehabilitate
the injury without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Carter started through Week 10, but couldn't hold off Dillon,
whose 1,129-yard season was the third-best in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really gives me a sense of urgency is how _ ever since I
hurt my shoulder _ I've been kind of on the back burner,'' he said.
``Corey stepped up. Now I have something to prove. I just don't
want to get forgotten about in this offense. I want to get out
there because I know I can play with a lot of backs in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten? No way. Carter will provide fresh legs when Dillon
needs a break. The two will share the backfield when the Bengals go
to their ``Jet'' package. And with 15 rushing TDs in 32 career
games, Carter should remain the goal-line specialist.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be enough to satisfy his appetite for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're there (in the spotlight) and you get out of it,
you want to get back into it,'' Carter said. ``That's where I am
right now, especially around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to gain the confidence back of the people in
Cincinnati, my teammates, coach (Bruce) Coslet, my running backs
coach (Jim Anderson) and people throughout the nation that I'm a
good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, entering the fourth year of a seven-year, $19.125
million contract, is running hard and fast at training camp in an
attempt to push Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just don't give Ki-Jana credit because to whom
a lot is given, a lot is expected,'' Anderson said. ``Some
unfortunate things have happened to him, but he's come back and
he's working hard. He knows that for him to achieve, he has to get
himself ready, because any snap, he can be called on and he must
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the sad stories in football, what happened at the
beginning of his career,'' said Leigh Steinberg, Carter's agent.
``But Ki-Jana has an incredible competitive desire. He's ready to
take off. He will have an outstanding year and will press (Dillon)
very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter won't reveal his goals, saying only that they have to do
with team and personal success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was being a little knucklehead, taking everything
for granted early in my career,'' he said. ``But I've got too many
things ahead of me that I want to see and I'm too stubborn to let
'em go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people talk bad about me. But (injuries) have
hampered me so far. Now I've got no excuses . . . just go out and
do the best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I'm done with my career, I'm going to have a good
one. It's my fourth year. I know it's getting late. But I'll get
there. I know I will.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Johnson's way is a duping incident
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson, for all his swagger, knows he
cannot get where he wants alone. He is in a joint venture, with his
players, with the media, all of whom he counts on to be dopes.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the media. Johnson was one of us for two years. He
knows he can use us to motivate players, and he knows what we want.
A story. A story handed to us. Television reporters, who are less
often present, don't even want that much. They want a quote. A
bite. A gimme.
</P>
<P>
   So he gives, even on those days he doesn't call in spin to a
radio show. He bounces off the field, and often before he even
steps upon his little orange box to beam himself into your little
black box, he gives us a name.
</P>
<P>
   A name he either praises or denigrates. No in-between. A name to
which he might have done the opposite a day earlier. The rookie
John Avery slips from Barry Sanders to Barry Manilow, just like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can't do my job,'' said a bewildered Avery, who
has a sore hamstring. ``So the praise is cut off right there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm aware of (how it affects players),'' Johnson said.
``But number one, I'm honest. So if you ask me a question, I'm
going to be honest. I may not tell you the full story, but I'll be
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Johnson volunteers names before the questions start, and one
wonders if he doesn't choose them before practice. He cannot have
watched 80 guys at once. He cannot know for sure until he watches
tape.
</P>
<P>
   He's not God.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's just a psychology major who relies on his young
players to think he is God. To not know any better. To read the
newspaper, and watch television, and get his message, if it hasn't
already come to them in waves of cameras and notebooks as soon as
he is done.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dixon was hit by the waves this week. No warning. A
Canadian Football League veteran, suddenly he is being called by
Johnson ``as good a performer as I've seen at (left guard) since
I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon is a performer who admits that ``my confidence is
fragile.'' That he still expects ``to be playing left tackle for
the Montreal Alouettes next week.'' That he has ``had too many
disappointments in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon could use a class with Stuart Smalley, an Al Franken
character on Saturday Night Live. ``I'm good enough, I'm smart
enough, and doggone it, people like me,'' Smalley said into a
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Johnson is the mirror, and Dixon is in the coach's
golden glow. ``This has been a dream, the last couple of days,''
Dixon said. ``It's the biggest thing that has happened to me in the
last four, five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all players enjoy the praise so. When Johnson declared last
July that Derrick Rodgers was having a better camp than Zach Thomas
had as a rookie, Rodgers was uncomfortable. So was Brad Jackson,
when Johnson commended him last month.
</P>
<P>
   That beats the alternative, though. Jeff Buckey has been lauded,
a seventh-rounder made good. Now Johnson dishes out a daily public
insult for the reserved Buckey to swallow, as if it will help him
put on weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about what's said in the media,'' Buckey said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not easy. Jason Taylor talks about taking the positive in
stride and taking heed if Johnson ``comes off and says you're a big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But did Taylor, as a 1997 rookie, really know Johnson was
playing mind games? He laughs. ``We're cool now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Most veterans are. Brock Marion played for Johnson as a rookie
in Dallas. He doesn't sweat every word in Miami. Neither does
Robert Jones, another former Cowboy. ``Every time you grab Jimmy,''
Jones said, ``I don't know what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do we sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Brent Smith, then Smith gets hurt. He likes Avery, then
Avery gets hurt. Wednesday, he liked Bernie Parmalee again. Bernie
Parmalee. How much has he changed since Monday? Since 1996?
</P>
<P>
   How different is Dixon's life than it was Monday? Quite. But he
knows one missed block changes everything again. The cameras leave.
</P>
<P>
   When they left Wednesday, Dixon was smiling. James Brown, the
right tackle, glanced over:
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Jimmy say?''

 &HT;    Marlins: Unsigned Ambres holds football option
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The 18-year-old kid who took batting practice with the
Marlins at the Astrodome on Wednesday could be a big part of the
Marlins' future.
</P>
<P>
   He could also be playing quarterback this fall at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Ambres, the Marlins' first-round pick in the 1998 draft, is
still holding out for more money. And, since he has a scholarship
offer from A&AMP;M, he could turn Florida down completely, go to
college and start football practice on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all on them,'' Ambres, a center fielder, said. ``You
still have A&AMP;M in the picture, so if it's not done by Tuesday, I'll
head up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins don't want that, but they're not too keen on meeting
Ambres's asking price, either. He's asking for about $1.8 million,
and the Marlins aren't sure right now if they can make up the
difference by Ambres's self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd like to get on with his life, it makes sense,'' said
Marlins scouting director Orrin Freeman, who flew to Houston on
Wednesday to meet with Ambres, his parents and his agent. ``We're
hoping to get it done, but we're both going to have to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman knows Ambres can use football as a bargaining chip _ he
knew it when he drafted him. But the way the Marlins figure it, the
worst that happens is they don't sign Ambres, and they get a
compensatory ``sandwich'' pick between the first and second rounds
of next year's draft. That pick won't be much lower than 27 anyway,
so they won't be losing much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, eventually, things will change,'' said Ambres.
``I've got so many options a lot of guys don't have, and a lot of
people in this state would like to see me go play football. But my
love is baseball, and what better thing is there to do than play
the game you love?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Just resting: Right fielder Mark Kotsay has been out of the
lineup for three days now, and Marlins manager Jim Leyland said
it's because he's worried Kotsay is losing too much weight and
weakening. Kotsay might play this afternoon, but Leyland said
Tuesday he'd likely hold him out of all four games in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay's batting average has dropped 18 points since the start
of July, to .273 entering Wednesday's game, and Leyland thought
maybe playing everyday in the heat of South Florida and on the
astroturf in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia was wearing on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll take something out of you, sure,'' Kotsay said. ``But
I'm not going to come out and say I'm tired or I'm worn out. I feel
all right to play, and I'll go in when he puts me in. Right now, it
makes sense to have a guy like (Ryan) Jackson in there instead of
me, if I'm not helping the team.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Trade winds: The Boston Red Sox are definitely interested in
Todd Zeile, and have what the Marlins want _ a solid third-base
prospect at a AAA ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   If Boston wants Zeile to bolster their right-handed hitting,
settle their infield situation by moving John Valentin back to
second base and possibly DH or catch in case of emergency, the
Marlins are sure to ask for Cole Liniak, the AAA Pawtucket third
baseman who, though 92 games this season, was hitting .272 with 27
doubles, 14 home runs and 51 RBI. He could step in immediately or
at least soon, because if the Marlins move Zeile, they don't have a
top prospect in their system who could play third at the big-league
level.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston is also talking to Toronto about Mike Stanley, and to
Cincinnati about Reggie Sanders and possibly Bret Boone, so they
could fill their needs elsewhere. The trade deadline is Friday.

   AMMAN, Jordan _ This is a difficult time for illness to afflict
the only king that most Jordanians have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, King Hussein, sovereign of this land for 45 years,
announced to his people that he was going to the hospital for
tests, much like a father would with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he confirmed that he had lymphatic cancer, though it
was apparently caught early and he vowed to live through it.
</P>
<P>
   Televised from his hospital at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., the 62-year-old monarch spoke of upcoming months of
chemotherapy and said, ``There is life and there is an end to life,
this is the way with everyone. But rest assured, I am not over and
done with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has been sick before, having cancer removed from his
kidney in 1992. But now, his subjects are worried not only about
him, but also about the future of their little desert country,
which sits among so many threatening neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has affected me more than if it were a member of my own
family,'' said Jordanian carpenter Atef Beni, 33. ``He is the
protector of this country. We all live under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Under other circumstances, Jordanians might offer cautious
criticism of the King about the country's recession, his unpopular
peace with Israel and his human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordanians, as well as foreigners, see him also as the only
one who can fix these problems, recognizing that he is an essential
buffer between forces that could unsettle Jordan and the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be in stagnation waiting for him,'' said Taher Masri,
a former Jordanian prime minister who seeks the office again.
``(People) may criticize him perhaps, but when it comes to our
feelings for him, he is a savior. No doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A descendant of the Muslim prophet Mohammed, Hussein is from a
Saudi family installed by western forces after World War I. He has
been a neutral broker between Bedouins, indigenous Jordanians and
Palestinians, the latter of whom now make up about 60 percent of
Jordan's 4.4 million population.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, Hussein opened relations with Israel on the west,
which most Jordanians see as a belligerent neighbor. Meanwhile, he
has held off, while maintaining ties with, Iraq's expansionist
Saddam Hussein on the east and Syria's Hafez Asad to the north.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein has crushed bread riots of his own people and
fought a bloody, though short, war against Yasser Arafat's PLO when
it tried to exert too much power from its base in his country.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, he will almost certainly be replaced by Crown Prince
Hassan, the King's brother, who is 12 years younger and has been
the named successor for more than 30 years. Hassan, educated at
Oxford, is considered a competent intellectual who, according to a
Western diplomat, has ``velcro-ed himself'' to the King's policies.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the King who has the charm.
</P>
<P>
   He became king at just 18 years of age. Now, in his early 60s,
Hussein is seen as the patient man who gave a palace up to orphans
and visited grieving Israelis after their children were killed by a
crazed Jordanian soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he sometimes flies his own plane and that his
fourth wife, Queen Noor, is an Arab-American educated at Princeton,
add to a carefully-crafted mystique that have raised his country's
profile with his own.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Jordan faces serious internal problems, aggravated
by what had been high expectations for the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Always a poor country with few resources, Jordan's economy is
worsening. Unemployment hovers over 20 percent and a third of the
country lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hussein's boldest venture, the 1994 peace treaty with Israel,
is largely seen as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops still occupy most of the land in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank sought by Palestinians, many of whom have close
relatives of Palestinians in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Israelis humiliated and infuriated the King when they
tried to assassinate a Hamas terrorist, respected by many
Jordanians, on the streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Contrary to hopes for democracy, people are restless under
Hussein's bans on public demonstration and tough rules against
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, an avid reader of medical journals even before his
illnesses, has been more candid about them than many Western
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He has also talked about the inevitability of death, almost a
taboo subject in a culture where most people do not even make
wills.
</P>
<P>
   This prompts assurances that Crown Prince Hassan will rule much
like the King, maintaining the unpopular peace process with Israel
and perhaps being more adept at handling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Unclear still, is who would come after Hassan. Observers say the
royal family may be split between two 18-year-old princes --
Hassan's son Rashed or Hussein's and Queen Noor's son Hamzah.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein may have been giving the edge to his son recently. He
welcomed Hamzah to manhood with a letter, published prominently in
the semi-official press, stating that Hamzah had now reached the
age he was when he became king.

SHAKER SIMPLICITY AND A BAY VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BC-ANTIQUES-COLUMN)  
 (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The peninsula encompassing the downtown area of Portland, Maine,
stretches closely along the mainland like a short left thumb, its
outer margins bounded by the waters of Casco Bay. It is a
pleasantly compact place, with neighborhoods that invite strolling
and a harbor full of islands reached by a ferry ride that can feel
like a vacation in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to visit such a manageable maritime city and do a
little exploring along the coast nearby lured my wife, Margaret,
and me on a recent weekend. But we also went out of curiosity about
a living link to an unusual chapter in American religious history.
For more than two centuries, a Shaker community has made its home
on a farmstead less than an hour's drive away from Portland, and
the six believers living there now are the last remnant of this
sect in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the word Shaker calls to mind the skilled makers of
decorative craft items like ladder-back chairs and elegant wooden
boxes. For others, the name also conjures up an idealized image of
a peaceful, agrarian people, a picture aided by the lyrics of a
well-known Shaker hymn, `` 'Tis a gift to be simple. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Common though such ideas are, they slight the rich and varied
history of the Shakers themselves, a once controversial Christian
sect distinguished by its commitment to celibacy, its practice of
holding all goods in common, its emphasis on personal confession
and on equality between men and women, and its determination to
remain separate from mainstream society, which Shakers call ``the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the Christ Spirit, the expression of Deity, first
manifested in Jesus of Nazareth,'' declares a tiny pamphlet of the
sect's basic beliefs. ``We also regard Ann Lee as the first to
receive in this latter day the interior realization that the same
Divine Spirit which was in Jesus might dwell within the
consciousness of any man, woman or child.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, born in England in 1736, became prominent among a group
there called the Shaking Quakers, named for their ecstatic behavior
in worship services. The group emerged amid the religious revivals
that occurred on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-18th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Only after immigrating to America with a few fellow believers in
1774, and settling near Albany, N.Y., did Mother Ann Lee, as she
was called, achieve the status of a visionary leader. She laid the
basis for what became the United Society of Believers in Christ's
Second Appearing, the Shakers' formal name, through a series of
preaching tours that culminated in 1783, the year before her death.
</P>
<P>
   Through conversions, the society grew remarkably, to 6,000
people in the 1830s and '40s. They were gathered in 19 rural
communities from Maine to Kentucky. But after the Civil War, their
numbers began a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
   Getting from New York to the last living Shaker settlement, the
Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, which lies within the town of New
Gloucester, is not difficult. It takes about an hour to fly into
Portland's airport, a few minutes from the city center. We arrived
late one Friday evening, picked up a rental car and drove to the
residential West End, where we checked into the Danforth, a
bed-and-breakfast inn in a three-story brick house built for a
merchant 170 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   We planned to go to Sabbathday Lake the next morning. The Shaker
community lives there year round, but the grounds are open to
visitors only between Memorial Day and Columbus Day.
</P>
<P>
   After a few miles of uninteresting countryside on Route 26, a
busy two-lane stretch of asphalt that links the coast with Canada,
a roadside sign appears, announcing the Sabbathday Lake Shaker
community. The site includes more than a dozen white-painted wooden
buildings clustered around an imposing brick house, the community's
home, called the Dwelling House.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who arrives expecting the likes of Plimouth Plantation or
Colonial Williamsburg, with people in antique costumes going about
picturesque chores, risks great disappointment. During our visit,
the place was dead quiet; the only visible activity was the labors
of a dog named Habukkuk, herding sheep in a pasture. Our guide, a
non-Shaker, said the community's living quarters were
(appropriately) off limits.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview later, Leonard Brooks, director of the
Shaker Museum and Shaker Library at Sabbathday Lake, said it would
be unusual for visitors to have any contact with community members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at work in the workshops and the Dwelling House,'' he
said. ``They meet for prayer three times a day. So there's not a
lot of time to meet the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbathday Lake's attraction is more subtle, centering on the
value of entering a place where a highly distinctive American group
continues to live out its history. To enhance a visit, I'd
recommend a little reading. Some books are available in the small
and tasteful museum shop inside a building that houses displays
about life in the community as it once was. You have to stop there
anyway for a $5 tour ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shaker Experience in America'' (Yale, 1992), by Stephen J.
Stein, is an excellent, thorough history that describes the
successes and failures, as well as leading personalities, of the
sect's two centuries. It warns, too, against the temptation to
glamorize the Shakers. ``The United Society has an unusual, even
remarkable, record of achievements,'' Stein writes. ``It does not
need to be sentimentalized or romanticized.''

 UNDATED: or romanticized.''   &HT;    There were no other visitors when we arrived, so we wound up
with a private tour. Our guide, a knowledgeable local woman, said
the Sabbathday Lake property encompassed 1,900 acres, on which the
Shakers raise culinary herbs for sale. They can be purchased in the
museum shop or the Shaker store or by mail order.
 &HT;    The community now consists of four women and two men, ranging in
age from 30-something to 80-something. All live and dine in the
48-room Dwelling House, which dates to 1883. At mealtimes they are
segregated by sex.
 &HT;    When we visited in June, seven people were living there. But in
a poignant illustration of Shaker demographic trends, the community
has since decreased by one, as a third ``brother'' left Sabbathday
Lake.
 &HT;    Across from the Dwelling House sits the community's most
interesting structure, the Meetinghouse, first used on April 19,
1794. It is a satisfyingly austere place of white walls and
blue-painted ceiling beams, illuminated by the light from clear
glass windows. Worshipers sit on facing benches, the men and the
women separately.
 &HT;    A utilitarian building, the Meetinghouse contains an upper floor
arranged to show Shaker living and working space. Examples of the
famous chairs can be seen, along with other evidence of Shaker
industriousness, like a workbench for making flat brooms for sale.
 &HT;    The believers, the guide said, have a history as an
entrepreneurial people whose products and innovations, like the
circular saw, the clothespin and the flat broom, provided financial
support to the communities.
 &HT;    Our tour also took in the Ministry's Shop next door, set up to
show how the community's governing elders and eldresses lived and
worked. It also shows the evolution in Shaker dress and home styles
during the later 19th century, as business dealings brought
believers closer to outside society. The walls are adorned with
pictures, while bedsheets bear monograms, a sign of individualism
emerging among a communal people.
 &HT;    As Stein makes clear in his book, the Shakers never shunned
modern technology, using the railroads to ship their products to
market and later buying cars. But their insistence on redefining
the idea of the family by requiring celibacy and communal living
made them distinct, and in the 19th century subject to rumors,
accusations and even physical attack by neighbors.
 &HT;    If the Shaker commitment to celibacy seems merely peculiar,
rather than the razor-sharp dividing line from a sinful world,
consider what James Whittaker, a Shaker leader, wrote to relatives
in 1785: ``I hate your fleshly lives, and your fleshly generation,
and increasing, as I hate the smoke of the bottomless pit.''
 &HT;    These days, the sort of vehemence with which the earliest
Shakers expressed their commitment to religious separatism belongs
to the distant past. When we left Sabbathday Lake, it was with
thoughts of the creativity and durability of this community.
 &HT;    We returned to Portland by way of Yarmouth, a coastal town where
we paused for lunch at the Royal River Cannery. A window near our
table looked out on half a dozen small sailboats; on one, a man
worked away, swabbing his deck.
 &HT;    The scene made us want to get closer to the water, a desire
Portland can fulfill, with a ride on a Casco Bay Lines ferry to one
of the harbor islands.
 &HT;    At the terminal, we asked a man behind the counter to recommend
a see-the-basics cruise. He sold us round-trip tickets to Peaks
Island, a 20-minute ride that gave us time to gaze on distant
wooded shores and enjoy the play of sunlight and cloud shadow on
the bay.
 &HT;    Rather than disembark with the other passengers, we stayed
aboard for the return. We met a couple who had gone over earlier
and walked clear around the residential island, a brisk 90-minute
journey, they said.
 &HT;    We saved our walking for downtown Portland and its Old Port
area, a place of shops and restaurants behind the waterfront. At
our request, the Danforth made reservations for us both nights we
were in town, sending us the first evening to Perfetto, a place of
hardwood floors, brick walls and a menu that runs from filet mignon
to a good haddock with risotto.
 &HT;    The restaurant won our gratitude for taking us in with no fuss,
even though we arrived several minutes past the time when it
normally stops seating diners. We returned to the area the next
night, to Street &AMP; Company, a seafood restaurant on cobblestoned
Wharf Street.
 &HT;    One caveat worth mentioning about this area, however, is that as
the evening progresses, a just-postcollegiate crowd rolls in, bound
for local bars. The resulting hilarity, it seems, can reach rather
high decibels.
 &HT;    Although the Old Port reverts to calm in the daylight, we
decided to put the city behind us on Sunday, driving along the
coast below Brunswick. A guidebook recommended Route 123, which
runs down a finger of land in Casco Bay. We found country houses,
white-steepled churches and glimpses of the water.
 &HT;    It was a pretty enough landscape, on a road that allowed us to
stop at a tiny beach where we could stroll beside sun-sparkled
water. But the surroundings did not make the impression of
Sabbathday Lake.
 &HT;    Once the village was the most northerly outpost of a farflung
network of believers. Now it is a singular place in America's
religious landscape.
 &HT;    The first Shakers gathered there while Ann Lee was still alive.
That a community remains, in its third century, offers a fragile
testimony to the power of her vision.

PLUMBING THE SUBCONSCIOUS TO REACH MARITAL EQUILIBRIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hypnotism and feng shui (the Eastern philosophy involving the
strategic placement of buildings and their contents to achieve a
greater harmony with nature) are forces that impinge powerfully on
the marriage of Mathilde (Sandrine Kiberlain), a neurotic
29-year-old Parisian, and her 39-year-old husband, Nico (Vincent
Lindon), a successful orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   In Benoit Jacquot's eerie, exquisitely subtle film ``Seventh
Heaven,'' which opens Friday in New York City, both are crucial
elements of what might be described as a psychological mystery that
exudes a faint undertone of menace.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by the French filmmaker who created a splash last year
with ``A Single Girl,'' ``Seventh Heaven'' is an open-ended
meditation on the delicate power dynamics of a marriage, presented
as an elaborate psychic whodunit. In its early scenes, Mathilde, a
dour, beautiful woman with a faraway look in her eyes, is suffering
from fainting spells, which often follow episodes of kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   One evening at a cocktail party she catches the eye of a
grim-faced middle-aged guest (Francois Berleand), who shoots her a
look that implies he can read her mind.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, when Mathilde suffers another fainting spell
after pocketing an item in a toy store, she regains consciousness
to find the unsmiling mystery guest beside her. Escorting her to
lunch in a deserted restaurant, he directs intimate questions at
the dazed woman in a voice that suggests he may already know the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The two begin hypnotherapy sessions in which he explores her
childhood relationship with a father who may have sexually abused
her while telling her an entrancing bedtime story. We also learn
that around that time, her father died in a possible suicide. When
asked about the past, Mathilde's seductive, meddlesome mother, who
is still beautiful at 53, equivocates and recalls her husband as
being insanely jealous.
</P>
<P>
   While in a hypnotic trance, Mathilde, who has been sexually
unresponsive to her husband, becomes spontaneously orgasmic. At the
end of their first session, the doctor advises her to rearrange her
home so that the bedroom and the study are reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement has a startling effect on her marriage. The
balance of sexual power changes so dramatically that Nico is thrown
into a tailspin, and after he has an odd, sexually ambiguous
encounter with a younger male colleague in a bar, Nico seeks
professional help.
</P>
<P>
   What's so remarkable about the film is that its mixture of
personal erotic history, speculation and bedroom confusion is
presented without a tinge of hysteria. While examining the
phenomenon of repressed memory, the movie makes no judgments about
its reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Its vision of the typical bourgeois family (Mathilde and Nico
have a young son) is of an erotically charged organism in which
energy, information and vibrations are continually circulating. If
there have been any sexual crimes, it suggests, everyone is deeply
implicated.
</P>
<P>
   In the scenes in which Mathilde drifts almost like a sleepwalker
through the city, Ms. Kiberlain recalls both Monica Vitti wandering
dazedly through Antonioni's ``Red Desert'' and Tippi Hedren in
``Marnie.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Jacquot's film, the melodrama has been stripped away.
Instead of a hellish vision of spiritual ennui or a lurid Freudian
nightmare, ``Seventh Heaven'' presents its characters' turmoil as
completely ordinary. At the same time, it leaves its mysteries,
including the identity and motives of the hypnotist, unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   It is this everyday quality of the film that sets it apart.
Middle-class marital ``seventh heaven,'' it suggests, is a state of
functioning imperfection, in which powerful psychological forces
reach an equilibrium that is tenuous and unsatisfying at best, but
somehow workable. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

FOR MANAGERS, ONE SKILL IS VALUED ABOVE ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Top salesmen do not necessarily make good sales
managers. Top production workers do not necessarily make good
foremen. Top teachers do not necessarily make good principals. And
the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   In any line of work, the ability to be an outstanding performer
does not always translate into the ability to be a good manager.
</P>
<P>
   Many skills are transferable, of course. Skill in getting along
with others is perhaps the No. 1 management credential, just as it
is a top asset for the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   The work ethic that helps someone prosper in an entry-level job
will continue to be a valuable tool in management. But there's a
big change when a first-time supervisor is thrown a larger net of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A manager becomes responsible for motivating others, for
conveying or setting policies, and for being the relay point
between those above and those below on the organizational ladder.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest differences between management and
nonmanagement is that the workday becomes consumed with meetings,
budget-making and, perhaps most unsettling of all, conflict
resolutions. In general, the management paperwork is a piece of
cake compared with the people part.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a worker's success no longer is measured by how well
he or she performs individually. It is tied into how well the new
manager encourages and enables others to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Woe to the star performer who always paddled a skilled but solo
route through the company. There is a new, unfamiliar standard for
performance evaluations. Managers are rated as much on people
skills as on measurable output.
</P>
<P>
   Some workplaces do a good job training and preparing workers for
management roles. Others don't. In fact, most don't. Most
organizations see good people in the ranks, tap them for
promotions, then trust them to do well.
</P>
<P>
   Many adapt and prosper. They find that management is a
day-to-day learning experience. Their individual experience expands
geometrically. They become more valuable to their employer.
</P>
<P>
   But neophyte managers must know this: You won't believe how
often you will be called upon to manage or resolve conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of executives by Accountemps asked, ``In general, what
percentage of management time is wasted on resolving personality
conflicts?'' While I question the use of the word ``wasted,'' it
does indicate that most managers would prefer doing something other
than adjudicating spats.
</P>
<P>
   The average response of those polled was 18 percent _ not quite
double what the average response was to the same question a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what that says about the decreasing ability of
workers to get along with others. But I am sure that it indicates a
dire need for managers to be trained in conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are books, seminars and workplace trainers
available to teach conflict-resolution skills. Unfortunately, most
new managers are too busy taking care of business to take advantage
of them.
</P>
<P>
   A new manager's learning curve is long. It starts at the moment
of promotion and arcs through much unfamiliar territory. It calls
for many attributes, including the patience of Job and wisdom of
Solomon.

WORTHY BUT TRANSITORY ENTERPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Some enterprises, though worthy, have transitory lives
On Beaver Creek _ I once traveled down this valley on foot, canteen
empty and with a ferocious thirst.
</P>
<P>
   The topographic map gave no hint of a spring to water from. But
it did show a town ahead _ a place with the hopeful name of Tigris,
mother of civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   I stumbled out upon a road, ascended it around a bend and came
upon the place, only to find that Tigris had perished unremembered
years before.
</P>
<P>
   No drink was to be found there, but I made these notes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALS)The door of the John Allen Store, General Mdse., is
nailed shut and further guarded by wicked canes of blackberry that
have forced the rotting porch boards and grown up to make a thicket
on a stage.
</P>
<P>
   Just across is the livery stable, broken by a tree and dragged
down by wild grape. Garage &AMP; Welding _ dead too, fastened with a
rusted padlock. The tomato cannery, of galvanized sheeting, chimes
impassively under the blows of clenched fists.
</P>
<P>
   On the hill behind are the remains of a dwelling, home of the
master of Tigris overlooking his fief, consumed on a winter night
by some accident with the flue. A mansion it was, judging by the
size of the footings. Hugely the offending furnace looms,
embarrassed to have survived.(END ITALS)
</P>
<P>
   From Tigris, the road led on to the town of Ava, and beyond
there, a gravel lane descended into a different valley.
</P>
<P>
   I built my fire and spread my blanket that night in a grassy
little glade, beside a bluff where a rivulet of clear, sweet water
spouted from a pipe driven into a cleft in the rock face.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I continued on down that valley's brook to its
joining with larger Bryant Creek. And, rounding one of Bryant's
bends in the blue light of evening, was astonished to hear the
day's last prayer song, in Latin, spreading sweet and melancholy
through the forested solitude of Shingle Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd come upon was a community of Trappist monks _ 20-some
of them, supporting themselves by the manufacture of cement
building blocks and the making of jellies.
</P>
<P>
   More notes:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALS)Theirs is the silent order, so they are generous
with everything but talk. They have forsaken the pleasures and
temptations of the world for the simplicity of bread and milk, hard
work and early rising.(END ITALS)
</P>
<P>
   All that was 35 years ago. On a recent day I passed through that
Ozark country again, this time by car.
</P>
<P>
   In Tigris, no sign of the livery stable could be found. John
Allen's establishment, like the man himself, also had disappeared
entirely. The name on the metal sheeting of the cannery's front has
faded, and the ruin of the mansion is lost among the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Trappists of Shingle Hollow have moved to new quarters on
the hill above. Nothing remains of the old monastery down by Bryant
Creek, or of the hard disciplines of that monastic order. For the
rules have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The monks speak freely now, their services no longer are sung in
Latin. There's even a female among them _ a woman of the town
brought in to help with office matters.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently the young find the contemplative vocation less
attractive than in previous times, for the community is in
inexorable decline. Every year the brothers are older and fewer _
now only 12 regular and two hermit monks, several of them ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, in a different piece of country to the east, we
stopped on a ridge where there'd been a mill for making barrel
staves. Trees had reclaimed the denuded land, and except for the
concrete slab upon which it had stood, the mill itself was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Along that ridge there'd been rough cabins _ 30 or maybe more of
them _ for the timber workers and their families. But all that
could be found of those were a few stone footings and, close to
those, the stubborn perennials a woman's hand had transplanted
there from some other forgotten camp.
</P>
<P>
   In all these places, I was struck by how faint and fragile is
the print of some men's works upon the land. Yet the endeavors of
others _ even inauspiciously begun _ can have a durable life.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the difference between them?
</P>

   UNDATED _ The case of a pregnant 12-year-old Michigan girl
seeking an abortion in Wichita, Kan., isn't as rare as many might
think.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of young girls nationwide are getting abortions. Last
year, 48 Kansas girls ages 14 and under underwent the procedure, as
did 121 Missouri girls, in their respective states.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 12 months, we've probably done about ten
12-year-olds, and maybe another ten 13-year-olds,'' said Patty
Brous, president of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.
``I think we've also had one 10-year-old in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the numbers are small in comparison to the total number
of abortions performed nationwide _ around 1.2 million _ those on
both sides of the issue say they are a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every abortion is a tragedy,'' said Dave Gittrich, executive
director of Kansans for Life, the state's largest anti-abortion
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is very, very troubling,'' said Susan Tew,
spokeswoman for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an organization that
researches reproductive issues.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also highlight another disturbing issue: rape and
incest of young girls. Those who specialize in the treatment of
adolescents say that most pregnancies in girls 13 and under are the
result of rape and incest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very high percentage of the very young teens who did
not voluntarily have intercourse,'' said Paula J. Adams Hillard,
professor of obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics in the
College of Medicine at the University of Cincinnati. ``We see it
all the time. That's something nobody likes to think about, but it
is really, really important to note.''
</P>
<P>
   Brous said she'd seen similar cases at Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our experience with the 12- and 13-year-olds, more often
than not the pregnancy is a result of coercion, usually by an older
male, often a family member or a close friend of the family,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really illustrates the crying need in this country for
comprehensive sexuality education that is age-appropriate, from
early childhood through high school and college.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has attracted national attention since a Michigan
judge on Friday cleared the way for the parents of a 12-year-old
girl to take her out of the state for a late-term abortion. The
girl, who allegedly was impregnated by her 17-year-old brother, is
about 28 weeks pregnant. A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Wichita physician George Tiller, who operates Women's Health
Care Services, is one of a handful of doctors who performs
late-term abortions. Abortion is illegal in Michigan after the 24th
week unless the girl or woman's life is endangered. Kansas law
permits it under a few other circumstances, although the law is
currently being challenged by Tiller.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tiller nor his clinic administrator would comment on the
case Wednesday. Clinic officials have neither confirmed nor denied
that the girl is getting an abortion there.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Bowman, spokeswoman for the Women's Freedom Project and
former spokeswoman for Tiller, said she was aware of girls as young
as 9 having abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know that it happens to 10-, 11- and 12-year-olds,''
Bowman said. ``The issue of how often it happens is immaterial. If
it happens to you and your family, it is a tragedy. And the fact
that it happens at all is indicative of the enormous abuse going on
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many girls in the 10- to 12-year-old
range get abortions each year. The Alan Guttmacher Institute, an
organization that compiles abortion statistics, reports that in
1994 _ the most current year data are available _ 12,150 abortions
were performed on girls ages 14 and under in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   About the same number of births were reported _ 12,901, and
about 3,800 miscarriages. That means there were roughly 28,851
pregnancies in girls ages 14 and under. The figures, however,
aren't broken down into more specific age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Figures compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention show in 1995 that 5,903 abortions were performed on
girls ages 14 and under in 42 states and New York City. Not all
states, however, report their abortion figures to the CDC. Among
those not included are heavily populated states such as California,
Florida and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether young girls should be delivering babies is
a hotly contested one.
</P>
<P>
   Hillard said most studies suggest that teens who are older than
15 don't run much more risk of medical complications than do older
women. But the studies indicate that younger teens probably do face
increased risks, in part because they don't seek prenatal care
until later in their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies also show that younger teens are not yet
biologically mature enough to deliver, Hillard said.
</P>
<P>
   Many abortion opponents believe otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's not easy if you're 12 years old,'' said
Kansans for Life's Gittrich. ``But the rule of thumb has always
been that if you can conceive, you can deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't necessarily the case, Hillard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ignoring the fact that it may not have been voluntarily
that she got pregnant in the first place, it's ignoring all of the
developmental issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that arises in dealing with young girls getting
pregnant is late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is very, very complicated, and you'll find many
physicians who are not truly supportive,'' Hillard said. ``There's
just not a good choice in those cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do the girls wait so long to seek an abortion?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they don't know,'' Hillard said. ``Menstrual
periods are frequently irregular for teens, and they don't keep
track of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are not developmentally mature, certainly not at age 12,
and even not at age 15,'' Hillard said. ``They're not thinking
about the consequences of their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons young girls wait so long, Hillard said, are
because they are afraid of disappointing their families and because
of a lack of familiarity with the medical system.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are just completely lost, they may not have good
problem-solving skills, and they don't know to go to some other
adult if they can't go to a parent, especially if one is the father
of the child,'' she said. ``They're just completely floundering,
and it's so very, very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes argue that though the cases are tragic, abortion
is not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is abortion going to solve?'' Gittrich said. ``Is it
going to make them an `unvictim' of an incest? Is it going to make
them feel better about being incested? It's just not going to do a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to be just as traumatized as she was before the
abortion. The only problem is she's going to have to deal with the
fact that the baby she's felt kicking and moving and living in her
womb is now going to be killed. All we're doing is compounding the
problems and killing the child.''

`RIGOLETTO': VERDI SURVEY PROVIDES AN EARNEST `RIGOLETTO' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Viewed as a welcome instance of corporate and city
cooperation, the New York Grand Opera's performance on Wednesday
night of Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' was a heartening event.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent La Selva, the artistic director of the company, has been
presenting free outdoor operas in Central Park for 25 years, and
with this ``Rigoletto,'' the scrappy company is more than halfway
through its seven-year survey of all 28 Verdi operas in
chronological order. Despite the oppressive humidity and the
distractions of a corporate challenge run that closed some park
entrances, a capacity audience of more than 10,000 turned up,
including the city's most public opera fan, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who gave a welcoming speech and stayed for the entire performance,
and the renowned soprano Licia Albanese, 85 as of last week and a
loyal supporter of La Selva and his company.
</P>
<P>
   But viewed as a musical event, the production was another
instance of earnest effort, genuine talent and ineptitude. The
major problem remains the sound system at Summerstage, which is
better suited to pop, folk, dance and other typically amplified
types of music that are offered there. Buzzing, ringing and woofy
distortion in the overhead speakers made it difficult to evaluate
the singers.
</P>
<P>
   The title role of the hunch-backed jester in the court of the
womanizing Duke of Mantua was sung by Raemond Martin, an American
baritone who began in the Young Artists Studio of the Deutsche Oper
in Berlin. Martin has a pleasant lyric voice, fairly rich in its
low range, but thinner in its top notes. It was a carefully sung,
and mostly sympathetic, portrayal, but Martin did not reveal the
depths and torment of this character, driven to keep his only
child, a grown daughter, Gilda, under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Buonauro, an Italian tenor, made a dashing duke, but his
essentially bright lyric tenor voice was sometimes unsteady and
tight, especially in his high range.
</P>
<P>
   Yoko Ojima, a Japanese-born soprano who sang Gilda, must have
been gratified by her ovation from the audience. But vocally, she
seemed not up to the role. Her singing was wobbly, frequently
off-pitch, rhythmically lax and expressively neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Daniels as Gilda's nurse, Giovanna, Del-Bourree Bach as the
hired killer Sparafucile, and Alexandra Newland as the killer's
sister, Maddalena, completed the cast.
</P>
<P>
   La Selva and his orchestra players, as usual, deserve much
credit for putting this opera across. The conductor has a palpable
understanding of Verdi's style, and given the challenges of the
occasion, shaped the score with musicianly skill. For all the
pleasure this people's maestro has provided to New York opera
lovers, he must get frustrated having to perform in such impossible
conditions. But he brings them on himself with this ambitious
``Viva Verdi'' festival.
</P>
<P>
   Next Wednesday night, it's on to ``Il Trovatore,'' the last
offering of this summer's season.

`THREADS OF TIME': BROOK FINALLY GETS PERSONAL, BUT NOT
SCANDALOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Brook's career as a director is unpredictable in the
extreme. Repeatedly he has reinvented himself: as an interpreter of
Shakespeare at Stratford on Avon; as the leader of a Paris-based
experimental ensemble investigating diverse cultures and myths, and
as an explorer of the relationships between art, society and
science.
</P>
<P>
   In his illuminating new book, ``Threads of Time,'' Brook says
that the basic conflict of his life has been to resolve ``when to
cling to a conviction and when to see through it and let go.'' This
is not to suggest that he is indecisive but that he regards life _
and his life in the theater _ as a series of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous books, he has philosophized about his art, but
rarely has he written about his personal life. With ``Threads of
Time,'' he opens the door, not too wide but enough to offer a
revealing self-portrait of a man of action as well as a man of
thought, someone who disdains the mantle of guru. He begins with so
many disclaimers as to discourage the casual reader.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally omitted from the book are ``indiscretions,
indulgences, excesses.'' His aim, he says, is to weave together the
threads of his development, the roots _ and the intricate routes _
of his creative life.
</P>
<P>
   The book is less a memoir than an introspective look at an
artist's interior journey. As might be expected from someone who is
part shaman, part showman, he artfully chooses his scenes and
images, focusing on those moments and those people that have been
most consequential.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning there was his father, whom he adored, an
intellectual (and a drug manufacturer) who immigrated to England
from Latvia. The family name was Bryk in Russian, Brouck in French
and Brook at the hands of a British passport officer. His father
was a perfectionist, his mother ``hypersensitive, unhappy,
artistic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a childhood that seemed markedly free of anxiety, he and his
brother were led to believe that ``life was a cornucopia, our home
a land of security . . . a dangerous illusion, yet one that helped
to create a basis of inner security for later life.''
</P>
<P>
   His father encouraged him to be a lawyer but left him free to
choose his own course. He thought about being a diplomat, a foreign
correspondent or a secret agent. Through the magic of theater, he
managed to combine aspects of all three professions. Often probing
seemingly alien environments, he is, as he characterizes himself, a
distiller, finding the core of an experience and transmitting it to
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   As a student, he listened intently as a music teacher told him
that rhythm was the common factor in all the arts. That phrase, he
said, ``made me aware that the movement of the eye as it passes
across a painting or across the vaults and arches of a great
cathedral is related to a dancer's leaps and turns and to the pulse
of music.''
</P>
<P>
   In a crucial passage, he talks about his first toy theater and
his discovery of the treacherous field of the imagination, ``where
truths are often hard to distinguish from illusions and where both
throw shadows.'' He had to learn that ``what we call living is an
attempt to read the shadows, betrayed at every turn by what we so
easily assume to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading the shadows, he went to Oxford and made a film, running
counter to a dean who was ``the ferocious opponent of film, theater
and other decadent activities.'' For not paying a university fine,
he was expelled. To be reinstated, he had to swear that he would
never work in films or in theater, an oath he immediately broke.
One disappointment: his film career has never equaled his stage
career.
</P>
<P>
   Today the London theater is filled with directorial prodigies
(Sam Mendes, Katie Mitchell, Matthew Warchus, among others), but in
the 1940s it was ``unprecedented for a director to be very young.''
Before he was 20, Brook was directing in London and by 22 he was
director of productions at Covent Garden, where he decided that
opera singers were lamentable actors.
</P>
<P>
   He adds about audiences, ``Unaccountably, opera lovers do not
seem to be distracted by ugliness, only by the unfamiliar'' _ a
feeling that might be echoed by Robert Wilson. For a 1949
production of ``Salome'' designed by Salvador Dali, Brook was booed
off the stage and dismissed. Since then, he has never stopped being
innovative and iconoclastic.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, he reminds us that at its first preview, his
gymnastic version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' seemed to be a
total disaster. Later it came to be regarded as revolutionary. With
that production and his ``King Lear'' and ``Timon of Athens,'' he
swept aside all Shakespearean convention. With his adaptations
(such as ``The Man Who,'' based on the work of Oliver Sacks), he
begins with a clear field, transforming prose texts into original
theatrical experiences.
</P>
<P>
   His portraits of actors (especially Laurence Olivier, John
Gielgud and Paul Scofield) are invaluable, personalized cameos.
After he collided with Olivier over the film of ``The Beggar's
Opera,'' he assumed they would never work together again. Then he
found himself directing him on stage in ``Titus Andronicus'' (the
first production of Brook's that I saw), and realized that when
they were on parallel rails, they could be creative partners.
</P>
<P>
   In human terms, their relationship was always strained (Olivier
was, he says, ``a strangely hidden man''); not so with Gielgud,
whom he admires for his ``intuitive sense of quality,'' a trait
that Gielgud shares with Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his intellectualism, Brook is himself a romantic by
nature. At 12 he read ``War and Peace'' and was so enraptured by
the heroine that he vowed that he would marry a woman named Natasha
_ and he did, the actress Natasha Parry, his wife and frequent
star, most recently in London in Beckett's ``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   He closes his book with a regret that he is still not able to
articulate what has guided him over the years. ``Not knowing is not
resignation,'' he says. ``It is an opening to amazement.'' As a
young man, he was in a hurry; he thought he would die by 40. At 73,
in this book, as onstage, Brook continues his essential quest.

'THE GOVERNESS': CAPTURING IMAGES AND PASSION IN A TURBULENT
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our world is so overrun with photographic images that it's
amazing to realize that the art of photography is barely 150 years
old. Who would have thought, until it had been done, that it was
possible to capture and freeze a moment of time on a piece of
paper?
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Goldbacher's ravishingly handsome film ``The Governess''
takes us back to the spooky moment when the pioneers of photography
discovered how to create a lasting photographic image. That the
inventors in her film _ a gentleman scientist named Charles
Cavendish and his daughter's governess, Rosina da Silva (Minnie
Driver) _ are fictional characters gives her a metaphoric license
that sticking to the facts couldn't have allowed.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles and Rosina stumble on the idea of ``salt fixed''
prints (it's actually Rosina's idea, although Charles, her tutor in
photography, later takes credit for it), they are conducting a
secret, wildly passionate affair, and many of the first photographs
they take are of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The saucy Rosina poses for a series in which she plays Salome
doing the dance of the seven veils. While Charles, a skittish
Victorian Scot, is asleep, she takes a picture of him lying naked.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes of these photo sessions, in which a single eye is
shown peering feverishly through a lens, resonate long after the
film has ended, because of the poignancy with which they evoke the
difference between stop-time and real time.
</P>
<P>
   If Rosina's photograph of the naked Charles will last forever,
his tempestuous passion for her is evanescent and fraught with
guilt and betrayal. Because the cinematography of ``The Governess''
is so richly panoramic, the movie forces you to contemplate the
emotional power exerted by film, which is, after all just a series
of flickering photographic images flashed on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about trusting the truth of the frozen image in a
universe of ceaseless change aren't the only ideas that the movie
tosses around with the same spirited abandon exhibited by its
central character, Rosina.
</P>
<P>
   A rebellious life-hungry sensualist, Rosina grows up in an
affluent Sephardic Jewish household in London. Her world suddenly
shatters in the early 1840s when her father, a successful fish
merchant, is murdered on the street and the family is plunged into
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting an arranged marriage with an older man, Rosina
determines to disguise her Jewishness (the movie makes much of
virulent anti-Semitism in her world), and find a job. Posing as
Mary Blackchurch, a Protestant of partly Italian descent, she takes
a job as a governess to the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish
island.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rosina carries off the charade, the movie makes a major
point of showing the gap between 19th-century Christian and Jewish
cultures. Rosina may be a rebel, but she remains unshakably rooted
to her Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamy flashbacks in which she hungers for the life she left
behind are steeped in Jewish ritual and chant, and she secretly
continues to observe Passover. At the same time, she must observe
Christian rituals in the Cavendish family chapel.
</P>
<P>
   But it is her affair with the head of the household that reveals
the most profound and painful differences between the two
traditions. Where Charles rails about sin and hellfire and being
``consumed'' by his passion, Rosina pursues their relationship with
free-spirited determination.
</P>
<P>
   She has little comprehension of what Charles is going through
and not much sympathy. Were Charles to learn she was Jewish, he
would probably denounce her as a witch. Although Ms. Goldbacher is
sympathetic to both characters, she is clearly on the side of
Rosina, who emerges as a proto-feminist hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governess'' is a wonderful showcase for Ms. Driver, whose
Rosina is a complicated, intimidating character. She pursues an
adulterous affair with the same stubborn feistiness she shows in
her dealings with Clementina (Florence Hoath), the mischievous,
morbidly inclined little monster in her charge.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Driver's performance is strong, it is less than great,
because her face lacks the transparency of expression that would
transport us inside her character's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wilkinson's Charles is a harrowingly effective portrait of a
guarded, puritanical man swept off his feet and nearly unstrung by
a passion he resists with all his will. Harriet Walter is equally
impressive as his idle, snobbish wife who wonders out loud in a
sweetly curdled voice if it's possible to die of disappointment and
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rhys Meyers is touching as the Cavendish's emotionally
unstable son, Henry, who develops an obsessive infatuation with
Rosina.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes some missteps. Rosina's ability to support her
family in luxurious style from her earnings as a governess is
implausible. The screenplay includes some glaring lapses into
contemporary slang. And dramatically, the movie peters out in its
disappointingly perfunctory final scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Governess,'' which opens Friday in New York City,
still leaves a lasting after-image. &QL;

`WAR AND CIVILIZATION:' BATTLES AND BLOODSHED OVER MILLENNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Keegan, the popular British military historian, lends
scholarship to ``War and Civilization,'' the eight-part history of
mayhem that begins Sunday at 9 p.m. on the Learning Channel. Walter
Cronkite, America's narrator for all occasions, lends his
portentous baritone. And the producers lay on plenty of effects _
smoke, bodies, slow motion, fleeting images _ intended to represent
the most momentous clashes of the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a busy mix of lecture room and legend, costume
drama and technical information, carries us from the Greek city
states to the Chinese empire, from the fall of Rome to the fall of
Constantinople, from the English civil war to the American Civil
War, from World War I to Hiroshima, right up to yesterday's carnage
in Rwanda and Bosnia, with many other cruel stops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Attention is steadily directed at innovations of weaponry,
tactics, logistics and other elements that have accounted for
triumph by slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's opening hour pays a mixed tribute to the Greeks of
3,000 years ago, crediting that fount of democracy with creating a
``Western way of war,'' which was ``deadly and decisive.'' You will
learn about the effectiveness of the armor that the hoplites, or
yeoman farmers, wore (about 70 pounds each) and the power of their
massed phalanxes. Military analysis helps explain the Greek
strategy on land and sea that turned back the Persians at the
battles that Herodotus made famous.
</P>
<P>
   The particular attraction of the series lies in the details,
how, for example, Philip of Macedon's shifts to longer spears and
smaller shields, along with the addition of horsemen and archers,
made his standing army the most formidable of their time. His son
and heir, Alexander the Great, whose empire covered all of the
known world, is crowned the ``father of modern logistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent episodes give credit to the horse, which bore Attila
and Genghis Khan into Europe and China; to the long bow, which, in
the 14th century, enabled the British to topple the French knights
in their bulky armor; to the gunpowder that blasted away notions of
gallantry along with castle walls; to the arrival of the tank and
the airplane and, yes, to the sudden appearance of nuclear weapons,
which were heralded as changing everything but have not in fact
done much to stop nationalist, ethnic, religious and tribal clashes
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite's script poses the question, ``Can there be a future
without war?'' Perhaps influenced by the Cold War's resolution
without cataclysm, Keegan is mildly optimistic. He notes that with
the cost of all-out war now so high, both in blood and treasure,
the world's great armies have perforce become peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller forces keep busy. Since World War II, we are
reminded, most war casualties have been inflicted by second-hand
small arms, notably the Kalashnikov assault rifle, which even
impoverished nations can afford.
</P>
<P>
   With due regard for the many technical and tactical achievements
recorded here that have transformed warfare through the ages, every
day's headlines confirm that old-fashioned hatred is still managing
to cause misery and crush hope around the globe.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Running times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ARMAGEDDON,' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and
Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This
big, showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a
single heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a
strip club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid)
becomes the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and
a notion of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real
courage. Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason
that he probably got the set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries
gamely to seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window-dressing
at NASA headquarters. Totally predictable elements _ loud noises,
frequent explosions and bright computer-screen colors _ seem as
inevitable and deadly as the asteroid while they create the
illusion of escapist fun (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CITY OF ANGELS,' starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Directed
by Brad Silberling (PG-13, 112 minutes). An empty Hollywood remake
of ``Wings of Desire,'' Wim Wenders' poetic 1987 cult favorite,
``City of Angels'' wants to be a blockbuster sobfest in the
supernatural romantic tradition of ``Heaven Can Wait,'' ``Ghost''
and ``Titanic.'' But the ingredients don't gel. Cage is the droopy
sad-sack angel who falls in love with Ms. Ryan's perky, bike-riding
Los Angeles cardiologist and tumbles out of heaven just to be with
her. Unfortunately, Cage looks more like a serial killer (or a
sinister cult leader) than an angel, and he and Ms. Ryan lack
romantic chemistry. The screenplay's watered-down New Age cliches
are illustrated by cinematography that lends the California
settings the shallow gloss of a shampoo commercial (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DR. DOLITTLE,' starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty Thomas
(PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the animals,
they pile on the back talk, thanks to the stellar cast of vocal
talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John
Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Murphy plays
straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film
is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than
``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Murphy's understated
timing but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from the
animal cast (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EVEREST,' directed by David Brashears with Greg MacGillivray
(not rated; 45 minutes). Images of the world's highest mountain _
29,028 feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the 8-story-high, 100-foot-wide IMAX screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever-shifting ice, thundering
avalanches, the perils of air so thin that it addles the brain, and
sudden, blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain,
as many articles and books were later to relate, other teams made
their way into the so-called death zone, at 25,000 feet, where a
violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the worst
single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it possible for
armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of their climb
toward heaven (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE WITH THE WIND,' starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia
de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by Victor
Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life left
in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's
romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never existed) just
before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great film but a
satisfying one. The performances by Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable and
Hattie McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in the
meticulous physical production. The movie shows its age most
unfortunately in the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints,
which, though new, go sort of pinkish more often than they should
(Vincent Canby).
</P>
<P>
   `HENRY FOOL,' starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool
(Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim
(Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH ART,' starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Directed by
Lisa Cholodenko (R, 96 minutes). Ms. Sheedy gives a fierce, tricky
performance in the role of a once-celebrated photographer, spooked
by fame, who long ago retreated from the art world to live a
reclusive, druggy life among lesbian friends. This steamily intense
story follows her spider-fly relationship with Ms. Mitchell's
bright-eyed, ambitious ingenue, who works for a desperately stylish
photography magazine. Ms. Cholodenko's seductive, powerfully
atmospheric first feature explores their relationship with
intelligence and avidity. But it sacrifices any hope of raw edges
and real emotion to its own chic sensibility, which proves so
studiously alluring that it overwhelms the story. Patricia Clarkson
does a scene-stealing turn as Ms. Sheedy's lover, a glamorously
decadent German actress who never got past the Fassbinder years
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LETHAL WEAPON 4,' starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Rene
Russo. Directed by Richard Donner (R, 125 minutes). In the full
perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, this turns out
to be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around. The characters are
funny and likable, and they all live on Earth. The formula still
has some zip. The stars, with the welcome new addition of Chris
Rock as a young detective who has married into the ``Lethal
Weapon'' family, play their roles with breezy finesse. And the
story, about slave smuggling and Chinese gangsters, is a
flamboyant, fight-filled adventure fueled by kidding camaraderie
and constant forward motion. Bear in mind that this is still a film
whose idea of high drama is watching a car get pushed in front of
an oncoming train (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `MAFIA!,' starring Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges and Christina
Applegate. Directed by Jim Abrahams (PG-13, 86 minutes). This
sendup makes an offer you could probably refuse, but its
Mad-magazine-style hit-or-miss humor works well enough to be
reasonably bright. It's true, though, that a Mafia movie satire
without a single horse's head in a bed and without anyone who
sounds like Joe Pesci has left a few stones unturned. Concentrating
mostly on the ``Godfather'' films and ``Casino,'' Abrahams throws
in anything from canned meatballs by Spalding to vomit gags. Lloyd
Bridges, to whose memory the film is dedicated, has the role of a
dapper Don and shows one last time how sporting and debonair he
could be (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MASK OF ZORRO,' starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins
and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell (PG-13, 130
minutes). Travel back to the days when swashbuckling was serious
business, when boyish adventure films still had their innocence and
when the bravado of thrilling stunt work was all a movie needed in
the way of special effects. Hopkins is marvelously game as the
film's dashing senior Zorro. Banderas was born to play the aging
hero's jokey, hot-blooded protege. And he meets his match in the
story's heroine, whose beauty is inevitably described as ``beyond
compare.'' This robust old-fashioned adventure should appeal to
older children, but beware of a few needlessly grisly touches
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MULAN,' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B.D.
Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes).
Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping
in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but
also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This
is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films,
right down to the clowning sidekicks, would-be ``Under the Sea''
production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine
(``When will my reflection show who I am inside?''). Murphy's very
funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon
entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as
a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more
often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE NEGOTIATOR,' starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.
Directed by F. Gary Gray (R, 115 minutes). In a twist on the
Hitchcockian maxim, this thriller takes two extraordinary actors
and places them in surprisingly ordinary circumstances. In a film
whose title should have been plural, both stars play seasoned
hostage negotiators who are caught up in a by-the-numbers battle of
wits. Amazingly, both these shrewd, maverick actors are cast as
nice guys, team players and clean-cut family men. The movie's
brisk, familiar look of a police story, heavy with close-ups, that
escalates to a paramilitary operation will look right at home when
it comes to the video screen (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,' starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated, 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,' starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan,
Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes).
Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy
finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little
Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil twin.
Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and
announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold.
Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers
preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUT OF SIGHT,' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PARENT TRAP,' starring Lindsay Lohan, Natasha Richardson
and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Nancy Meyers and written by David
Swift, Ms. Meyers and Charles Shyer (PG, 128 minutes). A super-cute
remake of the old Hayley Mills hit, this time given a privileged
shelter-magazine gloss by the ``Father of the Bride'' team of Ms.
Meyers and Shyer. Ms. Richardson and Quaid beam appealingly as
parents who somehow managed to separate their twins at birth
without a twinge of guilt, and who seem to have spent all of the
intervening 11{ years shopping. In her dual role as English and
American sisters (one lives in a grand London town house; one lives
on a big Napa Valley vineyard; nobody lives in a coal mine), the
spirited Ms. Lohan commandeers the movie as if she had been taking
shy-violet lessons from Sharon Stone (Maslin).

UNION LOBBYING OF CITY GOES UNREPORTED DESPITE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The interest group considered to be the
strongest and most effective at getting its way at City Hall,
organized labor, doesn't disclose its lobbying of city officials,
despite a decade-old law aimed at eliminating back-room
deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   Union influence on policy under Mayor Willie Brown is on the
rise and labor representatives have been particularly busy
advocates this year on health care legislation, the city budget and
on proposed rules for municipal contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But labor has never filed the quarterly disclosures required of
all paid advocates, businesses and organizations under San
Francisco's 1988 lobbyist disclosure ordinance, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Vida, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said
notices would be sent to the unions advising them that if they meet
the threshold of lobbying activity that triggers the ordinance,
``they need to register and report.''
</P>
<P>
   The required reports identify who is lobbying and on whose
behalf; how much they are being paid for the work; the names of the
city officials with whom they are meeting; and the topics they
discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are a way for the public to track the efforts of
interest groups to influence public policy and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of unions to register and report their lobbying
activity came to the attention of Ethics Commission staff members
recently as they prepared a series of amendments to the disclosure
law.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's belated attempt to force compliance by the
unions, particularly the Service Employees International Union, the
city's largest, has already sparked controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives contend they were unaware the measure
applied to them. They also argue it is wrong to lump them in with
lobbyists for corporate interests, whose influence in City Hall
provided the original impetus for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boileau, vice president of the San Francisco Labor Council,
said the unions already disclose plenty of their political activity
by complying with state and local laws on reporting of campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the unions would resist city efforts to force them to
make similar disclosures under the lobbying ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists who regularly report their activities and elected
officials who have been critical of union influence at City Hall
disagreed with Boileau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I took office in 1993,'' said Board of Supervisors
President Barbara Kaufman, ``the unions have been the strongest
lobbying force and the most effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they should be treated any different from
private developers or other advocacy groups. They are very good at
what they do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got more money on the line than any other single
interest group,'' said Mark Mosher, of the Committee on Jobs, an
association of the city's biggest corporate employers.
</P>
<P>
   Activity directly tied to contract negotiations or matters
pertaining to workplace issues and grievance procedures are
exempted from the lobbying issue, according to a 1993 report from
the city attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   But if a union ``communicates with city officials for the
purpose of influencing legislative or administrative actions...,''
wrote Deputy City Attorney Randy Riddle, ``the organization is a
lobbyist within the meaning of the ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   Disclosures are due quarterly, and a $1,000 fine could be levied
for each violation.

 UNDATED: Sharon Stone (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed
by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning
back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he
works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it
had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are
frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who
made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet
has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks
continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the
casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SMALL SOLDIERS,' starring Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Dennis
Leary and Phil Hartman. Directed by Joe Dante (PG-13, 105 minutes).
This ably animated film about action-figure toys who virtually come
to life should have been a sure thing. There are innocent echoes of
``Toy Story'' and darker ones of the director's own ``Gremlins''
pictures, which had the witty balance of mischief and horror that
``Small Soldiers'' strangely lacks. The voice talent here is
extraordinary, with the casts of ``The Dirty Dozen'' and ``This Is
Spinal Tap'' playing rival toy factions, and Tommy Lee Jones and
Frank Langella as their respective commanders. But the story
remains unfocused and grows too wan for horror, too creepy for
lighthearted fun. Another reason not to laugh is Hartman's
performance in the fatuous role that was his last (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SPANISH PRISONER,' starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Written and directed by
David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's
cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security
check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for
reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: the mystery
here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate
con game, stays tricky to the very end. Scott plays the inventor of
a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss
who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast
working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays
a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his
pretty young sister. In her performance as a pert, unaccountably
off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's
sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITANIC,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Gloria
Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For once, a
much-touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious throwback to
the days when epic storytelling really filled the screen. Despite
the astonishing technological advances behind Cameron's great
visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the
film's central illusion, that the audience is drawn back into the
Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all
its painstaking historical detail, this ``Titanic'' proves anything
but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and
the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose
romance is skillfully interwoven with historical detail, Ms.
Winslet and DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his
``Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Cameron dared to dream of
the impossible and came up with the movie of the year (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TRUMAN SHOW,' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG,
104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and
cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top,
but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie
fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate
edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).

   `LOOKING BACK, MOVING ON: CELEBRATING PHILIPPINE CINEMA.' In
observance of the 100th anniversary of the independence of the
Philippines from Spain, the Film Society of Lincoln Center Friday
begins a three-week survey of classic and contemporary Philippine
filmmaking. The series of 28 films, subtitled in English, opens
Friday with Marilou Diaz-Abaya's ``Rizal'' (1998), about the
19th-century author, poet, physician and nationalist Jose Rizal,
whose martyrdom inspired a rebellion against Spanish rule. The
series includes Cesar Gallardo's ``Gerry the Tramp'' (1964),
starring Joseph Estrada, now president of the Philippines, as an
illiterate man of unknown parentage who becomes a champion of the
downtrodden. Among other directors represented in the series is
Lino Brocka, who opposed the censorship of the Marcos dictatorship,
achieved international renown and helped to reinvigorate the
Philippine film industry in a 20-year career that began in the
1970's. The series continues through Aug. 20 at the Walter Reade
Theater, at New York's Lincoln Center. Admission: $8.50; $5 for
Film Society members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees.

STATE ETHICS RULES WOULD HAMPER FEDERAL PROSECUTORS, FISHER SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pending legislation to hold federal attorneys to
various state ethics rules rather than one national standard would
make it impossible to prosecute terrorists, telemarketers and child
abusers, a Justice Department spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Attorney General Ray Fisher said prosecutors would be
severely hampered making cases against criminals who operate in
several states if they had to meet ``a haphazard patchwork of 50
sets of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Clever defense lawyers could ``throw up roadblocks'' to
prosecutions by claiming Justice Department attorneys violated a
state ethics rule during a nationwide investigation of illicit
conduct, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects of this provision could be disastrous,'' Fisher
said, noting that department lawyers often appear in more than 10
states annually. ``Quite simply, it might prevent federal
prosecutors from bringing some of our most important multistate
cases, such as those involving large-scale conspiracies,
telemarketing fraud, child sexual abuse, exploitation on the
Internet and terrorist attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial measure would create a seven-member
``Misconduct Review Board'' to review allegations of misbehavior by
Justice Department attorneys. The president would appoint the
panel's three voting members, and congressional leaders would name
the board's four advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The panel could subpoena information about an attorney's
conduct, including documents from a criminal investigation. The
board also could impose punishment, including the attorney's
dismissal, and refer the lawyer for criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the panel, ostensibly designed to rein in
overzealous prosecutors, could undermine even the most ethical of
prosecutions, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board would be able to intervene in a case on the basis of
vague allegations against department attorneys and would enable the
targets of investigations and their attorneys to obtain access to
all of the evidence obtained by the government, including the
identities of potential witnesses or confidential informants,''
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Pa., the measure's chief
sponsor, objected to Fisher's assessment. Calling the controversial
ethics provision ``very important,'' Jake O'Donnell said the
Justice Department's internal system for disciplining its lawyers
does not provide an adequate check on prosecutors' misconduct and
that an oversight panel would be a better safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   McDade's measure is part of a bill the House will consider next
week to provide $18.3 billion to the Justice Department for fiscal
year 1999, which begins Oct. 1. A Senate-passed measure to give
$17.8 billion to the department does not contain the controversial
provision.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno's opposition is so strong she would
take the unusual step of urging President Clinton to veto
legislation to fund her agency if the funding bill contains the
ethics measure, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is truly unnecessary,'' he said, noting that
federal lawyers who act unethically are already subject to
discipline from U.S. judges and the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility. ``We recognize the need for mechanisms
to deal with the occasional misconduct when it occurs, but this
proposal is fatally flawed,'' Fisher said. &QL;

`KILLER CONDOM': DEPAN HUMOR COMBINES WITH A FIXATION ON BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinematically speaking, it's a difficult summer for the male
reproductive organs. First there was that poor fellow in ``There's
Something About Mary'' and his difficulty with his tuxedo trouser
zipper on prom night.
</P>
<P>
   Now to make matters worse, there are the little creatures with
mouths like lampreys, teeth like sharks and an insatiable appetite
for men's external sexual parts and the occasional nose (sex no
barrier).
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters even worse, these creatures are on the loose
in New York in the guise of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these are the chirping, jabbering, bouncing little monsters
that give ``Killer Condom'' its title.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a Troma Entertainment release, but it is one with a
difference. ``Killer Condom'' is actually an import from Germany
with a level of deadpan humor considerably above the company's
usual adolescent subnorm. ``Killer Condom'' is gory, its fixation
on blood and severed flesh is in keeping with its subject.
</P>
<P>
   That this German-language film with English subtitles also deals
with dislocation, urban anomie, love and tolerance is among its
assets, as are its fun with movies like ``Psycho'' and its mockery
of American politicians who preach moral values while practicing
familiar vices.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the film is a flaccid detective story that
after far too long dredges up a standard-issue eccentric old
scientist and a flipped-out female physician with a bad case of
religious fanaticism to explain its mystery.
</P>
<P>
   At the tender heart and deranged mind of ``Killer Condom''
stands Luigi Mackeroni, a New York police detective played with
unwavering seriousness by Udo Samel, who is a sort of Teutonic Bob
Hoskins. Uprooted from his native Sicily, cynical about love,
unreformed in his devotion to cigarettes, comfortable in the
demimonde of the pre-Disney Times Square, Mackeroni is unashamedly
gay.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the film, a male college professor who has
lured a female student from Oklahoma to the aptly named Hotel
Quickie, where he intends to persuade her to exchange sex for an
improved grade, becomes the first victim of a voracious condom
provided gratis with the room.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, no one believes that such a creature could exist, but
when Mackeroni takes a young hustler named Billy (Marc Richter) to
one of the Quickie's rooms, he, too, becomes impaired but by no
means permanently disabled in an attack.
</P>
<P>
   As in all such movies, Mackeroni's straight partner and his
superior remain skeptical about the condoms until too late, and
eventually Mackeroni has to threaten to go it alone. Meanwhile,
Mackeroni is dealing with his conflicted feelings about Billy, his
yearning for Sicily and the overtures of Babette (Leonard Lansink),
a transsexual chanteuse at the Hotel Quickie who used to be a
colleague named Bob.
</P>
<P>
   The film is directed by Martin Walz, who wrote the screenplay
with Ralf Koenig, based on one of Koenig's comic books. They're far
out and sometimes dead on.

`LOLITA': REVISITING A DANGEROUS OBSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review. Broadcast
time is for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(th) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a screenwriter, Vladimir Nabokov was a great novelist. Mere
traces of his awkward, overlong screenplay for ``Lolita'' are
evident in Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film (bizarre and dated in its
own right), but the script survives in published form.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his least cinematic touches, Nabokov envisioned an
on-camera prologue featuring Dr. John Ray Jr., the tongue-in-cheek
character who framed the novel, a psychiatrist purporting to have
edited Humbert Humbert's memoir about his affair with a 12-year-old
nymphet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention to glorify Humbert,'' Ray explained. ``He
is horrible, he is abject. He is a shining example of moral
leprosy.'' True, but on screen the speech would have seemed a
clumsy attempt to disarm the anti-``Lolita'' camp, then as now a
small, literal-minded but vocal group.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ray's monologue soon becomes telling. While no version of
``Lolita'' has ever justified Humbert's actions, in his screenplay
Nabokov eloquently justifies our interest in this pedophile:
``There are in his story depths of passion and suffering, patterns
of tenderness and distress, that cannot be dismissed by his
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   That line expresses the soul of ``Lolita,'' both the novel and
Adrian Lyne's entrancing, heartbreaking film. This embattled movie
is no longer quite new, of course, having been rejected by nearly
every American distributor over the last year for several reasons:
because the film was too expensive; for fear of a backlash because
of the subject of pedophilia; for a combination of both.
</P>
<P>
   It will finally have its national premiere, uncut, on Sunday on
Showtime (after a recent weeklong run in one Los Angeles theater to
qualify for Academy Award nominations).
</P>
<P>
   Visually and emotionally, ``Lolita'' survives its journey to the
small screen with its power surprisingly intact. The film's master
stroke is its understanding that this is Humbert's story, told in
his own lyrical voice, from his own passionate, sad, tortured
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   As Humbert, Jeremy Irons creates one of the great, fearless
screen performances. His face registers the astonishing complexity
of Humbert's inner life. He is calculating, romantic, eventually
soul-sick with his own love. His voice-overs, taken from the novel,
resonate with Nabokov's poetry and with the conscience-stricken
tone of Humbert's backward look.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Irons never metaphorically winks at the audience
to hint that he knows better than Humbert. He seems to know exactly
what Humbert knows, with all the discomforting truths that
involves. It is an immensely seductive performance, but one whose
seductions are never on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne (whose commercial hits include ``Fatal Attraction'' and
``Indecent Proposal'') was expected to have made a titillating
``Lolita.'' Instead, he has risen to the level of his material. His
direction, and Stephen Schiff's discerning, faithful screenplay,
are sensitive to Nabokov's wit as well as his lyricism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of ``Lolita'' is Humbert's long flashback, and he quickly
reveals the source of his obsession with pubescent girls. In an
appropriately gauzy-looking episode, he recalls Cannes in 1921. The
14-year-old Humbert (Ben Silverstone) loves a girl named Annabel
Leigh (Emma Griffiths-Malin), who dies and stands forever frozen as
the embodiment of his ideal woman.
</P>
<P>
   He does not find her equal until he arrives in the New England
town of Ramsdale in 1947 and meets Lolita when he rents a room from
her mother, Charlotte. Melanie Griffith is ideally cast as the
annoying, widowed Charlotte. With her garish red nails, her
screeching voice, her affected diction, Charlotte seems unbearable
to the professorial Humbert. He will eventually marry her to be
near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Swain is extraordinary as Lolita. She is within sight
of womanhood yet remains, definitely, a schoolgirl. With braids and
saddle shoes, she is long-limbed, petulant and wisecracking, always
chewing gum, tossing jawbreakers around in her mouth, teasing
Humbert.
</P>
<P>
   There are flashes of seduction from Lolita that are,
intentionally, hard to distinguish from a schoolgirl crush (the
better for Humbert to misinterpret). Ms. Swain walks this
incredibly narrow line between innocent playfulness and adult
knowledge without a misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overall sadness of the tale, moments of mordant
humor undercut Humbert's romantic excess. When he first sets eyes
on Lolita, sunbathing on the lawn, her sheer dress soaked through
by the sprinkler, his heart stops. She smiles and reveals her
retainer.
</P>
<P>
   She wanders into his study one day and sits on his lap. She
looks into his eyes and after an uneasy pause asks, ``Am I getting
a zit?''
</P>
<P>
   After Charlotte's accidental death, Humbert and Lolita take off
on a long road trip and begin their sexual affair. On their first
night, at the Enchanted Hunters Hotel, Lolita suggests a game she
played with a boy at summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   She whispers in Humbert's ear. She says out loud, ``I guess I'm
going to have to show you everything,'' as she unties his pajama
bottoms. The screen fades to black, and we hear Humbert's
retrospective voice saying, ``Gentlewomen of the jury, I was not
even her first lover.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is true or not, he takes vile advantage of a child.
And though it will be a long while before he admits this, the film
does so at once. Throughout, the erotic scenes are more suggestive
than explicit, but are always fraught with this sense of Lolita's
corrupted innocence.
</P>
<P>
   As she gains experience, there are many chilling set pieces.
Lolita puts her hand on Humbert's thigh. ``You know how my
allowance is a dollar a week?'' she asks. ``Well, I think it should
be two.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scenes in which she howls with misery. Eventually, she
shrieks, ``Murder me, like you murdered my mother.'' Humbert
remains besotted, desperate not to lose her.
</P>
<P>
   The film is so faithful to the novel that it shares similar
flaws. After a stay at Beardsley College, Humbert and Lolita go
back on the road and the story flags. And though Frank Langella is
effectively sinister as Clare Quilty, who lures Lolita from
Humbert, the Grand Guignol scene of his murder belongs in another
film (and another novel).
</P>
<P>
   The stunning opening scene, with a bloodied Humbert driving on a
desolate country road, seems diminished on a small screen.
Otherwise, Howard Atherton's exquisite photography shines through:
the faded beauty of Cannes, the piercing clarity of the small
towns, the midnight-blue shadows of a rainy night. Ennio
Morricone's haunting music reinforces Humbert's lyrical
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Rich beyond what anyone could have expected, the film repays
repeated viewings. (Soon it will appear on theater screens as well.
Samuel Goldwyn Co. will release the movie in New York and Los
Angeles on Sept. 25 and in other cities through October.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Lolita'' is a tragic morality tale and a poignant
character study. Humbert calls himself ``an artist, a madman.''
Lyne's film echoes Nabokov's transforming vision: it turns
Humbert's madness into art.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will be heavy for a time from eastern
New England to northern Middle Atlantic coast, particularly Friday
morning, as a disturbance skirts the coast. However, skies will
brighten by late Friday afternoon as the low moves quickly out to
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be mixed with cumulus clouds across the interior
Northeast and eastern Ohio Valley, as a cool, dry air mass arrives.
Daytime highs will be close to normal, though nights will be cool
for the season. Meanwhile, high pressure, marking the center of the
refreshing air mass, will sponsor ample sun across the Great Lakes
states.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will percolate near a stalling cold
front from the southern Middle Atlantic states to the southern
Plains. Some storms will be locally heavy, though a significant
outbreak of severe weather is highly unlikely. Meanwhile, scattered
thundershowers will erupt near the eastern Gulf coast where cooler
air from sea breezes penetrate inland.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon thunderstorms will develop over the Rockies in
response to a persistent monsoon circulation. The Northwest will be
much cooler than recent days, while clouds and fog linger much of
the day at the coast. California will be sunny and seasonable,
though the day will dawn with fog and low clouds at the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Alex strengthened Thursday, as thunderstorms
increased in both number and intensity near the storm's center.
Further strengthening is expected Friday, as Tropical Storm Alex
continues to churn westward east of the Lesser Antilles.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hot Houston
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures soared to 100 degrees at Houston on Wednesday,
marking the 11th time this month with triple-digit readings. The
total represents Houston's second greatest number of 100-degree
days in July since records began. The number of 100-degree days for
the summer rose to 13, third on the all-time list behind the record
31 days in 1980. Temperatures of 100 degrees are not common in
Houston, given the clockwork afternoon cumulus and storms that
billow in conjunction with sultry winds from the Gulf of Mexico.
But steadfast high pressure aloft has suppressed clouds this month.

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    At a firemen's convention the fire chiefs told stories about
their men's heroism. Afterward, a veteran fireman asked, ``Why are
we spending all our time running to put out fires, when we should
be looking for the arsonist who is starting them?''
 &HT;    Sure enough, an investigation led to an arsonist, and the fires
abated.
 &HT;    This story comes to mind when I think about how people deal with
their emotional needs. Some are always busy putting out emotional
fires while others search for the cause, thus not allowing the
fires to start.
 &HT;    By looking inward, we can live emotionally healthier and happier
lives.
 &HT;    But for many, adventure seems to be the tool for measuring
emotional health and happiness.
 &HT;    Let's look at some of the ways society enlists the help of the
arts to portray happiness.
 &HT;    I had a teacher who said, ``If you want to know what people are
thinking about, check the best-seller list.'' When reviewing
current best-sellers, we find many books that are sad.
 &HT;    ``Angela's Ashes'' has been on the list for 86 weeks. It is a
memoir of misery -- family neglect, childhood suffering and total
abuse.
 &HT;    I prefer a best-seller that is down to earth, dealing with
reality and attainable goals for fulfillment. For me the Bible has
reality and wonderful goals. It has been on the best-seller list
for centuries. It has plenty of adventure but no fantasy.
 &HT;    Let's see what society offers in the way of adventure. If you
have a couple thousand dollars and you don't mind possibly dying,
you can try climbing Mt. McKinley. It's a most exciting trek but 91
climbers have died since 1932.
 &HT;    If you do come back alive and your fellow climber doesn't, you
can get a book out of it. If you are stranded on the mountain and
resort to cannibalism, it might even mean a movie. At this time
there is a waiting list to challenge the mountain.
 &HT;    What else does society offer in entertainment? We have at least
three films depicting how Mother Earth is going to pieces. Whether
it is ``Godzilla,'' the fearful monster tearing up New York City,
or ``Deep Impact,'' with a threat from asteroids, they don't come
close to the newest film, ``Armageddon.'' There Bruce Willis and
his boys save the world.
 &HT;    Sadly, Willis finds it easier to save the earth than his
marriage to Demi Moore.
 &HT;    What may be happening to society is the refusal to look at
ourselves and take responsibility for our actions. After all, it is
not easy to recognize and correct personal limitations and
obligations.
 &HT;    Instead, we continue to search for new and exciting things to
do. By dealing with fantasies we deflect the real self.
 &HT;    We do so by reading books of sorrow, or viewing movies of saving
the world or by climbing mountains. We deny ourselves the
inevitable fact that we are responsible for our deeds and when we
act responsibly, we really feel good.
 &HT;    In the fantasy world we put our true feelings on hold. It's more
exciting to go to the theater and see Bruce Willis save the world.
 &HT;    That is much easier than coming home to face your family and
save your marriage. But easier is not always better.
 &HT;    A story is told about a sad, sad king. All the physicians had
despaired of curing him. As a last resort the healer offered him a
remedy: If the king would put on the shirt of a person who was
absolutely happy, then the king would be healed.
 &HT;    Riders were dispatched all over the country to look for a person
who was absolutely happy and bring back the shirt to the king.
 &HT;    First they went to the richest person in the country. They asked
him, ``Are you happy?'' He answered: ``Of course. I am the richest
person in the country.''
 &HT;    ``But are you absolutely happy?'' He began to hesitate.
``Absolute is a difficult term. I always have to protect my
position. I've had a setback or two recently ...''
 &HT;    The messengers left him in the middle of his thoughts. Then they
met the country's leading educational figure. ``Are you happy?''
they asked him. ``Yes,'' he answered.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely happy?'' And there he began to hem and haw.
 &HT;    On their way home they heard a joyous melody. A person was
singing freely, and they sensed that he was really happy. They saw
a drunken man, reeling back and forth with a huge smile on his
face. ``Are you happy?'' they asked him. ``I am the happiest person
in the world,'' he answered.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely happy?'' ``Yes. I have not a care on my mind.''
``Sir, we need your shirt. The king is sick, but the healer said
that if he puts on the shirt of a happy man, he will be healed.
Lend us your shirt for a short while. We promise that you will be
amply rewarded.''
 &HT;    The man replied, ``I would be happy to help the king, and I do
not need his rewards. But there is one problem. I do not own a
shirt.'' In his pursuit of happiness he had lost his family,
friends and all his possessions.
 &HT;    That man's happiness was not what the king needed. I believe
that a person who wants to be happy and fulfilled must be ready to
give up something.
 &HT;    The Jewish sage Ben Zoma had a saying, ``Who is rich? He who is
happy with his lot.'' One must recognize when fantasy becomes
destructive. By escaping into fantasies, we fool ourselves. We need
to be in touch with the real self.
 &HT;    As in the king's story, one needs to recognize that you cannot
have it all and be happy all the time. Remember, by chasing your
fantasy -- you may lose more than your shirt.

 &HT;    Raunchy comic Carrington `bad boy of Nashville'
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- HBO wants to talk about a sitcom. Album
sales are climbing. Comedy club gigs have him rolling in the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Carrington can feel it. He's on the verge of something
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel a rumble,'' says Carrington, who brings his act to
the Comedy Corner in West Palm Beach the next two weekends. ``I
just need that one big thing to push me over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a plan,'' he says with a mischievous smirk. ``I want a
million people to like me and pay me $10 a year for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he probably won't get paradise in an installment plan.
But it might not take that much for Carrington to be comedy's next
big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years of touring have built a loyal following for the
28-year-old married father of two boys from Tulsa, Okla. Comedy
club audiences are now shouting requests for their favorite bits of
his raunchy brand of guitar-slingin', good ol' boy humor. Millions
have heard him perform songs during regular spots on radio's
syndicated Bob and Tom Show. He's done segments on A&AMP;E's Evening at
the Improv and NBC's Friday Night Videos. And his new album,
Hangin' With Rodney, has sold almost 20,000 copies in less than two
months _ impressive numbers for any debut comedy album that doesn't
have a huge promotional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, since at least half of his best material is strictly
for adults. Jokes about bodily functions, anatomically correct
snowmen, sexually transmitted diseases. That sort of thing. This
ain't your father's Jeff Foxworthy or Jerry Clower album. Think
instead of a raw, countryfied Redd Foxx in a cowboy hat and a Texas
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington does have less raunchy material, but even then it
tends to be hilariously scatological. Such as this bit about his
infrequent churchgoing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with going to church once a year is you got all
those righteous people who go every day lookin' at you like, `What
are you doing here? Feeling guilty about something? You can't just
make it up in one day!' Get off my case, lady, I'm just here for
the wine and bread, for god sakes. And the preacher, he always
wants to point you out, don't he? (As the preacher) `WE GOT SOME
NEW PEOPLE HERE TODAY WITH US!' We ain't new, mister, we were here
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a little dismayed about the parental advisory sticker on
the front of the CD. The way he figures it, the stuff he talks
about is the way most people think but rarely speak of in mixed
company. You can hear audible gasps on the album at the beginning,
before audience members buy into the concept. He dutifully chides
them: ``Comedy club, chuckle chuckle, y'all. Don't get all bent out
of shape!'' It helps break the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you don't offend people in some shape or form, you
haven't really done your job or your aren't doing it right,''
Carrington said. ``I like a little shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nashville never had an album with a (parental advisory)
sticker on it,'' Carrington says. ``Country music and Nashville are
about family values, but behind the scenes those people are as
regular as I am. My humor is what makes me laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been those who have advised Carrington to tone
it down in order to make the big push into TV and widespread
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to clean it up,'' he said. ``I want to do what it
is that I do. If I become known as the bad boy of comedy in
Nashville, well, I'm not sure I want that, but if so, so be it.''

 &HT;    Student pilot pursues dream: Flying for Jesus
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLa. -- Harold Martin wants to be a missionary,
but he says he can't preach.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Hobe Sound resident plans to be a bush pilot for God.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 23, dreams of flying small, single-engine planes to
nearly inaccessible areas in forgotten parts of the world to serve
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to landing on make-shift airstrips in
unpredictable weather to bring Bibles, medicine and supplies to
missionaries in the field.
</P>
<P>
   He wants his plane to be an air ambulance when someone is sick,
a water wagon in times of drought and always a welcome link to the
outside world. A 20-minute flight could save a trek of days or
weeks hauling supplies over mountains and through jungles.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the isolated destinations have no control tower, weather
service or repair facilities. Martin must be able to gauge the
wind, fix his own aircraft, make spare parts from whatever
materials are available and take off unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he hopes to become one of only about 500 men and women
who serve in a specialized air force that flies in the name of
Christ to hard-to-reach places others rarely go.
</P>
<P>
   They are the pilots, mechanics and electronic technicians who
work for missionary airlines and bring supplies to isolated
Christian missionaries and their flocks all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin is now in training to fulfill his dream. He attends
what some call the Top Gun school for missionary aviators at Moody
Missionary Aviation Training school in Elizabethton, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be in a jungle setting in Africa or South
America,'&AMP; Martin said. ``The main role is supporting missionaries
who are there. I might be in a large town, but I would be flying
into remote areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is a second-year student at Moody and has completed the
required course to be certified as an aircraft maintenance
technician.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, he will work in the school's shop to
gain maintenance experience and learn to fly the school's Cessna
aircraft. Upon graduation, Martin will earn licenses in
single-engine private, instrument and commercial flying. And he
learns more than how to fly a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``His training prepares him not only to be a professional pilot
but his own skilled mechanic, weather service, navigator, control
tower, airstrip construction contractor and airline manager,'' said
Ed Robinson, 57, the director of the school and son of the founder.
</P>
<P>
   Moody Aviation is a ministry of Moody Bible Institute, a Chicago
missionary school founded in 1886. The flight school began in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Robinson was a Moody graduate and a World War II pilot but
was declared too old to be a missionary pilot. So, he decided to
train otherq to do the vital work. The institute agreed. The school
was started.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the school trains more than half the world's missionary
pilots, according to Ed Robinson. Others come from a couple of
small flight programs at Bible colleges, some are retired military
pilots and still others take flight training on their own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moody is the oldest school of its kind and, many think, the
best. There are 80 students, a faculty of 23 and 17 aircraft. The
three-year pilot mechanic course costs more than $40,000, plus
living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And most students complete two years of Bible study at the
Chicago institute before coming to flight school. Others must
complete at least 15 hours of college level biblical studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you read about us is technical,'' Robinson said.
``But aviation is just a platform for people representing Jesus
Christ to be with people who don't know him.''
</P>
<P>
   The school accepts both men and women, but the student body is
overwhelmingly male. There are three areas of aviation study.
</P>
<P>
   All students take a year of aircraft maintenance. Maintenance
specialists have a second year working on aircraft and then
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Avionics technicians study electronics and communications
systems for two additional years. And a pilot-mechanic spends two
years flying, fixing planes and learning related skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mkody does in three years is really ridiculous,'' Martin
said in awe. ``They really pack it ij.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduates far exceed FAA standards and are in great demand,
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could double in size, and our graduates would still have
pretty good job security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni generally fly for one of several Protestant
nondenominational missionary agencies that provide flight services
for countless missionary groups.
</P>
<P>
   The largest one is the Mission Aviation Fellowship based in
Redlands, Calif. That group has more than 115 pilots, as well as
mechanics and avionics technicians serving at 34 bases in 27
countries. They fly more than 4 million miles a year, according to
Donna Sharp from the fellowship's communications office. The agency
has 89 aircraft, of which 79 are single-engine Cessnas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest Cessna fleet in the world,'' Sharp said.
``We fly more hours than most airlines. The pilots fly in and out
of the jungle on landing strips that are not the most wonderful.
These guys are really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Roman Catholic priests fly planes in mission areas, but the
church does not have missionary flight agencies, according to Cathy
McDonald, a spokeswoman for the Maryknoll Fathers Catholic Foreign
Missionary Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   Missionary Flights International is a small nondenominational
ministry based in West Palm Beach."They have nine xilots who fly
DC-3s to support missionary work in Haiti, the Dominican Republic
and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin hopes to fly with one of the missionary airlines. His
interest in missions began at the Hobe Sound Bible Church, where he
has worshipped all his life. Summer missionary trips were exciting
and convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Honduras and felt that God would have me work in
missions,'' Martin said. ``I know I am not a preacher and I like to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   He majored in missions at the Hobe Sound Bible College, married
Kayla Laird, 24, from Hobe Sound and applied to Moody Aviation.
Kayla plans to be a nurse and happily anticipates going to the
mission field, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and most missionary pilots pay for the privilege of
serving God: They must raise money for their own salary and part of
the cost of flight operations from friends and churches.
Missionaries who use the air service pay only a fraction of the
cost. Pilots and mechanics find the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the world around me, making a lot of money is
great,'' Martin said. ``But when you die, you can't take it with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he worried about money, school work and supporting a
family in the mission field, as well as living out of this country
away from family for years at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He prayed that God might put him at ease with all of that or
take away his desire to fly. Soon, he found a Bible verse,
Philippians 1:6, to remind him that God finishes what he starts:
</P>
<P>
   I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among
you will bring it to completion by the day of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was God telling me to relax,'' Martin said. ``Ever since
I trusted God, he's really helped things.''

TOUR DE FRANCE SHRINKING AS DRUG SANCTIONS HIT HARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland _ Slightly deflated, but not yet
defeated, the Tour de France rolls on. But even though it left
behind its host country for a few hours Thursday afternoon, it
didn't leave behind all its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Only 101 cyclists lined up at the beginning of the race's
fourth-to-last stage before it ends in Paris Sunday. That's little
more than half of the 189 who started the race almost three weeks
ago, attrition due in large part to riders who were banished after
drug investigations or dropped out because they felt harassed by
the probes and media coverage they feel have overshadowed the race.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining riders gathered in Aix les Bains at 11 in the
morning with their numbers once again pinned on their jerseys _
they had stripped them off in protest Wednesday, when they merely
rode instead of raced, causing the stage to be nullified _ and they
were ready to compete. But the mood was anything but joyful.
</P>
<P>
   In the village where sponsors gather before the race, reporters
speculated about what might happen, team officials walked around
talking on cell phones, and French racer Luc Leblanc _ wearing
street clothes instead of his racing uniform _ did interviews with
television stations about why he decided to pull out of the race
the night before (to show ``solidarity,'' he said, with countryman
Laurent Jalabert, whose Spanish-based team dropped out Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   Other no-shows were the two Spanish teams, Vitalico, and the
Kelme team, of which fourth-place Fernando Escartin is a member.
</P>
<P>
   Also absent was Rodolfo Massi, who was detained by police
Wednesday night along with Marc Madiot, the director of the
Francaise des Jeux team, and an unidentified doctor, judicial
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press also reported that police searched vehicles
and hotel rooms Wednesday night belonging to the teams from
Francaise des Jeux, ONCE, and Casino, and that no illegal
substances were found among medication seized Tuesday by customs
officers from the Bigmat team.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the clear blue skies, a black cloud hung over the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Jemison of Salt Lake City, a rider for the US Postal
Service team, said morale was down Wednesday night and was still
low Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said. ``That can change, but I mean, who's
going to raise their arms today and feel good about it?''
</P>
<P>
   The 136-mile ride ventured over the French border into
Switzerland on its final full day in the Alps. And even though it
lacked the straight up-and-down mountain passes that marked the
past three days, Jemison said the stage was anything but easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this is not flat,'' he said, displaying the small
profile of the stage that he keeps in his jersey. ``This is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jemison and the remaining riders appeared to be back in
racing form as they covered the countryside at a clip that averaged
28 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The flat finish was made for sprinters, and it seemed Germany's
Erik Zabel was poised to cross the line first as he furiousily spun
his wheels and sped along to the front. But another ace sprinter,
Tom Steels of Belgium, made clear that it was not to be. He rushed
up right next to Zabel's wheel, then surged just inches ahead as he
crossed the line in 4 hours 53 minutes 27 seconds. It was the third
stage win for Steels, who is in 81st place overall.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the pack rolled into town en masse, and the overall
standings didn't change.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Marco Pantani is in first place, with an almost
six-minute lead over Bobby Julich of the United States, who leads
defending champion Jan Ullrich by just 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., finished 54th Thursday, 4
minutes 8 seconds back, and is in 52d place overall with a 1-hour
37-minute 30-second deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he gets to the podium in Paris Sunday, Julich realizes
his finish might be tainted by the scandals that have surrounded
the Tour..
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there may be a little asterisk by my name in the
results,'' Julich said, ``but I know what I know, and Laurent
Jalabert dropping out doesn't take any of the prestige away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think regardless if it's just me or 10 guys crossing the
line, when we all were there in the race and when all the riders
were givng 100 percent, I was still there. I was one of the best
riders, and that's what I'm going to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tour heads back to France today but, the riders hope, not
back to more problems.

US LOSES TO LITHUANIA, 84,82, AT THE BUZZER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ We've now officially gone back to the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's just like it was in the pre-Dream Team days, when the
United States would go to an international basketball tournament
and find itself in a shark pool. The US entry in the world
championships here discovered just how vulnerable it was Thursday
when it fell behind Lithuania by 16 points and wound up losing,
84-82, when Jimmy Oliver's great look at a potential game-winning
3-pointer rattled in and out at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Lithunania is not even considered one of the favorites.
Lithuania is missing its two best players, Arvydas Sabonis and
Zadrunas Ilgauskas. A couple of its players look as if they need _
I mean really need _ a good meal. But more than a few of these guys
played a superb game against the Americans. If Oliver's shot had
gone down, it would have been a painful, and more than likely
incomprehensible, loss for the Lithuanians, who took the lead at
13-12 and never gave it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy we can come back and play (Friday) and not have
to wait three or four days,'' said point guard Michael Hawkins, who
packed 11 of his 16 points into a stretch drive that almost
resulted in a tremendous American comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's opponent is South Korea. Trust me when I tell you that
your US team will have no trouble beating South Korea. The loss
Thursday will have little effect on the US chances of winning the
gold medal, other than to boost the confidence of the teams
considered true contenders.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no big surprise to learn that the Lithuanian
player who bullied America's team the most was the most
Americanized player they've got. I am speaking of ex-Seton Hall
star Arturas Karnisovas, whose 29 points, accumulated via an
impressive all-around display of offensive virtuosity, looked and
felt more like 129. He did not make baskets as much as he threw
daggers. He pretty much did whatever he felt like doing, and none
of Rudy Tomajanovich's players came close to stopping him.
</P>
<P>
   This is interesting because at the Goodwill Games, Karnisovas
was the team offensive millstone. The Lithuanians shot 52 percent
as a team despite his 38 percent bricklaying.
</P>
<P>
   But it just so happens that this game was played at Peace and
Friendship Arena, where Karnisovas played a full season for
Olympiakos in the Greek League. ``When the bus pulled up, I started
thinking about the good games I had here for Olympiakos,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had three or four games over 30 in this building and 15
or 20 more over 20,'' pointed out Hawkins, an Olympiakos teammate.
``So he felt real comfortable in this gym.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans looked distinctly uncomfortable in the first half.
Oliver hit two quick shots, but that was it. For most of the half,
it was Boulder Central. Worse yet, the US couldn't figure out what
was going on when Lithuania had the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The scouting report harped on Lithuania's shooting ability. The
Lithuanians responded with obvious trickery. They began taking it
to the hoop and they never stopped. They also got into transition
every chance they got, and no one had said anything about that,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the Americans play Brazil,'' said Karnisovas.
``Brazil was aggressive at the start. They were getting to the line
and they were running. Then they slowed down. They looked unsure of
themselves. They lost their leverage. We decided we would run the
ball and stay aggressive, and we also said we had to be as physical
as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we didn't think they could run,'' said assistant
coach Del Harris. ``We just thought we could contain them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they did that to us,'' fumed Oliver. ``We
spend a lot of time working on defensive transition. I think they
came out more aggressively and tried to put it to us from the
get-go. They put us back on our heels. Looking at the films, they
were a shooting team. They turned out to be a driving team.''
</P>
<P>
   The US is still trying to find out exactly what it is. Brazil is
no longer the Brazil of old. That was perhaps a deceptively easy
opener. Anyone watching the tape of this one will come away with
all kinds of ideas about how to beat this US team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My state of mind, and I will pass this on, is that we simply
can't go out there and have another bad start against Korea,'' said
Oliver. ``We must do whatever it takes, starting right there in the
locker room, to get off to a better start.''
</P>
<P>
   The US remains confident, but not ridiculously so. The European
players among them certainly respect the competition. What this
game reminded everyone is that the US isn't good enough to dig big
holes and assume that the extrication effort will be successful.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of you folks hated the Dream Team and its successors. You
wanted competition. This game serves as ample enough evidence that
you've got it.

MESSAGES IN THE MEDIA: VARIED PERCEPTIONS OF FACTUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass. N.M., Ohio)  (Eds: Exhibition notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Guys _ Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Barnett
Newman, Ad Reinhardt _ made Abstract Expressionism. Other guys _
Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein,
James Rosenquist _ made proto-Pop and Pop Art, and still other guys
made Minimalism, Conceptualism and the various isms of the 1960s.
But girls made post-modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I exaggerate. But not much. Women (now that we're serious)
were crucial to the art movements of the late 1970s and 1980s. At
last. Especially in the realms of appropriation, media critique and
photography used to dissect cultural practices and stereotypes.
Barbara Kruger, Louise Lawler, Sherrie Levine, Cindy Sherman,
Laurie Simmons and Sarah Charlesworth ventured into this territory
relatively early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah Charlesworth: A Retrospective,'' the first mid-career
survey of Ms. Charlesworth's work, is on view at the National
Museum of Women in the Arts here. This show of 60 photo-works from
nine series made from 1977 to 1995 was organized by SITE Santa Fe
in New Mexico, with assistance from the National Museum of Women in
the Arts and the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest pieces, from the ``Modern History'' series of
1977-79, are just as strong as they were 20 years ago. ``April 21,
1978'' tracks a photograph of the kidnapped Italian Prime Minister
Aldo Moro across the front pages of 45 newspapers in several
countries. An Italian newspaper had declared him dead; Moro's
abductors photographed him live, holding up that headline. (Later
they murdered him and stuffed his body in a car trunk; that
occasioned another trenchant photograph.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Charlesworth removed all the newspaper text except the
mastheads, then rephotographed the pages. Most Italian papers
carried the first photograph large; some gave it as much as
two-thirds of the page. Elsewhere, local news won out: in Britain,
a newborn royal got better placement and space. The Moro story
moved across the world at great speed but with varying intensities,
changing size, getting cropped and having to share space with
diverse events. At times the photograph of Moro's wary face was
replaced by a photograph of Italians looking at a newspaper with
his picture, actually a report on news reception rather than news.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Charlesworth's series says reams about the ways a global
news network transmits and modifies information. She raises the
complicated question of how newspapers (or any sources of news)
decide what to report and emphasize, and how. ``April 21, 1978''
suggests that even the few images that are virtually the only
culture shared across borders and continents probably have
different meanings and resonances because they have been presented
in such different ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a smart and jaunty essay in the show's accompanying catalog,
the critic Dave Hickey points out that these textless pages
emphasize that a news page is composed of rectangles within a
larger rectangle as surely as a Mondrian is and, for that matter,
as surely as a museum gallery is. Most people tend to ignore the
esthetic organization of the front page while consuming their
unsweetened news and coffee. Boxes within boxes: it is useful to be
reminded that museum spaces and picture frames have become so
common and accepted an experience that few people are conscious of
the setting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hickey's observation about Ms. Charlesworth's series nicely
situates the artist's commentary on the media in an esthetic realm,
an advantage some of her pieces have over much of the conceptual
art her work grew out of. It's worth remembering that esthetics and
presentation, however little noticed, still count. ``The Arc of
Total Eclipse, Feb. 26, 1979'' tracks newspaper photographs of a
solar eclipse across 29 front pages in the northwestern United
States and Canada. Here, Ms. Charlesworth makes clear that the
perception of the same event differs from place to place because
cameras seldom click at the same fraction of a second, editors
present pictures differently and, even more tellingly,
photographers (or any other observer) may see an event at slightly
different times, places and angles. This is a literally moving
commentary on time, point of view and perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stills, 1980'' consists of four enlarged and rephotographed
images of people in midair, jumping from buildings either to commit
suicide or escape a fire; we are not told which. One woman, her
face blank, floats gracefully like a becalmed ballerina. Another
plunges down feet first, her dress flying up to reveal her behind
and cover her head , rendering her even more anonymous than time,
graininess and lack of identification can. I find these pictures as
riveting and harrowing as primal fear.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Charlesworth's later color work consists of single or
scattered images on saturated color fields, highly lacquered, often
paired with another framed image. Gorgeous as they are _ and they
are gorgeous _ and smart as they sometimes are about, say, gender
issues, the implications seldom seem as profound as her
investigations of the transmission of information.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this work tries to express complex ideas about sexual
desire, the interplay of nature and culture, or spiritual
yearnings. The approach is reductive, taking iconic forms out of
context and floating them on a sea of color; this is visually
appealing but not always as rewarding on the second and third
round. Photography is not all that good at expressing ideas that
are more complicated than propaganda. Ms. Charlesworth's piece on
Moro works partly because the series is so large that comparisons
are built in.
</P>
<P>
   The five ``Objects of Desire'' series, with each item in them
presented as a glittering object of desire in itself, cannot quite
avoid the common problem that dogs critiques of cultural
seductions. The obvious targets are advertising and film, which are
already universally recognized as overplaying the sex card. The
post-modern ploy of using pop culture to critique itself can bring
art perilously close to glorifying what it intends to scold; and
parodying or making pseudo icons of forms that are already
exaggerated is a tricky business. Some years ago a group of
enterprising literati published a spoof of Vogue magazine that fell
flat because fashion copy that was on the level already sounded
like a sendup.
</P>
<P>
   Like news pictures, Ms. Charlesworth's work will doubtless be
received differently by different museum installations, different
locales and different mindsets. I consider her in good, provocative
form in the ``Renaissance Paintings and Drawings'' series, where
she cleverly revises Renaissance works of art, but think her early
1990s pictures of magic tricks too easy a comment on how readily
photographs lie. Ms. Charlesworth is obviously thoughtful;
sometimes her art cannot quite measure up to her ideas.

SENATE GOP CONFIDENT OF PREVAILING ON MANAGED CARE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Noting that Senate debate on reining in managed
care has been put off until after the August recess, Republican
lawmakers said Thursday they won't compromise on one of the key
sticking points _ patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a key architects of the Senate
Republican managed care bill introduced last month, accused
Democrats of stalling and creating the delay in considering the GOP
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not going too far to say the Democrats are
beginning to jeopardize the possibility of passing a bill,
period,'' Gramm said at a news conference. ``Their unwillingness to
bring this bill up is beginning to threaten the whole concept of
passing a bill this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pushing for their own patients-rights measure,
which they say goes further than the GOP measure to control the
cost-conscious health plans that closely monitor patient treatment
to make sure it is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the Republicans who dominate the Senate have
``reached a consensus. And the consensus is we want to defeat the
(Democrats') bill and we want to adopt our bill. That's the
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   With Election Day a little more than three months away, managed
care has become a hot-button issue, with both parties jockeying to
win voter favor as the champion of controlling health plans.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans approved a managed care bill July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans were anxious to bring up their version of the
bill this week. But on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., put it off after Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., refused to go along with the GOP plan to limit the number
of amendments Democrats could offer.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on the Senate floor Thursday, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., co-author of the Democrats' patients-rights bill,
accused Republicans of squelching open debate and a vote on each
legislative issue for fear that it would show that ``their plan is
more loophole than law.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans ``believe that the less the American people
know about their sham proposals, the better they will be able to
protect their friends in the health insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   At the GOP news conference, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said
Democrats fear that a vote on the Republican bill would take away
one of their prime 1998 campaign issues. ``It seems to me they're
more interested in playing politics ... than they are in trying to
legislate seriously on this matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic bills would require health plans
to compensate patients for most emergency room care at hospitals
not in the plans' hospital networks. Both would lift ``gag'' rules
that prevent doctors from talking about treatment options that
individual plans do not cover.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican bill would cover only the 48 million people
whose plans are exempted by federal law from state regulation. The
Democratic bill would cover all 160 million or so enrolled in
managed care health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill would set up appeal routes inside and
outside health plans when patients disagree with their plan's
denial of coverage. The Democrats also would permit patients to sue
their health plan for compensatory and punitive damages when the
denial results in further injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill also would set up an internal and external
appeals route. Patients would be able to go to court after the
appeals route is exhausted, but only in limited circumstances. If
the external appeals body rules in the patient's favor and the plan
still does not provide the treatment, the patient could obtain a
court-ordered penalty of $100 a day for each day the plan refuses
to comply.
</P>
<P>
   If the appeals body turns thumbs down, the patient still could
go to court but only to recover the cost of the denied benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill also contains a provision to expand a small
federal trial program of medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
offer tax deductions to individuals who set the accounts to save
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred when they purchase
high-deductible medical insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and their supporters have condemned MSAs as sops to
the rich and healthy that would, in effect, draw them out of the
insurance risk pool and cause rates to rise for the poorer and less
healthy who remain behind.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, a staunch MSA advocate, said he could not compromise on
these accounts in order to get a bill passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical savings accounts are not controversial,'' he insisted.
``They're only controversial with people who deep in their heart
want the government to run the health care system. They know if we
get medical savings accounts and empower the consumer, they will
never. ever have their dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   A compromise bill authored by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., is aimed
at bridging the gap between the two parties. Joined by Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the Chafee proposal includes
many of the common points of the Democratic and Republican plans,
such as internal and external appeals, and easier access to
emergency room care.
</P>
<P>
   But it avoids the political pitfalls such as the lawsuit
provision in the Democrats' bill and expanded medical savings
accounts in the Republicans' measure.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the Chafee bill contains fewer protections than the
Democrats' bill, but its existence proves ``that the wall of
opposition by Senate Republicans to genuine reform is continuing to
crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, however, dismissed the Chafee effort, calling it ``a
compromise looking for a constituency.''

CURTAIN CALL FOR UCLA FILM PRESERVATIONISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(NOTE: Phone number corrected in last graph.0 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So many films, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lament of the film preservationist who races against
time, corrosion and the chemicals in the reels themselves as he
labors to save remnants of this 20th-century art form. The men and
women committed to this endeavor are technicians, film lovers and
detectives all rolled into one. Because to restore a film, you have
to track down an original first.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA Film and Television Archive's annual Festival of
Preservation, which opens Saturday night, not only brings to light
the restorative work being done by the archivists but also some
titles that haven't been seen in a long while or at all. Others are
recognized classics. What all have in common is they'll be seen
again as they were the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A film restorer strives to become invisible _ to find original
footage of such impeccably high quality and to use the arts and
sciences of film preservation so effectively that it seems as if a
work from the distant past has been passed on to the present
untouched by human hands,'' writes Robert Rosen, director of the
UCLA Film and Television Archive.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, American audiences will view ``Joan of Arc''
in its original cut for the first time in 50 years. Disapproval of
co-stars Ingrid Bergman and Jose Ferrer's affair tainted this
controversial 1948 production that led to a recut. That version
reduced Ferrer's dynamic performance and downplayed the trial,
adding narration and a chorus of angels in its place.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation festival runs through August, and 35 films will
be presented. They run the gamut from newsreels to animation,
television specials to Spanish-language feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   ``LOST HORIZON'' _ From a preservationist's standpoint, Frank
Capra's 1937 story of paradise found presented its own challenges.
The director's cut ran six hours and was shortened with each
re-release. Also, seven minutes cut in the late 1930s were not
retrieved, so stills now take their place in the restored version;
7:30 p.m. Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FRESHMAN'' _ Harold Lloyd goes off to college to become
the Big Man on Campus and becomes the tackling dummy for the
football team instead in this 1925 satire that showcased Lloyd's
comedy skills; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``MACBETH'' _ Orson Welles downsized in this 1948 production in
exchange for autonomy from studio meddling. Working for the smaller
Republic Pictures, he employed simple, rough sets that ``convey a
primitive, dreamlike strangeness'' that serves Welles'
interpretation of this Shakespeare classic; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``WORKING GIRLS'' _ Director Dorothy Arzner puts two Indiana
sisters in the Big Apple, tosses out sexual innuendos and engages
in some playful gender confusion in this 1931 romp that was clearly
ahead of its time; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``HEARST METROTONE NEWS COLLECTION: Restored Newsreels from the
1930s in America'' _ Before television news, audiences witnessed
the events of the day at the movies. This collection, restored by
UCLA archivists under a grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, covers the period from the stock market crash of 1929
to President Franklin Roosevelt's ``Day of Infamy'' speech after
the attack at Pearl Harbor; 7:30 p.m. Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``DINAH SHORE: THE NBC YEARS'' _ The easy charm, warm smile and
engaging manner of the late variety-show hostess are remembered in
this tribute, compiled by UCLA and Research Video. Her interviewing
style put stars from Frank Sinatra to Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald
to Groucho Marx at ease on the NBC sets, where she worked from
1951-63. Show time is 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences, 5230 Lankershim Blvd., North
Hollywood. Admission is free for this event only, but reservations
must be made by calling (310) 206-8014.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for all other screenings are sold one hour before show
time nightly at the James Bridges Theater box office, on the UCLA
campus near Sunset Boulevard and Hilgard Avenue. Tickets cost $6
general admission, $4 for students and seniors. Passes for five
screenings cost $25 general, $17 for students and seniors.
</P>
<P>

THIS SUMMER, NOISE MATTERS  
 TV'S OK WITH DAVID KELLEY  
 HOLLYWOOD SUCCESS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ If there is one outstanding feature of the movies
released this summer, especially the big special-effects pictures,
it is that they are among the noisiest films ever made.
``Armageddon'' and ``Godzilla,'' and even the serious drama
``Saving Private Ryan,'' have cranked up the aural effects, leaving
some people thrilled and others with headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the response, many experts say movie sound _ even if it
is sometimes characterized as just ``technical'' _ is entering a
more sophisticated era, partly as a result of better sound
production in the studios, and partly as a result of movie
theaters' installing digital sound systems. And the change is
having a big impact on how audiences experience films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound has become a much more important tool in terms of
putting the audience in a mood and a place,'' said Wylie Stateman,
a co-founder of Soundelux Entertainment, a large sound production
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound tells the story,'' he continued. ``It's not responsible
just to make it louder. What you can do is create a time and a
place, create weight and velocity. You can put a helicopter over
the audience's head and move it all around.''
</P>
<P>
   Stateman has worked on effects from the screech of Godzilla,
produced with a mix of elements ranging from a trumpet to lion and
camel roars, to the sounds in ``Flubber,'' ``Air Force One'' and
``Jerry Maguire.'' He is also creating the effects for the voice of
God for the animated feature ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jenkins, the president of Todd-AO Studios, the largest
sound production company in Hollywood, said, ``The technical
improvements have always gone in small increments, but in the last
three to five years they have grown in great leaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who worked on ``Lost in Space'' and ``Six Days, Seven
Nights,'' among other films, added: ``What this is about is
contrast and subtlety. We can be much more subtle now. A whisper is
as important as an explosion as far as we're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jenkins and Stateman emphasized that the new equipment and
techniques have clarified soundtracks, making each element more
distinct, removing background noise and allowing for subtle mixes
that give the audience a sense that the images on the screen are at
varying distances.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the digital electronic advances, many techniques
are still quite prosaic. Stateman said that a head of lettuce is
still torn in half to create ripping sounds, and that coconut
shells are still knocked together to produce the sound of horses'
hooves, just as in radio days. But now the horses can seem to walk
around the viewer, and even behind.
</P>
<P>
   Stateman said one of the greatest and most satisfying challenges
was taking the relatively flat images of animation and making them
come to life through sound.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that movie sound would increasingly be used to
create a sense of total immersion in the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll go back to smell-o-rama,'' he said, ``but
using new digital standards will put you completely in the
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in addition to filling the entire theater with
sounds, seats might be made to vibrate to add to the sense of
realism.
</P>
<P>
   Just a Break From TV
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Hollywood hierarchy has looked something like
this: You did theater to get into television, and television to get
into movies, then went back to television only when you got too old
for the movies or hit a creative slump.
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, David Kelley, television's most prolific
writer-producer, would seem to have finally gotten his break.
Kelley created ``Picket Fences,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' ``The
Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal'' for television, and his shows just
garnered 14 Emmy nominations. He is a meticulous craftsman who
wrote every episode of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice'' last
season.
</P>
<P>
   But at long last his movie career appears to be taking off.
Earlier, he wrote ``From the Hip'' and ``To Gillian on Her 37th
Birthday,'' both of which did not fare well in the theaters. Now he
has two films under way: ``Lake Placid,'' the tale of a 35-foot
crocodile that makes its way into a remote lake in Maine, and
``Mystery Alaska,'' about a small-town hockey team whose pride is
suddenly put on the line when it gets an opportunity to play the
New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelley said he viewed these projects as modest asides, to
fill his time between television seasons, not as an opportunity to
climb the Hollywood ladder: ``You still hear people say: `You're a
pretty good writer. Why are you still doing television?' It always
surprises me. The sugar plums that dance around in peoples' heads
here come from features. But both of these movies were done during
the hiatus in the television season. It really was just that. I
consider myself to be in television. I just had a few good ideas
that didn't lend themselves to television treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said that given the quality of much television today and
the amounts of money that could be made, the medium had gained
somewhat in stature, but for emphasis, he added, ``This is not a
segue into features.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Alaska,'' which is being released by Disney's
Hollywood Pictures and on which Kelley was a writer and a producer,
has just finished shooting and is expected in theaters early next
year. It stars Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita
Davidovich and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid,'' which Kelley wrote and is a producer on, is
about to begin production and is being released by Phoenix
Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Canal Plus and Pioneer. It stars Bill
Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt and Brendan Gleeson. Kelley
said the film had grown out of a childhood ``obsession'' with
crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he was disappointed in some ways that he had done
the hockey story as a feature rather than a television series
because he had grown to like the characters and wished he had had
the opportunity to explore them further.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said that he and his wife, actress Michelle Pfeiffer,
tried to go to the movies every Saturday night, and that he enjoyed
the entertainment, but that he preferred writing for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make an argument that television is better than
features these days, but the best feature is something to behold,''
Kelley said. ``But it's just always been more fun for me to write
for existing characters. I'm content to stay in television, for
now.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Daydream Come True
</P>
<P>
   You spend years producing and directing promotional spots for
television shows, but you dream of making a feature-length movie.
You have a script, written with your wife. You even get a small
production company interested, and all you need is an actor or two
with just a bit of a reputation. And then you suddenly find
yourself with two Oscar winners eager to play roles.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Valerio admitted that that was, at one time anyway, his
daydream, but that it had now come true, much like an old-fashioned
Hollywood tale, as he was preparing to direct his first feature
film, ``Carlo's Wake,'' with Martin Landau and Rita Moreno. The
movie is being produced by Triple Axel Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Though the project has been years in the making, Valerio, 40,
admitted to a frisson of delight that he was finally moving ahead.
He said he was concentrating on how to make the oddball comedy seem
fresh, and especially on how to make it a movie rather than a
two-hour sitcom, a common pitfall for directors who come from
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlo's Wake'' began as a play written by Valerio's wife,
Rosie Taravella, and based on real experiences. The play was a
poignant and humorous account of her father's wake; the colorful
members of the extended family who attended the event and the woman
who did not, Carlo's estranged wife, Angela. Lies, secrets and,
eventually, truths about the family spill out as its members take
account of Carlo's life and joust with each other over his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   What the audience must come to terms with, Valerio said, is
whether ultimately Carlo's wife was justified in running off with
her husband's brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlo is a bit of a scoundrel, so it's a dark-edged comedy,''
Valerio said. ``But what happens is the children all see the dead
man differently. It's like they're talking about a different man.
The audience doesn't know what to think because they only know what
they're told by the characters. It's not a gross-out comedy like
some of the ones that are popular now. It's darker.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's budget is $2.5 million, which is a reasonably hefty
sum for a small, independent film with an ensemble cast, and it
will be shot in Santa Monica. It's a big step for Valerio, who at
one time directed what he described as a porno puppet show for the
Playboy channel before focusing on promotional spots for television
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 10 years, I directed most of the best actors in
television,'' he said. ``It was just for a short time for each
promotion, but I worked with everyone from Dick Van Dyke to Cheech
Marin. You learn a lot working with people like that.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Love sweeter than any gift costing a mint
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my grandsons is getting married to a darling,
dark-haired, bookish young girl, and I've brooded over how to help
with the celebration and what to give them.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, parents and grandparents could deed over a
spread of land. Before that, when more land wasn't to be had, they
would give a mule or a milk cow. In the house, the womenfolk busied
around getting together feather beds and quilts for them. Many
young couples started marriage with a brace of ducks, a couple of
setting hens and a setting of eggs.
</P>
<P>
   I knew an old lady who always gave Bibles for wedding presents,
and a gentle, kind old bachelor who had a wonderful library and
invited the nuptial couple to take their choice of his books.
Starting them off with a library of their own was the richest gift
he had at his disposal, and I dallied with the idea of giving my
grandson and his bride books.
</P>
<P>
   But they give me books. Ted left two boxes of books in my
basement and said, ``Help yourself.'' They are all things I want to
read, but no self-help book that will tell me what to give them for
a wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a grandmother will bestow a new car on the marrying
ones. I don't have one to give, and I can't afford to buy them one.
Besides, they have cars and probably strong ideas about what they
will buy for themselves when they are able. I know a rich lady in
Mobile(Ala.) who sends the bridal couple around the world on their
honeymoon. I might finance a trip to Ludowici, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The old custom of registering their wants with a department
store is not as prevalent with brides-to-be as it used to be. I
remember going to Rich's and being taken in hand by 'Cile Butts,
who would take you on a tour of the china, crystal and silver
departments, detouring by linens and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Computer no help
</P>
<P>
   I tried that at the one store where our bride is registered.
There was no 'Cile Butts to be warm and welcoming. You talked to a
computer. I was so discouraged by the answers I got, I turned off
the machine and started wandering. There were many pretty things,
but would she want any of them? What does she have already? What
have her friends and relatives contributed?
</P>
<P>
   So I went home and started thinking about the custom of handing
down. To one bride, I handed down the remains of my mother's
silver, which happened to be her own chosen pattern. To another, I
gave two old serving pieces that had belonged to her
great-grandmother on the other side. What is left for this couple?
I searched the cabin and came up with nothing. An old platter?
Crackled and stained and in use for 100 years ... what modern girl
would want that? I looked at quilts and pictures. They mean a lot
to me, but absolutely nothing to this pretty newcomer in our
family.
</P>
<P>
   The day approaches, and I am out of ideas. Or I was until I
remembered a card I read years ago. It said, ``What can I give
thee? I can give thee love.''
</P>
<P>
   And I do. I wish them a long and happy marriage, independent of
things. I send them a heartful of love going back to when the
husband-to-be was a newborn baby and I drove down Piedmont Avenue
with an iron bed tied to the top of my car. I send them memories _
his first haircut, his grammar school play, our walks to the river,
our talks about books. Worrying about a present would detract from
the day, so I won't. I send them love.

 &HT;    Trip-hopping Tricky in a feel-good mood
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brace yourself, Tricky fans.
</P>
<P>
   The moody genius behind the trip-hop masterpiece ``Maxinquaye''
and the dense, difficult new effort ``Angels With Dirty Faces'' is
about to throw the wildest curveball of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He is getting happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Mr. Positive!'' gushes the 30-year-old British
artist in an expletive-riddled phone interview from his home in New
York. Those who know the man's work and reputation will find that
hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Born Adrian Thaws, Tricky got his nickname as a teenager. (In
the July issue of Details magazine, he says it was because he was
thought to be ``unreliable.'') He rose to prominence in the early
'90s as part of a clique of artists experimenting with
``trip-hop,'' a downbeat, murky-sounding form of electronic dance
music. His 1995 debut, ``Maxinquaye,'' made many critics' year-end
best-of lists, and such pop hipsters as Bjork and Neneh Cherry
queued up to collaborate with him.
</P>
<P>
   As Tricky's career grew, so did his reputation for being
temperamental. In interviews he could be uncooperative, refusing to
discuss past efforts. By his own admission, he could be difficult
with colleagues. ``People I had been working with told me they
couldn't work with me anymore,'' he says. ``I knew there was
something wrong.'' He tried tai chi to calm his nerves and sought
the opinions of several doctors, but, he says, ``I went to see the
wrong ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, earlier this year, he went to see a nutritionist who
diagnosed him with candidiasis, a yeastlike fungus that some say
infects the intestinal and respiratory tracts. Controversy
surrounds the condition and its treatment, which includes
restricting sugar and wheat in the patient's diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether such a thing as candidiasis exists is still in
question,'' says Chris Rosenbloom, an associate professor of
nutrition at Georgia State University. ``The whole area is still
not well-known. In terms of its treatment, restricting someone's
sugar intake makes sense theoretically. But no one has ever shown
that it actually clears it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, after several months of being on such a diet,
Tricky says, ``I feel so much better. I've written some new songs
that I am loving. They're not nearly as tense and paranoid as the
old stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the masses respond to the new, feel-good Tricky? ``I can
see a lot more people getting into (the new songs),'' he says. Not
that mainstream success is necessarily the main goal. ``Only if I
can do it my way,'' Tricky insists. ``It would be beautiful to do
it without compromising.''

 &HT;    On-target `Negotiator' fights fire with fire
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's main kick is the engrossing duel of bluffs and
counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us believe in
the high stakes of the situation. And director F. Gary Gray (``Set
It Off'') remembers the meat and potatoes of the genre, throwing in
tense action sequences that make the film resemble a cousin of
``Die Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey. Directed by F. Gary
Gray. Rated R for violence, language. At metro theaters. 2 hours,
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Takes no hostages with its blend of tense action
and terrific acting.

   An updated `Trap' sticks to tried, true
</P>
<P>
   By Jill Vejnoska
</P>
<P>
   The people behind this remake have wisely deviated little from
the plot of the 1961 Disney movie that made 15-year-old Hayley
Mills a top star. This time, redheaded Lindsay Lohan plays the dual
role of separated-practically-at-birth identical twins who meet at
camp and switch identities in the hope of reuniting their divorced
parents. Much of what's different about this ``Trap'' involves
updating _ fax machines and ``Leo'' DiCaprio references dot a
modernized tale, which includes a mother who works and (in one
scene) gets a little tipsy. Young kids may fidget at the length and
several kissing scenes. But they should enjoy the high-jinks-filled
camp sequence and Atlanta's Elaine Hendrix as Dad's coldly
calculating fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parent Trap''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

   Starring Natasha Richardson, Dennis Quaid and Lindsay Lohan.
Directed by Nancy Meyers. Rated PG for mild profanity and alcohol
use. At metro theaters.

 &HT;    `Henry Fool' keeps emotional distance
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never been a fool for director Hal Hartley's work
(``Trust,'' ``Amateur''), and ``Henry Fool'' does little to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which won the best screenplay prize at Cannes earlier
this year, is an ambitious fable of friendship, fame, art, commerce
and the ever-shifting phenomenon known as the eye of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly named Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) is a nerdy, put-upon
garbage man who is generally regarded as retarded by everyone in
his Queens neighborhood, including his slatternly sister (Parker
Posey, doing her usual wild-child slut act). Then, one day, Henry
Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan) moves into the Grim basement and takes over
Simon's life.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is as grandiose and overbearing as Simon is withdrawn and
unsure. He's also a self-styled writer, working on a personal opus
that he calls his ``Confession.'' Noting his new friend's
difficulty in expressing himself, Henry hands him a notebook and
some advice: ``Ever feel like you've got something to say and can't
get it out, stop and write it down.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll grant Hartley intelligence, wit, a love for language and a
certain eccentric world vision, all nice attributes for any
filmmaker. But his determinedly removed style keeps us at a
distance, and without any emotional investment in the characters,
it's difficult to be drawn into the picture's central conflict: the
sacredness of friendship vs. the integrity of the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Henry Fool'' just seems to go on and on and on,
bogged down by the director's insufferable self-indulgence and a
fatally bad performance in the title role. Urbaniak is fine as
Simon; his constricted conciseness of gesture and air of unblinking
alienation suggest a heavily medicated Lyle Lovett. But his
co-star, Ryan, has none of the innate charisma and self-serving
bravura of a natural-born poseur. Hartley gives him a particularly
distasteful secret which, when revealed, is supposed to make us
reconsider our attraction to this colorful scoundrel. But because
he's more boring than colorful, our ``attraction'' isn't really at
stake.

 &HT;    Family _ the tie that binds
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, it's so rare to see an independent film about a
family that's not dysfunctional that that fact alone makes this
debut feature by Theresa Connelly something of a welcome surprise.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that her bustling clan of working-class
Polish-Americans, the Pzoniaks, doesn't have its share of problems.
To begin with, the sultry, iron-willed matriarch, Jadzia (Lena
Olin), is having an affair. Her sad-eyed husband, Bolek (Gabriel
Byrne), who works the graveyard shift at the neighborhood bakery,
has his suspicions. After all, every time he has a night off, his
wife has a meeting of the Polish Women's Auxiliary. (Watching Olin
march off to her illicit assignations in pseudomilitary garb is a
great sight gag.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, their beautiful daughter, Hala (Claire Danes), is a
headstrong bundle of raging hormones who routinely sneaks out after
dark. One night, she comes home pregnant. The icing on the cake:
She's just been chosen to play the Virgin Mary in their church's
annual procession.
</P>
<P>
   Objectively speaking, ``Polish Wedding'' is a stubbornly un-P.C.
movie. Essentially, it endorses a teenager's dropping out of high
school, getting knocked up and forcing the baby's father to marry
her, regardless of consequences down the road. The film never
really examines this kind of thinking, and yet that's part of its
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly's script may be shaky and cliched, but her cast so
expertly creates this insular, blue-collar, first-generation
community that choices such as adoption, abortion and contraception
don't seem relevant. You even swallow, with barely a grimace, the
film's Old World assertion that women's true vocation is, in
Jadzia's words, ``making life and making love.''
</P>
<P>
   Olin, last seen putting a lethal leg-lock on Gary Oldman in
``Romeo Is Bleeding,'' is a commanding, sensual and complex woman,
firmly committed to her family yet risking all for a fling. Danes
is her ever-radiant self, just a little sneakier and
self-assertive. Best of all is Byrne, who effortlessly translates
his trademark Irish soulfulness into soulful Polishness.
</P>
<P>
   What all this adds up to is a warning of sorts: This movie may
be playing the art-house circuit, but it's more like a wobbly
``Moonstruck'' wannabe than anything Parker Posey or Christina
Ricci has been in recently. Thus, ``Polish Wedding'' may be too
square for the typically hip independent-film audience. Ironically,
that same lack of chic is what makes it so refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polish Wedding''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes, Lena Olin and Gabriel Byrne. Directed by
Theresa Connelly. Rated PG-13 for sex. At Tara. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A strong cast transforms a trite script.

 &HT;    Shenandoah Valley: Walk into the lives of the early settlers
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Staunton, Va. -- In the early 18th century, the Shenandoah
Valley was still wilderness _ America's western frontier. Its
earliest settlers were farmers from Germany, Northern Ireland and
England who came in search of religious freedom and land to call
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of American Frontier Culture tells their story. A
walking tour through this remarkable outdoor living history museum
takes visitors to the three European farms and finally to the
American frontier farm that represents the melding of the Old World
traditions of these three ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The farms are not replicas but buildings that were dismantled,
shipped to Virginia and reassembled on site. Each farmhouse is
outfitted with period-appropriate furniture, household items and
farm implements. Even the crops in the fields and the livestock in
the barns are antique breeds typical of the countries represented.
Costumed interpreters demonstrate farm skills. At each home, tables
have been laid with typical foods of the time and place.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop on the loop trail is the timber-frame German farm
built between 1688 and 1730 in the village of Hordt by the Rhine
River in Rhineland-Palatinate. You'll likely be greeted by a
gregarious flock of feather-crowned German silver spitzhaubens,
once common barnyard chickens. Inside, a man spins wool into yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the Ulster farm, typical of those leased from a landlord
by the Scottish-Irish in Northern Ireland. The three thatch-roofed
buildings stood near the village of Drumquin, County Tyrone. A
woman in a straw hat hoes the field as another woman tends to
household chores inside. Farther down the path a blacksmith is at
work at the forge moved from County Fermanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The English farm was the home of a yeoman (a small landowner) in
the late 17th century. The meat on the table along with the
vegetables attest to his relative prosperity. The two-story
timber-frame house was moved from Hartlebury Parish,
Worcestershire, in the West Midland area. Its windows are lead
glass and the roof clay tile.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the American log farmhouse and outbuildings were found
near the town of Eagle Rock in Botetourt County in the southern
part of the valley. During a visit earlier this summer, a group of
schoolchildren watched as an interpreter quilted on the front
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Plan to spend a full morning or afternoon to see the
introductory video and exhibits in the visitor center and explore
the farms.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Stonewall's Shenandoah: In the General's footsteps
 &HT;    (EMBARGOEDC UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The distance from Lexington, Va., in the southern reaches of the
Shenandoah Valley, north to Winchester is about 130 miles _ a
three-hour drive through small towns along U.S. 11, somewhat less
if you zoom along I-81. But why rush?
</P>
<P>
   We spent six days in the valley earlier this summer and almost
missed our flight home from Richmond because there was so much to
take in _ so many interesting detours.
</P>
<P>
   So many sites related to Lt. Gen. Thomas J. ``Stonewall''
Jackson, we started to feel like instant Stonewall scholars. Here's
a little of the history we learned:
</P>
<P>
   Lexington
</P>
<P>
   -- Stonewall Jackson Home: The modest green-shuttered red brick
house on East Washington Street, just up hill from the Lexington
Visitors Center, is the only residence Jackson ever owned. By all
accounts, he spent his happiest years here with his wife, Anna,
while teaching at Virginia Military Institute, from early 1859
until he rode off to war April 21, 1861, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the National Historic Landmark house documents the
life of the bearded, tight-lipped Jackson _ a man hard to imagine
with a smile on his face. But in this domestic setting, the
brilliant military leader comes to life as a professor, devout
Christian, church leader, businessman and loving husband. You'll
see the study where Jackson stood to prepare his lessons at an
upright desk, the dining room where he conducted Bible study and
prayer before breakfast each morning and the parlor where he
visited with his wife by the fire at night. The neat-as-a-pin house
and carefully tended garden in the back reflect Jackson's desire
for order. After his death, Anna and their daughter left Lexington
and returned to her native North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, 1-5 p.m. Sundays. 540-463-2552.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery: Don't be surprised if
you see lemons scattered around the Stonewall Jackson Monument and
Jackson's grave. A wreath of lemons was placed at the grave on
Memorial Day. His admirers honor him with the fruit because it
seems Jackson frequently sucked lemons to relieve a cronic stomach
ailment _ even on the battlefield. The bronze statue of Jackson was
erected in 1891 atop a granite base. Jackson's tomb is beneath the
monument, surrounded by a six-chambered burial vault containing
family members.
</P>
<P>
   540-463-2552.
</P>
<P>
   -- VMI Museum: On the lower level of Jackson Memorial Hall on
the VMI campus, where he taught for a decade before the war, is
where you'll find his preserved horse. ``Little Sorrel is central
to the museum _ both figuratively and physically,'' says director
Keith Gibson. ``It compresses history for folks when they think
that horse was an eyewitness to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally named Fancy, the dumpy, rather homely little horse
was anything but. Yet, the calm, easy-gaited beast with remarkable
stamina served Jackson well. Little Sorrel died in 1886, at age 36,
at the Robert E. Lee Camp for Confederate Veterans in Richmond,
having been exhibited at countless Southern fairs in his postwar
years. After preparation by a taxidermist, Sorrel was initially
displayed at Lee Camp but moved to VMI in 1948 when the camp
closed. A janitor, assigned to place a bucket of water in the glass
case where Sorrel was originally housed to maintain humidity,
reportedly quipped he was the only man in the world whose job it
was to water a dead horse.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jackson items include the blue wool VMI faculty uniform he
sported at the First Battle of Manassas on July 21, 1861; the
bullet-pierced raincoat he wore when he was mortally wounded while
sitting atop his horse at Chancellorsville; the slouch hat he
favored over the standard-issue caps; and the field desk he used
throughout the war. These and other exhibits at Virginia's oldest
museum tell the story of the nation's first state-supported
military college, founded in 1839.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, 2-5 p.m. Sundays. Free.
540-464-7232.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Stonewall Country'': Jackson's life before and during the
Civil War, recalled with battle scenes, stories and music, has been
the centerpiece at Theater at Lime Kiln in Lexington for 14 years.
Unfortunately, the show was not in production when we visited. But
we bought tickets to a Sunday night concert with Nathan and the
Zydeco Cha Chas just to experience the rough-hewn ambience of the
amphitheater built amid the stone ruins of an old lime kiln, with
bare earth for a stage and the fragrance of honeysuckle in the air.
</P>
<P>
   $11 Tuesdays-Thursdays; $16 Fridays and Saturdays. Through Aug.
15. The Sunday night concert series continues through Sept. 6.
540-463-3074 (Web site is www.cfw.com/limekiln).
</P>
<P>
   Dayton
</P>
<P>
   -- Shenandoah Valley Folk Art &AMP; Heritage Center: Somewhat off
the beaten path, this museum in Dayton, south of Harrisonburg, is
worth finding _ not only for its exhibits on the folk art and
culture of the valley but for the electric floor-to-ceiling map
that lights up to pinpoint Jackson's moves during the Valley
Campaign as a 20-minute taped narration details the action. The map
provides a graphic overview of Jackson's ``mislead and surprise''
strategy that kept Union forces on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: If you're in the area on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday,
drop by the Dayton Farmers Market on Va. 42. It's a vast emporium
filled with locally grown produce and fresh meats and seafood,
handcrafted gifts, baked goods, cheeses, gourmet coffees and a
country restaurant (540-879-9885).
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m.-4 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays-Saturdays, 1-5 p.m.
Sundays. $4. Take I-81 Exit 245, then west on Port Republic Road,
left on Va. 42 and right on County Road 732. 540-879-
</P>
<P>
   2681.
</P>
<P>
   New Market
</P>
<P>
   -- New Market Battlefield Military Museum: Although Jackson was
dead by the time of the May 15, 1864, Battle of New Market _ during
which the outnumbered Confederate army and VMI cadets defeated
Union troops _ his earlier defense of the valley help lay the
groundwork for victory. Plan to spend at least an hour winding
through the labyrinthian exhibit hall past 130 illuminated and
well-organized displays highlighting not only the Battle of New
Market but the entire Civil War and American military history from
1750 to the present. A Jackson family Bible and a piece of the
uniform the general was wearing when he was mortally wounded are
among the more than 3,000 artifacts assembled by Civil War
collector John Bracken. Catch the half-hour film on the Civil War
and take the self-guided battlefield tour that begins on the museum
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned by Bracken (``I personally chased all these
things down,'' he says), this 10-year-old museum is not affiliated
with the close-by state historical park and the Hall of Valor,
although both are on the battle site.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily through Dec. 15. $6. Follow signs from I-81,
Exit 264. 540-
</P>
<P>
   740-8065.
</P>
<P>
   -- New Market Battlefield State Historical Park and Virginia
Military Insitute Hall of Valor Civil War Museum: Don't miss the
film ``Stonewall's Valley,'' depicting the daring 1862 campaign
that spared the valley and saved Richmond from occupation by
Federal troops. Exhibits include dioramas, photo murals and
artifacts. Admission includes the 19th century Bushong farmstead,
used as a hospital after the Bushong's orchard was turned into a
battlefield. Scenic pathways lead to bluffs high above the
Shenandoah River.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. $5 adults; $2 ages 6-15; 5 and under free.
Follow signs all the way to the end of County Road 305 from I-81
Exit 264. 540-740-3101.
</P>
<P>
   Stratsburg
</P>
<P>
   -- Stonewall Jackson Museum at Hupp's Hill Battlefield Park: The
original section of the rustic museum is a 1750s split log
structure that was part of the George F. Hupp estate on the
outskirts of Strasburg. From outside the museum, note the trenches
from the 1864 Battle of Cedar Creek and fabulous views of the town,
Massanutten Mountain and the valley. Inside, immerse yourself in
the brilliant military strategist who ``won simply because he would
not lose,'' says director Patrick Heelen. ``Failure was not an
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's victorious 1862 campaign _ spurred by what Heelan
calls ``an overriding sense of duty and purpose'' _ is explored
through a wonderful jumble of artifacts, more than 100 photographs
of Jackson and interpretive materials that depict him as a devout
Christian and staunch patriot. While not as polished as the New
Market museums, it successfully chronicles Jackson's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's emphasis on interactive learning also sets it
apart. Visitors can handle reproductions of Civil War weapons,
uniforms, saddles and toys. Children can visit a hands-on room
where they can try on period costumes, climb into a soldier's tent,
hop on wooden horses complete with cavalry saddles and bridles, and
dig through ``Discovery Boxes'' filled with games, puzzles and
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, noon-5 p.m. Sundays. $3
adults; $2 for seniors and children; free for children under 6.
33229 Old Valley Pike. 540-465-
</P>
<P>
   5884.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester
</P>
<P>
   -- Stonewall Jackson's Headquarters Museum: Actress Mary Tyler
Moore's great-grandfather owned the striking 1854 Hudson River
Gothic Revival-style house on Braddock Street in Winchester _ but
that's not its primary claim to fame. Lt. Col. Lewis T. Moore's
house served as Jackson's headquarters in Winchester during the
winter of 1861-62. Restored and furnished by the local historical
society, the house contains artifacts from Jackson, calvary officer
Gen. Turner Ashby, mapmaker Jedediah Hotchkiss and other
Confederates. Among the memorabilia is Ashby's revolver and
Jackson's prayer book _ he was a Presbyterian _ and camp table.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m.-4 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, noon-4 p.m. Sundays. Through
October. $3.50 adults; $1.75 children. 415 N. Braddock St.
540-667-3242.
</P>
<P>
   -- Shenandoah Valley Civil War Center: The center's permanent
exhibition, ``Shenandoah: Crossroads of the Confederacy, The Role
of Virginia's Valley 1861-1865,'' provides an excellent orientation
to the region's Civil War history. Located in the Kurtz building in
the heart of Old Winchester, the center offers an overview of 15
military engagements and a summary of Jackson's campaign. This is
also a good place to stock up on brochures on Civil War sites and
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, noon-5 p.m. Sundays. Free. N.
Cameron St. 540-722-6367.
</P>
<P>
   Epilogue
</P>
<P>
   -- Stonewall's Arm: The general's amputated left arm didn't come
home to the Shenandoah Valley for burial with the rest of his body.
The limb is interred at a farm 15 miles west of Fredericksburg.
Jackson's chaplain, the Rev. Beverly Tucker Lacy, claimed the arm
and buried it in the cemetery at Ellwood, his family's home. The
granite marker at the grave reads ``Arm of Stonewall Jackson. May
3, 1863.'' Upon hearing of his trusted lieutenant's grave injury,
Gen. Robert E. Lee is quoted as saying, ``He has lost his left arm;
but I have lost my right arm.'' Jackson died of pneumonia seven
days later.
</P>
<P>
   Open daily. From Fredericksburg, take Va. 3 west through
Chancellorsville, then left on County Road 20, and look for gravel
road on left that leads to Ellwood. 540-373-6122 (National Park
Service).

 &HT;    Stonewall's Shenandoah: The general's spirit is everywherein
this verdant Virginia valley
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Shenandoah Valley, Va. -- After visiting endless Civil
War museums, battlefields and memorials, you figure you've seen all
there is to see of Lt. Gen. Thomas Jonathan ``Stonewall'' Jackson.
You've already beheld his burial place, a separate grave for his
amputated left arm, his prayer book, a scrap of his gray
Confederate uniform, even his shaving razor. But then, halfway
through a tour of the Virginia Military Institute Museum in
Lexington, you come across _ whoa, could it be? _ the general's
horse.
</P>
<P>
   It's Little Sorrel, all right _ stuffed, of course _ standing
proudly in a battlefield diorama, saddled and poised to bear his
master into yet another skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson hasn't set foot in this great green valley for well over
a century, yet vestiges of the man are everywhere. He takes on
mythic proportions in this much-visited region nestled between the
ancient ranges of the Alleghenies and Blue Ridge and gently scored
by the meandering Shenandoah River.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's legacy is pervasive _ from Winchester to the north,
where he was headquartered briefly during his victorious Valley
Campaign of 1862, and south to his final resting place in
Lexington, after he was accidentally shot by his own men in 1863,
had his arm removed and developed pneumonia, dying when he was but
39.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the valley earlier this summer, we didn't
tarry long before encountering the spirit of ``Old Jack,'' the
nickname bestowed upon Jackson by cadets at Virginia Military
Institute, where he taught until the Civil War erupted. There's
Rebel's Tattoo Studio (roll over, good soldier!) on East Stonewall
Drive in Front Royal and Stonewall Tavern and Grill in Winchester.
In Staunton, an important supply depot during the Civil War, the
Stonewall Brigade Band plays to picnicking crowds in Gypsy Hill
Park on Monday nights in summer. Staunton's once grand but now
decrepit Stonewall Jackson Hotel, built in 1925, remains the town's
tallest building. Stonewall Country Properties is a real estate
firm in Lexington and Rockbridge County, also home to Stonewall
Jackson Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As the great-grandson of a Scotch-Irish immigrant, the tenacious
Jackson was a likely hero of the people whose Ulster Scot, English
and German ancestors turned wilderness into farms in the mid-18th
century. He was determined to defend the bountiful ``breadbasket of
the Confederacy'' against Union domination.
</P>
<P>
   We could easily understand Jackson's passion for the Shenandoah.
To this day, the sweeping valley, nearly 200 miles long, remains a
fertile land dotted by silver silos and red barns on a patchwork of
green farmland and vineyards that produce award-winning wines. Its
sparkling steams lure fishermen. Canoeists and kayakers paddle its
rivers. Horseback riders and hikers roam its ridges and hollows.
</P>
<P>
   Late spring's blooming of pink and white mountain laurel,
rhododendron and wild azalea draws nature lovers from around the
world to Shenandoah National Park. In summer, green reigns. Then,
in October, visitors witness a fiery fall display of maples, oaks
and poplars. You can relish stunning panoramic views of the valley
and the Allegheny Mountains to the west from overlooks along the
105-mile Skyline Drive, which snakes atop the Blue Ridge from Front
Royal to Afton Mountain. In winter, skiers hit Massanutten
Mountain's slopes in the center of the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's limestone caverns beckon tourists into the cool,
damp underground world of stalactites and stalagmites. At majestic
Luray Caverns, we hummed along as the familiar strains of the folk
song ``Shenandoah'' played on the Great Stalacpipe Organ.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the Old Valley Pike _ an 18th-century wagon road,

 &HT;    Van Halen III
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA-- These are the times that try the souls of Van Halen
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ones who, after a long and blustery 11 years _ an epoch
in rock 'n' roll time _ had finally gotten used to Sammy Hagar, the
band's iron-tonsiled Big Kahuna, the guy who couldn't ``drive 55''
(as his signature tune declared), yet surprisingly sustained the
group after the 1985 departure of its original vocalist, David Lee
Roth. The foppish ``Diamond Dave'' had given this quintessential
1970s L.A. hard-rock act an outrageously animated visual presence
to match guitarist Eddie Van Halen's innovative, and much emulated,
``hammer-on'' technique. But his ego and the lure of an initially
promising solo career dispatched him on a path that eventually led
to ... uh, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hagar, too, is back in solo-land. And like one of those
former Soviet states that retires the party bosses and summons
fresh blood to the seat of power, Van Halen has a new lead singer _
Gary Cherone, of the popular (and now defunct) ``hair'' band
Extreme _ and some controversy on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Behold! There is much wailing and gnashing of teeth among the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave was awesome because he was a showman and a rocker,'' fan
Mike Schlenk opines on his Web site, ``Mike Schlenk's Personal Van
Halen Memorium'' (http://www.qni.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)schlenk/vh/), a page devoted both to Schlenk's VH
obsession (``It's a religion to me'') and his disappointment at the
band's latest edition. ``VH then matured a little with Sammy but it
continued to rock. Sammy is a ... rock star (despite his latest
album). He sang about female body parts and sandy beaches, but he
could be honest and heartfelt too. This latest album (``Van Halen
III,'' as in Mach 3) makes me think maybe the boys are
concentrating on being mature rather than being crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Van Halen couldn't give a flip. Which is, after all, how
it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a gas; the shows are great!'' says the
43-year-old guitarist, who joins the band tonight at Lakewood
Amphitheatre for a concert that will flaunt Cherone's new status
but will also survey Roth-era tunes unheard in a decade of tours.
``All the skeptical naysayers, after they see us live, they're not
thinking of Roth or Sammy after the show. There were some hard-core
Roth fans that even said, `Boy, was I wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Van Halen's confidence persists despite not-so-great record
sales of the March release of ``III,'' which the musician happily
admits was a departure for the 24-year-old act. ``It starts off
with a waltz and ends up with me singing! To me, that's what rock
'n' roll has always been about,'' Van Halen says in his gruff,
early-afternoon voice.
</P>
<P>
   The band's audience, however, has been slow to acknowledge this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, fans face an interesting challenge,'' says Gene
Romano, national director of rock programming for Jacor
Communications, which owns more than 200 radio stations nationwide,
of which 40 are rock stations (including Atlanta's WKLS-FM). ``The
band is perceptibly competing against past band-singer
permutations. Early listener reaction has not been terrific. It may
take awhile for fans to warm up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although two tracks from the album promoted for radio play
achieved brief Top 20 playlist status, and a third _ ``One I Want''
_ is on the way, the tunes aren't bulldozing the airwaves as in Van
Halen's previous incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio in L.A. won't even play us,'' Van Halen says. ``After 20
years! There's not one radio station in our hometown that will play
us. We don't fit their format. We're a rock 'n' roll band, a little
square peg trying to fit into this Spice pothole.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Eddie bitter? Heck, no! He's bemused.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you be, too? If you were married to actress Valerie
Bertinelli and your 7-year-old boy Wolfgang (a.k.a. ``Wolfie'') was
already getting some whammy out of the custom-made miniature guitar
you gave him? If you got to spend every summer, like, totally
rocking America? And, for once, with a hassle-free front man?
</P>
<P>
   ``The (other) three of us were always arguing with the singer,''
Van Halen says. ``I used to wonder, are all singers like this?
What's the deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed reviews and middle age have done nothing to temper the
guitarist's enthusiasm. ``I swear I don't feel it,'' he says.
``It's all frame of mind, too. Last tour, I was on crutches with my
hip. I haven't had the operation yet (for a condition called
vascular necrosis) and I'm jumping around like a maniac. The top of
my hip joint is dead bone and, this is very rare, it's coming back
to life. I cut out the booze, I'm eating healthy, working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me all the time,'' he says, about the band's rowdy
reputation in the '70s, ``and I say it's 99 percent the way it is
now as when we were the so-called `America's premier party band.'
We got pigeonholed.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Guns N' Roses came along to fill the slot in the 1980s
_ right?
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the biggest thing since sliced bread,'' Van Halen
says, reflecting on a group that now consists of its lead singer _
Axl Rose _ and hasn't released a new album in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess bread beat 'em out.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The new set list:
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually had to go out and buy our first record and learn
`I'm the One.' I hadn't played it in 20 years. `Hot for Teacher,'
`Dance the Night Away,' `Romeo Delight,' `Jamie's Crying' ...''
</P>
<P>
   -- The hyper-drive school of guitar: ``I play kind of weird;
it's just the way I play. A lot of people still think that I want
to do a guitar record. Just guitar. If I actually did a solo
record, people would really freak because there probably wouldn't
be guitar on it. There'd be piano, cello. I love playing cello, and
rhythmic stuff. I'm actually more of a rhythm guitarist than I am a
soloist.''
</P>
<P>
   -- His favorite album: ``I love Peter Gabriel. The last record I
bought was `So.' I don't know how long ago that was. The guy moves
me. Gives me goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Musical choices: ``Roth used to say, `Nobody wants to see you
playing piano; you're a guitar hero.' I said, `If I want to play
tuba, I'll damn well do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   -- Why he's not a guitar hero: ``I don't wear a mask. I don't
have a cape. What is that? I take it as a compliment, but it's
pretty funny.''

IN `BASEKETBALL,' BEING A GOOD SPORT IS FOUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``BASEketball'' is the type of movie that few people will see
once. They'll either avoid it, driven away by previews and ads that
make it look aggressively stupid (which it often is), or go back
for repeat viewings to catch all the dialogue and cameos they
missed the first time _ and eventually, rent the video so they can
memorize it.
</P>
<P>
   Couples break up over movies like this. If it's early in your
relationship, and you're not laughing and your date is, it's a
pretty good sign that you're not destined for eternal bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Director David Zucker and his co-writers certainly have their
target audience firmly in mind. Any movie that mixes sports,
``South Park,'' Yasmine Bleeth and Jenny McCarthy isn't going to be
fighting ``Hope Floats'' for fans. (Although you don't have to be
male to enjoy it, as evidenced by the two young women at the
preview screening who laughed loudly at every joke that's been
spoiled by the trailers.)
</P>
<P>
   In a summer when theaters could promote the Lowbrow Comedy of
the Week, ``BASEketball'' falls somewhere between the Farrelly
Brothers' ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Mafia!,'' which
was directed by Jim Abrahams, Zucker's former partner. Like
``Mary,'' it's politically incorrect and sometimes mean-spirited,
featuring gags at the expense of gays and terminally ill children.
Like ``Mafia!,'' it takes an anything-for-a-laugh approach, and how
much it succeeds depends on how much you share its sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the closest thing we've had in a while to a true slob
comedy, that anarchic genre that ``Animal House'' all but invented
20 years ago. ``Mary,'' for all its flouting of convention, doesn't
aim at any establishment targets. ``BASEketball'' takes a direct
bead on the increasingly corrupt and greedy world of professional
sports, with the help of an amazing number of real-life
sportscasters and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to a nonsensical combination of baseball and
basketball concocted by two slackers ``(South Park'' creators Trey
Parker and Matt Stone; Parker's the blond guy) as a way of showing
up some Dockers-clad neighborhood jocks. It's a noncontact sport,
but players are allowed to do ``psych-outs'' _ which are anything
the player can think of to mess up his opponent's shot, and which
make for many of the movie's funniest gags.
</P>
<P>
   After BASEketball becomes a neighborhood sensation, a
Stetson-wearing millionaire (Ernest Borgnine) persuades the guys to
turn it into a professional sport. Although anything goes on the _
field? court? _ the league is a model of integrity, in which teams
aren't allowed to move between cities and players aren't allowed to
sell out, refreshing bylaws in a business where real-life teams
have been known to move out of their hometowns overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But then another millionaire (Robert Vaughn) comes into the
picture, threatening to split up the duo with a Faustian deal;
their partnership is also threatened by a pretty charity worker.
Bleeth plays the good-hearted woman with good-natured humor.
McCarthy is wasted _ if, as an actress, she ``can'' be wasted _ as
the woman who hooks up with both millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans have a head start on everyone else here; the movie
is so loaded with cameos and in-jokes that you practically have to
be an ESPN junkie to get them all. Respected sportscaster Bob
Costas and Al Michaels deliver many funny moments with some fairly
demented play-by-plays; you have to wonder how many takes it took
before they stopped cracking up.
</P>
<P>
   For guys not known as actors, Parker and Stone do a decent
enough job, and they play off of each other well (although in slow
moments you're tempted to tally how many times they say ``Dude!'').
Even though they were cast before ``South Park'' became a
phenomenon, there still are a couple of ``Park''ish moments that
had the show's fans hooting and hollering at the preview screening.
The movie even features a hard-luck supporting character named
Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   Like his crony Abrahams, Zucker often runs out of momentum;
there are a lot of dead spots between the laughs, and the ratio of
successes to flops could generously be put at 50-50. At nearly an
hour and 40 minutes, the movie is too long for this kind of goofy
material, but people with the patience to sit through the closing
credits will be rewarded with a post-credit gag featuring Costas
and Michaels. For many others, though, that 98-minute length will
be about 100 minutes too many.

 &HT;    Hip Hop: The evolution of a genre
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the artist known as Tricky rejects the label, the term
``trip-hop'' has been applied not only to his rumbling,
post-apocalyptic update of the blues, but to nearly anything coming
out of his hometown of Bristol, England.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, when the musical collective Massive Attack formed in
that western English city, the genre has been freely evolving. Its
soundscapes, whether complex or stripped raw, draw on several
sources:
</P>
<P>
   -- The American hip-hop culture.
</P>
<P>
   -- The longer tradition of Jamaican ``sound systems'' _ marathon
parties with dozens of performers, including DJs, rappers,
vocalists, turntables and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   -- And the reggae variant known as dub, often eccentric or
extreme instrumental remixes of songs that can be at once hermetic
and psychedelic (putting the ``trip'' in trip-hop).
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack's 1991 album ``Blue Lines'' established the genre
and introduced listeners to Tricky, Geoff Barrow (who later founded
the band Portishead) and Nellee Hooper (probably best known for
production work on Madonna's ``Bedtime Stories''). The current
edition of the group is touring behind a new album, ``Mezzanine,''
and plays Sept. 6 at the Roxy.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky's breakthrough was the 1995 album ``Maxinquaye,'' named
after his late mother, Maxine Quaye. The album's dense, congested
sound is a Tricky signature, as are convoluted nods to rap
inspirations (an inside-out remake of Public Enemy's ``Black Steel
in the Hour of Chaos,'' for instance).
</P>
<P>
   Portishead is the only trip-hop-affiliated act to come close to
a commercial hit in the United States. ``Sour Times (Nobody Loves
Me),'' from its 1994 debut ``Dummy,'' with its somnambulant vibe
and spy movie motifs, was an ideal mope-fest for coffeehouse
melancholics everywhere. Vocalist Beth Gibbons conveyed a raw
soulfulness, however, that stirred emotion beneath the song's hip
veneer.

 &HT;    `Buffalo' roams but remains lost
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills and Buffalo-born Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo)
have more in common than a hometown. Billy's whole life has been
shaped by the football team. He was born the day the Bills played a
crucial game, something for which his fanatical Bills-loving mother
(Anjelica Huston) has never forgiven him. As a young adult, he made
a foolish, losing bet on the Bills. Unable to pay off his bookie
(Mickey Rourke), he was forced to confess to a crime he didn't
commit, thus landing in prison for five years.
</P>
<P>
   If all of ``Buffalo 66'' worked on this level of insistent,
loopy absurdity, it would be terrific. Unfortunately, Gallo _ a
former Calvin Klein underwear model and sometime actor, making his
writing-directing debut _ doesn't just want us to laugh at Billy's
predicament. He wants us to feel for Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we meet our skanky, bedraggled protagonist the day he gets
out of prison. For reasons never made clear _ or, perhaps, never
made credible _ he decides to visit his parents (Huston and Ben
Gazzara), zoned-out suburbanites who barely gave him the time of
day when they were raising him. En route, he drops by a tap-dancing
class and abducts a voluptuous blond teenager (Christina Ricci).
Her assignment: to pose as his wife during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   So far, not so bad. Huston and Gazzara are chillingly zany, she
with her outsized Bills obsession, he with his lounge-singer
fantasies. But once the young pair leave home, they have nowhere to
go. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66'' is all over the place. It's self-pitying and
sardonic, arty and maudlin. Gallo's appeal on-screen is a matter of
personal taste. Apparently he's something of a hipster's darling,
but he struck me as whiningly one-note. Still, give him credit for
recognizing talent in others. Gazzara and Huston create
etched-in-acid, quick-sketch caricatures. Ricci, meanwhile, takes
full command of a role that's not just underwritten, but unwritten.
A mournful little tap dance in a deserted bowling alley makes no
sense whatsoever in Gallo's script, but it makes all kinds of sense
in Ricci's capable hands (and feet).
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci. Directed by Gallo.
Not rated, but contains strong language, graphic violence and
nudity. At Tara. 1 hour, 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Don't shuffle off to this ``Buffalo.''

 &HT;    How to have a ball, `South Park' style
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big lizard and the giant asteroid let us down. So thank
heaven for the rude boys of summer. In the wake of the Farrelly
brothers and ``There's Something About Mary,'' here come ``South
Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another zesty,
disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``BASEketball,'' and though the guys didn't write
it, their anarchic, tacky spirit comes through in every scene.
That's because it's directed and co-written by David Zucker, who
paved the way for anything-goes, taste-defying humor with
``Airplane!'' and the ``Naked Gun'' flicks back when Parker and
Stone were still pooping their pants. (Given their sense of humor,
that might not have been so long ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone play Coop and Remer, two slackers who invent a
hybrid of baseball and basketball in their driveway. Basically,
it's designed to be as un-strenuous as possible. Five years later,
it's a national sport, complete with mock-up garage-front playing
field and barely dressed cheerleaders. The rules: Score base runs
by shooting hoops. When the other team is up, the challenge is to
psych out rival players to make them flub their shots. (Prime
psych-outs include I-slept-with-your-mama jokes, or putting a
player to sleep by playing a books-on-tape parody of ``The Horse
Whisperer.'')
</P>
<P>
   As the boys play around the country, the movie takes swipes at
various cities. In San Francisco, for instance, the cheerleaders
are buff, shirtless men. Here, Parker parodies a Foster's beer
commercial, climaxing with a bared rear, and yells, ``That wasn't a
gay joke, that was an Australian joke!''
</P>
<P>
   That's debatable. ``BASEketball'' manages to be racist, sexist,
homophobic and just about everything else. But it does so in a way
that kiddingly tweaks the very notion of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Take Yasmine Bleeth, who plays the guys' dream girl and the
director of the Dream Come True foundation. Instead of calling her
kids ``terminally ill,'' she prefers ``health-challenged and
survival-impaired.'' One little boy with liver disease takes the
place of ``Mary's'' little dog as the target of extreme slapstick
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   So does ``Squeak'' (Dian Bachar), the fellows' diminutive pal,
also known as ``Little Bitch.'' Tossed around nearly as much as the
titular ball, Bachar gets a prime moment in ``BASEketball's''
gleeful spoof of movie cliches: When Coop and Remer have their
inevitable falling-out, Squeak gives them a hackneyed lecture about
sportsmanship ... while dressed as a giant pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, if it matters, has the boys struggling to keep
ownership of their team (the Beers) away from an evil businessman
(Robert Vaughn) and the sexpot widow (Jenny McCarthy) of the
original owner (Ernest Borgnine). Like much else in the movie, the
conflict is just a chance to throw in sight gags and allow Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Bob Costas, Al Michaels and Robert Stack to tweak
their own images. And if you wonder what Kato Kaelin has been doing
lately, you'll find an answer here.
</P>
<P>
   ``BASEketball'' lives up to its title. It is base. It's also a
ball. But if you can live without the sight of male lactation, you
may want to sit this game out.

   Puff Daddy heads fest that also features R&AMP;B at the Georgia Dome
</P>
<P>
   By Sonia Murray
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Two of the biggest names in pop music last year
finally make it to Atlanta this Saturday: Puffy and Missy.
</P>
<P>
   That's short for Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs and Missy
``Misdemeanor'' Elliott, both longtime million-selling producers
who made it to the top of the charts in 1997 when they finally
debuted as rappers. They are among the most anticipated performers
in the 10-act Budweiser Superfest at the Georgia Dome, which is
expected to last at least six hours and draw tens of thousands of
fans.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Puffy and Missy are no longer on every other song
you hear and in just about every video you see _ a slam that was
thrown Puffy's way at one point. But they continue to be major
influences in pop music and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   While Combs has had the No. 1 rap single nationally for the past
month _ ``Come With Me,'' a song from the ``Godzilla'' soundtrack
featuring Jimmy Page _ it gets little airplay on Atlanta's urban
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The song probably isn't in heavy rotation on R&AMP;B and rap
stations because of its rock backdrop, says Jermaine Dupri, Atlanta
producer, rapper and label president and Combs' friend and peer.
``But Puffy himself is kind of cooling out now, doing his thing
behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes scenes in an untitled Oliver Stone movie in which
Combs, 28, will make his film debut as a football player. Filming
for the project, which will include Al Pacino, begins in September.
(Combs supposedly got his nickname when he was a high school
football player; teammates said the thin teenager would often
``puff out'' his chest to look bigger.)
</P>
<P>
   Combs also has plans for Atlanta. He and LaFace Records
co-President Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid plan to open Justin's, a
Caribbean-themed restaurant, in mid-September in the former Coco
Pazzo location on Peachtree Road. It will be the second spot Combs
has launched and named for his 4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to call me a rapper or whatever, but I consider
myself an entertainer, and I want to be involved in all of the
various forms of entertainment,'' said Combs, whose manager, Benny
Medina, helped guide Will Smith from music to movies as well.
``Atlanta is like home for me,'' continues Combs, a Harlem native,
who did not bring his ``No Way Out'' tour to Atlanta last year
because the city lacked a suitable venue. (The Omni had been
demolished and the Hawks monopolized the Dome.) His decision to
skip Atlanta prompted local radio stations V-103 and Hot 97.5 to
circulate petitions to bring the tour here. The effort failed, but
it didn't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some love, man,'' Combs remarked. ``And I can't wait to
get back onstage and return that love to my fans in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's first public performance here, meanwhile, will be one
of the last she'll do anywhere for some time. The 25-year-old has
spent the first half of her summer as the lone hip-hop act on the
Lilith Fair tour. That was time the lyricist (for Mariah Carey,
Aaliyah and SWV) could have spent on projects for Whitney Houston,
R&AMP;B trio Total, the ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' soundtrack and
her own new label, Gold Mind Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad she's got my project out of the way,'' said Nicole
Wray (``Make It Hot''), 17, the first artist on Elliott's roster.
``Because she's got so much on her plate now I'd have to think I
would be standing in line behind Whitney or Scary Spice,'' with
whom Elliott has recorded the first ``Fools'' single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missy is like my idol,'' added Da Brat, the first female
rapper to sell a million records. ``I mean she just keeps coming
with the hits, for herself, and whoever can afford her these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Budweiser Superfest
</P>
<P>
   With Puff Daddy, Mase, Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott, LSG and
others.
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. Saturday. Georgia Dome, 1 Georgia Dome Drive N.W. $40.75,
$45.75 and $52.75.
</P>
<P>
   The Budweiser Superfest rounds up some of today's most popular
rap and rhythm-and-blues acts. A rundown:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sean ``Puffy'' Combs: Producer, rapper and two-time Grammy
Award winner. Has two singles on Billboard's rap Top 10: ``Come
With Me'' (at No. 1 for the fifth week) and ``Lookin' at Me,'' with
the million-selling rapper Mase.
</P>
<P>
   -- Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott: The mass appeal of this
producer-rapper's hits for herself (``The Rain'') and others has
made her a Gap and Sprite spokeswoman and put her in Whitney
Houston's stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dru Hill: The quartet (``In My Bed'') that has stepped in as
the gospel-tinged, gritty R&AMP;B act while Jodeci is away.
</P>
<P>
   -- Montell Jordan: Just when the R&AMP;B singer thought ``This Is
How We Do It'' would be his biggest single, ``Let's Ride,'' with
Master P, put him back on the road to No. 1 status.
</P>
<P>
   -- K-Ci and Jo Jo: Jodeci's lead singers venture out on their
own and away from the previous R&AMP;B act's more promiscuous lyrics
(``All My Life'').
</P>
<P>
   -- Lil' Kim: Rap's million-selling equivalent to Madonna back
when the Material Girl was posing naked for ``Sex'' and wearing
bras as tops.
</P>
<P>
   -- LSG: Established crooners Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat and
Johnny Gill succeed at appealing to the young.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mase: Monotone, slow-talking rapper made his way quickly into
prominence alongside Puff Daddy (``Can't Nobody Hold Me Down'').
</P>
<P>
   -- 112: Atlanta quartet touted as the gentlemen on the Bad Boy
label. Best known for their vulnerable ballads (``Cupid'').
</P>
<P>
   -- Timbaland: One of urban music's most forward-thinking
producers. Tim ``Timbaland'' Mosely often sets Missy's lyrics to
music.

 &HT;    Visual ``Lolita'' not as good as the book
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some books are just good at being books. They aren't cut out for
synergy. Vladimir Nabokov's ``Lolita'' is a masterpiece _ it ranked
fourth on the Modern Library's recent list of this century's 100
best English language novels. A satiric, self-aware, lushly playful
roadtrip through the mind of a 37-year-old Englishman obsessed with
a 12-year-old American nymphet, Nabokov's ``Lolita'' spins its
tawdry subject into provocative art.
</P>
<P>
   The $58 million movie adaptation that arrives on pay cable's
Showtime (9 p.m. EDT Sunday) doesn't manage the same trick.
Directed by Adrian Lyne (``Fatal Attraction,'' ``9 1/2 Weeks''),
with Jeremy Irons as the obsessed Humbert, this ``Lolita'' is
smart, gorgeous, tastefully brave (sexy without any real sex) _but
finally a payoff-free crawl through a world a little too creepy to
take the time to watch.
</P>
<P>
   As a novel, ``Lolita's'' forbidden eroticism isn't always front
and center. What Nabokov's masterly hands created wasn't just a
voyeur's kick _ when the book was finally published in the U.S. in
1958 (four years after its Paris printing), those who thumbed
through it for the juicy parts quickly found themselves tangled in
the bramble of Nabokov's inspired alliteration.
</P>
<P>
   But this movie adaptation (which itself took two years to reach
wide U.S. distribution from Europe) keeps our eyes, like Humbert's,
always lurking for the chance peek: the bare midriff, the legs
bicycling in bed, the dress lifted just to there. It makes us
Humbert's accomplice, rather than the rapt listener we are in the
novel. It's ... creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Irons is practically perfect; with his lipless mouth and
eyelids that blink a half-moment after his every pathetic thought,
he totes a comic air of self-rebuke. A post-World War Two
continental, Humbert arrives at a New England town the summer
before he begins teaching at a college. He's soon greeted at the
house with a room for rent by Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith), a
man-hunting widow who runs it.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert is about to sprint from Charlotte _ or is it the
cartoon-like Griffith? _ when he spots her daughter Lolita
(15-year-old unknown Dominque Swain), who's getting nice and wet
under a lawn sprinkler. He stays.
</P>
<P>
   Swain is practically perfect herself. She's all antsy, random
hormones _ one minute a languid, sashaying coquette, the next
sticking gum under a dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   It's when ``Lolita'' turns on its own inherent unsavoriness that
watching it almost seems worthwhile. Like the moment early on when
Lolita bends over the back of a chair, in a classic Vargas girlie
pose, and leans in close to the pinned-to-his-seat Humbert. As he
holds his breath in agonized expectancy, Lolita purrs, ``Am I
getting a zit?''
</P>
<P>
   But as the movie takes its sweet time moving along, we feel less
and less like sharing in Humbert's fetish. When Lolita also catches
the perverted eye of Clare Quilty (Frank Langella), a kiddie-porn
lovin' playwright, we, like Lolita, are given a choice between
Creep and Creepier.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a movie this well done, not much of a choice.
</P>

 &HT;    When D-DAY hit home
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bedford, Va. -- What Lucille Boggess remembers most clearly
about D-Day is this: ``The dog howled all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess was 15 on June 6, 1944, and the radio had been blaring
reports that thousands of Allied troops had stormed the beaches of
Normandy in faraway France.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents began to worry from the moment they learned that the
long-awaited invasion was on. They knew her two eldest brothers,
Bedford, 30, and Raymond Hoback, 24, were in Company A of the 116th
Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division. And in England.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents suspected, Boggess says today, that her brothers
were taking part in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   They were. What the family wouldn't know until a month after
D-Day was that both had been killed within 15 minutes of hitting
the beach. And so had 19 other Bedford boys in Company A of the
116th, a federalized Virginia National Guard regiment.
</P>
<P>
   Boggess, now 69, believes her family's dog somehow sensed her
parents' fears. Whatever the cause, the plaintive cries certainly
marked an end to her easygoing, fun-loving way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford, then a bucolic village of 3,200 souls nestled beside
the Blue Ridge Mountains, would become synonymous with sacrifice.
Per capita, this picturesque burg lost more men on the beaches of
Normandy on D-Day than any other American village, town or city.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years later, many who remember the invasion have
died, and others have moved in. Yet World War II is still very much
a presence, and so Steven Spielberg's horrific D-Day saga, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' is particularly resonant.
</P>
<P>
   The movie depicts the chaos and carnage among the 29th Division,
the first wave to hit what was code-named ``Omaha Beach.'' For
Boggess, it was hard to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sort of tried to insulate myself,'' she says. ``I
couldn't think of my brothers in something so terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess, longtime revenue commissioner, serves on the board of
the National D-Day Memorial Foundation, created by Congress to
erect a $12 million memorial in Bedford to honor the 1,200
Americans who died in the invasion that day. The foundation relies
on donations; to date only about half the money has been collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the movie raises interest that will help raise money
for the D-Day monument,'' she says. ``I don't like war movies, but
this one may do some good. Spielberg will reach people who never
would have known.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the consensus around Bedford, a town too small
for a movie theater, where people have been talking about ``Private
Ryan'' and in some cases traveling the 30 miles west to Roanoke to
see it.
</P>
<P>
   One who did last Friday, in a special viewing for D-Day vets,
was Ray Nance, 84. As a first lieutenant in Company A, Nance was
wounded three times on Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie will be a good thing,'' he says, showing a visitor
French money and a $5 bill signed by some buddies on his landing
craft. ``The movie was the most realistic I've ever seen, but
still, nothing can come close to the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stevens, 78, the only other living member of the 116th in
Bedford, went to the movie because he knew he'd be asked about it
and also to ``get people thinking about D-Day, before we're all
gone. People still go to Appomattox, and they should always
remember D-Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' twin brother, Ray, was one of the Bedford boys lost
that day. Stevens found out four days later, when he saw a cross
with dog tags tacked to it in a temporary graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had Ray's name on it,'' he says. ``Losing my twin, that was
terrible. I still think of him, but I don't dote. He's buried over
here at Longwood Cemetery. I don't think about it much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Many D-Day veterans echo that sentiment, but some say it's time
to speak, because their generation is disappearing fast. Of 5,000
men who landed with the 116th Regiment _ the successor to Stonewall
Jackson's fabled Civil War unit _ only about 200 are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Boggess says there are good reasons many WWII vets haven't
talked much about the war. Like the fictional Ryan, they wrestle
with the knowledge that many others died while they were saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of guilt,'' she says. ``So many died.
Those who lived felt funny, no matter how brave they were. And
people who stayed at home felt funny. Especially in Bedford. It
really wasn't until about 1984, the 40th anniversary, that D-Day
began to come into focus in this community, even though we had the
big 10-year anniversary event.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1954, thousands came for the dedication of a modest
D-Day monument made of granite carved from the caves of
Vierville-sur-mer, France, near where Company A went ashore. A
bronze plaque bears the names of the 21 Bedford men of Company A
who died, plus two in other units. The monument's significance is
evident in its prominent location _ directly in front of the town's
Confederate memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Boggess says the community seems split between those who know
about Bedford's sacrifice and those who don't know or don't care.
The reason: For years, it just wasn't discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people, just like the men, felt they had done what they
had to do, what anybody would do. It was only when we had the
anniversaries that people realized what an incredible price this
little tiny town paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the silence, she says, Bedford still hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a generation,'' she says, gesturing toward the 1954
monument. ``You can't take so many young men out of a town the size
of Bedford and not change it. It's hard to comprehend the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother felt that, she says, ``everyone needed to die a
little after losing her two boys. A part of her died when they did.
She sobbed and cried. My dad would go out to the barn and cry
alone. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom didn't want to go on outings again. Our outings
stopped. We stopped having fun. It was almost like she didn't want
life to continue, that it wasn't fair for us to have fun. It's
never been like it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Gaston, pastor of Bedford Presbyterian Church,
found out fast that many Bedfordians seem deeply scarred by D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here a few years ago, I knew I needed to understand
the community,`` says Gaston, 39. ``I was sitting there with a
longtime member, and tears started streaming down her face when she
described what it was like when the rash of telegrams started
coming in. It was so terrible to her still, she said the greatest
thing to her was to go to a Presbyterian camp, where there were no
reminders. You could almost sense her own guilt that she felt good
to have a chance to get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a cloud hanging over the community when 50
years later, people still cry about it,'' Gaston says, looking at a
D-Day poster in the city museum. ``The town is healing, but it's
not quite healed.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess hopes the movie may help with the healing and that the
dedication of the national memorial, planned for June 6, 2000, will
too. Both can help older residents come to terms with the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Both can also educate younger people about the community's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a generation, mine, that was profoundly affected,''
Boggess says. ``Then we had a generation that grew up in the shadow
of it. And a lot of people in the younger group now don't know much
about it at all. That's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Saunders, a 17-year-old college freshman, complains he
hasn't been taught much about World War II, let alone Bedford's
sacrifice at D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense I have to learn about D-Day in a
movie,'' he says. ``It was talk all my life about Vietnam. My dad's
generation wanted to forget World War II because of Vietnam, to
forget about war.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford Museum director Ellen Wandrei, 50, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd bet you'd find that most kids here are clueless about
D-Day,'' says the former teacher and mother of two grown sons, one
a member of the 116th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an adult before I learned one of my uncles helped
liberate Dachau. He didn't talk about things and people didn't ask.
My peers had Vietnam and people didn't want to think about war.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gross, 61, Bedford's city manager, says there's always been
a kind of gentleman's agreement not to dwell on Bedford's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some level, it's always been on people's minds,'' he says.
``I don't think Bedford has gotten over it. It's like the red soil,
it's just there _ D-Day. It's like it's just below the surface. It
hurts too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Teass, 75, knew almost all the Bedford boys who died.
As the town's telegraph operator, she got the first word of the
D-Day disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from Roanoke _ `casualties coming.' I don't know how
many it was, maybe five or seven at first. And then they just kept
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   After that muggy summer, she muses, Bedford changed. ``People
didn't talk as much on the streets. It became a calm, quiet, sad
town. Everything was different. It's mighty sad when a community so
small gets hit so hard. I hope it never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess says she's gotten over the hurt as much as she ever
will, but she'll never forget the dreadful summer of '44.
</P>
<P>
   She was a teenager, anticipating seeing her friends at Sunday
church services, when the county sheriff pulled into the driveway
of her family's farmhouse five weeks after D-Day. The sheriff
delivered the telegram that said her brother Bedford had been
killed at D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, it seemed, all of Center Point Methodist
Church, right across the street, was in our front yard,'' she
recalls. ``Everybody was crying and hugging.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the sheriff returned. This time he handed her
parents a telegram saying that her brother Raymond had disappeared
at Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men later told me he was shot,'' she says. ``He got shot
at low tide. They said his wounds weren't mortal, but at high tide
he washed out to sea, and his body was never found.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to visit brother Bedford's grave in September when
about 40 local folks travel to Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Nance won't be going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll go sometime, by myself, with my family,'' he
ponders, staring at a yard-long faded photo of Company A hanging on
a hallway wall. ``I'd want to see where I went in, where I looked
up at that church steeple. But I don't want to go with a crowd.
It's too personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance's combat career began and ended on D-Day. His wounds, just
below his lip near his throat, in his right foot and his trigger
finger, took months to mend, and the war ended before he could be
shipped to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He and other surviving members of the 116th Regiment often talk
in the present tense about their experiences, instantly recalling
names of men they haven't seen since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Nance points to a faded photo in his hallway. ``There, that's
John Wilkes. He was killed. Leslie Abbot there was klled. And
Elmere Wright was killed. John D. Clifton. Frank Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's Overstreet. He made it. Jack Powers was killed.
Gillaspie, Nick I think it was, got it. Here I am. I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stevens, who flies Old Glory in his front yard every day,
hasn't decided yet if he's going to France with the Bedford group.
He last saw his brother Ray early on the morning of D-Day when the
two men, both platoon leaders, headed for separate landing craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray stuck his hand out, wanting me to shake it, and I reminded
him we'd agreed to meet on the beach,'' Stevens said. ``But that
didn't happen. He'd told me a couple of times he didn't think he'd
make it. Maybe he knew. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A medic told me Ray was shot with machine-gun fire. I didn't
believe it. I couldn't believe it. We'd bought 136 acres and were
going to farm it together. I farm it now, but he never got the
chance. He never had kids and grandkids like me and never had a
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The war ended for Stevens on June 30, when he was hit by
shrapnel a few miles away from the beach at Ste.-Lo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain,'' he says. ``I miss Ray. Always have. But
I'm not bitter like I was at first. I liked to got killed trying to
get revenge for Ray. But you can't. You just have to go on. Ray and
I had big plans. It just didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom has its cost.''

AIR FORCE CAPTAIN FINED IN MARIJUANA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott R. Clarke, a 28-year-old Air Force captain, will not be
going to jail or dismissed from the military because of charges he
smoked marijuana and fraternized with enlisted personnel. Instead,
a court martial panel in Germany Thursday ruled that Clarke should
be reprimanded and fined $3,000 after finding him guilty of reduced
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved that he is not going to jail,'' said Clarke's
mother, Christine, who had criticized the Air Force for going ahead
with the court martial despite disputed evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said Clarke, of Medford, Mass., was found
guilty of attempted use of marijuana on one occasion last October
and several instances of fraternizing with enlisted personnel. The
decision by a seven-member military panel followed a four-day
hearing at the US Air Force Base in Spangdahlem, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Tufts University, Clarke's five-year Air Force
career was marked by uninterrupted promotions and commendations
until he was charged with the offenses last October. They stemmed
from allegations he had smoked marijuana at a going-away party for
an Air Force colleague at his house in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The most direct evidence against Clarke came from himself. While
nearly a dozen others at the party said no marijuana had been
smoked, Clarke told investigators he believed when he put a
hand-rolled cigarette to his lips on a back porch that it was
marijuana, but that he was too drunk to know for sure. The two
women who were with him at the time denied it was marijuana and
said the cigarette consisted of only regular tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The judges reduced the marijuana charge, which carries a maximum
two-year sentence, to attempted use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternization charge stemmed from Clarke's socializing with
several enlisted Air Force men and women with whom he had become
friendly after being assigned to Vokel Air Force Base in the
Netherlands in October 1996. Military policy bans fraternization to
the extent that it might give the appearance of favoritism or
adversely affect morale, discipline, or respect for authority.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke acknowledged to investigators that he was friendly with
several enlisted members. But his lawyers argued that his
leadership was not adversely affected and that Vokel AFB was such a
small facility, with only seven officers, that officers would
inevitably socialize with enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting on Clarke's pending court martial in June, The
Globe found that he was the first Air Force officer in at least a
year to be charged with only fraternization when the alleged
offense did not also involve improper sexual activity. All 10 Air
Force officers court-martialed for fraternization last year also
faced other charges, including adultery, sodomy, or indecent sexual
assault.

HUN SEN SAYS KING SIHANOUK HAS APPROVED COALITION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodia's leader, Hun Sen, offered
Thursday to form a three-way coalition government with his chief
rivals as additional returns in the parliamentary election on
Sunday appeared to confirm his predictions of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen spoke after meeting with King Norodom Sihanouk in the
ancient capital of Siem Reap and said the king had approved his
plan to share power with Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who is the
king's son, and Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said it was premature to talk of coalitions. Both
have filed official protests contending that Hun Sen stole the
election and both have threatened to boycott the new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Both are also bitter enemies of Hun Sen, who staged a coup a
year ago and ousted Ranariddh, leader of the FUNCINPEC royalist
party, as his partner in a previous coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy charges that Hun Sen was trying to kill him in March
1996 when four grenades were thrown at a rally he was holding,
killing 16 people and wounding more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Although most foreign election monitors coordinated by the
United Nations endorsed the conduct of the election, reports began
accumulating Thursday that supporters of the opposition were facing
threats and intimidation now that the election was over and foreign
observers were leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations and an independent monitoring group
called the Asian Network for Free Elections reported that dozens of
opposition members had fled to the capital from provincial towns
and villages where they were being threatened with reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. human
rights envoy to Cambodia, voiced concern. ``It is very important
that the political leadership make very clear they will take a
strong stance against attempts to settle scores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen, who heads the Cambodian People's Party, is leading in
the slow vote count. But it appears certain that he will need to
form a coalition with at least one of his rivals in order to reach
the two-thirds of Parliament's 122 seats that are needed to create
a government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to his majesty the king about the possibility of
having a coalition government between the CPP, FUNCINPEC and Sam
Rainsy,'' Hun Sen said as he left Siem Reap for Phnom Penh. ``His
majesty the king was pleased with the idea and would like to see
cooperation between the three parties in a coalition government,
giving a favorable atmosphere for national reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading independent poll-watch group, the Committee for Free
and Fair Elections, projected Thursday that the Cambodian People's
Party would win 59 seats, while FUNCINPEC was projected to win 45.
Sam Rainsy's party, which bears the name of the candidate, was
projected to win 18.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary official results were not expected until this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we have not yet received the result we cannot say
anything about a coalition,'' Ranariddh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the coalition offer ``premature,'' Sam Rainsy's party
issued a statement saying, ``If reports of irregularities and
electoral fraud are resolved, and the results of the elections are
shown to be valid, then we will accept those results and consider
our position on the formation of a coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   One Western diplomat was skeptical that a three-way coalition
could survive the stresses of the personal animosities and clashing
ambitions of the men involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is precisely the volatility of Hun Sen, the fickleness of
the prince and the provocativeness of Sam Rainsy that would make
this difficult to sustain,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's offer laid out his bargaining position for a possible
coalition, reserving the political plums for himself. ``I can say
clearly that as prime minister I have the right to choose five
important ministries for the CPP _ defense, interior, justice,
finance and foreign affairs,'' he said. He also proposed that Chea
Sim, the president of his own party, remain as chairman of the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy could become deputy
prime ministers. &QL;

`FABRIZIO PLESSI': A LIVELY BEGINNING TO A NEW SERIES ON MEDIA ART
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Exhibition notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Using the pompous title ``European Perspectives on
the Media Arts,'' the Guggenheim Museum's SoHo branch has ushered
in a series of shows that focus on ``media art practices'' in
Europe, exploring the work of key artists in the field. Fabrizio
Plessi, an Italian known for his large video installations,
inaugurates this new series, and this show is his New York debut as
well. Despite the unpromisingly academic title of the series,
Plessi gets it off to a lively start.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, he has provided four big installations for the
Guggenheim SoHo's ground-floor galleries, each given its own room.
If there's a common theme to them, it's the clever theatrical play
of video imagery with real substances and situations: water, stone,
metal, architectural elements and the like. Starting out in the
1970s, Plessi was involved with performance and Conceptual Art,
eventually turning from the use of video for recording such work to
exploring its potential as installation art in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Today he uses the technology to enhance and interpret the
mysterious realms of nature and history, mixing the virtual with
the real, so to speak. (He is professor of the humanization of
technologies at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, Germany.)
Take, for instance, the show's most impressive piece, ``Baroque
Cathodic Movements'' (1996), in which three ominous-looking wooden
structures, painted black and echoing 17th-century architectural
motifs, gyrate from the ceiling in slow, asynchronous rotations.
Each resembles a sort of furnace whose maw contains amazingly
real-looking video flames that appear to be consuming the ancient
architecture with a fierce roar. Ultratheatrical, a ballet in
themselves, they suggest coffins for the past while conveying a
shivery sense of hellfire and brimstone.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Plessi has been especially taken with the
movement of water, a preoccupation evident in two other works here.
In ``Rome II'' (1988), video monitors pave the rim of a large ring
built up of travertine marble pieces. Each of the monitors is alive
with the image and sounds of a turbulent patch of the Tiber River.
The images are identical, but each seems to move from one monitor
to the next, giving the sense of a rhythmical, relentless flow. The
water and the endless ring are intended to invoke the spirit of
Rome as the Eternal City, but even apart from these connotations
the piece has a hypnotic presence.
</P>
<P>
   A less successful work is ``Liquid Crystals'' (1993), inspired
by the canals and, I suppose, the ancient tradition of glassmaking
in Venice, where Plessi mainly lives and works. Five hundred empty
glasses are suspended upside down from the ceiling of this enclosed
piece, poised over 14 zinc buckets of bubbling water. The water in
the buckets looks very real, yet it's created by images on video
monitors concealed in each bucket, accompanied by appropriate
watery plops and squooshes. While intended as a metaphorical
reference to Venice, the work comes off instead as not much more
than a glitzy piece of decor. (It was commissioned by the Caffe
Florian in Venice for display there.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That can't be said of ``Bronx,'' a piece done for the 1986
Venice Biennale, which perhaps is surprising because it refers to a
turf that, while alive to New Yorkers, presumably doesn't have much
vibrancy overseas. Yet the Bronx does, apparently, resonate with
Plessi, if only as a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing it less as a place than a condition of ``separation and
isolation,'' as he says in a catalog note about the work, he evokes
the borough with a lineup of 26 video monitors, each with a
workman's shovel seemingly stuck into the middle of a screen that
reflects it in a fiery orange glow. If the piece suggests more the
past history of, say, Pittsburgh than the Bronx, never mind. In his
statement, Plessi holds that the work does not attempt to describe,
but to generate ``strong signals.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in technical brilliance and imagination, Plessi's work
scores high. As video shows go, his is one of the real _ not
virtual _ events of the year.

ITALY SAYS `MIRACLE' CANCER CURE DOESN'T WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Dr. Luigi Di Bella, an 85-year-old physiologist in Modena
who says he discovered a miracle cancer treatment, has for the last
year held center stage in Italy as he fought _ and almost won _ an
astonishing battle for legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed by some as a savior, derided by others as a dangerous
crackpot, Di Bella suffered a setback this week when government
tests of his method indicated that it does not work. But those
preliminary findings did not just tarnish his credibility. They
also shed dramatic light on how human desperation _ and a huge
lobbying campaign _ forced the Italian public health system to
provide a treatment without any proof of its efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 cancer patients were permitted to take the Di
Bella treatment free of charge before any serious clinical tests
had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not possible to resist the pressure from judges and the
media, who declared the treatment valid before it was tested,''
Rosario Bindi, Italy's minister of health, said Thursday in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was accused of killing hope,'' she said bitterly. ``But
there was no scientific evidence to support even the clinical
trials. They were forced on us by a social malady that swept this
country. Once we allowed the clinical trials, we could not limit it
to small numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Ms. Bindi's office issued the results of an initial
part of the first nationwide test of the treatment. A panel of
Italian and foreign doctors concluded that not one of 134 patients
showed any improvement after two months of treatment. Seventy-five
percent of the patients either grew sicker or died. Forty-nine
percent were found to have toxic side-effects from the cocktail of
vitamins, drugs and a growth-inhibiting hormone called somatostatin
that makes up the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Di Bella, who says he has cured 10,000 patients with his
treatment with the mixture, was unrepentant, insisting that the
trials had been rigged by oncologists jealous of his success.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bindi initially resisted calls to make the treatment
available free of charge, as are more orthodox cancer treatments
like chemotherapy. But public pressure was overwhelming. A kind of
mass hysteria drove thousands of cancer patients and their families
to hold rallies and sit-ins before government buildings and in St.
Peter's Square. In a February Vatican address, Pope John Paul II
called for ``reconciliation'' between Di Bella followers and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what kind of pressure we were under; society
was set to explode,'' said Dino Amadori, president of the Italian
Oncological Society, who also took part in the clinical trials.
``Our office was getting death threats.''
</P>
<P>
   In December a local judge ordered the health authorities in
Lecce, a town in Puglia, to administer the Di Bella treatment
without charge to a 2-year-old boy with a cancerous brain tumor.
The boy died this month, but that case unleashed a number of legal
actions. Politicians leaped in, as right-wing opposition parties
championed Di Bella and accused the government of costing lives.
Local administrations in Puglia and Lombardy independently began
sponsoring the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In February the Health Ministry relented and said it would put
600 patients with breast, colon and other forms of cancer in an
intensive clinical study. The number was later reduced to 397. For
the duration of the testing, the ministry also said it would permit
2,000 patients with the same cancer diagnoses as those in the
clinical study to get the Di Bella treatment free, under
observation by the public health service. The mixture, which was
costing $350 a day until the government pressed pharmaceutical
companies to lower their prices, still costs about $60 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In May the Constitutional Court ruled that by limiting the
number of patients who could get the treatment without charge, the
government was enforcing economic discrimination. That forced the
government to offer the treatment to any cancer patient who
requested it, for as long as the clinical trials were being held.
</P>
<P>
   The full conclusions are expected in September or October. But
the negative results obtained with the first 134 patients have
already led the Health Ministry to pull them off the treatment, as
well as those who were getting state-supported treatment for the
same protocols and whose symptoms have worsened.
</P>
<P>
   The reputation of Di Bella, a reclusive man with a vast,
fanatical following in Italy, has spread across the world. Last
June he traveled to Canada to explain his method. But he has long
resisted backing his claims with scientifically documented
evidence. ``They failed to show us any objective evidence that this
treatment has efficacy,'' said Dr. Victor Fornasier, a Canadian
pathologist who led a delegation to Modena in March.
</P>
<P>
   Italian health officials justify their actions by saying the
additional 2,000 patients they put under observation would have
sought out the treatment from any of the dozens of doctors who are
followers of Di Bella, paying their own way without any independent
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   But by administering the treatment in state-run clinics, however
experimentally, the government ran a different ethical risk: giving
vulnerable people the impression that it condoned an unproven
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   American medical ethics experts, who have watched similar
lobbying crusades for alternative cancer treatments like laetrile,
were appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is grotesquely outrageous,'' said Barrie Cassileth, an
American medical ethics expert and author of ``The Alternative
Medicine Handbook.'' ``It is malpractice on the part of public
health services to offer an untested, unscientific method as a real
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Di Bella alone seems serene. ``For me, nothing has changed,'' he
said in an interview Thursday. ``I will continue my work. I am
guided by truth, and scientific truth doesn't depend on a
government decree.''

CONGRESS URGED TO PROTECT PROGRAM FOR UNMARRIED FATHERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unmarried fathers told House lawmakers Thursday
that a federal program that helps them remain actively involved
with their children works and should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, introduced earlier this year by Rep. E. Clay Shaw
Jr., R-Fla., would provide $2 billion to states over five years to
help pay for projects where fathers would learn how to actively
support their children.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4 of every 10 children in America are growing up without
a father in their home, according to a 1996 Census Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we must move beyond simply helping mothers work,''
Shaw, chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on human
resources, said in a prepared statement. ``We must take the next
step by doing everything we can to increase the number of our
nation's children being raised in two-parent families.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Downing, 29, of Baltimore told the subcommittee that
Healthy Start, a Baltimore-based private, nonprofit group that
promotes child care, helped him get off of drugs and find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Downing took his son 12-year-old son, Victor Jr., to the
subcommittee hearing. Downing said he admired the men he saw in the
Healthy Start group. It took him a long time to join, he testified,
but the people at Healthy Start ``never gave up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Downing, who said he has been off cocaine and heroin for seven
months, said he was getting into fights over drugs in the streets
before he finally joined the program.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the benefits has been a closer relationship with
his son, who is now in the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his testimony, Downing nodded at his son and said,
``That's my best friend there.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy Start receives $5 million from the Department of Health
and Human Services, but that money will be cut in half starting in
October. Supporters of the program, and about 50 others like it in
the nation, are urging Congress to restore the money and protect
programs for fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Another Baltimore man, Paul Hope, told lawmakers he also broke a
drug addiction with the help of Healthy Start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't joined the group, by now I would be dead or in
prison for life,'' Hope, 25, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hope said the program changed the way he looks at life. He no
longer carries a firearm, he said, and his two children and their
mothers have been off welfare since he joined the program five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Current support programs for fathers work, said Joseph Jones,
director of services for men at Healthy Start.
</P>
<P>
   The main Healthy Start program was founded to reduce infant
mortality by finding pregnant mothers and providing support. The
program for men, which has about 200 participants, grew out of the
mother's program. Jones said counselors try to contact the men who
fathered the babies, and then work with them to find jobs and set
up support groups to help them understand the role of a father.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, himself a former drug addict and now a married father of
three, said most men at Healthy Start are on welfare and have an
average education level of ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just not enough (role) models'' in the inner city,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The programs like Healthy Start are not expensive, according to
Jones, and the benefits outweigh the costs. The project uses less
than $2,000 a year per person, which is a ``drop in the bucket''
compared to the costs of time in prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A man can come in unprepared for responsibility, Jones said, but
after participating in the program, ``he becomes a candidate for
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the legislation also requires the programs to
promote marriage and two-parent families.

ing: Intersecting Stories By Alice Mattison. Quill/Morrow, $13.
Many of the New Haven teachers, lawyers and social workers who
populate these whimsical tales are domestic but hardly
domesticated, as they squirm in the intellectual and social shadow
cast by Yale. `` Mattison is a charmer,'' Dwight Garner said last
year in the Book Review. ''It's a joy to tune into her characters'
thoughts.''

<P>
   The Women
</P>
<P>
   By Hilton Als. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $11. Three
quirky, highly personal portraits explore the themes of racial and
sexual identity by mixing memoir, literary criticism and
reflections on politics and psychology. The subjects are the
author's spirited mother, who moved to Brooklyn from Barbados;
Dorothy Dean, a brilliant but self-destructive fixture in New
York's gay scene in the 60's and 70's; and the Harlem poet and
dramatist Owen Dodson, who was Hilton Als's mentor and lover. In
1997 our reviewer, Andrea Lee, admired the ''almost magical
cohesiveness'' of these ''truly original'' essays, calling this ''a
book to read several times, noting how its application grows
broader and broader upon consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Good Brother
</P>
<P>
   By Chris Offutt. Scribner, $12. After his brother is killed,
Virgil Caudill tries to escape a blood feud in his Kentucky hill
town by fleeing to Montana, but he can't shake the past or the
psychological pull of his homeland. Last year in these pages, Jo
Ann Kiser called this ''a fine first novel by a fierce writer.''
</P>
<P>
   T. Rex and the Crater of Doom
</P>
<P>
   By Walter Alvarez. Vintage, $13. A geologist describes how the
discovery of a giant 65-million-year-old crater in Yucatan helped
advance the once scandalous theory that a comet or asteroid killed
off the dinosaurs (and nine-tenths of the planet's species at the
time). Last year our reviewer, Timothy Ferris, called this a ''deft
and readable . . . account from the world's leading authority on
death from above.'' In Dinosaur Lives: Unearthing an Evolutionary
Saga, by John R. Horner and Edwin Dobb (Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$13), a leading paleontologist and bone collector explains his
craft and uses the fossil record to offer fascinating ideas about
how dinosaurs lived and evolved. ''We can't all study dinosaurs,
but books like this mean we can all enjoy the process and the
results,'' Philip Gingerich wrote here in 1997. Back in the
Holocene, the creatures described in The Modern Ark. The Story of
Zoos: Past, Present and Future, by Vicki Croke (Bard/Avon, $12),
benefit from the author's close-up observation of their lives in
captivity. Combining history with vivid accounts of maulings, this
is an ''absorbing, provocative book,'' Carol Peace Robins said here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornerstone
</P>
<P>
   By Zoe Oldenbourg. Translated by Edward Hyams. Carroll &AMP; Graf,
$14.95. The title of this somber historical novel, which has just
been restored to print, refers to Christianity in 13th-century
France and the struggle among the members of a landowning family in
Champagne to build spiritual values in the squalid, bloody age of
chivalry. The result, Elizabeth Janeway said here in 1955, is ''a
vital book, and a rich one'' by an author of ''very substantial
talent.'' Three hundred years later in the New World, the events of
Aztec Autumn, by Gary Jennings (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $6.99), unfold
during another brutal time, in the years after the invasion of
Mexico by the conquistadors. The hero is a young Aztec who plots
revenge after witnessing the death of his father at the hands of
the Spaniards. ''Jennings's fascinating if often gory novel is
guided by exhaustive research,'' Charles Salzberg said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Woe Is I: The Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain
English
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia T. O'Conner. Riverhead, $11. With chapter titles
like ''Death Sentence: Do Clich s Deserve to Die?'' and ''Comma
Sutra: The Joy of Punctuation,'' it's fair to assume that this
grammar book, written by a former editor at The New York Times Book
Review, is irreverent and reader-friendly. But it's also
surprisingly useful. In 1996 our reviewer, Daniel Pinkwater, called
the guide ''lighthearted and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo Rex
</P>
<P>
   By Barry Hannah. Grove, $12. The author's audacious first novel
follows the larger-than-life comic exploits of Harriman Monroe as
he romps through the South in the 1950's and 60's. When it was
first published in 1972, our reviewer, Jim Harrison, called this
''a stunning piece of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine
</P>
<P>
   By Jasper Becker. Owl/Holt, $14.95. A journalist re-creates in
chilling detail the 1959-61 famine that killed up to 30 million
Chinese, a calamity caused by the obstinacy of the nation's
ruthless, ideologically driven leaders. The book, with a new
afterword on the current famine in North Korea, is ''powerful and
important,'' Nicholas Eberstadt wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Exiles: Three Short Novels
</P>
<P>
   By Philip Caputo. Vintage Contemporaries, $13. Whether in
Micronesia, suburban Connecticut or Vietnam, the misfit heroes in
this collection are outsiders whose defects lead them into trouble.
Last year in these pages, David Haward Bain said two of three
stories displayed the author's ''extraordinary eye for the exotica
of locale and behavior.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The second leg of the New York Philharmonic's tour of
parks in and around New York City got under way on Tuesday evening
at Van Cortlandt Park, in the Bronx. Kurt Masur has ceded the
podium of the traveling Carlos Moseley Pavilion to a newcomer,
Roberto Minczuk, a young Brazilian conductor, whose calling cards
included some fluff (John Williams' ``Summon the Heroes''), a dash
of Brazilian color (Lorenzo Fernandez's ``Batuque'') and two more
substantial works (Tchaikovsky's Serenade and Dvorak's Eighth
Symphony).
</P>
<P>
   The audience, estimated at 7,500, was less than a tenth the size
of the crowd that attended the series opener in Central Park a week
earlier. There was a subtle difference in atmosphere as well. As in
Manhattan, concertgoers brought picnics, blankets and fold-up
chairs, and settled in for an evening's entertainment that included
a Grucci fireworks display. But if the size of the crowd in Central
Park, the skyline on the park's borders and the slightly pressured
atmosphere gave last week's concert a festive glow, the Bronx
concert had more of a homespun charm, the sense of being a
neighborhood outing rather than a huge event.
</P>
<P>
   Minczuk was making his conducting debut with the Philharmonic,
but he has performed with the orchestra in another guise. In 1984,
when he was a 16-year-old student at the Juilliard School, he was
the soloist in Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 2 at one of the
orchestra's Young People's Concerts. He began conducting in the
late 1980s, and on Tuesday evening he showed that he has both
technique and interpretive flexibility going for him. His gestures
were broad and clear, and in the Tchaikovsky and Dvorak works, his
pacing was both personalized and tasteful, and magnified the
music's impulses nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to those works, however, meant wading through two
curtain raisers, which is at least one too many. Williams' ``Summon
the Heroes,'' composed for the 1996 Olympics, is a brassy,
predictable fanfare that sounded custom made to accompany
slow-motion video of athletes running, jumping, sweating and
exulting. Still, the Philharmonic's brass reveled in the spotlight,
and played brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   They also made strong contributions to the Fernandez work, in
which the brass lines include bent notes that superimpose a sultry
jazz sensibility upon a rhythmically vital and characteristically
Brazilian backdrop. But this movement, excerpted from an orchestral
suite, is too fleeting to give much of an impression of the
Brazilian folk style in which it is rooted.
</P>
<P>
   In its way, Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings is as
manipulative as Williams' piece; the fanfare is meant to be
stirring, the serenade wears its heart on its sleeve. Minczuk took
a natural approach to the Tchaikovsky, looking into its emotional
core but respecting the boundary between emotional and maudlin. The
Philharmonic's strings responded with what may have been a lush
sound on the stage; through the Moseley Pavilion's speakers, it
sounded edgy.
</P>
<P>
   The sound was better in the Dvorak, and Minczuk found an almost
ideally balanced approach to the conflicting currents of
brawniness, stateliness and folksy charm that Dvorak demands.
</P>
<P>
   Minczuk brings the same program to Miller Field, Gateway
National Recreation Center on Staten Island, Friday night.

RED SOX REACQUIRE MIKE STANLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette,
successful in his attempts to reacquire bat-for-hire Mike Stanley
Thursday, was pushing hard before Friday night's midnight trading
deadline to add another starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Several front-line pitchers are the subject of intense
discussions involving a number of clubs. The top prize remains
Seattle lefthander Randy Johnson, who would seem to command a price
too rich for the Sox. But others include Royals righthander Tim
Belcher, Cardinals righthander Todd Stottlemyre, Phillies
righthander Mark Portugal, and Expos lefthander Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox players reacted with jubilation when they arrived in the
clubhouse here Thursday morning and learned that Stanley, obtained
from Toronto for minor league pitchers Peter Munro and Jay Yennaco,
would be joining them in time for Friday night's game in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley played 246 games for the Red Sox in 1996 and '97 until
being traded to the Yankees last August for two minor league
pitchers, neither of whom is still with the Sox. Reliever Jim Mecir
was claimed by Tampa Bay in the expansion draft, and teenager Tony
Armas Jr. was packaged with top pitching prospect Carl Pavano to
Montreal in the deal for ace Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley signed a two-year deal with the Blue Jays as a free
agent last winter. The Red Sox will assume his 1999 guaranteed
salary of $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   He gives the club the veteran righthanded DH it has lacked since
trading Jim Leyritz to the San Diego Padres in June, as well as
someone who can play first base behind Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to him the other day,'' said third baseman John
Valentin, who saw Stanley last weekend in Boston, when reports of
the Red Sox' interest in Stanley surfaced, ``and the idea of coming
back put a smile on his face a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great pickup. I don't think you can look at it as him
being the savior in any way, but I don't think anybody can
complement our team the way I think he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here before. He knows the atmosphere. He likes to
hit in Fenway Park. He's a professional, quality guy and a veteran
leader who can help the young hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley could hit cleanup, sandwiched between lefthanded batters
Vaughn and Troy O'Leary, should manager Jimy Williams elect to
return Nomar Garciaparra to the top of the lineup. Stanley would
also be a nice fit in either the No. 5 or No. 6 hole, in front of
or behind O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who hit his 22d home run Wednesday night in his last
game for the Blue Jays, is batting only .240 in 98 games, but he's
hitting .298 against lefthanders and is on pace to set a career
high for home runs in a season, eclipsing the 26 he hit for the
Yankees in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has hit well at Fenway Park, too, batting .274 with 17
home runs and 72 RBIs in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have Mike Stanley,'' Vaughn said. ``He's a great
person, a good friend of mine, and a true professional who has
played in a lot of big games.''
</P>
<P>
   In making the trade for Stanley, Duquette continued to show a
willingness to deal pitching prospects to accomplish his goals. In
the last 11 months, the Red Sox have traded five pitchers and lost
another, Jeff Suppan, in the expansion draft in deals that have
netted them Stanley, Martinez, and outfielder Damon Buford.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox thought highly enough of Munro, 23, to invite him to
training camp as a nonroster player. A sixth-round draft pick in
1993, Munro was 5-4 with a 4.05 ERA in 17 starts for Triple A
Pawtucket and was a 1-0 loser to Syracuse in his last start. He had
pitched through the seventh inning in each of his last six starts
and allowed three runs or fewer in five of those starts.
</P>
<P>
   Yennaco, 22, is a Lawrence, Mass., native and was a third-round
draft pick in 1995 out of Pinkerton (N.H.) Academy. He split this
season between Trenton and Pawtucket, where he was 3-2 with a 5.82
ERA. Some people in the Red Sox system believe that with his
fastball in excess of 90 miles per hour, he eventually may be a
closer.

 NEW YORK: the 1940s.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Success came early to Robbins. At the age of 3, he played the
piano in a public children's concert. Rabinowitz operated a
delicatessen, and with his wife, offered Jerome and his older
sister, Sonya, a breadth of cultural opportunities. ``I grew up in
the Jewish tradition that children must get all the culture
possible,'' Robbins said in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   When his father went into corset manufacturing in Union City,
N.J., the family moved to nearby Weehawken, where Robbins graduated
from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1935. Although he entered New
York University, planning to major in chemistry, he left in a year
because of a slump in his father's business.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Robbins had also taken lessons with his
sister's modern-dance teachers, Gluck Sandor and Felicia Sorel, who
directed the Dance Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor, whom Robbins later called his ``guru,'' attracted
considerable attention with his experimental productions. These
included ``Petrouchka,'' with Constructivist costumes by Vincente
Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor also worked with theatrical companies, and it was in
``The Brothers Ashkenazi,'' a 1937 Yiddish Art Theater production,
that Robbins made his professional debut with a two-word walk-on
role.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tenets crucial to Robbins' future success might be
traced to the influence of the Dance Center. Sandor impressed him
most, he said, by ``an imagination that evolved a different style
for every production.'' The Robbins gift for establishing immediate
audience contact stemmed from these early years. ``We dancers were
taught to perform with the concentration of actors,'' the
choreographer said, explaining that this meant ``the centering of
everything to pull the viewers into the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance, not ballet, was dominant in the 1930s, and no
American ballet troupes independent of opera houses managed to
survive. But Sandor told his student: ``Study ballet. It's going to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins immersed himself in ballet classes with Ella Daganova.
He also studied Spanish dancing with Helene Veola, oriental dance
with Nimura, interpretive dancing with his sister and Alyce Bentley
and choreography with Bessie Schoenberg at the New Dance League.
Many of the classes were subsidized by the New Deal's Works
Progress Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Fancy Free'' was his first work for a ballet company,
Robbins had started choreographing while performing in summer shows
at Lake Tamiment, a Poconos resort in Bushkill, Pa., that served as
an incubator for rising talent like Danny Kaye and Imogene Coca.
The dancers there ranged from members of Martha Graham's company
like Dorothy Bird and Anita Alvarez to Balanchine disciples like
Ruthanna Boris. ``Jerry was considered to be a modern dancer at
that time, although he was deeply committed to ballet,'' Miss Bird
recalled in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' choreography at Tamiment included a duet for himself
and Miss Alvarez set to ``Strange Fruit,'' Billie Holiday's
recording of Lewis Allen's song about lynchings. Named after the
song, the work displayed the political commitment then common in
modern dance. Like-minded Robbins pieces, later seen in New York,
were ``Incident in Harlem'' and ``Death of a Loyalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also created a dance version of ``Our Town'' that was
incorporated into ``The Straw Hat Revue,'' which Max Leibman,
Tamiment's entertainment director, and the Shubert Organization
brought to New York in 1939. The show introduced Kaye to Broadway
and was in fact Robbins' Broadway choreographic debut although he
received no credit.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Robbins danced in the chorus of four musicals.
Some, including ``Keep Off the Grass'' in 1939, were choreographed
by Balanchine, then bereft of a ballet company.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined Ballet Theater only in its second season in
1940-41. Although not primarily remembered today as a dancer, he
left an impact on many who saw him perform at Ballet Theater and in
his own and Balanchine's works at the City Ballet. In any event,
his dancing career was overshadowed by his sensational success as a
choreographer. Robbins retired from dancing in 1952, although he
later appeared in cameo roles at the City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   While at Ballet Theater and in his early years on Broadway,
Robbins was also politically active. When called before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities in May 1953, the choreographer
said he had belonged to the American Communist Party's Theatrical
Transient Group between 1943 and 1947. Many in the arts never
forgave Robbins for naming eight colleagues as members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Velde, R-Ill., chairman of the committee, praised
Robbins for his testimony, which the choreographer justified on the
grounds that he had made ``a great mistake in joining the Communist
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his testimony, Robbins had already choreographed
hits like ``On the Town,'' ``Call Me Madam'' and ``The King and
I.'' His Broadway career was at stake: had he not cooperated with
the panel, he risked being blacklisted in the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for the Soviet Union was nonetheless common when that
country and the United States were allies in World War II. A more
universal statement about that period came from Robbins in ``Fancy
Free.'' A shrewd, warm and idiomatic picture of young people in
1944, ``Fancy Free'' offered something new in ballet: ``The
revelation of democratic human relationships,'' as George Amberg
wrote in his book, ``Ballet in America'' (1947).
</P>
<P>
   The same writer saw Robbins' next and equally enduring ballet,
``Interplay'' (1945) as proof ``that the contemporary American
style is not determined by the nature of the subject but by the
character of the execution.'' In The New York Times, John Martin
wrote that the work's ``eight dancers perform in an idiom and a
style that have meaning for them.'' The idea that Robbins ballets
offered a collective self-portrait of an entire American generation
was shared by the choreographer himself through the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the success of ``Fancy Free'' catapulted
Robbins into a second, parallel, career on Broadway. Oliver Smith,
the ballet's designer, urged Robbins and Leonard Bernstein to
expand the sailors-on-leave theme into a musical comedy. With a
book by two unknown writers, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and the
authority of a veteran director, George Abbott, the collaborators
had a hit on their hands. The musical, called ``On the Town,''
opened on Dec. 28, 1944, and struck a responsive chord in a
war-weary audience that identified with its urban comedy.

 NEW YORK: urban comedy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dance became a major component of any Robbins musical. In 1945,
he choreographed ``Billion Dollar Baby,'' also directed by Abbott,
while ``High Button Shoes'' (1947) confirmed his ingenuity for
period stylization. The Roseland Ballroom honored Robbins and
Martha Graham simultaneously with an award, she for ``bringing art
to the masses'' and he for being ``tops in Terpsichore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Ma _ I'm Dancing'' (1948), with a book by Robbins and
directed by him and Abbott, was a takeoff on a touring ballet
company. The typical Robbins comic timing was illustrated by a
Pullman car scene in which sleepwalkers tumbled in and out of
berths. In quick succession, Robbins choreographed ``Miss Liberty''
(1949), ``Call Me Madam'' (1950), ``The King and I'' (1951) and
``Two's Company'' (1952).
</P>
<P>
   Although not the first to treat serious subjects in musical
comedy, Robbins impressed Broadway with ``The Small House of Uncle
Thomas,'' his unconventional antislavery ballet in ``The King and
I.'' The sequence borrowed from Asian dance idioms. La Meri, an
American modern dancer, had earlier retold ``Swan Lake'' in the
same way, but ``The Small House'' looked fresh, not derivative.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' integrated vision of musicals became more pronounced in
shows when he took over the role of director as well as
choreographer. He was co-director of ``The Pajama Game'' (1954)
with Abbott; he adapted, directed and choreographed ``Peter Pan,''
starring Mary Martin (1954), and he directed ``Bells Are Ringing''
(1956).
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he directed and choreographed ``Gypsy,'' and in 1964,
he served as production supervisor of ``Funny Girl.'' But the two
most successful musicals of his career were those he conceived,
directed and choreographed: ``West Side Story,'' an updated version
of ``Romeo and Juliet'' in 1957, and ``Fiddler on the Roof,''
inspired by Sholom Aleichem's stories, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also acted as show doctor, patching up five productions.
He choreographed Aaron Copland's ``Tender Land'' for the New York
City Opera (1954) and directed two nonmusical productions: Arthur
Kopit's ``Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm
Feelin' So Sad,'' and Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage and her
Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his acclaim in show business (which included five
Donaldson Awards, four Tonys, two Oscars for the 1961 film version
of ``West Side Story'' and an Emmy for a televised version of
``Peter Pan''), Robbins remained primarily devoted to ballet.
</P>
<P>
   His later works were more classical but in 1946, he typically
caused a stir with ``Facsimile,'' the first of his ballets about
contemporary neuroses. The cast consisted of Robbins and two Ballet
Theater stars, Nora Kaye and John Kriza. The ballet's love triangle
came to an end with Ms. Kaye's cry of ``Stop!'' Looking back in
1990, Robbins said, ``It was sort of a transitional piece, and it
came out of a situation in my own life when I was involved with two
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaye, in fact, told The New York Times in 1951 that she
planned to marry Robbins on April 16 of that year. The engagement
was broken and Robbins, who was very private about his life, never
married. He is survived by his sister, Sonya Cullinen of
Wilmington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins had cast Miss Kaye in ``The Cage,'' an allegory about
man-eating female insects that commented at best on the eternal
battle of the sexes and at worst suggested that women instinctively
hate men. For all its sensational aura, it became one of the
classics Robbins choreographed in his first decade at the City
Ballet. In 1953, ``Afternoon of a Faun'' stunned audiences by its
mix of sensuousness and simplicity. An updated gloss on Nijinsky's
1913 ballet to the same Debussy score, the work epitomized the
Robbins genius for discovering the rightness of every movement.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Robbins was shuttling between Broadway and
ballet. In 1958, he took a step that led to an informal leave from
the City Ballet. For the first Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy, that summer, he directed an ad hoc group of dancers that
became Ballets: U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Although short-lived, this Robbins troupe had a huge success in
Europe and embodied a specifically American spirit in ballets like
``Moves'' and ``N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz.'' The group disbanded in
1961 but reassembled for a White House dinner in 1962 given by
President John F. Kennedy for the Shah of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Robbins returned to Ballet Theater to choreograph his
version of a peasant wedding in ``Les Noces.'' Just as
surprisingly, he then embarked on three years of quiet
experimentation in a project that he called the American Theater
Laboratory. His unrealized aim, he said later, was to create
theater pieces in the way that he composed ballets.
</P>
<P>
   On some level, the experience reopened the floodgates of his
creativity. Returning to the New York City Ballet in 1969, where
Balanchine named him ballet master, he astonished both the theater
and dance worlds with the invention that poured into ``Dances at a
Gathering.'' Subsequent major ballets included ``The Goldberg
Variations,'' an 85-minute exposition of the ballet lexicon, and
``Watermill,'' in which Edward Villella reclined onstage,
meditating on life and phases of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Balanchine, who had choreographed little between 1968
and 1972, was subject to increasing speculation that his creativity
had come to an end. That he then needed Robbins by his side was
obvious. Yet even after he recovered from this dry spell,
Balanchine continued to work with Robbins in a relationship of
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before Balanchine died on April 1, 1983, the City
Ballet's board named Robbins and Peter Martins, a principal dancer
in the company, as artistic directors. After Lincoln Kirstein, the
company's co-founder, resigned in September 1989, Robbins announced
that he wished to work on other projects and would resign his own
post on Jan. 1, 1990. He continued to rehearse the company for its
``Festival of Jerome Robbins' Ballets'' and, in effect, left the
troupe in June of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after restaging his works for the Paris Opera Ballet,
Robbins choreographed a plotless Bach ballet, ``Two- and Three-Part
Inventions,'' in June 1994 for the School of American Ballet. It
was transferred in the fall to the City Ballet. Robbins explained
that he was returning from ``a break.'' A few months earlier, he
had created a solo to Bach for Mikhail Baryshnikov.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the City Ballet acquired a hit in ``West Side
Story Suite,'' based on dances from his show, Robbins had a heart
valve replaced. But in 1997, he finished a major work for the
company, ``Brandenburg,'' to the Bach concertos. During rehearsals,
he had said, ``I feel I have one more big ballet in me.'' It was
his last new work.

BUFFALO BOB SMITH, 80, PARTNER OF `HOWDY DOODY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Fla., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith, a singing piano player and chatty radio disk
jockey who created Howdy Doody and then teamed up with the puppet
on one of early television's most enduring children's shows, died
Thursday at a hospital in Hendersonville, N.C. The cause was
cancer, said his family. Smith was 80 and lived in Flatrock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, kids, what time is it?'' Buffalo Bob would ask his Peanut
Gallery of children aged 3 to 8 years, gathered in an NBC studio in
New York at 30 Rockefeller Plaza every afternoon, five days a week,
in the late 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time,'' they'd respond with the lung power
that only children of that age can demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   And then they'd sing their Howdy Doody theme, set to the tune of
the French ditty, ``Ta-ra-ra-Boom-der-e:''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time/It's Howdy Doody time/Bob Smith and
Howdy, too/Say `howdy doo' to you/Let's give a rousing cheer/Cause
Howdy Doody's here/It's time to start the show/So kids, let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   Such doings made ``Howdy Doody'' one of the first shows NBC ever
produced in color.
</P>
<P>
   For many years in the 1950s, Buffalo Bob and Howdy were on
Monday to Friday at 5:30 p.m. After the theme, they'd be joined for
an hour by their friends, some human, some made of wood. These
included Clarabell the Clown, human, (he said nary a word but
hopped around honking a Harpo Marx-type horn stuck in his belt,
which he would remove to honk in Buffalo Bob's ear, which he
usually also sprayed with seltzer); Chief Thunderthud, human,
official representative of the Ooragnak Indians (``Ooragnak was
kangaroo spelled backwards); Princess Summerfall Winterspring (she
began as a puppet, then was transformed into a human because
Buffalo Bob, who hired actress Judy Tyler, wanted something
beautiful and life-sized for girls to identify with and Ms. Tyler
was all of that); and such puppets as Phineas T. Bluster, the
always grumpy but never evil mayor of Doodyville, his Latin and
Anglo brothers, Don Jose Bluster and Hector Hamhock Bluster, and
Flub-a-Dub, a meatball-eating wild animal made up of eight
different animals that Buffalo Bob claimed he had caught in a
jungle in South America.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a machine of sorts, a Super Talkscope, that
enabled Buffalo Bob and Howdy to instantly see what was going on
any place in the world, any time they wanted to. There were songs,
too, one of which was ``Iggily Wiggily Spaghetti,'' a big hit with
the Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a big man with an easy smile who almost always wore a
fringed cowboy outfit. At first Howdy called him ``Mr. Smith,'' but
as the years progressed, he became known to one and all as Buffalo
Bob, a name that had nothing to do with the Wild West but rather
with his hometown in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy started as an unprepossessing piece of wood in 1947 after
Smith talked NBC into letting him do a children's show. He grew out
of a character Smith had created on his radio show, ``Triple B
Ranch,'' called Elmer, who would greet Smith with a ``howdy
doody.'' His audiences soon came to call the puppet Howdy Doody.
That first Howdy was quickly retired when NBC and Smith got into a
dispute with Frank Paris, the puppet-maker, who declared that Howdy
was and forever would be his property and nobody else's, the
creative fortunes of Buffalo Bob and his writer notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then sought out some artists at Walt Disney's studios in
California, who refined Howdy into a freckle-faced kid, 27 inches
tall, with prominent ears who wore jeans, a bandanna and a checked
shirt. His delivery sounded suspiciously like that of Mortimer
Snerd, a dummy hayseed who had been created on radio by
ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for the madcap top-hatted wisacre,
Charlie McCarthy. The second Howdy was so successful that Smith
commissioned a second puppet as a stand-in, whom he called Double
Doody, and a third puppet with no strings attached who posed for
photos. He was called Photo Doody.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffalo Bob was neither a ventriloquist nor a puppeteer and
he never tried to engage in the kinds of pungent exchanges that
occurred between Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. Professional
puppeteers off camera manipulated Howdy's movements whenever he and
Smith had a conversation. Smith pre-recorded all Howdy's responses;
when they were on television, the exchanges between Buffalo Bob and
Howdy were all controlled by an engineer who simply put his finger
on the record and stopped the turntable when Smith was talking,
then took his finger off and let the turntable roll when it was
Howdy's turn. Not exactly high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy, as he was developed by writer Eddie Kean, was neither
excruciatingly thick like Mortimer nor wickedly and unredeemably
sophisticated as Charlie. Howdy was somehow direct without being
intrusive and friendly and supportive of Buffalo Bob without
becoming dull to the Peanut Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Howdy Doody was a sissy,'' said Kean on one
occasion. ``He was me as a child. I always preferred to study than
to play baseball. I never hit anybody. No one ever hit me. He was
the dullest character on the show. No offense to Bob, but he was
because I made him so.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Clarabell was Bob Keeshan, who went on to become
Captain Kangaroo. Clarabell never had a line to say until the show
went off the air (after 2,343 performances) on Sept. 30, 1960, at
which time he looked into the camera and said simply and wistfully,
``Goodbye, kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob moved to Florida from Mount Vernon, N.Y., bought
three radio stations and a liquor store, and thought he was out of
the Howdy Doody business.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. It could never be a permanent goodbye for
the youngsters who grew up watching Buffalo Bob, then went off to
serve in the war in Vietnam or to oppose it. After the tumult of
the 1960s, they felt they needed to return to simpler times. A
Howdy Doody revival started at the University of Pennsylvania in
1970. Someone asked students there what they would like to do most
of all, and many of them said they would like to revisit the world
of Howdy Doody.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, 1970, Buffalo Bob and Howdy showed up at Penn and
hosted a repeat of Howdy's 10th anniversary show of Dec. 28, 1957.
They were a hit and Buffalo Bob never stopped being Buffalo Bob
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith was born Robert Schmidt on Nov. 27, 1917, in
Buffalo, N.Y., the son of Emil H. Schmidt and Emma Kuehn Schmidt.
Schmidt had for years earned his keep as a coal miner in Illinois.
After a cave-in in which Schmidt was one of only three miners to
survive, his wife suggested that he leave the mines. He agreed,
taking his family to Buffalo, where he became a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Young Bob was encouraged to learn to play the piano and organ
and by the time he was 15 years old, he was on a Buffalo radio
station singing. He formed a three-man vocal group called the
Hi-Hatters. One member of the Hi-Hatters was Foster Brooks, who in
later years became famous as the drunk who frequently appeared in
Dean Martin's television program in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of making his way on upstate New York radio,
he came to New York City in August, 1947, and got a job as a disk
jockey on radio station WEAF, then owned by the National
Broadcasting Co. By 1947, Smith had a Saturday morning quiz show
for kids. The Howdy Doody show started that same year, at first on
Saturdays, then on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, finally, five
times a week, where it lasted for an hour. It was successful from
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy Doody was so popular that people gathered in the streets
before appliance store windows to watch it, as they did with
baseball games and wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy's popularity being what it was, it was announced in 1948
that he would run for president of all the boys and girls. Harry
Truman also happened to be running that year, and he won the
election over New York Gov. Thomas Dewey. But Howdy did get a great
many votes, becoming president of the boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Smith ran afoul of NBC executives when, during his
early morning talk show, he announced that a spaceship had landed
in Virginia and that it had contained that bodies of
Liliputian-like men attired in 15th century outfits. He read it as
though it had come from the wires of United Press, and although it
did not cause the alarm of Orson Welles' ``Martian invasion'' of
1938, it frightened a great many people, especially those living in
Virginia. NBC told him never to do anything like that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love kids,'' he told Val Adams of The New York Times in
1954. ``Kids never get on my nerves.'' Maybe not, but an overworked
Bob Smith soon suffered a heart attack and for a time, he did the
show from his home in Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith is survived by his wife, Mildred, to whom he was
married for 57 years, his three sons, Robin, Ronald and
Christopher, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. None of
them went into show business.

RICHARD JEWELL'S MOTHER SUES FBI AGENTS, FORMER PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barbara Jewell, whose son, Richard, became the focus
of a federal investigation into the 1996 Summer Olympics bombing
but was later cleared, has filed a lawsuit against six FBI agents
and a former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jewell is claiming that the officials intentionally
violated her Fourth Amendment rights by using misleading and false
statements by investigators to get a warrant to search her home,
said her lawyer, Watson Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jewell, the security guard who spotted the bomb in
Centennial Park before it exploded on July 27, 1996, was hailed as
a hero before word of the investigation was leaked and a media
frenzy ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said the lawsuit, which he filed on Wednesday in U.S.
District Court in Atlanta, was ``a matter of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Alleging ``real and emotional distress,'' the lawsuit says the
FBI agents searched everything from Mrs. Jewell's underwear drawer
to her Tupperware containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about 30 or 40 strange men pawing through your clothes,
your medicine cabinet, emptying out pill bottles, emptying out your
Tupperware to make sure nothing is hidden in your sugar, salt and
flour,'' said Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Some items were taken, including a ``Mary Poppins'' video, and

   At the time of the bombing, Jewell lived with his mother in her
apartment on the Buford Highway in Atlanta. She was humiliated in
front of her friends and neighbors, Bryant said, as investigators
and news media camped outside her door. It was October before he
was finally cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also laid the groundwork to sue not just former U.S.
Attorney Kent Alexander and the individual FBI agents named in the
suit, but to seek damages from the Justice Department and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant on Wednesday filed an administrative action against the
FBI and Justice Department, seeking $475,000. If that action is not
resolved in six months, he will add those agencies to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell, a former police officer, was working as a security guard
at the park in the early morning of July 27, 1996, when he spotted
a suspicious looking backpack that contained the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   While security guards and police tried to clear the area of
people, the bomb exploded, killing one woman and injuring more than
100 others.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell's actions were applauded after the blast by public
officials, who said he may have saved the lives of others, but he
quickly went from hero to suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell, who claimed that some members of the news media
mistreated him in their coverage, has since obtained settlements
from CNN and NBC and is suing The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
which first reported that he was the focus of an investigation. &QL;

 &HT;    BILL WOULD TIGHTEN FEDERAL LAWS AGAINST 'DATE RAPE' DRUGS
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The night that Hillory Farias returned home to La
Porte, Texas, from a volleyball camp, she went to a dance club with
friends. Later that night, she complained of a severe headache and
went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Hillory's grandmother found her dead.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days shy of the second anniversary of her death, Raul
Farias relayed his niece's story at a House Judiciary subcommittee
hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillory will never get the scholarship she dreamed of, she'll
never go to the prom. ... She'll never graduate,'' Farias said in a
shaky voice.
</P>
<P>
   It took two months for the medical examiner's office to figure
out what killed the 17-year-old high school senior who had hoped to
attend the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was a colorless, odorless drug called GHB that had been
dropped into the girl's Sprite _ a drug that law enforcement
officials say is the hottest ``date rape'' drug on the club scene
in Texas, Florida and many other states.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, introduced legislation
Thursday that would allow federal prosecution of the possession of
GHB and a similar drug called ketamine. The bill would allow
prosecution even when those who make the drugs change the formula
slightly. Some states, including Georgia, already regulate GHB.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence against women is a social evil we must address,''
said Jackson Lee. Her bill, named after Hillory, would also direct
the attorney general to educate the nation's youngsters about the
harmful effects of these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   GHB can appear as clear liquid or a white powder, and brings on
such effects as euphoria and intense sexual pleasure. Like other
date rape drugs, it interferes with memory and may even cause
amnesia, which makes it difficult to document a sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, the drug is known as ``liquid ecstasy,''
``scoop'' or even ``easy lay.'' Its chemical name is gamma hydroxy
butyrate, a depressant of the central nervous system that can cause
dizziness, heart rate problems, seizures and death.
</P>
<P>
   GHB was banned by the Food and Drug Administration in 1990, when
it was sold in health food stores.
</P>
<P>
   The major source today is cheap kits obtained over the Internet,
said Paul Doering, a pharmacy professor at the University of
Florida in Gainesville. As a result, ``non-chemists'' create GHB
from flawed and incomplete recipes that lead to unknown potency,
Doering said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there's no way to tell the strength of home-made GHB,
what might be a safe dose today could produce a toxic dose
tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stevens, a drug enforcement detective for the Orlando
Police Department, called GHB the most popular drug in club culture
in Central Florida, where minors use it to mimic the effects of
alcohol. The drug is also used calm highs obtained earlier from
hours of partying.
</P>
<P>
   GHB cannot be detected in routine drug screens. It took repeated
drug tests over two months to find the drug attributed to Hillory's
death, said Joye Carter, chief medical examiner for Harris County
in Houston.

LEWINSKY CASE CONTINUES TO CREATE LEGAL QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been a little more than six months since
allegations about a sexual relationship President Clinton and
Monica S. Lewinsky first surfaced, and the questions and legal
issues continue to pile up.
</P>
<P>
   With the news this week that Lewinsky has agreed to testify
before the grand jury in exchange for full immunity, and of
Clinton's agreement to videotape his testimony at the White House
on Aug. 17, here is an attempt at answers to some of the persistent
questions:
</P>
<P>
   Q. News reports refer confidently to what Lewinsky will say
about the alleged relationship and whether Clinton asked her to lie
about it under oath. How is it known what Lewinsky will testify to?
</P>
<P>
   A. It isn't, really. What has been widely reported is that
anonymous ``legal sources'' say Lewinsky will admit she had an
affair with Clinton, contradicting her sworn affidavit in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case that she did not have sex with the
president. Lewinsky, again according to various accounts, will say
no one at the White House helped her write the ``talking points''
that instructed her one-time friend, Linda R. Tripp, to say she saw
the president do nothing inappropriate. (Tripp denies any such
role.)
</P>
<P>
   Those in the best position to know what Lewinsky offered to say
include her own lawyers, and officials in independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's office. But there are other possibilities and most
news reports provide little guidance on this score.
</P>
<P>
   As White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry noted this
week, no one except Lewinsky, her lawyers and other confidants
really knows what she will tell the grand jury. Media reports about
her testimony have varied widely, with conflicting accounts of
whether the two agreed to lie about an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, meanwhile, has yet to talk publicly, and the general
description of her testimony doesn't take into account the
inevitable nuances that will arise when she actually is questioned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. After Lewinsky has testified, will Clinton know what she has
said, and, if so, how?
</P>
<P>
   A. Lewinsky's testimony to the grand jury is given in secret.
The prosecutors, the grand jurors, and the court personnel are not
allowed to discuss the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   However, a witness is not bound by that rule, so Lewinsky is
free to discuss her testimony with her lawyers afterward, and they
are allowed to convey that information to the president's lawyers
or _ more likely _ leak it to the press. Clinton also will learn
much about the nature of her testimony as he is asked questions by
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Given that Clinton appears to be in the extraordinary
position of being part of a criminal investigation, why didn't he
contest the subpoena to testify before the grand jury all the way
to the Supreme Court?
</P>
<P>
   A. Clinton for months has employed a strategy of remaining quiet
and appealing every legal action that could harm him. Some members
of Clinton's legal team wanted to continue this strategy and fight
the subpoena. But with Lewinsky's agreement to testify, and with
the investigation apparently drawing near a close, Clinton's
political advisers were adamant that he fulfill his initial pledge
to cooperate. The political aides believed that the
silence-and-delay strategy was beginning to hurt him in the polls,
and that a refusal to answer a subpoena would make it appear that
Clinton was being uncooperative and trying to cover things up.
</P>
<P>
   There was a also a risk that the Supreme Court would have ruled
against Clinton's refusal to testify, which would have been
politically embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Clinton has already testified in the Jones case that he did
not have sex with Lewinsky. If he now admits in his grand jury
testimony that he did, how serious an offense would that be?
</P>
<P>
   A. The prospect that Clinton lied in the Jones deposition, while
a potential felony, is an offense that is rarely prosecuted for
civil cases. Lying alone is not perjury. The lie also has to be
``material.'' In the Jones case, the judge ruled the Lewinsky
evidence was irrelevant and later dismissed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lewinsky investigation is not a typical legal case. Most
legal experts say Starr does not have the option of indicting a
sitting president. Instead, Starr will deliver a report to
Congress, which will decide whether to begin impeachment
proceedings. Thus, it also becomes a political decision.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What if Clinton lies in his videotaped testimony for the
grand jury?
</P>
<P>
   A. That would be very serious, explained former federal
prosecutor Bruce Yannett. ``Courts view lying to a grand jury as a
very serious offense, and it is routinely prosecuted,'' he said.
``Congress and the American public would take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent for Clinton changing, or at least
modifying, his story. During the 1992 campaign, Clinton denied
having an affair with Gennifer Flowers. But during his deposition
in the Jones case, he admitted having sex with her once. While
White House officials said this was not a contradiction of
Clinton's denials of an affair, the impression was the president
was being careful not to be caught in a lie during a legal
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that Clinton would admit to some kind of
relationship with Lewinsky but say it was not what he considers to
be a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What role can Clinton's lawyer play during the president's
testimony?
</P>
<P>
   A. Normally, a grand jury witness testifies before a prosecutor
and the jurors without having a lawyer present. The witness can
consult his or her lawyer, who usually is standing outside the
grand jury room, before answering a question.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, Starr agreed to let the president be
questioned in videotaped testimony at the White House instead of
appearing before the grand jury at the federal courthouse. In
addition, Starr will allow the president's lawyers to be present
during the questioning. Starr, who had subpoenaed Clinton to
testify, agreed to withdraw the subpoena in exchange for Clinton's
voluntary agreement to this time and arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is known about a dress that Lewinsky supposedly has
turned over to Starr's office?
</P>
<P>
   A. It has been reported for months that Lewinsky may have a
dress that contains forensic evidence that could prove Clinton had
a sexual relationship with her. But when investigators examined
dresses from Lewinsky's Washington apartment, they found no such
evidence, leading critics to say the report had been false.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, Lewinsky reportedly acknowledged that the
dress in question was kept at her mother's New York City apartment.
While that dress reportedly has been turned over to investigators,
there has been no confirmation so far that it contains evidence
proving that Clinton had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. If
forensic evidence is found, then investigators would have to obtain
a DNA sample from the president to determine whether there is a
match; a swab of saliva would suffice, Yannett said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Before Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia K. Lewis, reached an
immunity agreement with Starr this week, where they vulnerable to
criminal charges?
</P>
<P>
   A. Lewinsky's attorneys were concerned she could have faced
charges of perjury, suborning perjury, or obstruction of justice.
Perjury could stem from contradicting her sworn statement that she
did not have a sexual relationship with the president. Suborning
perjury could relate to any efforts to get others to lie in the
case. Obstruction of justice could relate to the possibility that
Lewinsky conspired with Clinton or others to coverup their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who had many conversations with her daughter, apparently
kept the dress that investigators had been seeking and suggested
ways for Lewinsky and Tripp to avoid testifying in the Jones case.
So Lewis may have been concerned about facing charges of
obstructing justice.

COURT SCANNING NEW BOSTON LATIN ADMISSION POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The revised admissions policy for Boston's most
prestigious public school, Boston Latin, is now in the hands of a
federal appeals court, which must decide if it passes
constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a federal district judge court judge in Boston ruled
that it was constitutional, prompting an appeal by the attorney for
a white ninth-grader who was not admitted, Sarah Wessmann.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Wessmann's attorney, Michael C. McLaughlin, argued
before a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
that diversity is not a legally defensible basis for an admissions
policy that admits half of Latin students based purely on merit,
half of students on a combination of race and merit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts, he argued, including the US Supreme Court, have
not held that ``diversity'' serves a compelling government interest
-- the legal standard for taking factors such as race into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Boston School department attorney Frances Cohen argued that
courts, including the Supreme Court, have traditionally given local
school authorities broad discretion in balancing any number of
interests and issues, from religious freedom to students' free
speech rights. Thus, school districts should be ones to decide how
best to prepare students ``to become citizens in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   But McLaughlin argued that the Supreme Court in a 1995 case
involving set-asides for minority contractors said the only time
race can be used is as a remedy for a constitutional violation --
and only if there is no other, less restrictive alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no claim that there is a constitutional right to
diversity,'' said McLaughlin. ``There is no case for diversity as a
compelling government interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Bruce Selya, a member of the appeals court panel, noted
the uniqueness of Boston Latin School, which he said makes the case
``terribly difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all aware that a student who is denied admission to
Boston Latin School solely because of this policy cannot get a
comparable education anywhere else in the city of Boston,'' Selya
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen disagreed, saying that Wessmann is getting a similar
education at Boston Latin Academy, where she takes Latin and honors
math. ``It's a comparable education,'' Cohen said, ``but not her
first-choice education.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the revised admissions policy for Boston Latin
School, which admits 50 percent of students based solely on grades
and entrance exam scores, and the other half of the class based on
grades, test scores and on the proportion of applicants from their
racial group.
</P>
<P>
   Wessmann, who was not admitted, scored higher than 10 minorities
who were admitted to Latin.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin had successfully challenged an earlier admissions
policy on behalf of his daughter, Julia. That policy, which was
dropped because of questions about its constitutionality, set aside
35 percent of seats for blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Chief US District Court Judge Joseph L. Tauro found that
the revised policy was constitutional, ruling that it was not
``just another paternalistic affirmative action program'' like
those previously struck down by the Supreme Court.

when they decided to open up the 33-year-old Medicare program to
HMOs and other forms of managed care. But Anthem got over-extended
as it hustled to lock up the Medicare market and recently announced
it was discontinuing its Medicare HMO in 19 Ohio counties. The

LAWMAKERS URGED TO HELP `PROTECT OUR YOUTH' AGAINST DATE RAPE
DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Texas man shared his grief with a House committee
Thursday over the ``date rape'' drug death of his 17-year-old niece
two years ago, as he pleaded with lawmakers to outlaw substances
that could be used to render women defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a House Judiciary subcommittee considering
several bills, Raul Farias of the Houston-area city of La Porte
recounted how his niece Hillory Farias died after drinking a soda
that was laced with gamma y-hydroxybutyrate, better known as GHB.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the young high school volleyball player attracted
national attention in August of 1996 after authorities, who were at
first perplexed by her death, discovered that someone had slipped
GHB into her soft drink during an evening out with friends. The
crime remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to be a willing participant of drug use. But
it's another when you are participating unwillingly or
unknowingly,'' said Farias, who called on lawmakers to help
``protect our youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Farias called for passage of a bill sponsored by Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas, that would place the drugs GHB and Ketamine
on the Food and Drug Administration's list of controlled
substances. The bill and several similar pending proposals would
also make it a federal crime to use drugs ``to render a woman
helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow Ketamine and GHB to be used as a tool for date
rape by individuals who prey on unsuspecting teen-age girls and
women,'' Jackson Lee, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told
her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Calling violence against women ``a social evil that we must
address,'' Jackson Lee said Congress should ``send a message loud
and clear that if you commit date rape by using GHB or Ketamine you
become an inmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee's bill would also instruct the attorney general to
establish programs to distribute materials to high school and
college students about the use of drugs in sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hillory Farias, there have been at least 15 other
deaths attributed to GHB use across the country. But Jackson Lee
said the drug is probably responsible for many more deaths since it
is not normally covered in standard toxicology screens.
</P>
<P>
   The congress member said the drug, which is produced outside the
United States, has been responsible for at least 60 admissions to
Houston-area hospitals during the past six months. &QL;

COMMENTARY: `WHAT DID YOU DO TO US?' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago an editor on The New York Times, decently
paid and with a good future, diverted money from the newspaper to
himself _ less than $1,000. He did it in a way that made it
inevitable that the paper would soon find out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was heading the news department. The first words I said to him
after I was told were: ``What did you do to us?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You, me, the newsroom. He knew what I meant; we read each
other's unhappy eyes. I was saying I had to fire him immediately.
Otherwise the paper could no longer operate with assumption of
honor _ impossible to contemplate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What has the president done to us, the country? An adulterer
knows always that, if discovered, he will damage his family. Both
the act and consequences, in our society, are considered the
business of the adulterer and the few people he puts at risk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if Bill Clinton committed adultery in the White House, he
also committed putting the presidency at reckless, selfish risk.
That's why it sticks in my own gullet.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency does not belong to any president. It is his to
guard, not to put in jeopardy, to throw on the table like a
one-dollar chip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether Americans in President John F. Kennedy's time cared
about presidential adultery, or knew, or whether foreign presidents
have no worries about sex does not matter. This is America NOW, not
the Kennedy era, and we vote only for our own president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, adultery would knowingly be a particularly grave
risk of the presidency, given his pre-White House record and
reputation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently most Americans do not want him to lose the presidency
for adultery, even for perjury about adultery. But the risk to the
presidency is not any lesser, nor the price to the country. Nobody
can be a fully functioning president and month after month a
full-time defendant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also passes on to future presidents
the entirely reasonable fear that the law will deprive him of the
confidentiality, and self-confidence, of people close to him. The
restrictions were imposed not by the special prosecutor himself but
by the courts that upheld him.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To me, the idea of Secret Service agents having to testify about
what they saw or heard because protecting the president's life put
them within range is shocking. But there it is, a souvenir of the
Clinton era. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have been trying falteringly to write this column in tenses
hinting I believe that perhaps Clinton might not have done as his
accuser is ready to testify. But I am a little embarrassed because
I do not believe that at all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Non-jurors are entitled to form opinions about innocence or
guilt before any trial. But all these years I have written, edited
and believed in innocent until proven guilty, juror or not.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accuser is a young person with no known accomplishment
beyond grabbing hold of the lowest bureaucratic rung. The accused
was twice elected president of the United States. Why is it that
the American majority, including his supporters, believe her when
she says she had sex with him, not him when he says denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Because: He takes himself with himself throughout his life, as
do we all. He has lied before, about his sex life before he became
president. I gave him an easy pass on that, as did the country on
Election Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But since then, he has become a man whose word on matters of
world importance is doubted. Naturally, he gets no benefit of the
doubt on non-global matters, like adultery.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During his first presidential campaign, for instance, he said he
would struggle for oppressed Chinese and Tibetans. Now he is the
world's ace promoter of the Chinese Communist regime that kills and
tortures them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had believed that America's trust in its leader would depend
on an ear tuned to the dungeons, not just an eye fixed on the Dow.
I was wrong. But maybe the disbelief now in Clinton's word, in his
own country, is a little payoff time from those dungeons. I like
thinking so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, I do not long for another president to be driven out of
office. But surely I do not know what will come of all this. Maybe,
if he has not told the utter, complete truth, he will tell it now,
for congressional amnesty? Maybe Monica would testify it was all an
erotic dream? I suppose not.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not much chance. Probably we will just live with a dishonored
presidency _ our cost for his risk.

U.S. PROTESTS DETENTION OF DIPLOMATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An American diplomat told the government here
Thursday that military attaches from the U.S. Embassy are free to
travel where they want in Mexico. The firm reminder followed the
detention of the two envoys by villagers in the southern state of
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the government of Mexico's concern for the
safety of our staff,'' the embassy official said on customary
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, as was explained to the Mexican foreign ministry's
representatives, as diplomats we have the freedom to travel
anywhere in Mexico without giving prior notice,'' the official
said. ``At the same time, Mexican diplomats in the United States
are free to travel to anyplace they want without advising us.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident involving the military aides had newly arrived U.S.
Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow facing his first diplomatic flap even
before he could present his credentials to President Ernesto
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Two American defense attaches from the embassy were detained for
nearly 10 hours last weekend by villagers in Chiapas. The incident
set off a chain of events that included a dressing down of the
deputy chief of mission Charles Brayshaw by the Mexican Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Brayshaw is acting in Davidow's place until the new ambassador
is fully accredited.
</P>
<P>
   Brayshaw was summoned to the Foreign Ministry to explain what
Thomas Gillen and Elizabeth Kruger were doing in the village of Los
Platanos when they reportedly refused to allow villagers to search
boxes in their automobile.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-government villagers demanded to know who Gillen and
Kruger were and what they were doing in Los Platanos, about 50
miles north of the colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas. The
villagers blocked the road for about 10 hours before Chiapas state
officials negotiated their release.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports said Gillen and Kruger claimed diplomatic
immunity and refused to let the villagers open the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry officials told Brayshaw of their concern about
``risks and consequences that could accompany visiting certain
villages in the state of Chiapas to obtain information,'' the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is a sensitive issue in Mexico. A brief but bloody
insurrection erupted there in 1994, with a band rebels demanding
democracy and rights for Indians. Since then, violence has flared
periodically and the southern state has drawn increasing scrutiny
from foreign rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accredited defense and military attaches from all countries
regularly travel anywhere they want, except to areas specifically
prohibited for reasons of national security, the American embassy
official said.
</P>
<P>
   When possible, the official said, ``in recognition of the joint
concern for the safety of staff,'' informal notice will be given
before travel.

COMMENTARY: A SKEPTIC LOOKS AT THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We truly live in wonderful times, but now and then when Old
Devil Skeptic jumps on my back, he starts me asking myself
questions. Here are several I asked just this morning.
</P>
<P>
   1. Scientists who work with genes have just cloned some mice. It
was big news, but can somebody tell me: Why does the world need
more mice?
</P>
<P>
   Aren't there already enough mice for everybody? Are so many
people complaining of mice shortages that we have to clone them?
</P>
<P>
   Can't we curb the childish exuberance of the world's cloners?
Don't misread me. Cloning is a wonderful, wonderful thing, but
where will we end up when the cloners clone what they're absolutely
dying to clone just to show they can do it; to wit, people?
</P>
<P>
   Why make rush-hour traffic worse just because you've got the
know-how? That's just showing off, isn't it? Instead of glutting
the landscape with more mice and people, why don't biologists clone
creatures facing extinction?
</P>
<P>
   Frogs and toads, for instance, are much in the news just now.
They are dying en masse of a mysterious worldwide affliction. You
cloners ought to be making frogs and toads, not mice. Shouldn't
you?
</P>
<P>
   2. I am watching the already famous opening of ``Saving Private
Ryan'' with its nasty pictures of what D-Day on Omaha Beach was
probably like for the men who were there, and I am being very glad
I was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago I saw Robert Mitchum, John Wayne and Henry Fonda take
that very same beach in ``The Longest Day,'' and left the theater
full of envy. How great if I could have been there that day with
those manly stars. So calm, so indestructible, such great jaw
lines.
</P>
<P>
   As I watch, Spielberg's horrific D-Day is making hash of the
secret hero within me. Why would anyone but an utter, complete,
absolute, asinine fool regret having missed out on such reeking
slaughter?
</P>
<P>
   Why are women of our wonderful times demanding assignment to
combat duty? Can they truly believe that submitting to this kind of
butchery is essential to free woman of her ancient oppressors? How
does it promote sisterhood to step off a landing craft into a wall
of machine-gun fire?
</P>
<P>
   Has the remote-control weaponry of our wonderful times deluded
young people most fatally? Did anybody who watched the gulf war on
television see anybody bleeding?
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that in combat nobody has to be blown into widely
separate parts anymore? Is it true, as Pentagon censorship
suggested in the gulf war, that combat is a telegenically fetching
series of electronic encounters between bloodless machines? No more
disemboweled bodies on squalid battlefields?
</P>
<P>
   Is somebody kidding us?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't somebody always?
</P>
<P>
   3. My, but isn't there a lot of political to-do about the
profit-oriented health-care industry? Why do Republicans and Demos
both want to show the world that they love ailing people so much?
</P>
<P>
   Could there be an election coming up this fall?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they do not love all people with medical problems,
just people lucky enough to have some insurance coverage provided
by the managed-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are pushing bills to win themselves votes from this
insured class, which is presumed to want relief from the
penny-pinching insurance bureaucracy in charge of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these politicians devoted only to these privileged
insurance customers? Why is neither party visibly or even vocally
concerned about the 40 million people who have no insurance
coverage at all?
</P>
<P>
   Could they think it wiser not to tackle the problem of the 40
million uninsured until a bipartisan, blue-ribbon, ultra-certified,
super-orthodox, hyper-ossified panel makes recommendations?
</P>
<P>
   When do you think that might be?
</P>
<P>
   Ever?
</P>
<P>
   4. Remember what President Roosevelt told the generation that
fought the ``Private Ryan'' war? ``This generation has a rendezvous
with destiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What does our present generation have a rendezvous with? Linda
Tripp? Monica Lewinsky? The Powerball lottery?

BUFFALO BOB SMITH, 80; `VOICE AND EGO' OF HOWDY DOODY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith, the television pioneer whose question ``Say
kids! What time is it?'' was greeted with the joyous ``It's Howdy
Doody time!'' during 13 years of live broadcasts, died Thursday of
cancer in a Hendersonville, N.C., hospital near his Flat Rock home.
He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was ``literally the voice and ego'' of the freckle-faced
marionette Howdy Doody, television producer Burt DuBrow, a friend
and colleague of Smith's, said Thursday. ``A lot of people didn't
know he was Howdy's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith made his mark on pop culture by creating the show that is
often credited with establishing television as an entertainment
medium. The show drove the sales of TV sets and was considered the
first popular children's show on television, possibly because, when
it began in 1947, there was literally nothing else on the air
except test patterns until its daily 5:30 p.m. broadcast on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The show's phenomenal appeal and popularity were said to have
influenced Milton Berle and other performers to forsake the
established medium of radio and take their chances on the newer and
untested television. The show's occasionally broad slapstick was a
far remove from comedian Fred Allen's depiction of TV on small
screens: ``A collection of passport photos.''
</P>
<P>
   The show ran for 2,343 performances before succumbing in 1960 to
the more sophisticated ``Mickey Mouse Club.'' During its peak
years, the show had a viewing audience of 10 million, most children
ranging in age from two to 11 years old. Broadcast live, Smith
interacted with a studio audience of children called the Peanut
Gallery. He also showed film shorts (``Gumby'' started there and
was spun off into its own show) and sang a song or two.
</P>
<P>
   DuBrow called the show, which had a continuing story set in
Doodyville that ended on Fridays, ``the first soap opera for
kids.'' The show's ensemble included an irascible mute clown
Clarabell, once played by Bob Keeshan, who would go on to become
TV's ``Captain Kangaroo.'' Others in the ensemble were a winsome
Indian princess named Summerfall Winterspring, Phineas T. Bluster,
Dilly Dally, Chief Thunderthud, Trapper John and Flubadub.
</P>
<P>
   DuBrow said Smith was the same powerful but reassuring presence
on- and off-camera. ``What you saw you got. He had an incredible
presence. When he looked at you, you thought you were the most
important person in the world. We looked up to him as a hero. It
wasn't like today when a hero is a cartoon or a Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith got his start on the radio and his nickname in his
hometown, Buffalo, N.Y. ``I did just about everything you could do
on the radio when I was 15,'' he said. Two years later, singer Kate
Smith came to Buffalo. Smith joined her vaudeville act, playing the
piano at times and other times playing master of ceremonies. He was
back working successfully in radio when NBC was looking for someone
in 1947 to be host of a children's television show.
</P>
<P>
   That was the birth of ``The Howdy Doody Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970-71, during the Vietnam era, he and DuBrow staged a
successful tour of colleges thronged by students who'd grown up
with Howdy Doody. He continued to make hundreds of appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show was loved for much of its 13 years, it without
its critics. Stephen Davis, author of the 1987 book ``Say Kids!
What Time Is It?'' said then that Howdy Doody became an
extraordinarily lucrative merchandising machine in his time.
``Buffalo Bob would break off a conversation ... to look into the
camera and say, `Hey, kids, did you know Wonder Bread builds strong
bodies 12 ways?' Nobody held a stopwatch on advertising in those
days.'' Smith was television's first spokesman, with his wholesome
image also selling Campbell Soup and Twinkies. Smith would later
buy three radio stations and dabble in real estate. For 43 summers,
Smith vacationed at Grand Lakes Stream, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   DuBrow described Smith as a ``religious, spiritual man'' who
signed off his shows ``telling the kids not to forget to go to
church or their place of worship. He played 15 to 20 instruments,
including the piano and the organ at church.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Smith's Howdy Doody was ``Proustian, as familiar as
the sound and sense of the cooking in the kitchen. It reminds
Yuppies of our mothers puttering around in the kitchen between 5
and 6 in the afternoon. It gave us the warm glow of childhood, the
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 57 years, Mildred, Smith is survived by his
three sons, Robin, Ronald, and Christopher and three grandchildren.

HANGED BRITON IS EXONERATED AFTER 46 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For 46 years the relatives of Derek Bentley, hanged at
19 for his role in the murder of a police officer, told anyone who
would listen that he was the victim of a terrible miscarriage of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   They went to Parliament looking for the support of legislators.
They went to Speakers' Corner, that great democratic bazaar in Hyde
Park in London, and pleaded their case before the gathered crowds.
They went to documentary filmmakers, reporters and crusading book
authors. And year after year they went to the British government,
asking for help, and were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Bentley family and what had become a passionate
network of supporters finally got what they had fought for.
Britain's highest court overturned the conviction against Bentley,
saying that the trial judge had presented such a one-sided account
of the case to the jury that Bentley had been denied ``that fair
trial which is the birthright of every British citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be a matter of profound and continuing regret that
this mistrial occurred and that the defects we have found were not
recognized at the time,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Nov. 2, 1952, Bentley and a 16-year-old friend,
Christopher Craig, were confronted by police as they tried to break
into a warehouse in south London. While Bentley _ who was prone to
seizures and had the mental age of 11 _ was held by one of the
officers, Craig shot and killed Police Constable Sidney Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bentley took no part in the killing, three officers
testified that he had yelled, ``Let him have it, Chris,'' inciting
his friend to fire at Constable Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bentley's assertion that he never uttered those words _
an assertion that was backed up by Craig and several other
witnesses _ he was convicted of murder and hanged in January 1953.
Because of his age, Craig was sent to prison and released after 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In its judgment Thursday, written by the chief justice of the
Court of Appeal, Lord Bingham, the court found that the language
used by the trial judge amounted to a ``highly rhetorical and
strongly-worded denunciation of both defendants and their
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the court concluded, the trial judge gave
far too much weight to the word of the police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury were never fairly invited by the trial judge to
consider the points which had been made on the appellant's
behalf,'' the judgment said. ``The effect was to deprive him of the
protection which jury trial should have afforded.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also said that even if Bentley had yelled ``Let him
have it,'' the statement was ambiguous. ``It could bear an innocent
meaning, being an encouragement by the appellant to Craig to hand
over his weapon,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   The day Bentley was executed, crowds demonstrated outside
Wandsworth Prison, where he was being held, and at the Houses of
Parliament. And his 21-year-old sister, Iris, who had already lost
two siblings, returned her engagement ring to her fiance and vowed
to spend the rest of her life fighting to clear her brother's name.
</P>
<P>
   In years of campaigning, petitioning and hoping, she achieved a
number of hard-won victories. In 1965 Parliament voted to abolish
the death penalty, in part because of the country's continued
unease over the Bentley case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Bentley's remains were removed from a prison graveyard
and buried in a grave in a south London cemetery, which Miss
Bentley kept covered in flowers and where the headstone reads:
``Here lies the body of Derek Bentley, a victim of British
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The case inspired countless sympathetic books, television
documentaries, songs and films, including the 1991 feature film
``Let Him Have It.''
</P>
<P>
   And although one home secretary after another turned down Miss
Bentley's requests to reopen the case, in 1993 Home Secretary
Michael Howard finally granted Bentley a limited pardon, saying he
should not have been put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Last November the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an
independent body set up to re-examine possible miscarriages of
justice, finally sent the Bentley case to the Court of Appeal. But
the decision was too late for Iris Bentley, who died earlier that
year after a long struggle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday her daughter, Maria Dingwall-Bentley, celebrated by
opening a bottle of 1958 Moet &AMP; Chandon Champagne that Iris and
Derek's father had bought in anticipation of this day. But she said
her joy was laced with regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been one of the most pleasurable days of my
life, but also tinged with great sadness that my mother, Iris, is
not here today,'' Ms. Dingwall-Bentley said at a news conference.
``For 46 years all we have known is Derek never murdered anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyer, Benedict Birnberg, applauded the decision
Thursday but lashed out at the successive governments, most under
Conservative rule, that had refused to re-examine the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had every opportunity, year after year, to refer this
case back to the courts or to have a public inquiry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, now 62 and a retired plumber, said that Thursday's ruling
had left him ``grateful and relieved,'' but ``saddened that it has
taken those 46 years for the authorities of this country to admit
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig expressed his remorse over the death of Constable Miles
and said he would never speak publicly about the case again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day does not go by when I don't think about Derek,'' he
said. &QL;

   CABLE-ALLEN (Seattle) Software billionaire Paul Allen morphed
himself into a cable TV mogul yesterday, announcing he would spent
$4.5 billion to buy Charter Communications and combine it with
Marcus Cable (which he bought a couple of months ago) to become the
nation's seventh-largest cable operator. The deals give him
high-speed access into about 2.5 million homes and a platform he
can use to deliver a wealth of cool stuff _ interactive television,
convenient electronic commerce, lightning-fast Internet access,
local and long-distance telephone service and eventually video on
demand _ he envisions in the ``wired world'' of the ever-nearer
future. The Charter purchase is Allen's largest personal investment
so far and the latest in a string of deals that signify a growing
belief in the business world that the TV cable is the best way to
deliver tons of digital data to the home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith, a singing piano player and chatty radio disk
jockey who created Howdy Doody and then teamed up with the puppet
on one of early television's most enduring children's shows, died
Thursday at a hospital in Hendersonville, N.C. The cause was
cancer, said his family. Smith was 80 and lived in Flat Rock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, kids, what time is it?'' Buffalo Bob would ask his Peanut
Gallery of children aged 3 to 8 years, gathered in an NBC studio in
New York at 30 Rockefeller Plaza every afternoon, five days a week,
in the late 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time,'' they'd respond with the lung power
that only children of that age can demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   And then they'd sing their Howdy Doody theme, set to the tune of
the French ditty, ``Ta-ra-ra-Boom-der-e:''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time/It's Howdy Doody time/Bob Smith and
Howdy, too/Say `howdy doo' to you/Let's give a rousing cheer/Cause
Howdy Doody's here/It's time to start the show/So kids, let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   Such doings made ``Howdy Doody'' one of the first shows NBC ever
produced in color.
</P>
<P>
   For many years in the 1950s, Buffalo Bob and Howdy were on
Monday to Friday at 5:30 p.m. After the theme, they'd be joined for
an hour by their friends, some human, some made of wood. These
included Clarabell the Clown, human, (he said nary a word but
hopped around honking a Harpo Marx-type horn stuck in his belt,
which he would remove to honk in Buffalo Bob's ear, which he
usually also sprayed with seltzer); Chief Thunderthud, human,
official representative of the Ooragnak Indians (``Ooragnak was
kangaroo spelled backwards); Princess Summerfall Winterspring (she
began as a puppet, then was transformed into a human because
Buffalo Bob, who hired actress Judy Tyler, wanted something
beautiful and life-sized for girls to identify with and Ms. Tyler
was all of that); and such puppets as Phineas T. Bluster, the
always grumpy but never evil mayor of Doodyville, his Latin and
Anglo brothers, Don Jose Bluster and Hector Hamhock Bluster, and
Flub-a-Dub, a meatball-eating wild animal made up of eight
different animals that Buffalo Bob claimed he had caught in a
jungle in South America.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a machine of sorts, a Super Talkscope, that
enabled Buffalo Bob and Howdy to instantly see what was going on
any place in the world, any time they wanted to. There were songs,
too, one of which was ``Iggily Wiggily Spaghetti,'' a big hit with
the Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a big man with an easy smile who almost always wore a
fringed cowboy outfit. At first Howdy called him ``Mr. Smith,'' but
as the years progressed, he became known to one and all as Buffalo
Bob, a name that had nothing to do with the Wild West but rather
with his hometown in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy started as an unprepossessing piece of wood in 1947 after
Smith talked NBC into letting him do a children's show. He grew out
of a character Smith had created on his radio show, ``Triple B
Ranch,'' called Elmer, who would greet Smith with a ``howdy
doody.'' His audiences soon came to call the puppet Howdy Doody.
That first Howdy was quickly retired when NBC and Smith got into a
dispute with Frank Paris, the puppet-maker, who declared that Howdy
was and forever would be his property and nobody else's, the
creative fortunes of Buffalo Bob and his writer notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then sought out some artists at Walt Disney's studios in
California, who refined Howdy into a freckle-faced kid, 27 inches
tall, with prominent ears who wore jeans, a bandanna and a checked
shirt. His delivery sounded suspiciously like that of Mortimer
Snerd, a dummy hayseed who had been created on radio by
ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for the madcap top-hatted wisacre,
Charlie McCarthy. The second Howdy was so successful that Smith
commissioned a second puppet as a stand-in, whom he called Double
Doody, and a third puppet with no strings attached who posed for
photos. He was called Photo Doody.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffalo Bob was neither a ventriloquist nor a puppeteer and
he never tried to engage in the kinds of pungent exchanges that
occurred between Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. Professional
puppeteers off camera manipulated Howdy's movements whenever he and
Smith had a conversation. Smith pre-recorded all Howdy's responses;
when they were on television, the exchanges between Buffalo Bob and
Howdy were all controlled by an engineer who simply put his finger
on the record and stopped the turntable when Smith was talking,
then took his finger off and let the turntable roll when it was
Howdy's turn. Not exactly high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy, as he was developed by writer Eddie Kean, was neither
excruciatingly thick like Mortimer nor wickedly and unredeemably
sophisticated as Charlie. Howdy was somehow direct without being
intrusive and friendly and supportive of Buffalo Bob without
becoming dull to the Peanut Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Howdy Doody was a sissy,'' said Kean on one
occasion. ``He was me as a child. I always preferred to study than
to play baseball. I never hit anybody. No one ever hit me. He was
the dullest character on the show. No offense to Bob, but he was
because I made him so.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Clarabell was Bob Keeshan, who went on to become
Captain Kangaroo. Clarabell never had a line to say until the show
went off the air (after 2,343 performances) on Sept. 30, 1960, at
which time he looked into the camera and said simply and wistfully,
``Goodbye, kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob moved to Florida from Mount Vernon, N.Y., bought
three radio stations and a liquor store, and thought he was out of
the Howdy Doody business.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. It could never be a permanent goodbye for
the youngsters who grew up watching Buffalo Bob, then went off to
serve in the war in Vietnam or to oppose it. After the tumult of
the 1960s, they felt they needed to return to simpler times. A
Howdy Doody revival started at the University of Pennsylvania in
1970. Someone asked students there what they would like to do most
of all, and many of them said they would like to revisit the world
of Howdy Doody.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, 1970, Buffalo Bob and Howdy showed up at Penn and
hosted a repeat of Howdy's 10th anniversary show of Dec. 28, 1957.
They were a hit and Buffalo Bob never stopped being Buffalo Bob
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith was born Robert Schmidt on Nov. 27, 1917, in
Buffalo, N.Y., the son of Emil H. Schmidt and Emma Kuehn Schmidt.
Schmidt had for years earned his keep as a coal miner in Illinois.
After a cave-in in which Schmidt was one of only three miners to
survive, his wife suggested that he leave the mines. He agreed,
taking his family to Buffalo, where he became a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Young Bob was encouraged to learn to play the piano and organ
and by the time he was 15 years old, he was on a Buffalo radio
station singing. He formed a three-man vocal group called the
Hi-Hatters. One member of the Hi-Hatters was Foster Brooks, who in
later years became famous as the drunk who frequently appeared in
Dean Martin's television program in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of making his way on upstate New York radio,
he came to New York City in August, 1947, and got a job as a disk
jockey on radio station WEAF, then owned by the National
Broadcasting Co. By 1947, Smith had a Saturday morning quiz show
for kids. The Howdy Doody show started that same year, at first on
Saturdays, then on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, finally, five
times a week, where it lasted for an hour. It was successful from
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy Doody was so popular that people gathered in the streets
before appliance store windows to watch it, as they did with
baseball games and wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy's popularity being what it was, it was announced in 1948
that he would run for president of all the boys and girls. Harry
Truman also happened to be running that year, and he won the
election over New York Gov. Thomas Dewey. But Howdy did get a great
many votes, becoming president of the boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Smith ran afoul of NBC executives when, during his
early morning talk show, he announced that a spaceship had landed
in Virginia and that it had contained that bodies of
Liliputian-like men attired in 15th century outfits. He read it as
though it had come from the wires of United Press, and although it
did not cause the alarm of Orson Welles' ``Martian invasion'' of
1938, it frightened a great many people, especially those living in
Virginia. NBC told him never to do anything like that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love kids,'' he told Val Adams of The New York Times in
1954. ``Kids never get on my nerves.'' Maybe not, but an overworked
Bob Smith soon suffered a heart attack and for a time, he did the
show from his home in Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith is survived by his wife, Mildred, to whom he was
married for 57 years, his three sons, Robin, Ronald and
Christopher, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. None of
them went into show business.

FUNERAL HELD FOR CAPITOL SHOOTING VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ John Michael Gibson, one of two officers killed
last week protecting the Capitol, was remembered as he was laid to
rest next to other American heroes at Arlington National Cemetery
Thursday as a man who lived to help others.
</P>
<P>
   His widow, Evelyn, wept as she and their children, Daniel, 14,
Jack, 15, and Kristen, 17, each placed a long-stemmed red rose on
Gibson's mahogany casket. They embraced one another, and Evelyn
Gibson wiped tears from her daughter's face.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a 42-year-old &UR;  &LR; Capitol Police detective, &UR;  &LR; was given full
police honors, including a fly-over by police helicopters and a
21-gun, three-volley salute, at a service attended by family
members from Massachusetts, busloads of congressmen, and police
officers from Canada to California.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners was the family of Capitol Police Officer
Jacob J. Chestnut, who also died last Friday when Russell Weston
Jr., a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, allegedly stormed the
Capitol. Gibson's family plans to attend Friday's services for
Chestnut, 58, an Air Force veteran, who will be buried at Arlington
with full military honors.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Chestnut are the first Capitol Police officers to die
in the line of duty in the more than 100-year history of the force.
Gibson died just hours before his family was scheduled to leave on
vacation. The Capitol shooting was believed to be the first time he
ever had to draw his weapon in his 18 years with the force.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Gibson was to have been best man at the wedding of
his brother, Charles, an Air Force sergeant based at the American
Embassy in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now John, you'll have the best seat in the house,'' said Jack
De Wolfe, supervisor of special agents for the Capitol Police, who
gave Gibson's eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   After the funeral at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in suburban
Lake Ridge, a motorcade of more than 1,000 police motorcycles and
cruisers stretched for 15 miles along Interstate 95, according to
the Military District of Washington. The route was lined by many
families with children who held American flags and stood in silent
tribute to the slain detective.
</P>
<P>
   Special congressional permission was granted for Gibson, who did
not serve in the military, to be buried at Arlington. His grave, on
a grassy knoll beneath red maple trees, is just a short walk from
the gravesite of President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   De Wolfe, who was Gibson's best friend and immediate supervisor,
delivered an emotional, and sometimes humorous, eulogy, remembering
his fellow Massachusetts native as a man who never lost his
enthusiasm for police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``John enjoyed helping people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When they joined the Capitol force as rookies in 1980, DeWolfe
said another Massachusetts native, John Morrissey, asked if Gibson
could join their car pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another guy who liked the Red Sox and Bruins and Celtics,''
recalled DeWolfe during the service. ``How could I go wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   On their first assignment as plainclothes detectives, a local
police official in the Midwest asked if either of them ``spoke
English,'' De Wolfe said with a distinctive Massachusetts accent
that drew laughter from the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gibson, a bodyguard for House Republican whip Tom DeLay
of Texas, never failed to stop at an accident scene to provide
assistance when they drove into Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met an individual who loved his profession as much as
John,'' said DeWolfe.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gibson, who delighted in his motorcycle training, was
happiest on motorcycle rounds on Capitol Hill. De Wolfe said Gibson
inherited his driving skills from his father, Charles, and his
ability to tell a joke from his mother, Eleanor. His parents still
live in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Moakley family members were at the services Thursday.
Evelyn Gibson is the daughter of Robert Moakley, the brother of
Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston Democrat.

`MIRETTE': A CASE OF PLUCK TURNING INTO LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HADDAM, Conn. _ What is it about the Goodspeed Opera House
and musicals involving plucky, pint-size redheads who melt hearts
and minister to troubled adults? From the theater where ``Annie''
was born 22 years ago now comes ``Mirette,'' with music and lyrics
by ``The Fantasticks'' team of Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones. It is
adapted from the prize-winning children's book ``Mirette on the
High Wire,'' the story of a little girl's dream of becoming a
tightrope walker.
</P>
<P>
   Goodspeed, that riverside Victorian doll house, is about as
hospitable a backdrop as could be furnished for a musical about
childish wishes. And the theater's latest offering, aided greatly
by Schmidt's jaunty melodies and Cassandra Kubinski's unaffected
performance in the title role, strives mightily to take the
audience along into the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Mirette,'' originally produced in Goodspeed's smaller,
workshop-oriented space, never really finds its footing on the
theater's main stage. The expansion and embellishment of Emily
Arnold McCully's delightful book proves too burdensome an exercise
for so slender a narrative. To get to the not-all-that climactic
moment in which Mirette finally walks the tightrope, we sit through
an entire symphony when a simple drumroll would do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCully's illustrated book, published in 1992, tells the
sweetly wistful story of the awakening of Mirette's unlikely
ambition when a celebrated tightrope walker checks into the
vivacious Parisian boardinghouse run by her mother, Madame Gateau.
The performer, Bellini, has fled the circus after developing a
sudden fear of heights; in teaching Mirette his craft he finds the
strength to conquer his own phobia.
</P>
<P>
   You can see why Schmidt's and Jones' curiosity was piqued. In
subjects ranging from first love (``The Fantasticks'') to wedded
bliss (``I Do! I Do!'') the venerable partnership has often been
attracted to tales with a bedtime-story shimmer to them. Their best
work here, in ``Learning Who You Are,'' a duet for Mirette and
Bellini, reflects their penchant for finding the music in fairy
tale pairings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It's difficult, however, to present a full-blown musical on the
promise of sparkle. Ms. Diggs, the show's book writer, does her
best to broaden the plot by filling Madame Gateau's boardinghouse
with an assortment of aspiring jugglers, opera singers and
tumblers. But they're standard-issue secondary characters, lifeless
and charmless.
</P>
<P>
   Director Andre Ernotte displays no particular warmth for this
material. The pantherlike Mellon certainly looks as if he could
walk the high wire, but his menacing manner makes his Bellini less
likely as a mentor for an impressionable girl than as a candidate
for special scrutiny by the neighborhood watch committee.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Kubinski, though, is a sturdy and unspoiled presence. She's
the sturdy center of a show that isn't quite the confection it's
meant to be.

COYOTE SIGHTINGS ON THE RISE IN SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With Coyote-Attack)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ABBY FUNG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrolman David Malcolmson said he had never even heard the word
coyote mentioned around quiet Sandwich, Mass. five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last three weeks, residents of the small Cape Cod
town have inundated the police and animal-control departments with
18 calls of coyote sightings _ all before four-year-old Daniel Neal
was attacked by a coyote while playing in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials say this is the first documented coyote
attack on a human in Massachusetts, and that attacks are rare,
usually prompted only by rabies or if the animal has been fed by
humans.
</P>
<P>
   But the proliferation of coyotes in the state _ and particularly
into its eastern and southern regions _ has been a long time
coming, since the first of the animals began migrating to
Massachusetts 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Langlois, a wildlife biologist with the state Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife, said reports of coyote sightings have been
``steadily increasing,'' with some fluctuations, from 81 in 1990 to
137 in 1996. The slight dip last year, to 105, was due to the fact
that the animals are now so common in some places that people have
stopped reporting them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people, after their third years of seeing coyotes,
who just don't report it anymore,'' Langlois said. ``The Cape is
the newest territory for the coyote to expand to. It's not
commonplace to see a coyote yet, so you might get the increase in
the number of calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Chatham officials hired a federal
sharpshooter to kill two coyotes who had supposedly been plaguing
the town's population of endangered piping plovers.
</P>
<P>
   Langlois said the first sighting of the coyote in southern and
eastern Massachusetts occurred during the 1970s, after coyotes had
migrated down from the Canadian border in the 1940s and 1950s into
Massachusetts' northern and western regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only place they don't exist yet is Nantucket and the
Vineyard,'' Langlois said. ``Whatever habitat is available to them,
they'll adapt to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cocca of the Massachusetts Audubon Society in Lincoln,
Mass. agrees. When she first started working for the society 10
years ago, Cocca said, she received only one call a month about
coyotes. Now she receives about three or four calls a month, and
from places which are farther south and east.
</P>
<P>
   The state coyote population, which is around 3,000, is
increasing because coyotes are highly adaptable, and can live off
brush piles, compost piles, trash bins, or scraps of food left for
them by people, wildlife officials say.
</P>
<P>
   They rarely attack people, but when they do, the attacks can be
deadly. In Los Angeles, one person was killed and nine were
attacked by coyotes between 1975 and 1981: Six of the nine were
children younger than five.

 &HT;    CLINTON WEIGHED LAW AND POLITICS IN GRAND JURY DECISION
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With one eye on the justice system and another on
the court of public opinion, President Clinton has staked his
presidency on his belief that the political risk of fighting Ken
Starr far outweighs the legal risk of cooperating with him.
</P>
<P>
   He's betting that whatever the independent counsel reports to
Congress, lawmakers will be reluctant to impeach a popular
president weeks before all House members and a third of the Senate
must face voters back home.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to Clinton, however, is that his Aug. 17 grand jury
testimony will damage public trust in him, or that Starr will give
Congress evidence that the president had lied under oath or
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Any of those outcomes, analysts say, could erode Clinton's
public popularity, perhaps his greatest insurance against moves by
a Republican-led Congress to impeach and convict him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Congress will not get too far ahead of the public,'' said
Michael Genovese, a political science professor at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, said Genovese, ''Clinton really has to be
careful of how this plays in Peoria _ even more than how it plays
in court.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Clinton's playing very well in the heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the legal tide appeared to turn this week against
Clinton, an NBC News poll taken Wednesday showed 68 percent of
Americans approving of the way Clinton is doing his job, up five
percentage points from a month ago. The poll showed 27 percent of
Americans disapproving, with 5 percent unsure. The telephone survey
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of probing allegations that Clinton had an
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and then
urged her to lie about it under oath _ charges the president has
denied _ Starr obtained a court order requiring Clinton to answer
questions before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena was withdrawn after Clinton agreed instead to
voluntarily give his testimony by videotape from the White House
with his lawyers present.
</P>
<P>
   He did so even though many legal experts believe Starr could not
have forced Clinton to honor the court order.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a strong argument that he can't, on the grounds that
he's in a unique position _ there's only one president,'' said
Thomas Sargentich, professor of constitutional law and presidential
powers at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Having one branch of the American government, the judiciary,
dictate terms to another, the president, could be argued to be
unconstitutional, a matter that Clinton's attorneys could have
taken to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a fairly strong constitutional argument, and it would
not be a bad thing for the president to assert it,'' said
Sargentich.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stakes are much greater than this particular president's
future,'' said Sargentich. ''The question is one of preserving the
power and the dignity of the office of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political advisers, however, counseled against taking
a stand that might make it appear that the president was primarily
concerned with saving his own skin.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats, fighting to regain the House in the
November elections, warned that they would not support Clinton if
he resisted testifying.
</P>
<P>
   There were fears, moreover, that Clinton might not prevail in
the Supreme Court. Other presidents, including George Bush, Ronald
Reagan and even Thomas Jefferson, have given testimony to grand
juries considering criminal charges against third parties. Some
legal experts contend that the Supreme Court might well have leaned
on those cases as precedent, then ruled that testimony from Clinton
in a case focusing on him was comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to testify also reflects a set of
calculations as yet inscrutable to the public.
</P>
<P>
   While Lewinsky is reportedly prepared to testify that she had an
affair with Clinton, reversing an earlier sworn statement in which
she said the opposite, the public has been offered no proof that
such an affair took place.
</P>
<P>
   If it didn't, then Clinton could simply elaborate in his
testimony on his now famous January claim that he never had sex
with ''that woman _ Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's later shown that an affair did take place, however,
Clinton's credibility, already a liability to him, could slip
further, posing a potential threat to his public support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politically, what you do (with the testimony) is you make it
look like you're cooperating, you make it look like you're the
victim, you make it look like Ken Starr is out to get you,'' said
Genovese.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk is, if he did lie under oath, then Congress would
consider that an impeachable offense,'' Genovese said. ''That would
cross a legal line that could give the Republicans credibility
...It opens a door that right now is not open.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possibility is that Clinton might admit to
wrongdoing and ask the nation to forgive him, and try to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton ultimately tells Starr and his team on Aug. 17,
it's certain that the president will look, as he has throughout his
career, to his personal powers of persuasion and his political
instincts to put the best possible face on the matter, in the hope
that he'll be embraced by the jury he knows best _ in the court of
public opinion.

 &HT;    Lottery chief stands by Powerball decision
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Georgia Lottery President Rebecca Paul said Thursday
she doesn't regret her decision nearly two years ago to bail out of
Powerball and join The Big Game, a more conservative, multi-state
jackpot game.
</P>
<P>
   That move kept Georgians on the sidelines this week while many
parts of the nation were gripped in Powerball mania over a $295.7
million jackpot that was finally claimed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said such mammoth jackpots cause short-term surges in
lottery ticket sales in the 20 Powerball states but don't
necessarily boost those lotteries' sales in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   She said Powerball jackpots of $195 million and $295 million in
recent months may cause ``jackpot fatigue,'' where players decide
to postpone ticket buying until jackpots reach very high levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you continue to raise the bar higher and higher, the long
term impact is negative for raising money for programs you fund,''
Paul said. The Georgia lottery funds HOPE college scholarships,
pre-kindergarten and technical programs for schools.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said the Georgia Lottery pulled out of Powerball in the
late summer of 1996 due to concerns about Georgia's liability for
other new games Powerball states _ all considerably smaller than
Georgia _ planned to launch.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Lottery didn't want to join one particular new game
run by the Multi-State Lottery Association, which also runs
Powerball. But attorneys warned that Georgia might not be able to
escape liability for the new game as long as it remained a member
of the association, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia quit Powerball before the new game began. Meanwhile, six
states similar in size to Georgia were beginning The Big Game. At
the time, odds for winning the Big Game were 52 million to 1,
slightly better than Powerball's 54 million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   But after Georgia departed, Powerball lengthened its odds to 80
million to 1, greatly increasing the chances that its jackpots
would roll over, creating bigger payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given Georgians the opportunity to play for $60-$70
million jackpots,'' Paul said. ``And we've had several winners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia ticket sales volume for The Big Game since late 1996
haven't matched Powerball ticket sales through August 1996 when it
was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Big Game sales failed to reach the $1 million mark on 30 percent
of the draws in the past six months, while Powerball failed to
reach that mark on only 4 percent of draws during the same period
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, daily sales for both games were highly sensitive to
jackpot levels at the time. For example, while $1.2 million
Powerball tickets were sold on April 3, 1996, when the jackpot was
$5 million, $5.6 million Big Game tickets were sold on April 3,
1998, when its jackpot was $50 million.

 &HT;    Sinclair Community College offers distance learning courses
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Sinclair Community College has joined with seven
other community colleges across the country to offer
distance-learning courses to students starting this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Community College Distance Learning Network will make as
many as 500 courses available in a variety of ways, including
video, audio, Internet and CD-ROM, according to Peggy Falkenstein,
Sinclair's dean of distance learning. The venture is designed to
make it easier for potential students to gain access to a college
education, and it also could boost enrollment and tuition revenue
for Sinclair, Falkenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair has offered such distance-learning courses since the
early 1980s, and currently has 59 courses available on the Internet
and 73 on video. The collaboration with other colleges will greatly
increase the profile of Sinclair's offerings: The colleges are
preparing an advertising campaign for the Yahoo! web site and
national newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The courses will be open to students anywhere who pay the
tuition to the college providing the instruction, Falkenstein said.
Sinclair will offer the courses for $31 per credit hour to
Montgomery County residents, $50 per credit hour to out-of-county
Ohio residents and $83 per credit hour to out-of-state students.
Montgomery County residents pay the least because they support
Sinclair through a countywide tax and through their state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration will also make full use of Sinclair's newly
constructed Center for Interactive Learning, a technology-rich
building in the heart of the downtown Dayton campus that is poised
to open Sept. 14.

REPORTS OF DRESS, TAPES RAISE NEW QUESTIONS IN CLINTON
INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reports that Monica Lewinsky is turning a dress and
an answering-machine tape over to special counsel Kenneth Starr
raised new legal questions _ and White House angst _ Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The items could hold tell-tale evidence of an intimate
relationship between Lewinsky and President Clinton, who has denied
under oath and in public statements having sex with the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Unclear was whether the tape could bear on Lewinsky's expected
testimony to a federal grand jury that she and Clinton agreed to
deny having sex during her repeated visits to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Also uncertain was how Starr intends to seek samples, such as
blood, saliva or hair, from Clinton for DNA matching tests with any
residue on the dress. A request for such samples could set off
another legal wrangle between the president's lawyers and the
special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The White House refused comment on ``any of these rumors'' about
Lewinsky producing material evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A dress, supposedly semen stained, figured in the early days of
the investigation last winter because of reports that Lewinsky
talked about the garment with Linda Tripp, a former White House
aide who taped their conversations. William Ginsburg, one of
Lewinsky's original lawyers who has since left the case, said in
January a dress existed that ``might be forensically important in
terms of DNA evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents, under a court-ordered search warrant, removed
several garments from Lewinsky's Watergate apartment, but
reportedly no evidence incriminating to Clinton was found. The
dress reportedly turned over to Starr on Wednesday was given to
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, for safekeeping, according to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky took the dress and tape with her when she went to her
lawyers' office to sign papers relating to the immunity deal,
sources said. In broadcast tape of Lewinsky en route to her lawyers
office, she is holding a carryall bag, which reportedly contained
items to be given to Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern has been granted immunity from
prosecution for any action in the case _ except for lying to the
grand jury in her upcoming testimony. She swore in the Paula Jones
harassment case that she had not had a sexual relationship with the
president but is now reported ready to recant.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the official silence at the White House, the possibility
that the special counsel has physical evidence to back up
Lewinsky's claim of a sexual relationship sent a shudder through
the Clinton administration on the day after the president agreed to
be questioned by Starr's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not good news for the president,'' said a senior
administration official. ``Despite legal questions that can be
fought out (between the White House and Starr's office), this
intensifies the need for Clinton to be absolutely, unequivocally
truthful'' in his videotaped grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Among the future legal battlegrounds could be the issue of
whether the president can be forced to provide DNA samples to be
compared with any residue from the dress.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who specialize in criminal cases said a demand by Starr
for sample of Clinton's blood, saliva or hair could lead to a legal
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years of case law is on Starr's side, said David Baugh, a
former assistant U.S. attorney in Texas and Virginia. ``It
shouldn't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts freely order (such samples) on the basis of potential
relevance'' in routine cases, said Edward Millett, a criminal
defense lawyer in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Hollander of Albuquerque, N.M., a specialist in Fourth
Amendment search-and-seizure cases, said ``the rules seem to be
different in this case'' and predicted another deal based on
negotiations between Clinton's lawyers and Starr's office. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; National polls published Thursday indicated that while the
public continues to approve of Clinton's handling of his job, there
is increasing concern about whether he committed perjury in denying
a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal-NBC survey found that by 64 percent to 30
percent respondents approved of Clinton's job performance _ a
continuation of his strong ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some erosion on the issue of whether perjury about
his relationship with Lewinsky is grounds for Congress to begin
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Journal-NBC survey found that 57 percent to 39
percent of respondents did not believe perjury about sex was
serious enough to warrant an impeachment inquiry, but in the most
recent sampling the margin had closed to six points, 51 percent to
45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum has switched in another direction,'' said Peter
Hart, a Democratic pollster who with a Republican analyst oversees
the poll.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Thursday, Starr called a group of Secret
Service personnel before grand juries, apparently probing for
information on what the protective force may have seen during
Lewinsky's more than three-dozen visits to the White House during
and after her internship.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, accompanied by Secret Service attorney Mike Leibig,
made no comment as they arrived at the federal courthouse.

 &HT;    HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPLIT IMMIGRATION AGENCY
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House immigration subcommittee voted Thursday
to create a new law-enforcement agency that would operate the
Border Patrol and handle deportations and other anti-crime
functions currently performed by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Like the FBI, the new Bureau of Enforcement and Border Affairs
would be a separate division of the Justice Department. The INS,
already part of the Justice Department, would be responsible solely
for the citizenship process.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was introduced two weeks ago by Rep. Harold
Rogers, R-Ky., and its swift approval by the immigration
subcommittee reflects growing impatience among both Republicans and
Democrats for improvements in the performance of the INS,
particularly in processing a nationwide backlog of 1.9 million
applications for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this separation will improve both immigration
service and enforcement operations,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, chairman of the immigration subcommittee. Smith offered a
litany of complaints about the failure of the INS to respond to
requests from both Congress and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Smith said a couple waited more than a year for
INS approval of their adoption of an orphan from India: ``They sent
a written inquiry, only to receive a terse written reply that ...
such inquiries take away from the time the INS has to process
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration recognizes the weaknesses in the INS,
but opposes dividing the agency's responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do acknowledge and agree there needs to be some management
improvement there,'' Associate Attorney General Ray Fisher said
Thursday. ``That has already been undertaken in great measure by
(INS Commissioner) Doris Meissner and the INS. We oppose the
proposal to split the agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who met two weeks
ago with Vice President Al Gore to complain about the citizenship
backlog, were wary Thursday of the legislation that would divide
the agency in charge of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we believe reform of the INS is vital, we are concerned
... (that) this legislation does not address one of the priorities
of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus _ immigrant services,'' 13
caucus members said in a letter to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate immigration subcommittee, led by Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., is still examining possible solutions to INS
problems and plans the third of three hearings on the subject in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a very slow approach,'' said Abraham's
spokesman, Joe McMonigle. ``We're going to ... look at all the
functions of INS, then use next year to start on legislation.''

INSURER AIG TO INVEST IN MERCHANT BANK BLACKSTONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American International Group Inc. said Thursday that
it would invest $1.35 billion in the Blackstone Group, the private
New York merchant bank, raising the prospect of considerable future
cooperation between the two companies as the traditional barriers
between insurance and investment banking continue to erode.
</P>
<P>
   The big insurance group is paying $150 million of this money to
acquire a 7 percent limited partnership stake in Blackstone, while
the remainder, an estimated $1.2 billion, would be invested in
Blackstone's private equity partnerships, real estate funds and
other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In a relationship that both companies see continuing for many
years, AIG is also committing to reinvesting this money with
Blackstone along with at least half of its after-tax profits,
Blackstone president and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman said in
an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely therefore that the money AIG is agreeing to invest
could grow to $2 billion to $3 billion or more within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   AIG's 7 percent stake in Blackstone replaces $100 million that
Nikko Securities Inc. of Japan had invested in the New York
merchant bank in 1988. That stake now makes less sense for Nikko,
after the Japanese securities company _ responding to the
continuing deregulation of Tokyo's financial markets _ a few weeks
ago entered into a worldwide partnership with the Travelers Group
and its Salomon Smith Barney investment banking subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement of AIG's investment also reflects the
continuing convergence of Wall Street businesses, analysts said.
``AIG would at one point have been viewed as a traditional
insurance company,'' said John Keefe, an independent New York
financial analyst. ``Not now. This shows that the barriers between
the different sectors of U.S. finance _ banking, insurance and
investment banking _ are wearing away. This makes AIG look more
like a merchant bank or an investment bank.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   AIG's financial strength has many analysts speculating about its
future strategy. In 1997, the company was the most profitable among
insurance and financial services companies with headquarters in the
United States. Its $3.33 billion net profit in 1997 on revenue of
$30.6 billion represented a record for the company and the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting investment with a number of fascinating
sideline possibilities,'' said Michael Lewis, an insurance analyst
at Warburg Dillon Read. ``AIG is viewed more and more as an
acquirer and part of the consolidation of the financial services
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Blackstone and AIG, which are both based in New
York City, have worked together for many years. AIG chairman and
chief executive Maurice Greenberg has been on Blackstone's advisory
board since 1989. But Thursday's announcement represents a
considerable deepening of the existing business relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been an investor in Blackstone funds for a number of
years,'' Greenberg said, adding that AIG has in the past invested
$300 million in Blackstone funds. Speaking from Switzerland, where
he is on vacation, Greenberg praised Blackstone's returns as among
the best in the investment banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said Thursday that the Blackstone Capital
Partners II fund had returned an average of 68 percent a year since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the relationship between AIG and
Blackstone will grow further, particularly as there has long been
speculation that the big insurance group might seek to grow by
acquiring, or merging with, a Wall Street firm. Greenberg, however,
seemed wary of compromising Blackstone's independence. ``I have
known Pete Peterson and Steve Schwarzman for many years,'' he said
Thursday. ``It's a long relationship. The thing that makes them
good is their independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The payment of $150 million for 7 percent of Blackstone would
imply a valuation of $2.14 billion for the entire company.
Schwarzman cautioned that this, however, would represent a
``minimum notional value'' for the firm as Blackstone is not a
publicly quoted company.
</P>
<P>
   Blackstone chairman Peter Peterson and Schwarzman teamed up at
Lehman Brothers, where Peterson was chairman and Schwarzman was his
deputy. In 1985, they founded Blackstone to focus on private equity
investing, real estate investment, asset management, and advising
on mergers and acquisitions and restructurings.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzman said AIG and Blackstone would explore cooperation
``on an ad hoc basis in a variety of areas,'' but he declined to
comment on what the two firms might do together in Asia, where AIG
has huge existing businesses, but where many companies might
welcome Blackstone with its track record for advice on
restructurings.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific: Asia crisis forces 2 plant closings
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Georgia-Pacific Corp. was forced to trim 25 percent
of its pulp-making production because of a decline in Asian orders
and weaker foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second-largest paper and wood-products company said
Thursday it's closing market pulp production at plants in Ashdown,
Ark., and Port Hudson, La. They produce almost 25 percent of
Georgia-Pacific pulp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been apparent that this isn't a viable product,''
Georgia-Pacific spokesman Ken Haldin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ashdown plant has 1,300 workers, and the Port Hudson plant
has 875 workers. About 30 people at each plant are being laid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we do not anticipate a turnaround in this market for
at least two years, we are acting sooner rather than later to
mothball these operations,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
A.D. ``Pete'' Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers might be eligible to transfer to other jobs or
plants, depending upon their union contracts, Haldin said.
</P>
<P>
   Market pulp is sold on the open market. Most hardwood pulp is
sold overseas. The pulp is combined with other fibers to make
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The paper-producing industry anticipates further declines in
sales in the third quarter because of the weakness in Asian
currencies, said Matt Berler, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs will occur over the next month, Haldin said. The
paper manufacturing operations _ which make copy, bond, offset
printing and writing paper _ will remain open.

 &HT;    Rumors swirl, but MediaOne denies sale
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Is MediaOne Group, the parent of Atlanta's largest
single cable system, for sale?
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based cable operator has topped Wall Street's
speculative list of prime takeover targets for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor mill cranked into action again Thursday when Ray Katz,
a prominent media analyst at Bear Stearns, suggested investors were
accumulating MediaOne shares amid speculation the company would be
bought and divided among several cable operators, including Time
Warner and Atlanta-based Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications declined comment on the speculation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has already said it is not interested in MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for us to get bigger,'' said Time Warner
Chairman Gerald Levin last week. ``We're going to build out our
current systems, not add new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Time Warner's 12 million subscribers are 50,000 in
northwest Atlanta, where the company owns a system. That system is
currently being upgraded to handle digital services such as cable
modems and high-definition television.
</P>
<P>
   While uninterested himself, Levin has the power to block the
sale of MediaOne to anyone. This right of first refusal is part of
an agreement that controls most of the company's entertainment
assets. MediaOne owns about a quarter of that partnership.
</P>
<P>
   As for MediaOne, its top executives say the company is not for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never say never,'' says MediaOne Chief Executive Jan
Peters, ``but we're absolutely not for sale. We're happy with our
assets and our strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has 540,000 subscribers in metro Atlanta and is
rebuilding the system to provide digital television, telephone
service and high-speed access to the Internet.

CRITICS SAY MEXICO'S BANK BAILOUT HELPS THE WEALTHY

 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ If there is anyone who personifies what Mexicans
distrust about their banking system, he is Angel Isidoro Rodriguez
Saez.
</P>
<P>
   For four years when Rodriguez headed a large bank, Mexican
regulators say, he made illegal loans to himself and his family
worth $400 million. When the government seized the bank in 1995,
its bailout program absorbed the huge portfolio of rotten loans
that Rodriguez had left. So far he is facing charges of fraud and
tax evasion covering at least $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans are outraged that Rodriguez, a playboy whose
nickname is The Divine, is out of jail, attending society parties,
appearing on talk shows and going about his new business of running
beachside resorts.
</P>
<P>
   So when the government asked Congress to rescue the program that
rescued Rodriguez's bank, among others, it was met with a revolt. A
newly emboldened opposition in control of the lower house has
seized on Rodriguez's case to open an intense debate over the sins
of the economic elite.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has denied that he committed fraud, promised to pay
his debts and contended that his role in the banking problem had
been overblown.
</P>
<P>
   But that has hardly soothed everyday Mexicans, besieged by high
interest rates and laboring to meet their own debts. Many of those
people say they are convinced that the government is asking them to
bail out Rodriguez and other high-living tycoons who danced away
from their own debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich are being favored, being let off from their debts,
even though they can pay them, while we, the people who suffer in
paying, have to pay,'' said Luis Corona Rodriguez, 49, a bus driver
here, who last weekend joined a small but vociferous demonstration
against the bailout.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy was ignited in March, when finance officials
admitted for the first time that the bailout program had quietly
gone about the business of cleaning up the country's banks by
taking over $62 billion of bad loans. That figure is about 16
percent of what Mexico produces in an entire year, and it was far
higher than experts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The arcane, even tedious legislative discussion that officials
had expected on refinancing the program never occurred. Instead the
government is confronting the question of who should pay for the
errors.
</P>
<P>
   As never before, top officials are being called on the carpet to
account for recurrent economic calamities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the premier moral dilemma Mexico is facing right
now,'' an anti-government social critic, Carlos Monsivais, said.
``We are looking at debts left behind by past official failures.
This government wants to charge the Mexican people infinite sums to
pay for the incompetence of a handful of functionaries and
bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, cobbled together in 1995 in the midst of an
economic cataclysm, brought the banks back from the brink of
collapse to a stable but fragile health. Now that the economy as a
whole is thriving, finance officials are seeking to put the program
on firm footing.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry is asking Congress to allocate millions of
pesos to pay the interest on the loans in the fund and to transfer
those liabilities from the fund to the overall public debt. That
move could increase the public debt, from 26 percent to 42 percent
of the annual gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal turned into a severe political test for Finance
Minister Angel Gurria, revealing the financial acumen and weak
lobbying skills of a man who is often mentioned as a possible
presidential candidate in 2000. Gurria is a charismatic technocrat
who is used to operating in an era, now past, when the opposition
was powerless and the word of a top official was as good as law.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a technocratic fix the government's proposal makes a lot of
sense,'' Manuel Pastor, an economist who specializes in Latin
America at the University of California at Santa Cruz, said. ``Up
to now the technocrats have been the masters of the universe. But
the public is asking for the first time: `What are we getting for
our money? A better financial system or some subsidy to the
wealthy?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
have balked at moving the bailout sums to the nation's debt. The
left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution has said the fund
is illegal, because Congress never authorized it. The party is
organizing a nationwide referendum on the bailout and calling for a
program to help debtors instead of banks.
</P>
<P>
   No party has suggested that the government should default on the
bailout debts, a move that could imperil the entire banking system.
But after four months of debate the issue has reached an angry
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are finance officials, including Gurria and
Guillermo Ortiz, head of the Banco de Mexico, the central bank, who
have won the trust of the markets for their expertise. Ortiz
initiated the rescue in 1995, when he was finance minister, to help
foundering banks recapitalize and protect Mexicans' deposits.
Investors lauded it as a smart alternative to a financial collapse,
which seemed imminent after a peso devaluation in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the worst moments of the crisis,'' Ortiz recalled in
an interview, ``we never had people lining up to take their money
out of the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are people like Luis Rodriguez, the bus
driver. His family's finances were wiped out when interest rates on
a bank loan topped 100 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come here today because I feel so powerless,''
Rodriguez said. ``It was my young daughter's birthday yesterday,
and what did I give her? I couldn't afford to give her anything but
a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the Fund for Bank Savings Protection, the
government helped weak banks by buying bad loan portfolios while
requiring investors to inject fresh capital. The government paid
the banks with 10-year Treasury notes that cannot trade on the
markets now and that pay no interest until they come due. The
program protected 100 percent of Mexicans' bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every bank participated. The Treasury notes now amount
to 30 percent of the banking system's assets, far more than the
banks' total capital, according to the Mexican Bankers Association.
The government's latest proposal would let the banks exchange the
notes for a security that could trade for cash.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, 12 of the 19 banks have failed despite government
assistance, and their major stockholders lost all their
investments, an estimated $1.5 billion. Even so, most Mexicans say
they do not believe official statements that the bailout was
enacted to protect their deposits, not bankers' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released by the bailout agency to Congress show that
604 multimillion-dollar loans that banks made to rich investors,
including Angel Rodriguez, account for nearly half the agency's
debts. The documents suggest that the agency may have
indiscriminately bought questionable or even fraudulent loans to
favor well-known entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also reluctant to hand taxpayers debts to pay down
over 30 years that would cut directly into federal social spending.
Outlays for social spending have dropped 40 percent since 1994,
according to a Congressional study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to accept the government's never-ending
efforts to distribute losses among the Mexican people and
concentrate profits and opportunities among a few of its friends,''
said Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, a deputy from the Party of the
Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Gurria hit lawmakers with the $62 billion
takeover figure with no prior negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress retaliated by ordering exhaustive audits of the
bailout agency. Despite warnings from finance officials that delays
could undermine investor confidence, the lawmakers delayed action
on the government proposals until after the audits have been
completed, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators have also summoned many current and former
officials who were thought to have been untouchable to testify at
hearings, including former Finance Minister Pedro Aspe.
</P>
<P>
   Among government officials, Ortiz is the most politically
vulnerable. Before becoming finance minister in late 1994, he was
chairman of the committee that sold state-owned banks to private
bankers, including the one that Rodriguez bought.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have called for Ortiz's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   PRI deputies stormed out of meetings last week in a failed
effort to prevent the opposition from forcing Ortiz to testify. But
Ortiz pointed out that not even President Ernesto Zedillo can
remove him from the bank, which has recently been fortified with
new autonomous powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever accused me of any inappropriate transaction,
of favoring political interests or even of doing political
favors,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, whose nickname The Divine comes from a family
restaurant with that name, has become the government's worst
political nightmare. He was arrested in 1996 in Spain while sunning
on his yacht in the Mediterranean. After a two-year legal battle,
Mexico succeeded in extraditing him.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as he returned on 1 June, Mexico's lenient financial
fraud laws allowed him to post bail. Because of outdated bankruptcy
laws, his personal wealth remains untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez acknowledged in an interview that he owed $120 million
to his former bank and others. The loans are languishing in the
bailout fund.
</P>
<P>
   He protested that the officials were exaggerating his
malfeasance. ``The government is trying to make me into a legend,''
Rodriguez said, ``to make it appear that I am a major cause of all
the troubles of the bank bailout.''

<P>
   Despite signs that economic growth is slowing sharply, wages and
benefits are climbing a bit faster than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's employment cost index _ a broad gauge of
compensation trends closely watched by the Federal Reserve
chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other policy-makers _ rose
nine-tenths of 1 percent this spring, slightly more than the
seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in the winter. For the 12 months
ended in June, pay for all civilian workers, including government
workers, rose 3.5 percent, up from 2.8 percent in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup in labor costs reflects one of the tightest peacetime
labor markets in memory. Even as the Asian crisis, the recently
settled General Motors strike and a lull in inventory additions
have combined to drag down growth in recent months, unemployment is
well below 5 percent, as it has been for a year, hiring plans have
remained robust and thousands of jobs in industries from high
technology to hotels have gone begging.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration in wage inflation is of the creeping, rather
than galloping, variety: Pay and benefits are rising just one
percentage point faster than at the low-point for such cost
increases nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the latest reading is not likely to provoke Greenspan,
who only a week ago reiterated how closely he watches the index, to
raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't moved into new territory,'' said Nicholas Perna,
chief economist at Fleet Financial Group in Boston. ``This report
reduces the odds that the Fed will tighten.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since unemployment first slipped below the level that most
economists regard as consistent with steady inflation, the Federal
Reserve has been on the lookout for any hint that wage pressures
are getting out of hand. But now that the economy seems to be
slowing on its own, the modest pickup in pay may well show up in
slimmer profit margins rather than in higher prices for consumers.
Investors, in any case, seemed to take that view. Bond prices rose
after the report's release, and the stock market closed higher
ahead of Thursday's much anticipated report on economic growth for
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are getting a better deal than the raw numbers imply.
Thanks to a minuscule 1.6 percent rise in the cost of living over
the last year, relatively restrained nominal pay increases are
being translated into relatively robust real gains. Real pay is up
nearly 2 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the employment cost index, though widely regarded
as the broadest and most reliable gauge of employers' labor costs,
may understate just how well workers are doing. It does not include
one-time payments like signing bonuses and bounties, which
businesses are increasingly relying on to fill vacancies without
raising their entire pay structure. It also does not take account
of another widespread phenomenon: promotions that are given purely
to raise a worker's pay or promotions that workers give themselves
by switching to better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that these factors may add up is that another
Department of Labor measure, compensation per hour, has risen about
a percentage point more in the last year than the employment cost
index. ``We're seeing some dramatic wage inflation'' in some job
categories, says Maury Hanigan, a human resources consultant in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Wages and salaries grew nine-tenths of 1 percent, not much more
than the eight-tenths of 1 percent growth in the winter. But
benefit costs jumped sharply to eight-tenths of 1 percent, twice as
fast as they had risen in the previous quarter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of the pickup in benefit costs is probably temporary; it
reflects commissions and bonuses being paid on Wall Street and
elsewhere in the financial industry, where compensation has risen
by 7 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But at least half of the benefits, including Social Security
payments and vacation pay, are tied directly to wages. And
one-fifth consist of health benefits, which are once again marching
higher. ``Health insurance costs are picking up for the first time
in three and a half years,'' said Wayne Shelly, an economist at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issued the report.
</P>
<P>
   Wage pressures may not fade. Some of the forces holding down
living costs are clearly temporary. As Asia struggles back, oil
prices are apt to firm. And the strong dollar, which has made many
imports a bargain, could weaken.
</P>
<P>
   More important, even if the economy settles down to a growth
rate of 2 percent or 2.5 percent over the next year or so _ as
Greenspan and other forecasters expect _ it will not be slow enough
to loosen up the labor market much. ``The unemployment rate stays
exactly where it is,'' Perna predicted. ``The overall degree of
tightness stays exactly where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other reports made public Thursday suggest that this is the
case right now. The Conference Board reported that its help-wanted
advertising index rose to 91 in June from 90 in May and 88 a year
ago. And new claims for unemployment insurance dropped to 304,000
last week from 317,000 the week before, the Labor Department said.
That's the lowest level since the beginning of April.

 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug widely available in Europe that may reduce the urge to
drink is being tested in the United States, which has an estimated
13.7 million alcoholics. Its French maker hopes to have it on the
U.S. market in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts on dependency say the drug _ acamprosate, which
would be sold in the United States as Campral _ is badly needed.
Only two other medications can treat alcoholism, and both can have
unpleasant or potentially dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say they can prescribe acamprosate to help alcoholics
remain sober, possibly saving thousands of people from painful
relapses while reducing the cost of rehabilitation, which was $5
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Acamprosate's expected arrival, though, has ignited a
controversy in the health-care community, pitting specialists who
argue that alcoholics should be treated with counseling alone
against doctors who insist that drugs are crucial tools.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has become rousing at times, with acamprosate's
champions deriding opponents for their ``medieval'' outlook.
Advocates of drug-free treatments say their approach has worked for
decades; why take chances?
</P>
<P>
   Acamprosate's maker, Lipha SA, a subsidiary of the German drug
maker Merck KGaA, is undeterred. It plans to take on a U.S.
marketing partner and stress acamprosate's success rate.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 clinical trials with 3,338 alcohol-dependent patients in
Europe, 50 percent of those patients using acamprosate abstained
for three months _ the period when alcoholics are most likely to
regress _ compared with 39 percent of those using a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. trial, with 600 alcohol-dependent patients at 21 sites
nationwide, should be completed early next year. Lipha officials
are so excited about acamprosate's benefits that they hope it will
eventually be available over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acamprosate has been shown to help prevent relapse,'' said Dr.
Karl Mann, a professor of medicine at the University of Tubingen,
who conducted the trial in Germany. ``Once patients give up alcohol
and go on with their lives, they see it, smell it, dream about it.
Acamprosate helps them get through all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors hope acamprosate will become popular because it is cheap
and simple to take. In France, the average cost is $1.94 a pill,
about the same as a red wine at the local bistro. Patients take two
500-milligram pills in the morning and two more at night; the main
side effect is mild diarrhea, which usually goes away after several
days.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, American Home Products' Antabuse, introduced in
1951, can be toxic if the patient drinks enough alcohol, while
naltrexone, made by DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical, can cause liver
damage if prescribed in too high a dose.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is no substitute for detoxification. A patient's
alcoholism must be treated before it can do any good. But moderate
drinkers might also turn to it to try to control their drinking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   For some patients, acamprosate has worked well. Diagnosed with
breast cancer in 1981, Gudrum Hellinger, a 57-year-old school
secretary who lives near Munich, Germany, began sipping wine and
Champagne to cheer her mood. Ms. Hellinger gradually became a heavy
drinker and tried repeatedly to quit, always failing within about
two months. In 1995, she became suicidal and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took acamprosate for six months,'' Ms. Hellinger said.
``I've been sober for three years. I just didn't want a drink
anymore when I was on acamprosate. I don't think I could have given
up drinking without it. But you need more than the drug to do it.
I'm still in counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors, however, noting that only two other medications
for alcoholism have been introduced here since 1951, have renewed
their criticism of the pharmaceutical industry for not developing
more drugs to help addicts through withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The captains of large drug companies won't spend money on
medications to treat alcoholism, doctors say, because addicts
frequently do not take their drugs. Other patients simply make
better customers. As evidence, doctors note that while only 1.8
million American men were treated for erectile dysfunction last
year, according to IMS Health, an industry consultant, six new
treatments are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as many Americans were treated for alcoholism last year _
1.4 million, according to addiction experts _ but only two drugs,
including acamprosate, were being developed to aid withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies ``wouldn't get their money back from these
drugs,'' said Dr. Herbert Kleber, medical director of the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   For acamprosate's advocates, the strangest twist in the
controversy is that the debate exists at all. Alcoholism, after
all, is a devastating illness, one that tears families apart, ruins
careers and kills tens of thousands of people a year. A study by
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that
alcoholism and its treatment cost U.S. businesses $67.7 billion in
lost productivity in 1992, the latest statistics available.
Treatment is not cheap, either: a two-week stay in a clinic can
easily cost $450 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen percent of the U.S. population will be dependent on
alcohol at one time in their lives,'' said Barbara Mason, director
of the Division of Substance Abuse at the University of Miami
School of Medicine and the principal investigator of the nation's
clinical trials on acamprosate.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts call the synthetic drug a therapeutic breakthrough.
Invented by Lipha in 1980, acamprosate, also known as calcium
acetylhomotaurine, is thought to work by restoring normal activity
on certain neurotransmitters in the brain that become overexcited
by the withdrawal of alcohol. This hyperactivity can last a year,
experts say, leaving the alcoholic prone to relapse.
</P>
<P>
   But in the European studies, the drug remained somewhat
effective over time. The percentage of patients who took
acamprosate and abstained from drinking fell to 35 percent after
six months and 33 percent after a year. The number of people who
took placebos yet still stayed off alcohol declined to 23 percent
after six months and 21 percent after a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the higher success rate for those taking the drug is
encouraging. Lipha officials are confident that acamprosate will be
profitable in the United States despite a limited market. Sales of
alcohol withdrawal drugs in the United States totaled a modest $21
million last year, according to IMS Health, largely because of the
side effects of available drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big potential market,'' said Dr. Sylvie Chabac,
international strategic product manager for Lipha.
</P>
<P>
   For some researchers, acamprosate is more than just a promising
treatment _ it is an important new weapon in the arsenal against a
double addiction of alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, research has shown a strong link between heavy
smoking and drinking. An 11-year study by the Mayo Clinic showed
that those with a dual addiction were far more likely to die from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leading cause of death among alcoholics who smoke is lung
cancer,'' said Dr. David Lewis, director of the Center for Alcohol
and Addiction Studies at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Even with acamprosate's benefits, no one is passing it off as a
magic bullet. Experts insist that patients should also undergo
counseling and maintain it long after they are sober. Critics also
note that the drug is of no use in detoxification and that it has
never been proved to reduce a craving for alcohol, even though
patients repeatedly contend that it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a stigma that alcoholism is a moral weakness,''
said Dr. Richard Fuller, director of clinical and prevention
research at the alcoholism institute. ``I find it very distressing.
Alcoholism has a biological basis like hypertension. We treat that
with medications. Why can't you treat alcoholism the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   That argument, however, does not sit well with some clinicians.
``Alcoholics should not be given drugs, unless it is to treat an
organic illness like diabetes,'' said Dr. Joseph Pursch, who is
best known for treating Betty Ford and Billy Carter for alcoholism.
``All these drugs _ Xanax, Valium _ that doctors prescribe for
alcoholics can be addicting. What good is it to switch dependence
from one drug to another?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an import from France may be alcoholics' best hope for a
new medication. A 1995 report by the Institute of Medicine found
that U.S. drug and biotech companies avoided developing drugs for
addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasons: Many doctors would probably refuse to prescribe
them, many patients would probably decline to take them and
insurers might balk at reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry denies that it has neglected drugs for
addictions, noting that 19 such medications are under development,
including one for alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kleber, an author of the Institute of Medicine report, said
he was frustrated by the industry's inertia. ``I'm just glad we may
get acamprosate,'' he said. ``God knows we have a gazillion
antidepressants. Now at least we'll have more than one drug to
treat alcoholism.''

CLINTON, GORE STRESS ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD IN NORTH CAROLINA
CEREMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHE COUNTY, N.C. _ Seeking to polish the administration's
environmental credentials, President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore traveled to the bucolic southwest corner of this state to
confer special status on one of the oldest rivers in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony on the banks of the New River, Clinton designated
the waterway one of 14 American Heritage Rivers, which will make it
easier for local officials to receive federal help for
environmental cleanup and preservation of cultural landmarks along
its path.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ancient river has flowed through the heart of this land
for millions of years,'' Clinton told the crowd that endured humid
heat and a brief rain to catch a glimpse of the present.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Gore unveiled the list of 14 rivers that won
the national competition for the special designation. The rivers
include the Rio Grande in Texas, the Potomac in Washington, D.C.,
and the Hudson in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The New River, which flows northward from North Carolina,
through Virginia to West Virginia, is estimated to be about 320
million years old. In the 1960s, residents of this largely rural
mountainous region successfully fought a plan to build a dam across
the river, a victory that was alluded to several times during the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Clinton tried to stress that their environmental agenda
has not come at the cost of jobs, a criticism often leveled at
environmentalists by conservatives. Gore noted that river
renaissances across the country have served as a ``catapult to
create jobs.'' And Clinton said that the American Heritage River
program did not include federal mandates or restrictions on
property holders' rights.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton praised bipartisan support for the river program,
he chided the Republican leadership in Congress for blocking his
other environmental initiatives, including clean water funding and
money for land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks in Congress are no longer committed to bipartisan
progress,'' he said, adding ``they want to put off for another
day'' work on environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton flew to Raleigh to attend a
fund-raiser and rally for John Edwards, the Democratic Senate
candidate who is opposing incumbent Republican Sen. Lauch
Faircloth. The fund-raiser cost $5,000 a couple.
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat ceremony next to the serene river stood in stark
contrast to the turbulent politics of Washington where Clinton is
facing increasing pressure from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,
who this week granted immunity to Monica Lewinsky to tell about her
alleged affair with the president. Clinton also has agreed to
provide videotaped testimony to Starr's grand jury to avoid being
subpoenaed by the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But those interviewed in the supportive crowd did not appear
terribly concerned about the recent developments, with several
saying they didn't care about the president's private life and
others speculating that Lewinsky had ulterior motives for making
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's just in it for the fame and money,'' said Betty
Lou Houck, 50, of Ashe County, who was waiting for the president to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica is out for Monica. We got other things to worry about
without this dirt,'' said Amy Craig, a 42-year old single mother
who said she wanted to tell the president how she got off welfare
and escaped an abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Craig said she hoped that Clinton was telling the
truth when he vowed that he never had an affair with the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Winebarger said she didn't condone the president's conduct
if he did have the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he should have done it. After all he is a public
figure,'' said the 37-year old nursing home worker. But Winebarger
said, ``It's between him, Hillary and God.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Vicky Glenn, 32, said she didn't care about the
president's private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as long as he takes care of the world's business,'' the
factory worker said. Glenn also admitted she hasn't been following
the scandal story and said she didn't know who independent counsel
Starr is.

SITCOMS-TVCOLUMN (Pasadena, Calif.) - The legacy of Seinfeld is the
pursuit of nothingness. Accordingly, a comedy sameness has come
over the big networks, and grown-up comedy makers have begun to
turn elsewhere for distribution. In the next few weeks, two cable
nets not known for original comedies will debut four of them.
Showtime goes first, with ``Linc's`` and ``Rude Awakening`` on
Saturday. Lifetime rolls out ``Maggie`` and ``Oh, Baby`` on Aug.
18. ``You know what I think is `cutting edge' right now?''

LOLITA-TVCOLUMN (Pasadena, Calif.) - Cable television has also

``Lolita.'' Made as a feature film two years ago, it failed to find

AVENGERS (Undated) - By March 1966, the Beatles had forever changed
pop music and hair styles. Mini-skirts and knee-high boots were the

``The Avengers,`` an unlikely British import that quickly developed
a loyal audience and is today a cult passion. With the big-screen,

   PIQUA, Ohio _ For the elderly and disabled people of this weary
looking city surrounded by cornfields, Anthem Blue Cross &AMP; Blue
Shield's Medicare health maintenance organization was a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   It bought a motorized scooter for Ronnie Hines, who has diabetes
and multiple sclerosis. It diagnosed Dorothy Kloecker's shallow
breathing disorder, after many tests, and helped her to control it
with daily two-hour walks through the hilly cemetery. It removed
the benign but disconcerting lump in Rosie Stelzner's jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem provided exactly the kind of aggressive
prevention-oriented care that Congress and other health planners
envisioned when they opened up the 33-year-old Medicare program to
HMOs and other forms of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not last long. In late May, just a year and a half
after it started its Medicare HMO here, Anthem announced that it
was discontinuing the service as of Dec. 31 in 19 Ohio counties and
parts of three others. The decision affected 18,235 elderly
clients, including many in Piqua (pronounced pick-wah and less
often pick-way).
</P>
<P>
   Becky Howe, 50, who has a degenerative joint disease, expressed
the view of many of the elderly subscribers when she said:``They
gave us life. Now they're trying to suck that life out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two subscribers have filed a class-action suit in an effort to
stop Anthem from pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem officials said their company, which has successfully
operated a Medicare HMO around Cincinnati, about 75 miles south,
for three years, found itself over-extended, over-subscribed and
under-paid by the federal government when it expanded. Its
experience highlights the difficulties managed care companies face
as they try to extend service to Medicare clients outside the
bigger cities _ and the upheaval that results when these companies
stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem's retreat, like those of other HMOs recently from 10
counties in California, 10 in South Carolina and the whole state of
Utah, also casts a shadow over the decision by Congress and the
Clinton administration, as part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, to
steer more of the nation's retirees into managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to slow the 10 percent annual increases in federal
spending for Medicare and the even sharper increases some expect as
the baby-boom generation retires. Encouraging competition among
managed care companies for Medicare beneficiaries, they reasoned,
would mean more benefits for the elderly and lower costs for the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, managed care for the elderly and disabled is
going, not coming, and in the process it is doing exactly what many
critics feared: Building expectations among the elderly, then
dashing them, leaving the subscribers angry and confused.
</P>
<P>
   Until just a few months ago, three commercial television
channels carried commercials for Anthem Senior Advantage, the
Medicare HMO. The benefits over traditional Medicare were clear:
Prescriptions would cost just $5 to $15; doctor visits $5; there
would be no deductibles, no premiums and no charges at all for
hospitalization, and there would be free screenings and free
preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, by contrast, charges patients 20 percent of doctors'
bills and $760 of their initial hospital expenses. It does not
cover preventive care or most medicine or screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the number,'' said Mrs. Kloecker, 77, and signed up
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kloecker told Mrs. Stelzner, 73, who also called. ``I asked
them, `Is my doctor in this?''' Mrs. Stelzner said. Assured that he
was, she signed up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the television commercials, Anthem sent a sales agent
around. He knocked on Dolly Floss' door. Mrs. Floss, 58, is
diabetic and has been disabled and unemployable since a patient she
was treating as a nurse's aide fell on her back and shattered four
disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If you think this is too good to be true, wait till
you see the other things coming along,''' she said. `` `Eyeglasses,
hearing aides, dental.' I could get my testing strips. I'm supposed
to test my blood sugar eight times a day.'' The strips cost $48 for
a box of 50, so she had been testing just four or five times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Then the cancellation notice arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Hirsch, 69, who lives in a 25-year-old mobile home on a
Social Security check of $906 a month after losing two husbands to
death, said: ``I called Anthem. I was very upset. They said,
`Nothing is guaranteed.' I had great faith in Blue Cross &AMP; Blue
Shield. But that went down the drain. They had never done anything
as underhanded as this.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are just as peeved. Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a
Republican candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. John
Glenn, a Democrat, has publicly rebuked the company and ordered an
investigation. The state Legislature sharply questioned Anthem
officials at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told people, `As long as Medicare is around, we're going
to be around,' '' said state Rep. David Hobson, a Republican whose
distract includes four counties that have lost Anthem's Medicare
HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Keller, spokeswoman for the Ohio office of the American
Association of Retired Persons in Columbus, noted that managed care
had been widely proclaimed as the salvation of the Medicare
program, and argued that the Anthem experience should trouble
Congress on two counts.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it erode the elderly's confidence in managed care,
Ms. Keller said, but it can also disrupt their treatment, pushing
them back into traditional fee-for-service medicine without the
preventative care that many HMOs promise.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18,235 subscribers affected, 6,500 live in Miami County,
which includes Piqua, and five other counties where they are left
with no HMO at all. Many of Anthem's HMO subscribers have incomes
of $10,000 or $15,000 a year, mostly from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Piqua's retirees had Medigap insurance to cover the 20
percent of doctors' fees that Medicare does not, and they gave it
up. Mrs. Stelzner expects to get hers back, at a cost of $238.60
every two months. But that will not be possible for everyone
affected, and some others whose whose health has deteriorated might
have to pay more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the elderly accuse Anthem of discrimination. They point
out that the company has offered the Senior Advantage program in
Dayton, a half-hour away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're redlining,'' said Bruce Knisley, whose wife is
confined to their home by multiple sclerosis. ``It's like being
told you can't have a mortgage because of your age and where you
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthem, with headquarters in a new granite and glass suburban
office building just north of Cincinnati, acknowledges excesses in
trying to enroll Medicare recipients, in part to capture them
before competitors did.
</P>
<P>
   Having offered its Senior Advantage program successfully in
seven counties in and around Cincinnati for three years, Anthem
began expanding to 37 more counties at the start of last year. By
the end of the year, enrollment had leaped to 56,000 from 16,000,
and it is now up to 63,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what hit us, we were growing so fast,'' said
Lynne Gross, Anthem's vice president for government programs. ``We
didn't predict the high sales in rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The more beneficiaries Anthem enrolled, the more money it lost,
in part because of the Balanced Budget Act, which restrains
spending for Medicare. In an analysis of last year's results, Ms.
Gross said the company discovered that in urban areas it collected
an average of $389 a month in Medicare reimbursements for each
subscriber and spent $345, for a profit of $44. But in rural areas,
it collected $325 and spent $361, losing $36, with the lower
reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem also discovered that conventional Medicare, with its
traditional fee-for-service copayments and deductibles, was a
luxury that relatively poor retirees in places like Miami County
often shunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people saying for the first time, `I'm beginning to
live!''' Ms. Gross said. ``Fee-for-service wasn't meeting the needs
of these folks. I think managed care in rural communities may have
created a demand for care where there wasn't any care before.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pradip Vyas, an internist and primary care physician for
many of Anthem's Miami County subscribers, said the company
improved their health. Now Vyas asks: ``How will I convince my
patients to continue preventive medicine? They will have to pay out
of pocket, and many do not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there are cautionary lessons in Ohio for federal
health planners. Congress' new Medicare program greatly expands
upon more than a decade of efforts to encourage the 33.5 million
elderly and 5 million disabled beneficiaries to enroll in managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   Called Medicare Plus Choice, the new program still allows people
to choose regular Medicare. But it also lets them choose among a
variety of alternatives, primarily several forms of managed care
plans.
</P>
<P>
   For each subscriber, the Health Care Financing Administration
pays HMOs 95 percent of the average that the agency spends each
year for people who use Medicare's fee-for-service care.
</P>
<P>
   The base rates vary widely by county, from less than $400 a
month in rural areas to almost $800 in New York City. To make the
lower-rate areas more appealing to HMOs, Congress set up a formula
to shrink the variations, but so far it has not enhanced the
economic appeal of rural areas for HMOs. In addition, Congress
limited increases in most reimbursement rates to just 2 percent _
less than the rise in health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   So now, with their reimbursements squeezed, more HMOs are
charging subscribers premiums and reducing free benefits, and in
rural areas, they have begun closing their doors. Others are
scaling back plans to move into the areas..
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, ``that Anthem
made some monumental mistakes and over-promised what they could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeWine added: ``It would not shock me if Anthem is just the
beginning of this. The preliminary evidence would indicate that
there is a bigger issue than Anthem making bad business
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, DeWine said, ``one of the goals has been more
choice for Medicare recipients. That's one thing my constituents
tell me they want, and that's been a legitimate object of what we
should strive for. Choice is vitally important.''
</P>
<P>
   It was vitally important to Dolly Floss, who with Anthem's
departure is losing her free testing strips. ``I don't have a
choice,'' she said.

<P>
   When: Tonight at 7:40 p.m., Saturday at 1:15 p.m., Sunday at
1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South will telecast tonight, WAGA will
telecast Saturday, and TBS Sunday. 750-AM will broadcast all three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP Greg Maddux (14-4,
1.59; 17-13, 2.40 lifetime vs. Cardinals) vs. RHP Todd Stottlemyre
(9-9, 3.51; 0-0, 3.00 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday, LHP Tom
Glavine (14-4, 2.68; 11-4, 3.85 lifetime vs. Cardinals) vs. LHP
Kent Mercker (6-8, 5.94; 0-2, 6.35). Sunday, RHP Kevin Millwood
(11-6, 4.39; 0-0, 5.06 lifetime vs. Cardinals) vs. RHP Kent
Bottenfield (3-5, 4.73; 1-1, 2.25).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: Atlanta trails the all-time series 181-218 but
has lost just one season series to the Cardinals since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves swept a two-game series at St. Louis
on May 13-14, setting the league record for consecutive games with
home runs at 25 the first night and scoring seven times in the
eighth inning the second night in a 7-3 victory. John Rocker got
his first major-league victory.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Cardinals are 9-11 since the All-Star break,
entering Thursday night's game with Milwaukee. Although St. Louis
is sixth in the league in runs scored (4.9 per game), the club has
been undone by pitching troubles all season. Injuries to Alan
Benes, Matt Morris and Donovan Osborne made a shambles of the
rotation from Opening Day, and the team has tried 13 starters along
the way. The bullpen's ERA (4.78) is the third-highest in the
league, and Cardinals' relievers have been forced into the NL's
heaviest workload (363.1 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: Ray Lankford is hitting .351 since the All-Star
break. John Mabry has had two-hit games in four of his last eight
starts. Rookie reliever Rick Croushore has converted seven-of-eight
save chances, with 37 strikeouts in 37 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: Tom Pagnozzi is 4-for-21 (.190) since the break.
Willie McGee is hitting .242 on the road. Reliever John Frascatore,
who leads the team in appearances, has a 4.41 ERA with 70 hits and
28 walks allowed in 69 1/3 innings.

 &HT;    Against the Hall
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wanted to know how its Hall of
Fame rotation _ Tom Seaver, Ferguson Jenkins, Gaylord Perry and
Warren Spahn _ would match up against Mark McGwire on a computer.
So Diamond Mind Software (www.diamond-mind.com), which correctly
predicted the outcome of every game in the big series between the
Braves and Yankees in June, was called on once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' everyday lineup, with McGwire hitting third,
faced each of the Hall of Fame pitchers, with Rollie Fingers coming
on in relief. The computer company used numbers from the pitchers'
best seasons: 1981 for Fingers, 1974 for Jenkins, 1972 for Perry,
1969 for Seaver and 1953 for Spahn. The results were not good for
Big Mac. He went 2-for-16 with one home run and four strikeouts
against the Hall of Famers. He was 0-for-4 against Jenkins with one
strikeout; 1-for-4 against Perry with a double and run scored;
0-for-3 against Seaver with two strikeouts; and 1-for-4 against
Spahn with a homer and strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   He faced Fingers once, hitting into a double play.

 &HT;    How to retire McGWIRE
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Perhaps the pitchers of today should take a hint from
an old master when it comes to pitching to Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would try to keep McGwire in the park, 314-game
winner Gaylord Perry smiled _ and licked his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Perry's infamous spitball is the ticket; nothing seems to
be working for today's pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has 45 home runs in 105 games, hitting one home run
every 7.3 at-bats. He has walked 110 times, once every four plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   His homers have gone an estimated total of 18,884 feet, or 3.58
miles. And it's not even August yet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when the Braves and Cardinals begin a three-game series
at Turner Field, McGwire will hit against arguably the best
pitching staff in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the perfect swing right now,'' San Diego pitching coach
Merv Rettenmond said. ``He sees the ball better now than he used
to, and he's much stronger. He's matured as a person, and he's had
the desire to get better as a player. He's the ultimate power
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pitchers have had success, none more than Toronto's Roger
Clemens, who used to feed the 6-foot-5, 250-pound McGwire a steady
diet of fastballs inside on his hands. Clemens felt that McGwire's
biceps and quadriceps were so big that he wouldn't be able to get
his bat around quickly enough to hit a hard inside pitch. Perhaps
he was right; the result was four hits (two of them home runs) in
47 at-bats against Clemens, a future member of the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The game's other top pitching staffs have not been so fortunate.
In short, they have been pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one dream staff McGwire has not faced. And will not
face. Call it The Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff. The starters
are overpowering right-handers Tom Seaver and Ferguson Jenkins;
Perry, the spitball pitcher; and crafty left-hander Warren Spahn.
Rollie Fingers is the relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   This Hall of Fame rotation won 1,272 games, struck out 12,949
batters, won seven Cy Youngs and threw four no-hitters. Fingers had
341 saves and was the first reliever to win a Cy Young Award and
the Most Valuable Player in the same year (1981).
</P>
<P>
   Batter up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has weaknesses; I don't care who you are,'' Seaver
said. ``Obviously, (if) you put something in on his hands, it's
going to be tough on him. But I can see that it can be difficult to
throw to him inside. He is so big that he makes the strike zone
look much smaller when you are standing on the mound. Plus, if you
make a mistake and leave that ball out over the plate, he is so
quick (that) he is going to hit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people are afraid to pitch him inside,'' Seaver said.
``I would keep going inside on him and not worry if I walked him. I
think I could get him out, because he is right-handed. I always had
a lot of success against hitters like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appears McGwire has made adjustments and is doing a
better job of hitting pitches on his hands. His swing has become
more compact.
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Brad Ausmus thought his pitchers could attack
McGwire on the hands. Left-hander Pete Schourek tried. McGwire hit
one pitch into the third deck in the Astrodome but just foul.
Ausmus called for the same pitch again later in the series. McGwire
homered to left off Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   So Jenkins said he would use a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would go with a hard slider away,'' Jenkins said.
``I would make him reach out well over the plate, which should take
away some of his power. But I wouldn't walk him. I never walked
guys like that when I played. I always tried to challenge them, see
if I could get them out. I don't know if pitchers today challenge
like they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jenkins pitched there were plenty of power hitters,
including Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Harmon Killebrew. But he says
McGwire reminds him of 6-foot-6, 210-pound Dave Kingman, an earlier
intimidating figure in the batter's box. Jenkins said there's one
big difference: ``Mark is a much more selective hitter than Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave was scary-looking in that box, and I imagine so is
Mark,'' Jenkins said. ``But Dave struck out (1,816 times, fifth
all-time). Look at the number of walks Mark has. That's pretty
impressive. So you really can't get him to go looking for a bad
pitch. You're going to have to give him something in the strike
zone if you're not going to walk him. I like something hard on the
outside corner.''
</P>
<P>
   It would need to be close on the corner. McGwire is a
disciplined hitter. But as the chase gets down to cases, pitchers
will begin nibbling at the corners in an effort to turn off the
power.
</P>
<P>
   Spahn was one of the best at nibbling. He had an excellent
curveball and pitched on the corners, much as Greg Maddux does
today. Spahn would prefer to keep McGwire off-balance, by mixing up
his pitches, a strategy often used on big sluggers by working the
ball inside and outside. ``I'd pitch him inside, but I'd also throw
something down and away.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry agreed. ``You can't get in a pattern against a hitter like
that,'' he said. ``I really think he likes fastballs up and in. I
would probably throw a slider down and away.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perry also would use another strategy: ``I would work awful
hard on trying to get out the other players around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fingers said he would use one pitch for McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would throw him a slider outside,'' he said. ``That's the
hardest pitch in the world to hit. If you don't get him to hit your
pitch, then you walk him and shouldn't be embarrassed about it.
Make guys like that hit your pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   So different pitchers have different answers. Hard and inside.
Down and away. A slider outside. Nibble the corners.
</P>
<P>
   The one constant is respect. McGwire, 34, has 432 homers in his
career and is the second-fastest to reach 400. Depending on how
many more he hits this year, if he averages about 42 homers during
the next five years, he will pass Mays (660) and finish behind only
Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714).
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Perry is right. Maybe finding a way to doctor the
ball is the only way to get McGwire out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's so good,'' Perry said, ``he would probably hit that,
too.''

 &HT;    Rose's advice: Enjoy the ride
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Pete Rose has chased all kinds of baseball records.
</P>
<P>
   So he knows exactly how Mark McGwire feels about all the
attention from the media, fans and company representatives with
endorsement possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have fun with it,'' Rose advised last week during an interview
in Cooperstown, N.Y., where he was signing autographs during the
Hall of Fame weekend. ``He has to be having fun hitting all those
home runs with his little kid standing there as a bat boy. And
that's what I like about McGwire. Whenever they show him playing,
he is smiling. So, just have fun. It's got to be a blast what he is
going through. He is chasing a great record and has a good chance
of breaking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose also offered advice on how to deal with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fight them,'' Rose said. ``Deal with the media and don't
try to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was going through the (44-game) hitting streak and then
going after Ty Cobb's record, I used to have a press conference
before the game and after it. That way the rest of my teammates
weren't bothered, because the media knew where they could get me. I
liked talking to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is not as accessible, and at times he has become
impatient and terse with the media. The Cardinals have set limits
on his accessibility during the home run chase, holding a press
conference before the first game of a series. McGwire can be
interviewed after games, but he usually get upsets if he is asked
about his home runs, especially if the Cardinals lose.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about home run No. 45 after a 13-10 loss to Milwaukee
on Tuesday night, McGwire told the reporter, ``That's a stupid
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions will increase as McGwire approaches Roger Maris'
record of 61. When Rose was chasing Cobb's all-time hits record, he
became infatuated with Cobb. He spent hours reading about him. But
Rose points out that there was a difference between his pursuit of
Cobb and McGwire's pursuit of Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to eventually break that mark,'' Rose said.
``It was just a matter of time. Mark has only a certain amount of
games to hit 61.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose also has another suggestion for McGwire, one that might
help him when he steps on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just relax when you are not in the batter's box,'' Rose said.
``The only time you have to concentrate on the pitcher is when you
get in the batter's box. You don't have to concentrate on the
pitcher when you are in the dugout, the clubhouse, the on-deck
circle. You can't hit it then. So save your concentration.''

`DEEP STORAGE': COLLECTORS WHO SEEK THE INNATE ORDER OF CHAOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (Eds.: Exhibition notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The instinct to preserve, strong in most people, can
run especially deep in artists. Their desire to leave a record of
their beliefs, lives, times or inner states has been in effect at
least since the time of the Lascaux cave paintings, to the great
benefit of the world's cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, the artist's instinct to preserve has sometimes
crossed wires with a more institutional expression of that drive:
the museum or archive. The motivations have been many. Some artists
have been inspired by the museum's encyclopedic example or by a
desire to subvert and satirize its esthetic assumptions and vast
storehouses of art. Others have felt compelled to confront the
deluge of images, objects and events that press upon us all,
attempting to reveal their underlying order or chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of new recording tools, from the camera to the
computer, has played a role, as have the influences of recent art
movements. These include Minimalism's emphasis on serialism and
repetition; Conceptual Art's fascination with randomness, vast
systems outside art and pure fact, and performance art's inherent
dependence on documentation. In recent years, the artist as
collector, archivist, curator or documentarian has become a
familiar figure.
</P>
<P>
   Early precedents for the artist-as-archivist include the
projects of Eugene Atget and August Sander, who at the turn of the
century set out to photographically record, respectively, the city
of Paris and the German people, with extraordinary results.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the focus has been far narrower: Marcel Duchamp's
``Green Box,'' containing drawings, notes and reproductions,
documents and annotates the creation of his masterpiece ``The Large
Glass'' and is itself a work of art. Somewhere in between is Claes
Oldenburg's ``Mouse Museum,'' a collection of 385 small objects _
found, altered or made by the artist _ that comment on American
popular culture and consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   With Duchamp's ``Green Box'' among its jumping off points,
``Deep Storage: Collecting, Storing and Archiving in Art'' at the
PS 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City sets out to
document the urge to document in recent art. This exhibition of
more than 100 works by nearly 40 American and European artists is
terrific in spots and predictable in others. But it taps into an
important strain of contemporary art and confirms once again that
the most successful group exhibitions of the moment are based on
shared ideas, not visual styles.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the idea originated in an essay by the critic
Ingrid Shaffner and eventually expanded to involve five curators
and a thick, handsome catalog with essays by 15 writers. Sponsored
by the Siemens Cultural Program, it was first shown at the Haus der
Kunst in Munich last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moving between artists of different generations, sensibilities
and media, the show covers a lot of ground, sometimes sketchily, if
only because some monumental works, including Oldenburg's ``Mouse
Museum'' and Gerhard Richter's ``Atlas,'' which were included in
Munich, are not here.
</P>
<P>
   But particularly memorable is the opening gallery, on the
center's third floor, where the visitor is confronted by Jason
Rhoades' towering ``Great See Battles of Wilhelm Schurmann,'' a
compartmentalized structure that takes the boxed artwork to
monumental extremes. Part steamer trunk, part altar, part
collector's cabinet, it contains an elaborate installation work
that recapitulates the complex life of Schurmann, a well-known
German photography collector. To either side are the wryly memorial
paintings of David Deutsch, each depicting part of an enormous
basilicalike dome lined with indistinct portraits _ a pantheon of
patriarchal fuzziness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Arranged around the gallery are different expressions of the
collecting or storing impulse, which echo throughout the
exhibition. Douglas Blau's ``All of Tomorrow's Parties No. 2'' is a
moveable picture archive that features dozens of found images of
social gatherings, gleaned from stage, screen and art history.
Museum practices are variously sent up by H.C. Westermann's
``Second Shotgun,'' which comes with its own beautifully made
shipping-crate pedestal, and Louise Lawler's laconic photographs of
actual museum storerooms, where odd assortments of art objects
forlornly reflect vast holdings rarely exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   What might be called the bean-counter approach achieves grand
and pure heights in ``1,000,000 Years Past'' and ``1,000,000 Years
Future,'' by the well-known Conceptualist On Kawara. Each consists
of 10 thick, leather-bound volumes that count out a million years,
year by year. (Related but more elliptical are a series of poems by
David Bunn, each consisting of consecutive titles in the card
catalog of the Los Angeles Public Library.) Thomas Virnich's
``Weltkugel,'' a giant rough globe made from a mulch of maps and
atlases, is one of several works in which material and concept
collide in amusing ways.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes suspects both usual and not, and often
obscures the line between art and archive. Marcel Broodthaers and
Joseph Beuys are predictably present, as is an example of Edward
Ruscha's 1966 fold-out book, ``Every Building on the Sunset
Strip.''
</P>
<P>
   But the curators have also included the boxlike assemblages of
Hannelore Baron and five of the 106 ``Time Capsules'' that Andy
Warhol, an obsessive collector, assembled and preserved. The
contents of one capsule, including mail, magazine and exhibition
announcements, line the bottom of a large vitrine. Downstairs, a
little-known German artist, Karsten Bott, achieves an even more
obsessive effect with ``One of Each,'' a wall-to-wall display of
thousands of carefully ordered small objects that is viewed from a
raised walkway. This piece is but one selection in a 10-year
project titled ``Archive of Everyday History.''
</P>
<P>
   Another entry in the less-than-familiar column is Joseph
Cornell's ``Crystal Cage (Portrait of Bernice),'' a 20-year
accumulation of images that document the life of an imaginary
little girl. And one of the show's most fascinating surprises is a
small selection from ``Atlas of Memory,'' a display of art
reproductions, often rephotographed in thematic groupings, that
were amassed by the art historian Aby Warburg.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit chaos of Nam June Paik's ``Box for Zen
(Serenade),'' a jumble of objects in a suitcase, which figured in
the artist's early Fluxus performances, contrasts strikingly with
the handsome, strictly categorized photographs of the German
artists Bernd and Hilla Becher, who have spent more than three
decades documenting the massive industrial structures of 19th- and
20th-century Germany and America.
</P>
<P>
   In a downstairs gallery, the Bechers' project is poignantly yet
powerfully echoed in one of the show's high points: ``Detonation
Deutschland,'' a carefully orchestrated video installation by Piero
Steinle and Julian Rosenfeldt of Munich. In a darkened, mirrored
hall, seven screens periodically erupt with the sights and sounds
of old or bomb-damaged buildings being blown up during the
rebuilding of Germany after World War II. An archive in motion, the
work converts the march of progress into a bombardment of
mesmerizing beauty, inflected with violence, tragedy and human
folly.

CLINTON HAS ONE MORE CHANCE TO COME CLEAN  
 (THIS EDITORIAL IS APPEARING IN FRIDAY'S ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time and again, President Clinton has demonstrated he is an
accomplished performer before the camera. He has wriggled and
charmed his way out of any number of scrapes and embarrassing
messes. On Aug. 17, in what may be a defining moment of his
presidency, Clinton will have an opportunity to go before a camera
and tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the embattled president, flanked by his lawyers,
will submit to questioning by Independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
The interrogation will be videotaped in the White House for Starr's
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   With or without Clinton's full cooperation, Starr's six-month
investigation into allegations of perjury, witness tampering and
obstruction of justice stemming from charges of an affair between
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky will move, mercifully, close to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Congress would like to wash its hands of the whole
tawdry matter. Based on Starr's findings, members of the House must
decide whether to hold impeachment proceedings. Given enough
evidence, Congress has no choice but to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The public has had its fill of this sordid chapter, in between
being titillated and repulsed as each episode has been reported.
Clinton's charm and a booming economy have served as a buffer
against a concerted public outcry, but even his most ardent
supporters have grown weary and impatient with a man who seems
perfectly incapable of telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to allow Clinton to have lawyers present at the
videotaping, Starr provided an important concession. That is a
privilege, as we have pointed out, not enjoyed by other witnesses.
However, Clinton, and the nation, will be spared the embarrassing
spectacle of a president heading into a courthouse to testify in a
case in which he is the prime target.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clinton come clean and tell the truth in a few weeks? Given
his powers of persuasion, Clinton could go before the country
today, tomorrow, and confess to having a sexual relationship with
`that woman,'' and many would likely forgive and move on.
</P>
<P>
   But some speculate that Clinton will adhere to the strategy of
dissembling and denying an affair with Lewinsky. Of course, in
weighing his options, Clinton must deal with the testimony of
Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Secret Service agents, among others. And
then there is the dress. News reports have raised anew the
possbility of a dress stained from an encounter between Clinton and
Lewinsky. Such physical evidence would be impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has an opportunity, yet one more time, to be open with
the American public and tell the truth. Judging from an
increasingly weary public, that door is closing. &QL;

UNSER JR. HAS BITTERSWEET RETURN TO INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ His last hot laps around the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway earned Al Unser Jr. an embarrassing DNQ.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Did Not Qualify'' still haunts Little Al, who was the
reigning Indianapolis 500 champion when he failed to crack the
33-car starting lineup in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent split between the Indy Racing League and
Championship Auto Racing Teams has kept Unser and team owner Roger
Penske _ a couple of card-carrying CART loyalists _ out of Gasoline
Alley for three years. But Unser's exile at Indy is scheduled to
end today, in the finale of the True Value International Race of
Champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have mixed feelings. I'd be remiss if I said I didn't,''
said Unser, one of 12 drivers from various forms of motorsports
scheduled to run the 100-mile sprint in identically prepared
Pontiac Firebirds. The full-fendered IROC Firebirds making their
first racing appearances at the Speedway have nothing in common
with the rear-engined rockets Unser Jr. has been driving since
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely want to come back here and race in a
single-seat, open-wheeled car in the month of May,'' said Unser,
the Indy 500 champion in 1992 and 1994. ``But yes, it's going to
ease the pain a little bit. The main thing is it gives me an
opportunity to get back out there _ between those walls _ and
relive some of the moments that I've had there in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of four-time Indy 500 champion Al Unser and nephew of
three-time race-winner Bobby Unser, Little Al admittedly grew up
with the notion of racing at the Speedway as his birthright. His
first victory here in May 1992 produced the then-closest finish in
the race's history, 0.043-seconds in front of Scott Goodyear.
Victory No. 2 in May 1994 was one of eight races Unser won in 16
starts en route to his second CART PPG Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Even in defeat, Unser has been cast as a modern-day gladiator.
His late-race tangle and backward crash into the Turn 3 concrete
wall during the 1989 race led to Emerson Fittipaldi's first Indy
victory _ and a macho thumbs-up salute from Unser. After that race,
Unser announced that in case anybody had not figured it out,
winning the Indy 500 meant more to him than life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not racing at Indy really does play on Al's mind an awful lot
because of his family heritage,'' said Shelley Unser, Al's wife of
17 years. Shelley accompanied her husband to the Speedway during
Indy 500 qualifications in May, where they rooted for aspiring IRL
drivers Johnny and Robby Unser, Al's cousins.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Unser Jr., both made the big race. And he was
warmly received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what to expect with the crowd at an IRL race,''
Unser Jr. said. ``I didn't know if they would boo me or what. The
crowd showed me a lot of heart. They clapped. They said they missed
me. It almost brought a tear to my eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Unser said the impromptu show of support overwhelmed
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Elvis had come back to life,'' she said. ``I think
this \RIROC\S race is going to feel awkward for Al _ that this
isn't right. But it's a race car and he's a race car driver, so he
might just want to kick some butt on the NASCAR boys.''

BOSS PRIZE TO A SCOT  
 WORKS BY MAGRITTE'S FRIEND  
 MIRAGE'S WYNN BETTING ON ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Douglas Gordon, the 32-year-old film and video artist
from Glasgow, Scotland, who won the prestigious Turner Prize two
years ago, has captured another award. Wednesday night, the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum announced that Gordon was this year's winner
of the Hugo Boss Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year-old $50,000 prize is sponsored by the museum and
the men's wear company. It is given for significant contribution in
contemporary art, and artists of all nationalities are eligible. By
contrast, the $32,000 Turner Prize, awarded by the Tate Gallery in
London, is given to a contemporary British artist for a body of
work over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   An international jury of arts professionals chose Gordon from a
short list that included five others: William Kentridge, a South
African filmmaker; Lee Bul, a South Korean installation and
performance artist; Pipilotti Rist, a Swiss video artist; Lorna
Simpson, an American photographer and filmmaker, and Huang Yong
Ping, a Chinese installation artist. The work of all the finalists
is in a show at the Guggenheim's SoHo branch that runs until Sept.
20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury took into consideration that he'd won the Turner
Prize, but they didn't want to penalize him for it,'' said Nancy
Spector of the Guggenheim, who organized the show of the finalists'
work and who has been involved in the prize since its inception.
``Although I was not on this year's jury, I know they were looking
for someone with a promise for the future, and Douglas has an
amazing capacity and vision for invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon first gained public attention for his slow-motion version
of the Hitchcock film ``Psycho,'' which was shown at the Hayward
Gallery in London two years ago. The Boss Prize exhibition includes
his ``Hysterical'' (1995), a film installation made from an early
medical film that shows a masked woman being treated for a
psychiatric disorder by two doctors. The action is projected onto
two giant free-standing screens: at normal speed on one, slowed
down and reversed on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Douglas is someone working in the '90s whose relationship to
film is new and fresh,'' Ms. Spector said. ``Much of his work
centers on the idea of polar opposites: good and evil, sacred and
profane.''
</P>
<P>
   Magritte's Friend
</P>
<P>
   It's an auction house's dream to sell works of art from their
source, or at least as close to the source as possible. Christie's
in New York will be realizing that dream in November when it
auctions a group of 54 paintings and drawings from the collection
of Harry Torczyner, a Belgian-born writer, scholar and collector
who was Magritte's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, which is estimated to be worth about $15
million, was formed over 50 years. Twenty-five of the works are
paintings, drawings and gouaches by Magritte; also for sale is one
of his rare painted bottles. In addition, the collection includes
works by Francis Bacon, George Segal, Max Ernst, Christo and Paul
Klee.
</P>
<P>
   Torczyner, who died in March, was a friend and adviser to
Magritte. He commissioned works from the artist, wrote several
books and articles about him, arranged exhibitions of his work and
donated Magritte works to the Museum of Modern Art in New York and
the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Torczyner was also the subject of one of Magritte's most famous
portraits, ``Justice Has Been Done,'' from 1958. It shows the
lawyer in a toga with a hot-air balloon above his head. Just before
he died, Torczyner gave the painting to the Royal Museum of Fine
Arts of Belgium in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Magritte works to be sold are ``Personal Values,'' a
1952 painting considered iconic. It is a play on scale, showing an
oversized comb standing upright on a bed, a giant match lying on
the floor, a green wine goblet, an enormous pill and a
shaving-cream brush, all trapped in a bedroom with sky painted
walls. It is estimated to sell for $2 million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the auction is perhaps the most widely recognized
Magritte painting, ``Son of Man'' (1964), which shows a man in a
bowler hat with a green apple obscuring his face. It is expected to
fetch $2 million to $3 million. ``In every medium, he got the pick
and the best,'' said Franck Giraud, who runs Christie's 19th- and
20th-century departments. ``This collection has the largest and the
greatest selection of Magrittes in the world. Most of them are well
known because they have been extensively published and exhibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Bids on the work are expected, Giraud said, from museums in the
United States and abroad, and from the small but passionate group
of Magritte collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Betting on Art
</P>
<P>
   Mirage Resorts chairman Stephen Wynn has sought advice from top
experts since he began buying important Impressionist, modern and
contemporary art seriously two years ago, both for himself and for
Bellagio, his new resort that is scheduled to open in Las Vegas in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, William Acquavella, the Manhattan dealer, has
been his main adviser, representing Wynn at auctions. But though
Wynn said Acquavella will still be working with him, he has
recently hired Edmund P. Pillsbury, who resigned in January as
director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. Pillsbury
will be involved in the Bellagio Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a full art gallery with everything from an
Acoustiguide to a catalog,'' Wynn said in a recent telephone
interview. ``These days enthusiasm isn't enough. This is a very
serious, first-rate effort, and Ted knows exactly what he's talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to love art; it's another thing to know the
business and to anticipate public needs,'' Wynn added. ``Ted will
be involved in everything from making the space user-friendly to
ticketing to conservation. He will also help put together the
catalog, which will have essays by scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, spokesman for Mirage, said Pillsbury was traveling
abroad and could not be reached for comment. Wynn said that while
Pillsbury visits the Las Vegas resort regularly, he will still be
based in Fort Worth.

TRADE WINDS BLOW HOT, COLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trading away Wilson Alvarez and Sammy Sosa for Harold Baines in
July 1989 still haunts the Rangers. But the St. Louis Cardinals
rejoice at getting Mark McGwire last July for three minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason trades are a double-edged sword. Teams who think they
can win now often gamble by trading top minor-league prospects for
immediate help. Sometimes they win. Sometimes the past can haunt
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major-league team is still your No. 1 priority,'' Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``But you have to balance that
against the long-term interests of the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at some of the more significant midseason deals from the
past three years:
Rick Aguilera for Frankie Rodriguez July 6, 1995
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, 37-28, needed a reliever to reinforce their drive
to an American League Eastern Division title. The Twins thought
Rodriguez, a second-round pick in the 1990 draft, had the talent to
be a No. 1 starter. Aguilera saved 20 games and the Red Sox won the
division. Rodriguez, 25, has been a bust for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Boston
Cone for minor-leaguers July 28, 1995
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees strengthened their bid for the wild-card
playoff spot by acquiring David Cone from the Toronto Blue Jays for
minor-league pitchers Marty Janzen, Jason Jarvis and Mike Gordon.
Cone, who won the Cy Young Award in 1994, went 9-2 down the
stretch. The Blue Jays have received almost nothing from the three
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Yankees
Scott Erickson for Scott Klingenbeck July 7, 1995
</P>
<P>
   Klingenbeck was the Orioles' fifth pick in the 1992 draft, but
they traded him to the Twins for Scott Erickson. Erickson was 4-6
with a 5.95 earned-run average at the time of the trade but is
49-31 since then for the Orioles. Klingenbeck won one game for the
Twins before being given away to the Reds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Orioles
Bobby Bonilla for Alex Ochoa, Damon Buford July 28, 1995
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles insisted Ochoa, rated the eighth-best minor-league
prospect in baseball, was untouchable. But when they heard the
Yankees had acquired Cone, they traded him and Buford to the New
York Mets for Bonilla. Ochoa never fulfilled his promise and is a
part-timer now with the Twins. Buford is a defensive specialist.
Bonilla had a big year with Baltimore in 1996 before moving on to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Orioles
Ken Hill for minor-leaguers July 27, 1995
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, on their way to a 100-44 record, picked
up Hill from the St. Louis Cardinals, mainly as a fourth starter in
postseason, while giving up infielder David Bell, pitcher Rick
Heiserman and catcher Pepe McNeal. Hill won a big game in the AL
Championship Series before leaving as a free agent. The Cardinals
got almost nothing from the three minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Indians
Jim Abbott for minor-leaguers July 27, 1995
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, trying to hold on in the AL West, reacquired Abbott,
their former No. 1 draft pick, from the Chicago White Sox for
minor-league pitchers Bill Simas, Andrew Lorraine and John Snyder,
and outfielder McKay Christenson. Lorraine, another No. 1 pick, was
supposed to be the key to the deal but was a bust. Simas, however,
has been a serviceable reliever, and Snyder is getting a shot right
now in the White Sox rotation. The Angels didn't win in 1995 and
Abbott went 2-18 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: White Sox
Cecil Fielder for Sierra-Drews July 31, 1996
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees fortified their 1996 world championship team when
they acquired Fielder from the Detroit Tigers, who were willing to
accept Ruben Sierra's big contract to get minor-league pitcher Matt
Drews. Drews, a hard thrower, was the key to the deal but is
currently struggling at Triple A.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Yankees
Denny Neagle for Schmidt-Wright Aug. 28, 1996
</P>
<P>
   The Braves improved the best rotation in baseball when they
traded pitcher Jason Schmidt and first baseman Ron Wright to the
Pirates for Denny Neagle, a 20-game winner last year. Schmidt has
the talent to be a No. 1 starter, but Wright, once considered a
premier power prospect, struggles in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Braves
John Burkett for Helling-Dempster Aug. 8, 1996
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would have not won a division title in 1996 without
acquiring pitcher John Burkett from the Florida Marlins for
pitchers Rick Helling and Ryan Dempster. They even got Helling back
last year for Ed Vosberg. But Dempster still has a chance to be a
good major-league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Rangers
White Sox surrender July 31, 1997
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox ran up the white flag last year when they
traded pitchers Roberto Hernandez, Wilson Alvarez and Danny Darwin
to San Francisco for minor-league pitchers Keith Foulke, Lorenzo
Barcelo, Bobby Howry and Kev Vining, infielder Mike Caruso and
outfielder Brian Manning. The Giants got a division title out of
the deal; the White Sox were crucified. But the White Sox received
a front-line shortstop in Caruso while Foulke and Howry, a future
closer, are contributing in the bullpen. Alvarez and Hernandez left
as free agents after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Both did well
Jose Cruz for Spoljaric-Timlin July 31, 1997
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners traded Cruz to the Blue Jays for relievers Paul
Spoljaric and Mike Timlin. The two pitchers did little to help the
Mariners' bullpen. Cruz got off to a bad start with the Blue Jays
this year and is back in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: It all depends on Cruz. Mark McGwire for three
pitchers July 31, 1997
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris took a twist last year when
Oakland traded him to the Cardinals for pitchers T.J. Mathews, Eric
Ludwick and Blake Stein. McGwire has been a huge hit in St. Louis
but the Cardinals, through Tuesday, are 71-89 since the trade.
Mathews and Ludwick did little to help the Athletics. Stein could
develop into a front-line starter.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winner: Cardinals

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Congress have decided that, in
many cases, sanctions just are not an effective way to make foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the United States has backed off imposing
sanctions on Asian countries so they would be free to buy American
wheat, on Cuba to avoid a court fight with Canada and European
allies, and on China so American businesses could compete in that
huge market.
</P>
<P>
   Both administration and congressional leaders have avoided
sanctions, in large part, because of orchestrated complaints from
farm organizations and business groups, including the Chamber of
Commerce and USA Engage, a group of 676 companies who have formed a
powerful coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders contend that in the highly competitive
global economy, now regulated by an international trade
organization, economic sanctions are ineffective at getting most
countries to change and are actually backfiring since they hurt
U.S. business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unilateral sanctions only make foreign rivals stronger and
taint us as unreliable suppliers,'' said Bill Lane, Washington
director for Caterpillar Inc., who is chairman of USA Engage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 countries are now subjected to or threatened by
sanctions, trade groups say. And the trend has been growing: more
than 60 laws or executive orders authorizing sanctions _ about half
the total since World War I _ have been enacted in the last five
years. That roughly coincides with the end of the Cold War and the
super-power rivalry that had been the chief avenue for conducting
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Now legislators and policymakers are pulling the teeth out of
existing sanctions or dropping proposed penalties, fearing that
unilateral sanctions in particular are hurting American business or
diplomatic interests more than the foreign countries or companies
they are intended to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Congress exempted food exports from
sanctions automatically imposed on India and Pakistan after the two
countries conducted nuclear tests in May. The exemption was made in
part because the penalties would have barred American farmers from
bidding on a $37 million wheat order from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Senate committee shelved a popular bill to punish
foreign countries, including China, that endorsed or permitted
religious persecution after business groups protested that the
punishments would alienate diplomatic allies and trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very significant re-evaluation going on regarding
sanctions, as there should be,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who
led the fight to set aside the Senate's religious persecution bill.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also recalibrating its approach. In 1996,
President Clinton signed into law bills aimed at isolating Cuba,
Libya and Iran. But when the measures threatened to draw Washington
into a legal challenge and trade war with Canada and European
allies, the administration backed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having gone through these experiences, it made people
recognize we needed a better process for the executive branch,''
said Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of state for economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of sanctions has prompted the State Department
and the Senate to form special panels to review the usefulness of
sanctions. Legislation is pending in the House and Senate that
would require a cost-benefit analysis for any new sanctions and
would end them after two years unless they are reauthorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free ride for sanctions is over,'' said Richard Haass, a
former national security aide to President George Bush and an
editor of a new book on sanctions and diplomacy. ``Like other
foreign policy tools, sanctions are now subject to greater
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional leaders say they are not
abandoning sanctions entirely; instead, they want to use them
sparingly and in a more focused way.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these leaders recognize that in place of
sanctions the United States has few options and will either have to
rely more on diplomacy or accept its limitations and do nothing at
all.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For years, sanctions have provided Congress and the White House
with alternatives short of war but more forceful than diplomatic
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an effective and principled foreign policy tool, economic
sanctions are older than this Republic itself,'' said Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., who heads the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in particular, has been more eager in recent years to
slap on an arms embargo, cut foreign aid, cast a negative vote on
appropriating money to the International Monetary Fund, or threaten
to do all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're less patient with diplomacy and less tolerant of foreign
government actions we don't like,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
who sits on the International Relations Committee. ``They make us
feel like a player in foreign policy, where our powers tend to be
more limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has used sanctions to protest political
repression in places like Myanmar, formerly Burma, and to deny
nuclear weapons technology to countries like Iran. But other
penalties aim to punish countries that mislabel tuna products sold
here or withhold foreign aid from nations whose diplomats don't pay
their parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Even states and municipalities are jumping in, much to the State
Department's dismay. Massachusetts has imposed sanctions on
companies that do business in Myanmar. New York City is threatening
sanctions against Switzerland to press for reparations for
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   Examples in which sanctions have achieved their goal are few. In
virtually all of the success stories, the United States was joined
by many other countries in imposing the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The international sanctions imposed against Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 have slowed, but not completely stopped,
President Saddam Hussein's ability to rebuild his military arsenal.
And, of course, they have failed to help topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral sanctions helped to end apartheid in South Africa,
but were requested by the black-majority population and were only
one factor that influenced the white minority leadership there.
</P>
<P>
   But even multilateral sanctions have a limited bite. They failed
to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait or force Haiti's military rulers
to return President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. Only the use
of, or the threat of, military force accomplished those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Congress applied these sanctions with any firm
consistency. Political repression in one country is punished, in
another it is overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hardly anybody in this room who has been entirely
consistent on this subject,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a
leader of the Senate's review of sanctions who has supported
punishing Myanmar for political repression but not China.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of unilateral sanctions say the penalties have
symbolic value on important moral issues, and underscore the U.S.
leadership role in fighting religious persecution, oppressive
regimes or the spread of missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the House and Senate earlier this year voted
overwhelmingly to impose sanctions on foreign companies or entities
that aid Iran's ballistic-missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the legislation, which is aimed mainly at Russian
and Chinese companies, asserting that the bill would hamper the
administration's flexibility in conducting foreign policy. But
Congress may yet override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation sends a message to Russian or Chinese
companies that they have a choice: `Do business with the United
States or do business with Iran,''' said Howard Kohr, executive
director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. &QL;

CASE AGAINST CLINTON DEPENDS ON INTERPRETATION OF EVIDENCE, EXPERTS
SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-MEDIA) 
(sw) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legal waters into which Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
and President Clinton have plunged are murky and relatively
unexplored, criminal law experts said on Thursday. Much will depend
on interpretation of the evidence _ mostly words and the intent
behind them _ and of the federal statutes, which also consist of
words and their intent.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes that are the subject of the investigation are not
minor. They include perjury, subornation of perjury and obstruction
of justice as well as conspiracy to commit any or all of them. Each
carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison except
obstruction, which can carry up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The case is all the more complex because impeachment is a
political process and Clinton remains, at the moment, quite
popular.
</P>
<P>
   It is not publicly known what Monica Lewinsky will say in her
immunized grand jury testimony or what corroboration will be
brought to bear in the form of testimony by others, like her
mother, Marcia Lewis, and material evidence, including taped
messages and alleged gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been widely reported that Ms. Lewinsky will testify
that she and Clinton had a sexual relationship and later discussed
ways to deny and hide it.
</P>
<P>
   That brings up first the question of perjury, which is to lie
under oath in a legal proceeding on a material matter. Last January
17, in a sworn deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit against
Clinton, the president denied having had a sexual relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If, when he testifies on Aug. 17, he changes his story, he will
have been guilty of perjury in that deposition. If, on the other
hand, he sticks by his earlier statement, and the independent
counsel can corroborate Ms. Lewinsky's claims that she had sex with
him, the president risks being charged with perjury in these grand
jury proceedings. If criminal charges are brought, it will be up to
a jury to decide between the two versions. If impeachment
proceedings result, it will be up to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe Starr will attempt to bring criminal charges against
Clinton. It is not even known if that is constitutionally
permissible. But Starr is expected to file a report to Congress,
and it may decide to pursue impeachment even if no clear crime has
been committed.
</P>
<P>
   As he gives his testimony, the president will not know exactly
what Starr has as counter-evidence.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton changes his story and says that there had been a
sexual relationship, the perjury of which he would be guilty in the
Jones suit would likely have little legal consequence since that
lawsuit was dismissed and it can be argued that Clinton's perjury
was not therefore ``material,'' as required by the statute.
</P>
<P>
   But even that is not clear. Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard
Law School said that since it was not known at the time that the
suit would be dismissed, his testimony could be considered
material.
</P>
<P>
   All experts agree that if Clinton is charged with perjury in the
upcoming grand jury investigation, that would be far more damaging
than any perjury charge from the Jones civil case even though there
would be no real legal distinction between two instances of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The next question concerns alleged conversations between the
president and Ms. Lewinsky on hiding their relationship and alleged
efforts by Clinton to get Ms. Lewinsky a job through his friend,
Vernon Jordan. Here, experts say, it probably all comes down to
context.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were found to have said something like, `We both know it
isn't true but say X,' that is an easy case,'' said Charles
Weisselberg, professor of law at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``But it is likelier that his statements were far more
ambiguous and they have to be interpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers familiar with her account, Ms. Lewinsky has
said that Clinton told her of gifts he allegedly gave her, ``If you
don't have them, you can't turn them over.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr is seeking to establish whether Clinton had urged Ms.
Lewinsky to hide gifts, including a T-shirt, a brooch and a hat
pin, that had been subpoenaed by Mrs. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's alleged statement about the gifts, Weisselberg said,
has to be investigated and placed in context to know whether it was
an innocent observation or a nefarious suggestion and possible
subornation of perjury, which means knowingly getting someone else
to commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lloyd Weinreb of Harvard Law School said, the
relationship between a president and a young White House intern
involves a colossal imbalance of power so any mere suggestion by
him might be understood by her as an order. That, too. would add to
possible subornation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they may be seen as having worked together.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Puccio, a former federal prosecutor, said that if the two
agreed to lie to federal prosecutors, then that is obstruction of
justice. Given Ms. Lewinsky's grant of immunity, she would be an
unindicted co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   The federal statutes on obstruction of justice cover about 30
pages and include a vast array of efforts to tamper with witnesses
and evidence. One portion of the law states: ``Whoever knowingly
uses intimidation . . . threatens or corruptly persuades another
person . . . with intent to influence, delay or prevent the
testimony of any person in an official proceeding'' shall be fined
or imprisoned not more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dershowitz said, ``The bottom line is, no one knows what
obstruction of justice is. We know it has to have a corrupt intent
but it is a very gray area of the law.''

CORRUPTION DISPUTE DOMINATES KENYAN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The head of Kenya's new anti-corruption
authority has been suspended from office after a disagreement with
the finance minister in a case that underscores just how difficult
it is to root out graft here.
</P>
<P>
   President Daniel arap Moi suspended the official, John Harun
Mwau, on Wednesday, just four days after Mwau had filed charges
against four high-ranking Treasury Department officials, accusing
them of a scheme to evade $3.9 million in import duties on wheat
and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The president's actions came after the finance minister, Simeon
Nyachae, in a spirited defense of his accused subordinates,
attacked Mwau in public, accusing him of starting a witch hunt. He
defended the officials, who are accused of corrupt business
dealings, maintaining that not only did they act within the law,
but with the full approval of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Played out on the front pages of newspapers here, the
disagreement has undermined the credibility of Moi's efforts to
stamp out corruption, once again putting Kenya's shaky relations
with international lenders in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not helpful,'' said one diplomat, insisting on
anonymity. ``This is an unfortunate development, distracting from
the central issues this country faces. This is all a distraction, a
sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   When the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to Kenya last
year, one of its principal complaints was that the government had
done little or nothing to rein in rampant official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, corrupt schemes have seeped into almost every
level of government here, from bribes that traffic officers solicit
from motorists to elaborate land grabs and import-duty scams
involving Cabinet members, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   In response to pressure from the IMF, Moi set up the Kenya
Anti-Corruption Authority last December and put Mwau, a former
police officer and an opposition gadfly, in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But Mwau's decision to prosecute the four treasury officials as
his first high-profile case has raised questions about his
sincerity and the viability of his authority, diplomats and
financial officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the charges were leveled, the four accused officials were
seen as part of a progressive, reform-minded wing of the governing
party, a group led by Nyachae that stands firmly behind efforts to
stamp out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   While diplomats and officials at international lending
institutions said they could not say whether the charges were true,
they did say they came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a feeling that these people who were to be arrested
were doing their jobs and we have no reason to believe they were
corrupt,'' one banking official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the charges are true, several diplomats said the
public contretemps was not likely to persuade the IMF and World
Bank to resume aid to shore up Kenya's shattered economy, which is
reeling from a steep drop in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of the capital, meanwhile, speculation has grown
that Mwau purposely took aim at pro-reform officials first, instead
of other officials suspected of corruption, in order to take the
wind out of the pro-reform movement's sails.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon in Wednesday's Daily Nation newspaper showed Mwau and
Nyachae as puppets, their strings being pulled by hands
recognizable as the president's.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the president's office said Moi would appoint a
tribunal to ``inquire into the proper performance'' of the
corruption authority. The statement said Mwau would be suspended
until the tribunal had finished its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mwau has fiercely defended the charges against the
four officials and has said he will resign if they are not proved
true in court. It is highly unlikely the case will ever be heard,
however, since the attorney general has dropped the charges. The
accused officials are Joseph Kinyua, Njeru Kirira, John Msafari and
Samuel Chebii.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nyachae has accused Mwau of pressing the
charges only to divert attention from the fact that he himself is
under investigation by the Kenya Revenue Authority for evading duty
on the import of automobile tires.

HORSE FANS CAN FIND LUXURY OR LAID-BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some horse-racing fans planning an August vacation face a
decision as difficult as any maze of handicapping variables.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga or Del Mar?
</P>
<P>
   For traveling horseplayers who have the financial means _ or a
generous expense account _ it is impossible to go wrong at either
place. A losing day at Saratoga and Del Mar beats a winning day at
most other tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The best horses in the country congregate annually at the two
tracks, running for daily purses twice as high as at Lone Star Park
at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarities end there. Located on opposite sides of the
country, the tracks are equally far apart in style and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Race Course is tucked away in the middle of Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., a small tourist community less than a half-hour from
Albany, N.Y., in a picturesque setting of mountains, trees and
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The track has been in business since the mid-1800s, and the
quaint wooden grandstand and country-fair atmosphere are throwbacks
to a time when ladies wore hoop dresses to the track and gentlemen
were attired in top hats.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Saratoga has always been a summer showplace for
old-money aristocrats from New York, such as the Vanderbilts and
Whitneys. They still cram the August calendar with concertos,
charity balls and dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although coats and ties and sun dresses remain the standard in
the grandstand, the track is also a popular weekend getaway for
tailgaters from Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont. Clad
mostly in shorts and T-shirts, they arrive in the morning armed
with blankets, armchairs and coolers and wait in line to stake out
a spot in the track's vast grassy backyard. There they have access
to betting windows, TV monitors, concession tents and kiosks _ and
even shade trees, a foreign phenomenon at racetracks in this part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   After the races, many fans go next door to Siro's, a popular
restaurant with a block-sized beer garden whose cash flow could
support the economies of some Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   Properly planned, an afternoon at Saratoga is delightful.
Unfortunately, it can also be very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Springs has only about 40,000 permanent residents, and
a hotel shortage drives in-town lodging prices to exorbitant levels
during the racing season, even for spartan accommodations _
assuming you find a room at all. Many have to stay overnight in a
surrounding city and make the short drive to Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar, on the other hand, is in a beach community of the same
name just down the road from San Diego along the Pacific Coast
Highway. Built in 1937 as the brainchild of crooner Bing Crosby,
the Del Mar track is adjacent to the ocean, thus its trademark
slogan of ``Where the Surf Meets the Turf.''
</P>
<P>
   The Del Mar grandstand has a Mission-style architecture, but it
was recently remodeled and modernized.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the more traditional air of Saratoga, it is not
unusual to see bikinis on the track apron at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   You can't beat the environment, either. After racing hours, the
Del Mar and La Jolla areas offer outstanding restaurants, shopping
and night life. Temperatures seldom rise above 85 on sunny days
because of cool ocean breezes, and swimmers cavort alongside seals
in water so cold that wetsuits can be worn in the middle of summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a typical laid-back Southern California beach town, with
bicyclists, rollerbladers and skateboarders who sometimes seem to
outnumber motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Living in such a paradise isn't cheap, with modest homes selling
in the $1 million range. Fortunately, hotel rooms are easier to
obtain around Del Mar than in Saratoga and are more comfortable and
more realistically priced.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even at these tracks, the handicapping variables can
be just as tough to decipher as they are at Louisiana Downs or
Remington Park or Retama Park. And bad rides can happen there, too.
</P>
<P>
   But when the horses don't run according to plan at Saratoga and
Del Mar, it's much easier to shrug your shoulders and smile.
The Buzz
Still in the saddle Kent Desormeaux apparently is keeping the mount
on Real Quiet, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux has been penciled in as the rider of Real Quiet for
the Aug. 9 Buick Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in
Oceanport, N.J., because jockey Gary Stevens has instead opted to
ride archrival Victory Gallop in the same race.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop finished second to Real Quiet in the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness Stakes, then defeated him by a nose in the
Belmont Stakes to spoil the Triple Crown bid.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens reached a verbal agreement with trainer Bob Baffert
earlier this summer, allowing Stevens to ride any of Baffert's
horses. But in deciding to ride Victory Gallop and not Real Quiet
in the Haskell, Stevens' agent, Ron Anderson, cited a long-standing
relationship between Stevens and Houston-owned Prestonwood Farm,
which races the Belmont and Arkansas Derby winner.
The dirt on the dirt Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie's dirt surface
should look considerably different next spring, and possibly even
for the quarter-horse season this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Track consultant Dennis Moore _ whose brother, Ron, is in charge
of day-to-day maintenance of the racing strips at Lone Star _ was
in town this week to examine the surfaces and reportedly
recommended some changes.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt track was kinder to horses in 1998 than 1997, but it
still isn't where the Moores would like it. So the surface will be
retooled, perhaps along the lines of Louisiana Downs, where a
pine-bark additive recommended by Dennis Moore has helped transform
that once-maligned surface into one praised by horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make some changes,'' promised Lone Star general
manager Corey Johnsen, who said more details should be forthcoming
in a few weeks.
Hoofbeats
Fast but frail Hit hard again by illness, Silver Charm could miss
the Breeders' Cup Classic and most of this year's racing schedule,
trainer Bob Baffert said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Silver Charm trailed the field in the five-horse
San Diego Handicap, finishing an astonishing 27 lengths behind
winner Mud Route.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said afterward that the 4-year-old Kentucky Derby winner
had bled internally during the race and soon would be put back into
training. But a few days later, he reversed himself and said Silver
Charm probably won't run again until the Santa Anita meeting begins
shortly after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he believes Silver Charm is still suffering the
effects of the virus and subsequent antibiotic treatments that kept
the colt from participating in last month's Hollywood Gold Cup.
A bit ouchy Undefeated 2-year-old filly Arrested Dreams came out of
Lone Star Park's July 18 Silver Spur Stakes with a sore right shin
and is being given some time off, said owner and trainer Louis
Roussel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's at Louisiana Downs, and we just put a little blister on
her shin,'' Roussel said. ``We're just trying to get the soreness
out. Hopefully, we can make a race in September and maybe another
in October.''
</P>
<P>
   If Arrested Dreams returns to her best form and proves talented
enough, Roussel said he might still run her in the Nov. 7 Breeders'
Cup Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs. The daughter of Dehere has
won convincingly in her three starts, all at Lone Star.
Et cetera Houston furniture magnate Jim McIngvale has signed up to
sponsor the major 3-year-old prep race at Turfway Park in Florence,
Ky., which will now be called the Gallery Furniture.Com Stakes. Jim
Beam, the longtime supporter of the race, withdrew its sponsorship
earlier this year. If things go wrong, can Mattress Mac fire
Turfway Park? ... The Aug. 15 Pacific Classic at Del Mar has a
tentative lineup that includes Gentlemen, Touch Gold, Free House
and Mud Route, for a $1 million purse.

COMPETITION BILL IRES CABLE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cable television industry lashed out Thursday at newly
proposed federal legislation designed to increase competition and
protect the nation's 67 million cable subscribers from
price-gouging after regulation of monthly rates expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Representatives Edward Markey (D-Mass.), the
ranking Democrat on the House Telecommunications subcommitee, and
Billy Tauzin (R-La.), the panel's chairman, introduced a bill that
requires cable operators to offer a basic low-cost package of local
broadcast channels and bars cable companies from locking up
exclusive programming deals at the expense of a rival broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would give communities the chance to control local
rates after deregulation if the community determines that a cable
operator does not offer an acceptable range of programming choices.
Cable rates are currently set by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether there are sufficient protections for cable
subscribers when rates are deregulated on April 1, 1999, as called
for under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While long-distance phone rates have dropped because of
increased competition, cable TV and local phone markets have
remained largely under monopoly control and have not seen lower
prices. In fact, cable rates nationwide rose 7.3 perent over the
last year, while the inflation rate was &UR;  &LR; only 1.7 percent, said
Markey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nationally, the average rate for a package of cable programs
rose from $24.43 a month just before passage of the 1996
Telecommunications Act to more than $31 a month earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have anything remotely close to a competitive cable
marketplace today. Yet unless Congress acts, the regulation of
cable monopolies will end early next year and there will be no
competitive check on price gouging in most of our communities,''
said Markey, although he added that he doesn't expect the bill to
pass this session.
</P>
<P>
   Cable industry officials were quick to criticize the
Markey-Tauzin bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will harm, not help consumers,'' said
Bartlett Leber, vice president and corporate counsel for MediaOne
in New England, which has 850,000 cable subscribers in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Leber and other cable executives say they face rising
programming costs _ particularly to purchase shows from &UR;  &LR; various
sports channels such as ESPN _ which are responsible for many of
the recent rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne increased monthly rates about 10 percent this year.
Leber said 60 percent of the price rise was due to higher
programming fees. The other 40 percent was for maintaining and
expanding the company's broadband network.
</P>
<P>
   Cable officials asserted that introducing more regulations now
would defeat the purpose of the telecom act. ``We meet the
requirements, why do we need new legislation to micromanage us?''
asked Leber.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents of the legislation maintain that communities
will unduly control programming. The bill could ``empower thousands
of city councils to dictate TV program lineups,'' said Decker
Anstrom president of the national Cable Television Association, a
Washington trade group. ``It's more government where less
government is necessary.''

CLINTON KEEPS TO BUSY SCHEDULE OF PUBLIC APPEARANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ President Clinton appeared Thursday before
friendly crowds in North Carolina, never mentioning the sex and
perjury inquiries as he pressed his environmental programs and
helped raise money for John Edwards, a Democratic candidate for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Boggs, along the banks of the New River, Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore joined local politicians to declare the river an
American Heritage River, a move that encourages federal and local
agencies to preserve the river's environment and stimulate economic
activities in its watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand North Carolinians cheered enthusiastically, and
Clinton's luck was good enough that a drenching rain held off until
moments after his speech ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support you, Mr. President!'' one woman hollered from the
crowd, and she beamed as he gestured at her and said, ``Thank you,
ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has kept Clinton on a schedule of public
events, like Thursday's, as a grand jury in Washington prepares to
hear testimony from Monica Lewinsky, perhaps as early as next week.
In an immunity deal with prosecutors, Ms. Lewinsky, a former White
House intern, has said she had a sexual relationship with the
president and that they discussed ways to hide it. Clinton has
denied any such relationship.
</P>
<P>
   As he usually does at appearances with an environmental theme,
Clinton said the Republican-controlled Congress was loading
spending bills with provisions that would roll back environmental
protections.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Congress to release about $700 million that has
already been set aside for buying conservation lands and to finance
clean water programs in his budget request for fiscal year 1999,
which begins on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heritage Rivers program was established by a White
House executive order last year, and communities all over the
country have competed for the designation. Among the 14 waterways
that were selected this week to receive the special status were the
Hudson River, the Potomac River, the Rio Grande and the Connecticut
River.
</P>

   The New River, where Clinton spoke, is poorly named: Geologists
say it has been here for 350 million years, even before the
Appalachian Mountains rose. Two decades ago, conservationists
fought off efforts to dam a big stretch of the river.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives begins its session
most days with a period for one-minute speeches that members can
devote to any topic they please. Often, representatives use these
speeches to address the news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the one-minute speeches involved issues like
gambling, education and campaign finance. No one mentioned
President Clinton's decision to testify before the grand jury in
the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to questions about the president, Republican
representatives repeated, almost like a mantra, that they were
concentrating on legislation and the needs of their constituents
and were relying on the Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to decide how to deal with the investigation of
the president. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was this response from Republican Rep. J.D. Hayworth:
``My job is to represent the 6th District of Arizona and to work on
those issues I'm here for. I'm content to leave Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky to Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, a senior Republican from California, said
party leaders had advised the backbenchers to take that
noncommittal stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Dreier said, ``for us to engage in
Clinton-bashing now is not the wisest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why, Dreier replied, ``His popularity is high,
and we still need to work with him on issues like trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House also responded to inquiries in more or
less the same way. They are glad the president is going to testify,
they said, and hope this will bring the investigations to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we can get through with this and get to the
important issues,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hyde, he was courteous in an interview but said little of
substance. ``I think it's good that he's going to testify,'' he
said. ``Let's wait and hear what he's going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   When does he expect a report from Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel? Sometime after Aug. 17, the date scheduled for
the president's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be a lame-duck session after the November election
during which his committee would conduct an investigation? He is
not ruling it out.
</P>
<P>
   Is he looking forward to receiving Starr's report and possibly
conducting an inquiry? ``This is onerous duty,'' but somebody has
to do it, Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Is perjury an impeachable offense? ``To consider the
impeachability of any act, you have to look at it in context,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has authorization to hire a staff of 14 investigators and
lawyers to consider the question of impeachment, and most of those
slots are filled. Democrats on the panel have authorization for a
staff of four. Two lawyers have been hired, and interviews are
under way for the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Senators did not go out of their way either to comment on the
news of the president's plans to testify. On the wall of the Senate
press gallery, where the senators leave press releases with
quotations they hope will make the papers, none of the dozens of
releases posted Thursday dealt with the president and his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the matter, Republican senators were more
forthcoming than their counterparts in the House. Sen. Phil Gramm
of Texas declared: ``Well, where I'm from, if you were mayor of
College Station and you were accused of this, and you looked the
people in the face and said, `I didn't do it,' and you did it, you
couldn't stay mayor of College Station. If he did do it, it's going
to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue was clearly not at the forefront of the senators'
minds. Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican
leader, said he thought that the Lewinsky matter was important but
that campaign finance abuses were much more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators seemed reluctant to say much about the
subject. ``It's still in a state of flux,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey. ``We don't know what the responses can
be. If you look at it strictly on what you're hearing, it has a
superficial specter that is rather foreboding.''

NO SLACKING ABOUT SAVING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slackers and Generation X types, it seems, are hardly slack when
it comes to saving for retirement. According to a recent survey,
people between the ages of 18 and 39 began saving for retirement at
an average age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far earlier starting age than for older groups, the
survey found: People between the ages of 40 and 64 began saving for
retirement at an average age of 35, and those 65 and older waited
until they were 46. Louis Harris &AMP; Associates surveyed 1,000 adults
in June for Alliance Capital Management, the money management firm
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But young savers, who can generally afford to invest most
aggressively because they don't need the money for many years, are
proving oddly conservative in investment choices. The poll found
that only 46 percent of people aged 18 to 29 were using stocks or
stock or bond funds in their retirement investing. And young
investors who do own stocks or funds devote only 35 percent of
their portfolios to them, on average.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 62 percent of those aged 30 to 49 have invested
money in stocks or mutual funds. And these people are putting a
greater portion of their money _ 51 percent _ into such
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 56 percent of those aged 50 to 64
held stocks or mutual funds; on average, these investors also
devoted 51 percent of their portfolios to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fascinated that Gen X-ers would start saving regularly
for retirement earlier than their elders did but keep less of their
assets in more aggressive investments,'' said John Carifa,
president of Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that retirement savers didn't think they
were stashing away enough money. In estimating how much money they
would need to retire with an income equal to 70 percent of what
they now earned, the respondents gave a median answer of $196,000.
But the median amount they actually expected to save was just
$143,000, a 27 percent shortfall.

U.S. GOVERNMENT EYES $420 MILLION DEAL TO REPLENISH CRUDE RESERVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
and HILLARY DURGIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just months after announcing plans to sell oil from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at ``fire sale prices,'' the
federal government is now contemplating buying $420 million worth
of crude.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, in a surprise maneuver late Wednesday night,
attached an ``emergency'' measure to an unrelated appropriations
bill that would authorize the Energy Department to purchase about
28 million barrels of crude for the government's emergency oil
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate took up the 1999 Treasury-Postal Appropriations Bill
_ legislation designed to fund government services ranging from the
White House to the Internal Revenue Service _ on Thursday, but the
bill got bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   And while lawmakers could still take up the issue Friday, the
vote may be postponed until September.
</P>
<P>
   Authored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., the bill is designed to
replenish crude sold from the reserve over the last three years to
help balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has repeatedly used the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
as a cash machine in recent years, selling oil to pay for unrelated
programs and depressing the price of oil by as much as 50 cents a
barrel,'' Bingaman said. ``The purchase will get excess oil off the
market and will help restore some of the security the reserve is
intended to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers anticipate the Energy Department would pay an average
of $15 per barrel for the crude. That's a far cry from the average
$27.14-a-barrel the government spent building up the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The petroleum reserve has about 563 million barrels of crude oil
in storage caverns located along the Gulf Coast in Texas and
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   By declaring the provision an ``emergency,'' lawmakers are
circumventing budget rules that otherwise would require them to
find other spending to cut to pay for the oil purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjusted for inflation, oil prices are lower today than during
the Depression,'' Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While that is good for the consumer, it is a nightmare for our
small domestic producers,'' Murkowski said. ``The very survival of
our ability to produce oil within the United States is at risk ...
I call that an `emergency.'''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal gave oil prices a boost. They jumped 39 cents in
early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Light, sweet
crude for delivery in September ended the day at $14.21, up 12
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Unleaded gasoline for August delivery settled at 40.97 cents a
gallon, down 0.14 cent. Home heating oil for August delivery was
35.31 cents a gallon, down 0.02 cent.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas prices were lower, with contracts for delivery in
September settling at $1.906 per thousand cubic feet, off 2.7
cents.
</P>
<P>
   In London, North Sea Brent crude oil for September delivery
settled at $13.08 per barrel, up 2 cents, on the International
Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Sharief, director of energy research for Hornsby &AMP; Co., a
Houston-based energy risk management firm, said the amount of oil
being discussed was not enough to really affect the markets. ``I
was really surprised there was a blip,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Independent Petroleum Association of
America, representing the nation's smaller producers, hailed the
oil purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing 28 million barrels of oil from a saturated market
would help stabilize oil prices,'' the trade group said in a letter
to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   George Yates, a Roswell, N.M.-based producer and chairman of the
trade group, said that if government officials agreed to purchase
crude they would be ``sending the signal that they recognize not
only the opportunities brought about by low oil prices but also ...
that they would like to retain a domestic oil industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to purchase crude for the reserve comes less than
four months after then-Energy Secretary Federico Pea raised the
alarm about a congressional mandate that would have forced the
Energy Department to sell 21 million barrels of crude from the
reserve to raise $207.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pea feared the government would fetch prices ranging from $10 to
$15 a barrel, and thus cost American taxpayers $175 million or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed to postpone any further oil sales. Earlier this
week, Bingaman raised the idea of buying crude with President
Clinton, while the two were aboard Air Force One flying from
Albuquerque, N.M., to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials were generally supportive of
the measure Thursday, noting that with oil prices so low it would
be reasonable to purchase crude at this time. They noted, however,
that they want to first examine the budget rules to determine if
they would agree that no other spending cuts will be required.

STURGES CENTENNIAL: REELING BACK  
 NEW VIDEO RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STURGES CENTENNIAL: In the early and middle 1940s, Preston
Sturges wrote and directed a string of perhaps the wittiest, most
sophisticated comedies ever made for the American screen. In the
late '30s, though, he wrote before he directed. ``This is him
seeing what directors were doing and saying to himself, `Wait a
minute, I can do that,''' said his son Tom Sturges.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, retrospectives of Sturges films as a director, from
``The Great McGinty'' (1940) to ``Hail the Conquering Hero''
(1944), in Los Angeles and at the Film Forum in New York City (July
24-Aug. 6) commemorate his 100th birthday. Many of the major titles
have recently been reissued on video by Universal, and Tuesday the
studio will add four films written or partly written by Sturges but
directed by others: the drama ``Imitation of Life'' (1934), the
comedy ``Easy Living'' (1937), the adventure-comedy ``If I Were
King'' (1938) and the comedy ``Never Say Die'' (1939).
</P>
<P>
   The last film, a marital imbroglio starring Bob Hope and Martha
Raye, was written with others. ``Writers then were like piano
movers,'' Tom Sturges said. ``They worked in teams. One guy wrote
women's dialogue and one the men's. Another would write chase
scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sturges, now the general manager of Twism Records, a company
partly owned by Shaquille O'Neal, was 3 when his father died in
1959. Besides encouraging the restoration of his father's films, he
has gathered many of the scripts into bound volumes, published by
the University of California Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy Living,'' a riotous comedy directed by Mitchell Leisen,
is about a feisty banker (Edward Arnold) who chases his profligate
wife (Mary Nash) to a rooftop and flings her $58,000 fur coat off a
balcony, the young woman on whom the coat lands (Jean Arthur) and
the banker's debonair son (Ray Milland), with whom Ms. Arthur
begins a romance.
</P>
<P>
   Sturges was never entirely comfortable with his scripts in the
hands of others. `` `Easy Living' goes about 40 miles per hour,''
Tom Sturges said. ``My dad would have made it go 60.'' Preston
Sturges also frequently made deals to direct dialogue, possibly the
strongest attribute of all his films. ``My father liked getting two
people in a room and seeing what they could say to each other,''
Tom Sturges said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four films, he added, Sturges would have preferred
directing ``If I Were King,'' based on a play by Justin Huntly
McCarthy. Basil Rathbone is the ruthless and often hilarious Louis
XI, who is holed up in a 15th-century Paris under siege by the Duke
of Burgundy. Ronald Colman is the poet and rabble-rouser Francois
Villon.
</P>
<P>
   In Sturges' rendering of the situation, the cunning and
loquacious Louis, a born palace psychologist and obsessive
conniver, is more taken with courtly manipulation than he is
worried by the threat outside his walls. Villon remains in good
humor despite being under the constant threat of execution. Sturges
translated the poetry himself, adding the occasional embellishment.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admire a man who, while presumably being led to the
gallows, is asked to say something humorous to cheer a tearful
woman friend, responds, ``His neck at last shall have the chance to
weigh the tonnage of his pants.''

   With his hipness in high gear, Quentin Tarantino adapts Elmore
Leonard's ``Rum Punch.'' Jackie (Pam Grier), an airline attendant,
ferries money from Mexico for the gun runner Ordell Robbie (Samuel
L. Jackson). That gets her in trouble with the government and
introduces her to the sympathetic bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert
Forster). Tarantino indulges his gift for catchy gab, but a problem
arises with convoluted plotting in a film that, Janet Maslin wrote
in The New York Times, ``isn't sharp enough to sustain all the time
it wastes on small talk, long drives, trips to the mall and
favorite songs played on car radios.'' &QL;

   1998. Polygram . $102.96. 115 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

<P>
   Robert Altman becomes the latest name director to adapt a John
Grisham mystery (Francis Ford Coppola's ``Rain Maker'' was released
on tape in April). It all has to do with a lawyer, of course.
During a rainstorm in an evocatively depicted Savannah, the
divorced legal hotshot Rick Magruder (Kenneth Branagh) meets a
mysterious woman in fishnet stockings (Embeth Davidtz). Before he
knows it she's peeling off those wet clothes, and he's easing into
hot water he'd be better off avoiding, like how to deal with her
crazed father (Robert Duvall). Particularly well-suited to Altman's
atmospheric style, the film is his ``best genre piece since `The
Long Goodbye.''' (Maslin). &QL;

   1998. Warner. $19.94. 98 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.

   In Rodney Gibbons' adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel, Jo
Bhaer (Mariel Hemingway) of ``Little Women'' is now grown up and
the headmistress of Plumfield, a Massachusetts boarding school that
she runs with her husband, the professor (Chris Sarandon). With
cows grazing in pastures by the lovely woods, grace said before
meals and Saturday nights enlivened by pillow fights, all is
idyllic until the arrival of Dan (Ben Cook), a bad boy from the
city whose rude ways become a burden for all. But while Alcott is
full of life, here ``everyone seems to be just imitating 1930s
movies about the 19th century and false notes abound'' (Anita
Gates).

   1998. Paramount. $102.56. Laser disk, $34.95. 96 minutes. Closed

<P>
   It's a dark and stormy night in Huntingburg, Ind., as a security
guard (Christian Slater) tries to salvage $3 million from an
armored car that is the target of a gang of thieves led by Jim
(Morgan Freeman). Jim sure would like that money to retire on, but
in his way are a dam that is about to burst, a disgruntled sheriff
(Randy Quaid) and other stumbling blocks in a film for which ``deep
waters and shallow characters tell the story'' (Lawrence Van
Gelder). &QL;

MANY THINK CLINTON LIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As people around American see it, anyone in Bill
Clinton's position would have lied, even under oath.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Most believe former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky and
the occupant of the Oval Office had sex of some sort. They also
believe Clinton responded as any guilty husband and father might.
</P>
<P>
   He lied, they said. Maybe he told her to lie, too. That's
unfortunate, they said, even offensive. But few of the dozens of
men and women, Republicans and Democrats, interviewed said Clinton
should face impeachment proceedings for falsely answering a
question he should not have been asked in the first place. The
economy is humming, the nation is not at war, and that's what
matters most to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, really, who cares?'' said Nancy Miranda, a schoolteacher
from Brooklyn, N.Y. ``What is it lying about? There's no state
secrets. He didn't lie about the Bay of Pigs. (The investigation)
is such a waste of time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Damion Young, music director at a Los Angeles radio
station, ``He's done some good for the country, and if he did
something with this woman, then that's his business. He should be
judged on the things he's done as a professional and not what
happens on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Regina Jordan, executive director of the Chamber of
Commerce in Douglas, Ariz., put it, ``I just don't see the point of
any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that every voter thought Clinton should go
unpunished. Lori Murphy, who was visiting the Capitol from
Cookville, Tenn., said she was saddened that the American people
seem not to care that Clinton is ``a liar and a cheat.'' She is,
she added, as disappointed in them as she is in her president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that our nation is not more concerned with the
morality of our leaders,'' said Joann Creamer, who lives in
Arlington, Texas. ``People think if he's handling the country it's
OK. But if you don't have moral character in small decisions, you
don't in big decisions either.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Billy Mariani, a Chicago computer consultant who believes
Lewinsky is lying and Clinton is telling the truth, ``If it were
true, he lied under oath. You'd definitely have to bring forth
impeachment hearings. You can't let something like that go
unexcused.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, were more ambivalent about the impact of
Clinton's personal character on public issues as well as the
outcome of a sex scandal that has transfixed Washington but had
little impact on the day-to-day lives of average Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a terrific diplomat,'' said Anthony Papandrea, a Brooklyn
butcher. ``As good as he snows women, he snows other politicians.
He's one of those men who have that charisma where, no matter how
this turns out, people will like him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Think about Nixon and Watergate. That was breaking
and entering. This is about infidelity to your wife. Totally
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Some did say Clinton should face the same penalty for perjury as
any other person, although not until he leaves office. A half-dozen
also wanted Clinton impeached, especially if it is proven that the
president specifically asked Lewinsky to lie to prosecutors. Still,
most added, it would depend how and when Clinton made that request,
if he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not see a sitting president impeached for something
like this,'' said Marv Marlowe, an insurance agent in Santa Monica,
Calif. ``Lying is lying, of course, but let the punishment fit the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Vicky Erhart, a community outreach coordinator in Phoenix:
``I can't imagine someone not lying about something like that, to
be honest with you. Probably he should be punished if it was
obstruction of justice. But that would depend. I mean, if afterward
he just said, `Don't tell anyone,' then no, he shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Erhart, many people also said they were not absolutely
certain that Lewinsky was now telling the truth. When first
approached, Lewinsky, like Clinton, denied any relationship of a
sexual nature. This week, six months after independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr launched his investigation, she was granted
immunity from prosecution, and reportedly will tell a grand jury
that she had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most were inclined to believe Lewinsky, saying too many
women have come forward too many times to dismiss them all as
liars. As many noted, Clinton also initially denied an affair with
cabaret singer Jennifer Flowers while he was governor of Arkansas.
He later admitted to having sex with her once or twice; she
maintains their affair lasted 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm something of an expert on cheating husbands, having had
three myself,'' said Monica Williams, a bartender from Kissimmee,
Fla. ``Let me tell you something _ if a man is innocent, he can
prove it, and that's what he's going to do, right from the start,
because he knows he has to. If he says it's his word against hers,
he's a dog, and that's all there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sue Crosthwait, a paralegal in Oklahoma City, ``If I had to
say one way or the other, I'd say the women are probably telling
the truth. I hate to say that because I voted for him and I like
him as our president. But I do think it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many citizens, Consuela Ivy, a receptionist in Chicago,
said she would like to believe Clinton is telling the truth. Either
way, though, it doesn't much matter to her. The president, she
said, was elected to run the country well, not his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hillary's not bashing him over the head, I'm not going to
bash him over the head,'' Ivy said. ``I don't have to roll over and
look at him at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gary Thelen of Des Moines, Iowa, ``I'd prefer the whole
thing go away. People have been indiscreet for all of history. Why
is it now a big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the stance many men and particularly women took when all
Clinton was facing were charges that he had had a relationship with
a woman who technically worked for him and who was young enough to
be his daughter. When news of their alleged relationship first
broke, polls in fact showed that Clinton's support among women
rose.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many women also said they would not stand by the
president if it was proven that he had asked Lewinsky to lie or had
simply lied himself. Thursday they appeared to back off those
claims. Again and again, they stressed that Clinton was too smart
and too savvy a politician to have made such a request, which would
have been an attempt to obstruct and that it will ultimately be her
word against his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to make a mistake like that,'' said Cathy
Perkins, who sells Mary Kay cosmetics in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Perkins and other voters said they wished Clinton had
been upfront with the American people from the start. In a nation
known for embracing celebrities who admit their sins, they said he
would have been forgiven, the entire matter forgotten. Now the
president must testify before the grand jury via videotape on Aug.
17, though many feel the story has dragged on too long already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows he did it, and they've already made up their
minds about whether they think it matters. I'm just glad it's
coming to an end,'' said Jamie Gordon, a physical therapist in
Orlando, Fla. ``It is coming to an end, isn't it?''

<P>
   Perhaps it's the approach of the millennium, a good time for
taking inventory. Or the cold war's end, the stock market's heat,
the celebrity of mega-magnates. Whatever the reason, business tales
_ business details, even _ are increasingly the stuff of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   My own list includes two novels from last year: ``The Ax,''
Donald E. Westlake's chilling mystery about layoffs in the paper
pulp industry, and ``American Pastoral,'' Philip Roth's sweeping,
Pulitzer Prize-winning family narrative shaped in part by a
compelling chronicle of its fictional family's business: glove
making.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are this year's satirical novels: ``God Is My
Broker,'' by Christopher Buckley and John Tierney, a send-up of the
advice-mongers of money and management, and ``Lloyd: What
Happened,'' by Stanley Bing (Crown, $25.95), a comedic business
novel related in prose and, with a deadpan nod to executive
readers, in four-color charts.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Gain,'' by Richard Powers (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25),
takes the corporate tale beyond suspense, satire or subplot.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big, serious novel of business. Viewed through the
prism of the fictional Clare Soap and Chemical Co. and its company
town, ``Gain'' is a saga about the romance and ruin created by
American enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The novel tells two tales simultaneously _ the history of Clare,
a conglomerate of consumer, agricultural and chemical products that
began as a family candle-and-soap ``manufactory'' in the early 19th
century, and the story of Laura Bodey, who lives in the present in
Lacewood, Ill., Clare's longtime headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bodey's life _ she is the mother of two _ is dominated by
disease. Her daughter is grieving for her best friend, who has
succumbed to a malignant brain tumor. And Bodey herself has just
been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Bad luck all around, she
thinks, initially shrugging off an Environmental Protection Agency
study of toxic emissions at Clare.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel stories, of company and citizen, keep alternating.
Although the two narratives never exactly meet, the intended link
is clear from the novel's start: With corporate gain comes personal
loss. Robust growth exacts a price. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this overarching message _ reinforced by the author's use of
reprints of fictional advertising for Clare products _ never
overwhelms the narrative. In the capable hands of Powers, whose
most recent book, ``Galatea 2.2,'' is a futuristic Pygmalion story,
``Gain'' is still very much a novel. It's just that it remains a
novel in two parts.
</P>
<P>
   The book is at its best when spinning its textured corporate
history. Against a rich American backdrop, the Clare company takes
shape vividly, as real as the real-life companies mentioned along
the way: DuPont, Lever Brothers and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   As the three Clare brothers (and the reader) conquer the
mysteries of saponification _ the process of turning grimy grease
into soap _ and as Clare expands its product base, ``Gain'' holds
up a mirror to corporate life in the 19th and 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   These segments are dense with American history. In fine,
old-fashioned prose, the author places the Clare brothers _ Samuel,
Benjamin and Resolve _ in a firm social context. And he guides the
growing company through patent scuffles, financial panics,
incorporation issues, union organizing and, finally,
environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers are not portrayed as greedy. They are honest
suppliers, pay decent wages, and, if the company pollutes, it's out
of ignorance or accepted practice. The beast of growth, the
corporate behemoth, must be fed. So the brothers feed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gain'' is less persuasive in the Lacewood sections, where the
writing style is ultramodern _ present-tense prose sprinkled with
brand names and wisecracking dialogue. We care about the main
characters, but the story is static.
</P>
<P>
   When we meet her, Laura Bodey has a good sense of humor, two
teen-agers, a married lover, a real estate job and cancer. Aside
from her disease, little else progresses. Her fatalistic attitude
about her illness is altered only minimally when she learns about
fellow cancer sufferers and their lawsuit against Clare.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in her town, she is alienated from the history that
created her community. When her enlightenment comes, it takes the
form of blanket commercial hostility (she calls a business
telemarketer ``evil'') or naive questioning about the safety of her
hair dye, diet soda or dandruff shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   Only the passages about her course of chemotherapy _ finely
observed and affecting _ live up to the writing in the book's
``other'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   Powers pulls plenty of threads to try to bring together these
parallel stories. But the twin narratives never cross convincingly,
despite the novel's strong writing and wonderfully illuminating
detail. There's no climax, no meaningful moment when the two main
characters _ corporation and citizen _ confront each other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given its premise, ``Gain'' can't really deliver such
a denouement. In this novel, it is corporate growth itself _ not
greed, corruption or any other human foible _ that is the villain.
Clare's crimes, you might say, are nothing personal.

EQUITY-FUND PURCHASES SLOW DOWN IN JULY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Exhibiting their usual skittishness in a period of
stock market turmoil, mutual fund investors slowed their purchases
of equity funds in the second half of July, fund companies and
industry analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent slowdown, however, cash flows into stock
funds so far this year remain well ahead of last year's record
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, which together
account for one-fifth of the fund industry's $5.1 trillion in
assets, each reported sharply higher sales of stock funds in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out the month with cash flowing strongly into
equity funds,'' said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Fidelity, a
unit of FMR Corp. ``But by the end of the month, investors were
turning to safer havens, particularly money market funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $650 million trickled into equity funds in the week that
ended Wednesday, partly reversing the $1.4 billion that flowed out
the previous week, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata,
Calif., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The late-month down draft in stock prices and cash flows hardly
spells disaster for the monthly totals, which are watched on Wall
Street as an indicator of sentiment among mainstream investors.
Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a Santa Rosa, Calif., research firm,
estimates that $18 billion went into stock funds in July. The
Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported Thursday that
stock funds received $19.2 billion in net new investments in June.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, investors have apparently treated their mutual
fund choices in the same way as their stock investments _ flocking
to the biggest names, while leaving the smaller companies lagging
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Investors poured $3.3 billion into Vanguard's stock funds in
July, up 65 percent from the previous month and 4 percent higher
than in July 1997, a spokesman, Brian Mattes, said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard, the country's second-largest fund company, is having a
stellar year, with $34 billion flowing into its mutual funds in the
first seven months _more than in all of 1996 and not far behind the
$39.9 billion that the company received in all of 1997. Overall,
Vanguard's take so far this year exceeds the combined flows into
the funds of the next three largest sellers: Putnam Investments,
American Funds and Pimco.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, too, reports strong contributions. Its equity funds
took in $750 million in net new investments in July, up from $100
million last month, Ms. Crowley said. Fidelity's bond funds added
$300 million, up from about $200 million a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund groups experienced slower cash flows in July. At
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., which sells funds from dozens of companies,
investors bought a net $574 million of stock funds in July, down
from $896 million in June and $1.2 billion a year earlier. Bond
sales, which were higher than a year ago, fell slightly in July
from June.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1998, $126.3 billion was invested in equity
funds, up 16 percent from the first half of last year, the
Investment Company Institute said. June's stock flows of $19.2
billion were about even with the previous month's total and up from
$16.3 billion in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bond funds added $4.1 billion in June, about half the previous
month's net new investments but far above the $801 million that
investors funneled into bond funds in June 1997. In the first half
of the year, $38.6 billion moved into bond funds, way up from $2.1
billion in the first half of 1997.

RESEARCHER SAYS HE HAS NEW WAY TO ALTER GENE CODE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mich.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAR HARBOR, Maine _ A scientist has stunned geneticists here by
describing his success with a powerful new technique for rewriting
the DNA code in the cells of animals, plants and humans that he
says could revolutionize human gene therapy and agricultural
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The geneticists, though excited about the prospect of enormous
shortcuts in making animal models of human diseases and in
developing cures for inherited diseases, remain cautious because
many labs have failed to get the method to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the researchers attending the annual Short Course in
Human and Mammalian Genetics at the Jackson Laboratory here said
they were eager to get back to their labs and try their hand at
correcting DNA mutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's only one-tenth as efficient as was presented, this
will revolutionize what we do in our labs,'' said Lawrence Brody, a
scientist at the National Institute for Human Genome Research,
saying it would vastly speed the creation of animals with specific
genetic characteristics that mimic human diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology was presented here by Dr. Clifford J. Steer,
a liver specialist at the University of Minnesota Medical School,
who further developed the method after it was invented in the mid
1990s by another scientist. Steer called it ``very, very
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go in and alter a nucleotide (single unit of DNA
code), take it out or re-insert it exactly where you want to.''
With current methods for altering genetic information, changing a
single ``letter'' among the billions of nucleotides in a human cell
is so cumbersome and inefficient that it's not attempted. Instead,
gene therapy researchers use viruses to carry in copies of entire
normal genes in an effort to replace defective genes. But that
hasn't yet succeeded in curing any human disease.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the new technique is conceptually like using the
correcting key on an electric typewriter: it can quickly correct or
change up to three ``letters'' of genetic code in a remarkably high
percentage of cells containing the DNA mistake. And the artifical
molecule that rewrites the genetic script, called a
``chimeraplast,'' can be administered to the animal, plant or human
without the use of viruses, which raise many problems for gene
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Steer and his colleagues last March published a report in the
journal Nature Medicine on using the method to correct a mutant
liver cell gene in rats. And he says a company that owns the
technology, Kimeragen, Inc., of Newtown, Pa., hopes to test it in
children with a rare and ultimately fatal liver disorder by
sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Steer, whose work is supported by the company, said that the
method has successfully treated a rat version of the disorder,
called Crigler-Najjar disease. The disease affects only a few
hundred children but causes a severe jaundice that eventually
affects the brain, causing retardation and death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential applications in a wide range of genetic
diseases, cancer, AIDS and in changing traits in agricultural crops
and livestock, some scientists remain skeptical until the technique
is shown to be reliably reproducible.
</P>
<P>
   Steer said Thursday that the labs that have failed did not use
chimeraplasts of the necessary high quality. The ones he uses are
manufactured by Boston Biosystems in Bedford, Mass. And he said
that at least one laboratory, at the University of Arizona Health
Science Center in Tucson, has published an abstract saying that it
got the method to work.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Blaase, who heads the gene therapy branch of the
National Institutes of Health, said in a telephone interview that
he believes the technique will prove to be ``the breakthrough that
I have been waiting for in my two decades of work on gene
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the technique has not been shown to work in egg
cells, which could hinder its use in making transgenic
(gene-altered) animals, and it hasn't been able to target every
kind of genetic error that it's been tried on. Nevertheless,
Blaase, who is serving as a consultant to Kimeragen, said he
believes it should work in a number of ``really bad genetic
diseases'' that originate in the liver, such as hemophilia,
familial hypercholesterolemia and others.

TALKS STALL BETWEEN NORTHWEST AIRLINES AND ITS PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (js) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal mediators have declared an impasse in contract
negotiations between Northwest Airlines and its pilots, setting the
stage for a possible strike as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board, which has been presiding over
negotiations between Northwest and its 6,300 pilots since July
1997, declared the impasse on Wednesday and asked both sides to
submit to binding arbitration. Northwest agreed, but the pilots did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the issues are too important and too complex to give
to an outside party,'' Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association, said. ``The pilots who fly the airplanes and
know the schedules and the managers who run the airline are in the
best position to make these decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the Mediation Board's declaration
triggers a 30-day cooling off period before a strike. The earliest
that the pilots could walk out is Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are expected to continue and both Northwest and the
union expressed confidence that a strike can be averted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to prevent the inconvenience to passengers and the
severe economic disruption that a strike would cause,'' Ben Hirst,
Northwest's lead negotiator, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, which is the country's fourth-largest carrier and is
based in St. Paul, Minn., is currently negotiating with six
different unions representing about 90 percent of its 50,000
workers. Many of the airline's flights were disrupted in April and
May when machinists staged slowdowns and wildcat strikes to protest
the slow pace of the contract negotiations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The combination of the disruptions and the weak economy in Asia,
where Northwest has a large presence, caused the airline's
second-quarter earnings to plunge 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This week, 27,000 members of the International Association of
Machinists, which represents a wide range of workers from mechanics
to secretaries, voted on a series of tentative contracts with the
airline. The results will not be announced until next Tuesday, but
a spokesman for the union said that it now appeared that the
contracts would be rejected, which would send the union and the
airline back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   The airline and the pilots have agreed on 22 of 29 sections of a
new contract. Issues still outstanding include job security, pay
increases, retirement benefits and approval of Northwest's proposed
alliance with Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said that it would continue to fly its full schedule
over the next month.

 &HT;    Atlanta beats Reds 13-3 and trades for Colbrunn
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In a deft sequence that would make any rotisserie
player proud, the Atlanta Braves in a few choice hours on Thursday
body-slammed Cincinnati, pulled off a trade and flew back home to
joust with mighty Mark McGwire and his St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves dispensed with Cincinnati 13-3 and then regained Greg
Colbrunn, the reserve first baseman who played a valuable role with
the club last year but was not re-signed. Atlanta obtained him from
Colorado, where he was hitting .311 with two home runs and 13 RBIs
in 62 games. Of more interest to the club, he is 9-for-26 (.346) as
a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough out,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``He can give Cat
(Andres Galarraga) a day off, if he needs the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he bolsters the right-handed capability off
the bench. In return, Atlanta sent the Rockies minor-league
relievers David Cortes (Class AA Richmond) and Mike Porzio (Class A
Danville). The club needs to open a roster spot for Colbrunn. That
decision will be made after Cox and general manager John Schuerholz
discuss plans for moves before tonight's trading deadline.
Outfielder Danny Bautista appears at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pounded the Reds for 16 more hits, including two
homers by Gerald Williams and Andruw Jones, to take three of four
games from the Reds and finish their road trip at 7-2. From the
fifth inning of Wednesday night's game, Atlanta scored 24 times in
16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of went two or three games there where we didn't swing
so well,'' Chipper Jones said, ``so I guess you could say we were
due. From the fifth inning on (Wednesday) night, we swung extremely
well, took our walks and made them pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the game brought forth another quality performance by
Denny Neagle (11-9), who appears to be shaking out of a 1-3 slump
as he recovers his change-up. He allowed two runs on five hits in
eight innings, giving the bullpen a much needed breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember any (change-up) cutting back over the middle
of the plate,'' Neagle said. ``If anything, I missed low and away.
That's what I want to do with that pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves return home to greet the biggest story of the year in
McGwire and one of the most startling home-run rushes in history.
Greg Maddux, who faces Todd Stottlemyre and the Cardinals in the
first of three games, considered whether he would enjoy facing the
challenge of McGwire at the height of his prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Would you?'' Maddux replied. ``Why would you enjoy facing
a guy who can hit the Coke bottle (above left field)? I enjoy
facing the singles hitters.''

&HT;        HOUSE DEMS REGROUP DURING CALM IN STORM OF ANTI-GAY RIGHTS
LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 30 -- House gay rights advocates had a chance
to regroup Thursday, thanks to a last-minute schedule change.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the House passed a measure that jeopardizes
millions of dollars of federal housing funds to San Francisco
unless it repeals a domestic partner ordinance. And Thursday, the
House was supposed to consider a proposal by Rep. Joel Hefley,
R-Colorado Springs, that would block President Clinton's executive
order making homosexuals a ``protected group'' against
discrimination in federal employment.
</P>
<P>
   But a delay in debate on a larger spending bill, to which Hefley
was going to attach his amendment, provided a temporary calm in
what critics consider a storm of anti-gay rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to fight because we are right,'' said Rep.
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ``The very idea that (the Hefley amendment)
is coming to the floor -- that it's even being considered by this
body -- shows what we're up against in getting gay rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hefley said the intention of both measures were
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of it causing this much of a stir,'' said
Hefley. ``It's become in some people's mind a big gay issue, which
is not what it is at all.''
</P>
<P>
   His amendment, which he intends to attach to the House spending
plan for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, is simply
``to prevent the president from carving out another protected
class,'' Hefley said, something he believes is a unnecessary and
would bog down the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wednesday's measure by Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., ``That
is a different issue in that, no, we won't let a local municipality
blackmail their contractors with our money,'' said Hefley.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley was referring to the city ordinance forcing companies
doing business with San Francisco to provide benefits to employees'
domestic partners. The Riggs amendment would prevent San Francisco
from using any federal housing money ``to implement'' that
ordinance, something that could cost the city $65 million dollars,
according to Pelosi.
</P>
<P>
   The Riggs amendment passed by a 214-212 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democrats said Thursday that both bills are about one
thing: discriminating against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the millennium, we are still hung up on who to
discriminate against,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who, as the
only Holocaust survivor to be elected to Congress, said the issue
of discrimination ``touches the very core of my being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a hundred years ago, we had slavery on the basis of
pigmentation,'' said Lantos, adding: ``Are we still not grown up
enough to realize that discrimination... is an outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the bills are part of a GOP assault on gay rights,
which has included Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
equating homosexuality to alcoholism and kleptomania, and the
Senate holding up the nomination of gay philanthropist James Hormel
as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the only openly gay Democrat in the
House, said the measures are really election bellwethers for the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're setting up here is a test for November,'' said
Frank. ``The right wing, to its credit, will vote. Too many
moderates and liberals... will just denounce politics, or vote
Green, making sure the Republicans win.''
</P>
<P>
   The only open gay GOP Congressman, Jim Kolbe of Arizona, was
among 35 Republicans who voted against the Riggs amendment. Kolbe
did not return a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley's amendment was originally going to be attached to the
Treasury and Postal Service spending bill, until House leaders
realized that Kolbe was managing that debate, and delayed the
Hefley amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment is expected to be introduced early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, House Democrats said they will be making sure they
have enough votes to defeat it. Hefley said he does not know how
many votes his measure will get.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also said they will try to ensure that the Riggs
measure does not make it into the yet-to-be-passed Senate version
of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hefley amendment, Frank said he is confident the
proposal will be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this one will lose,'' said Frank. ``I think they've
clearly over reached on this one.''

PRESS APPROACHING LEWINSKY INQUIRY A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUSLY SECOND
TIME AROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-PERJURY) 
(sw) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The period of press hand-wringing and soul-searching is long
past. The harsh critique of the news media in Brill's Content is by
now old news. And the Monica Lewinsky story is back with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, news organizations are proceeding as usual:
plastering their front pages and leading their television reports
with news about developments in the case. But news executives say
they are doing things differently this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all being a bit more cautious in making sure
that we get things in perspective,'' said Walter Isaacson, managing
editor of Time magazine. ``But I'm really not sure that there were
any major transgressions made the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Steven Brill, who harshly criticized coverage of the
Lewinsky case as irresponsible in his magazine on the news media,
said he had noticed a slight change in approach on the part of
several news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being a little more careful about identifying
sources,'' Brill said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike, the White House press secretary, said: ``As the chum
in the water, I can attest it's the same feeding frenzy. The press
has but one speed on this story and it's fast forward with too few
editors who press the pause button.''
</P>
<P>
   While many newspaper, magazine and television journalists have
defended their initial coverage as appropriate, some news
executives say the accusations of Brill and other critics prompted
a healthy self-examination about reliable sourcing and getting too
far ahead of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my level best to make sure everything we
publish feels very solid and is based on our reporting, not on
second- or third-hand reporting,'' said Stephen Smith, who recently
resigned as editor of National Journal to become editor of U.S.
News &AMP; World Report. ``Watching the big press, which got so
competitive on this story, was a real lesson for me. You could see
people pushing the story further than it really wanted to go
because they were so locked into being first.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Wolinsky, managing editor for news at The Los Angeles Times,
said criticism of the press had forced his newspaper to try to
provide better context and to winnow out gratuitous, salacious
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make sure these stories have material that
says to the public, `This is why it's important,''' Wolinsky said.
``There has been a real focusing on what the real story is _ Is
there suborning of perjury? Are there crimes that would affect the
future of the presidency? _ as opposed to details of sex lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One element complicating the coverage, Wolinsky said, is that
news organizations are getting conflicting information from
different sources. As a result, he said, journalists from one news
organization at times wind up reporting what other news
organizations are saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are constantly leaking and spinning,'' Wolinsky said.
``Trying to get corroboration _ to not use gossip _ is much more
difficult on a story like this than it would be on any other story.
We're trying not to go out on a limb that might be sawed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, news organizations continue to rely heavily on anonymous
sources, making it difficult for the public to evaluate where the
information is coming from and why. In addition, with a scarcity of
concrete developments to cover and an abundance of air time to
fill, several television programs have continued to speculate about
impeachment and compare Clinton's predicament at this point to that
of President Richard Nixon after disclosure of the contents of the
Watergate tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a danger of lowest-common-denominator journalism,''
said James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel. ``In
an effort to avoid being scooped, often journalists will all try to
match the latest salacious story. When you're reduced to reporting
what other people are reporting, then you've abandoned your own
standards and adopted the other organizations' standards and I
think that's a dangerous path to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some news executives say, much of what they
reported in the early days of the story has proved accurate. ``In
many ways it's remarkable how the evidence in January is the
evidence today,'' Isaacson of Time said. ``It's not like, `Oh, that
was totally wrong. There were no tapes; there were no dresses.'''
</P>
<P>
   News organizations have been in retreat about the ``talking
points,'' intended to coach Linda Tripp on possible testimony about
Clinton. While there had been rampant speculation in the news media
about who in the Clinton administration might have written them,
Ms. Lewinsky herself has apparently claimed authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather, the CBS News anchor, said he subscribed to the view
``Better to be last than to be wrong'' but said news organizations
were operating in an increasingly crowded marketplace, which can
cloud judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive pit is much larger, much fiercer,'' Rather
said. ``One news organization will report something and the
pressure is immediate and immense to match it. But that's not an
excuse. ``There is no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation Journalism
Fellowships at Harvard University, said that however important the
story might be, coverage of it had been premature _ covering leaks,
not actual news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still crystal clear that the press is being used by
sources to an extent that really raises questions about just how
independent the press is,'' Kovach said. ``If I were an editor, I
would try to avoid publishing conclusionary statements about what
people are going to testify, because we don't know what they're
going to testify.''

GM BOARD HAS DIFFICULT MEETING COMING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The board of General Motors faces an unusually
difficult meeting on Monday because the company's management raised
Wall Street's expectations this summer for a drastic cost-cutting
move only to conclude a strike settlement this week that calls for
closer cooperation with the United Automobile Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Board members will have a wide range of options at their
regularly scheduled meeting. Most auto analysts were predicting
Thursday that the company would choose limited moves that might not
offend the UAW but also might not do much to improve the company's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials declined to speculate on the outcome of the board's
deliberations, which will also include meetings of some board
committees on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Possible limited moves include proceeding with a long-expected
initial public offering of a 20 percent stake in GM's auto parts
division; reshuffling some vice presidents, and eliminating the
production of some unprofitable car models and assigning workers to
other models.
</P>
<P>
   The board may also decide to combine the vehicle distribution
and marketing staffs of divisions like Chevrolet, Buick and
Cadillac, creating instead regional marketing offices that would
handle all cars and trucks. This might reduce nonunion,
white-collar employment slightly but would have little effect on
the public because the names of cars and dealerships would not
change.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American
car operations, said several times during the nearly eight-week
strike at two parts factories in Flint, Mich., that the automaker
was reconsidering the viability of various models and factories.
While the UAW has long tolerated changes in what models GM builds,
it has fought factory closings.
</P>
<P>
   Auto analysts said Thursday that they were trying to lower
institutional investors' hopes for any big moves, such as the
closing of unprofitable factories or layoffs of tens of thousands
of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North American
personnel, said late Tuesday that company and union officials would
begin meeting more regularly to discuss problems before they turn
into strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said
the same day that GM had not raised the possibility of factory
closings during strike-settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   David Bradley, an auto analyst with J.P. Morgan, said that those
comments made it unlikely that the GM board would take any big
steps on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been closing factories and reducing its work force
through attrition since the late 1970s as its American market share
has diminished.

GAILEY GOES ON PUBLIC VIEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Even exuberant Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin
can't remember the last time he got excited about a preseason
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the 11-year veteran can barely remember even playing in
one.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvin brings almost rookie-like emotion into tonight's
exhibition matchup against the Seattle Seahawks, set for 8 o'clock
at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet we are going to be in there longer than we are
used to,'' Irvin said of the Cowboys' first team. ``We are ready to
line up against somebody else and see what this offense looks like
against another team. Because of that, we are looking forward to
playing. ''
</P>
<P>
   Several changes after last season's 6-10 campaign, highlighted
by the addition of coach Chan Gailey and his new offense, the 1998
preseason might be far different from any of the past several
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, the offensive coordinator at Pittsburgh last season,
will make his inaugural walk into Texas Stadium as head coach. The
shotgun will make a Cowboys appearance for the first time in seven
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will also get a first look at top draft pick Greg Ellis,
newly acquired free-agent running back Chris Warren, a slimmed-down
Nate Newton, the position battles at free safety and No. 2
receiver, fullback Daryl Johnston in game action after neck
surgery, and a revamped defense scheme, featuring a ``3-4'' look.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey acknowledged that the environment surrounding the
preseason opener is unusual and therefore isn't surprised that
veterans like Irvin and quarterback Troy Aikman are excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are excited about it just like I think all of us are
excited about playing a game with a new offense and a new
defense,'' Gailey said. ``And \Rwe're excited about\S seeing how
some things turn out to make an evaluation of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The area drawing the most anticipation is the offense, where the
power running and precision passing scheme of years past gives way
to Gailey's power-running, high-octane attack, that will feature
the shotgun and five-receiver sets.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who will play about a quarter, along with the rest of
the first team, said he wants to play as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play as much as possible because it's a new
offense,'' Aikman said. ``We need to get a feel for it in a
game-type situation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Aikman warned that the offense might not look too
smooth the first time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want perfect execution,'' he said. ``But more likely, it
will look a little rough and we know that. We know there's going to
be some mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of offense, the game is also a spotlight for Gailey and
his coaching staff, including seven new assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps the coaches,'' Gailey said. ``We have a new warmup
procedure, new people on the phone, new people upstairs in the
coaching booth, new people downstairs on the sideline. It helps our
game-day management procedures.''

TAX CUT IS BIGGEST IN MASSACHUSETTS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How's this as a measure of the monetary euphoria
sweeping statehouses across the country lately? Even here, in the
state derided not so long ago as Taxachusetts, Acting Gov. Paul
Cellucci signed a $19.5 billion budget Thursday that incorporated
part of a brand-new, multiyear, $770 million tax cut, the largest
in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   And one of Cellucci's biggest end-of-session fights with the
Democrat-dominated Legislature is over whether its leadership's
proposal for an additional one-time $200 million tax cut is enough.
He is pushing for $650 million more in tax cuts, so that most of
the state's nearly $1.1 billion surplus from the 1998 fiscal year
will go right back to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to spend that surplus, I intend to veto,'' he said
Thursday afternoon after signing the budget for the 1999 fiscal
year, ``because I want that money to go to tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the sniping old label of Taxachusetts (and occasional
accompanying references to the Pay State instead of the Bay State)
has been outdated for years now, made obsolete mainly by the fiscal
discipline introduced by former Gov. William Weld in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Once the heaviest-taxing state in the country, Massachusetts now
imposes the eighth-highest tax burden on its residents, said
Barbara Anderson, probably the state's best-known anti-tax
advocate. Its income tax still rivals New York's for the top
position, though, she said, so ``we could still be Taxachusetts on
the income tax.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many other states in these hearty economic times and
this dawning election season, the state's revenue windfalls are
turning into stunning tax cuts as rainy-day funds fill to the brim
and ambitious new spending remains widely unpopular for almost
everything but education. According to a recent survey by the
National Conference of State Legislatures, 19 states cut taxes in
the fiscal year beginning July 1, as budget surpluses reached new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tax-cut plan that the Republican acting governor
signed into law last week, taxpayers' personal exemption on earned
income is doubled, and the ``investment income tax'' _ tax paid on
income from interest and investments _ is reduced from 12 percent
to the same level as earned income, 5.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So rosy is the Massachusetts tax picture, and so quiescent the
state's once-overburdened taxpayers, that Ms. Anderson and her
famous Coalition for Limited Taxation and government _ the group
behind the landmark 1980 voter-approved slash in the state property
tax known as Proposition 2 1/2 _ raised the question recently of
whether they should perhaps disband.
</P>
<P>
   Their membership had dropped, and they had just suffered a most
painful defeat, failing by just a few signatures to gather the
support needed for a ballot initiative on lowering the state income
tax to 5 percent from its current level of almost 6.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the coalition's possible imminent dissolution
brought a rush of support, Ms. Anderson said Thursday, and its
future remains unclear. It moved out of its downtown Boston office
on Wednesday, she said, but will likely shift to more online
communicating and less of the Beacon Hill lobbying that had come to
seem futile.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A McCormack Institute-University of Massachusetts poll in
January found that when offered the option of returning the budget
surplus to taxpayers or paying off state debt, only 40 percent
supported returning the money to taxpayers, while 31 percent wanted
to pay off state debt and 11 percent said both.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions remain even further divided; some argue the tax cuts
are simply going too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be looking at over a billion dollars in tax cuts,''
said James St. George, executive director of the nonprofit Tax
Equity Alliance of Massachusetts. ``It's just too large. Whenever
the economy slows down, we're going to find that that billion
dollar tax cut creates big holes in the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the cuts in part to ``a fair amount of
election-year politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, on the other hand, found the current tax cuts
unimpressive, falling well short of the fundamental change she
believes is needed and allowing a continued rise in spending that
she expects to keep rising until the next fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all supposed to be grateful because they're letting us
keep some of our own money,'' she said.

COYOTE ATTACKS CAPE COD TOT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. _ A coyote sprang from the woods and attacked a
3-year-old boy Wednesday evening as he played on his backyard
swingset here, the first documented case of a coyote attacking a
human in Massachusetts and one of only a dozen cases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was rescued when his mother kicked and punched the
coyote, wresting her bleeding son from its clutches. The animal
then began growling at the boy's five-year-old sister, who was at
the top of the swingset, before police officers arrived and killed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Neal was treated and released early Thursday morning at
Children's Hospital in Boston for bites to the head, arm, chest and
back. As a precaution, he was given the first battery of shots for
rabies.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, officials began trying to solve the mystery of what
prompted the coyote _ one of a burgeoning number of coyotes in
heavily populated Massachusetts towns _ to become violent.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Deblinger, the state's assistant director for wildlife, said
he douted the animal had rabies. More likely, he said, the coyote
had gotten accustomed to being around humans from either being fed
by them or eating food they had put out for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it's cute to get close to wildlife,'' Deblinger
said. ``But when wild animals get used to handouts and their
feeding gets interrupted, that's when we get problems like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes are normally skittish around humans, but this one had
become so aggressive over the last several days that local police
were actually hunting it when the attack occurred about 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and his 5-year-old sister Elena were playing on the
swingset in their back yard, which borders the Massachusetts
Military Reservation in the Forestdale section of Sandwich. Daniel
was on the glider while his sister was climbing on a section of the
set next to her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the coyote pulled Daniel off the swingset and dragged
him about 10 feet closer to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Audra Neal, who was in the kitchen, heard the commotion and ran
out and started kicking and punching the coyote. She then rushed
him inside, telling her daughter to stay up on the swingset. She
came back outside, staying between her daughter and the coyote
until her daughter was safely inside. She then called police.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich Police officer Michael F. Hoadley had been hunting the
coyote for several days, as sightings had increased and its
behavior became more aggressive. At nearby Camp Good News, local
officials said, the same coyote had pulled a child in a sleeping
bag out of his tent. It had scratched another camper and come face
to face with a third.
</P>
<P>
   Hoadley said he had spotted the coyote Wednesday morning but it
ran off before he could get a safe shot at it. He took a run later
in the day after work, listening to Van Halen on his headset. A
driver pulled up alongside him as he jogged and pointed behind him.
There was the coyote again, loping along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coyote was on my heels,'' Hoadley said. ``He must have
known I was coming for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the coyote ran into the woods. About two hours later, at
about 6:50, Audra Neal's call to police came in. Arriving at the
Neal home, Hoadley said, he could hear the mother and child
screaming inside the house and then spotted the coyote out back. It
took three shots to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home Thursday, Daniel Neal seemed in good spirits
after waking up from a nap Thursday afternoon. His mother, sitting
with him on their home's back deck, said: ``I only did what I had
to.''
</P>
<P>
   The coyote was a relatively young female, weighing an estimated
50 to 55 pounds. Rabies tests are expected to be concluded sometime
late today, but rabies is almost unknown on the Cape, in large part
because of a program begun three years ago to drop food for
raccoons from helicopters. The food contains the rabies vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   In every instance where a coyote has attacked a human, Deblinger
said, ``it was a fed coyote that attacked someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Chapman, the animal control officer in Sandwich, said
officials also are investigating whether the animal had distemper,
which he said could also cause aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Chapman said, he had always told people nervous
about coyotes to just make a lot of noise and they will take off.
``Now with this incident,'' he said, ``it's hard to tell them
that.''

&HT;      (CORRECTS NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS VOTING AGAINST RIGGS
AMMENDMENT TO 33)
 &HT;      HOUSE DEMS REGROUP DURING CALM IN STORM OF ANTI-GAY RIGHTS
LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 30 -- House gay rights advocates had a chance
to regroup Thursday, thanks to a last-minute schedule change.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the House passed a measure that jeopardizes
millions of dollars of federal housing funds to San Francisco
unless it repeals a domestic partner ordinance. And Thursday, the
House was supposed to consider a proposal by Rep. Joel Hefley,
R-Colorado Springs, that would block President Clinton's executive
order making homosexuals a ``protected group'' against
discrimination in federal employment.
</P>
<P>
   But a delay in debate on a larger spending bill, to which Hefley
was going to attach his amendment, provided a temporary calm in
what critics consider a storm of anti-gay rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to fight because we are right,'' said Rep.
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ``The very idea that (the Hefley amendment)
is coming to the floor -- that it's even being considered by this
body -- shows what we're up against in getting gay rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hefley said the intention of both measures were
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of it causing this much of a stir,'' said
Hefley. ``It's become in some people's mind a big gay issue, which
is not what it is at all.''
</P>
<P>
   His amendment, which he intends to attach to the House spending
plan for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, is simply
``to prevent the president from carving out another protected
class,'' Hefley said, something he believes is a unnecessary and
would bog down the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wednesday's measure by Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., ``That
is a different issue in that, no, we won't let a local municipality
blackmail their contractors with our money,'' said Hefley.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley was referring to the city ordinance forcing companies
doing business with San Francisco to provide benefits to employees'
domestic partners. The Riggs amendment would prevent San Francisco
from using any federal housing money ``to implement'' that
ordinance, something that could cost the city $65 million dollars,
according to Pelosi.
</P>
<P>
   The Riggs amendment passed by a 214-212 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democrats said Thursday that both bills are about one
thing: discriminating against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the millennium, we are still hung up on who to
discriminate against,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who, as the
only Holocaust survivor to be elected to Congress, said the issue
of discrimination ``touches the very core of my being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a hundred years ago, we had slavery on the basis of
pigmentation,'' said Lantos, adding: ``Are we still not grown up
enough to realize that discrimination... is an outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the bills are part of a GOP assault on gay rights,
which has included Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
equating homosexuality to alcoholism and kleptomania, and the
Senate holding up the nomination of gay philanthropist James Hormel
as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the only openly gay Democrat in the
House, said the measures are really election bellwethers for the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're setting up here is a test for November,'' said
Frank. ``The right wing, to its credit, will vote. Too many
moderates and liberals... will just denounce politics, or vote
Green, making sure the Republicans win.''
</P>
<P>
   The only open gay GOP Congressman, Jim Kolbe of Arizona, was
among 33 Republicans who voted against the Riggs amendment. Kolbe
did not return a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley's amendment was originally going to be attached to the
Treasury and Postal Service spending bill, until House leaders
realized that Kolbe was managing that debate, and delayed the
Hefley amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment is expected to be introduced early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, House Democrats said they will be making sure they
have enough votes to defeat it. Hefley said he does not know how
many votes his measure will get.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also said they will try to ensure that the Riggs
measure does not make it into the yet-to-be-passed Senate version
of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hefley amendment, Frank said he is confident the
proposal will be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this one will lose,'' said Frank. ``I think they've
clearly over reached on this one.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Business disinterest may KO Holyfield bout
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Evander Holyfield's last scheduled fight was voided
because of an opponent's positive hepatitis B test. His next
proposed bout might be floored because the host city has tested
negative for cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's desire to fight in the Georgia Dome on Sept. 19,
with Vaughn Bean as the probable opponent, appeared unlikely
Thursday because the Atlanta business community has not guaranteed
the financial support that the heavyweight champion and his
attorney, Jim Thomas, had hoped for or expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people keep telling you, `I need more time,' I lose
faith,'' Thomas said. ``People's words begin to ring hollow. The
other day, I thought this was a done deal. Now I'm pretty
discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who has resumed training in Houston, said, ``It's
hard for me to understand why nobody has been able to pull this
thing together. People have to understand that this isn't (my
fault). I want to do this. I'm taking considerably less money to
fight in Atlanta. I want to give kids the opportunity to say, 'I
saw the three-time heavyweight champion of the world fight.' If it
doesn't happen, it's because the (business) people didn't show
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's camp is seeking Atlanta businesses to guarantee the
$2 million to $3 million that promoter Don King believes is
necessary to help cover the promotional cost. The boxing card also
might include a concert.
</P>
<P>
   King also would like to receive financial concessions from the
state, which operates the Dome, and from local hotels to house
boxers, officials and Showtime employees.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime would carry the fight on its cable network or as a
pay-per-view offering.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield intended to make available thousands of moderately
priced tickets, hoping to draw as many as 50,000 people to the
Dome, which never has held boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he updated King on the lack of progress. ``He didn't
seem surprised,'' Thomas said. ``He said he never believes it until
he sees the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The next logical site for a Holyfield-Bean fight is Las Vegas,
but an alternative date probably would be sought because of the
Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez rematch Sept. 18 at Caesars
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the option of trying to reschedule the mandatory
defense against Henry Akinwande in Las Vegas. Doctors believe
Akinwande no longer is infectious with the hepatitis B virus, but
the New York State Athletic Commission, which canceled the June 6
bout with Holyfield, has a zero-tolerance rule, and Akinwande's
blood continues to show traces of antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield never thought opponents would be that hard to come by.
His master plan was to get the WBA and IBF mandatory bouts behind
him so he could concentrate on unifying the three major belts with
a Lennox Lewis fight in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thinks Atlanta-based companies that might financially
back

   DAY ONE (SUNDAY)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ENVIRONMENT _ COZUMEL, Mexico _ When huge cruise ships
belly up to a new concrete pier off this Caribbean island, it's a
bitter reminder to Dora Uribe of an opportunity lost. An
opportunity, she says, to use the North American Free Trade
Agreement to mount an eleventh-hour campaign to stop the pier and
save Paradise Reef _ a reef environmentalists had long argued would
be broken to pieces and eventually killed by the thrust of the
ships. In January 1996, Uribe and other Mexican environmentalists
were the first citizens to file a complaint with a special
commission established by NAFTA's environmental side agreement. The
Cozumel experience is one of the unhappy lessons learned by
environmentalists who have tried to use the NAFTA environmental
side agreement to ensure that laws in each country are followed,
not flouted or downgraded, as free trade spreads in Mexico, the
United States and Canada. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

fired from Han Young, a Korean-owned auto parts factory, for a

Mexican and American labor activists have taken this grievance and
a range of others alleging unfair treatment at the Han Young
export, or ``maquiladora'' factory, in Tijuana all the way to
Washington D.C. (Ferris, Cox News Service).

   JORDAN-HUSSEIN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ The soveriegn of this small
country for 45 years, King Hussein is the emblem of his nation and
its guarantor of stability and security. Even among those who feel
he has been dictatorial and let his country languish in an economic
recession, Jordainians breathed a sigh of relief to see him
apparently in control of his recently found lymphoma cancer. ``This
is not the time for the king to be sick, you know,'' said car parts
retalier George Naber, after watching the King on television
Tuesday nigh. ``The situation in this country is very bad. He is
the only one who can control everything.'' The King's illness calls
into question the future of a small country that plays a huge role
in protecting the stability of the Middle East. (Kaplow, Cox News

   COLOMBIA-US-$ADV02 _ MIAMI _ Conservative president-elect Andres
Pastrana takes office in Colombia on Friday, Aug. 7, bringing a
rare burst of optimism to this violent and dangerous South American
country. Already, Pastrana has initiated talks with leaders of two
rebel armies to end the hemisphere's longest-running civil war, in
which more than 35,000 people have been killed. And he's worked to
build better relations with the United States. Even the country's
right-wing death squads promised this week to stop attacking
civilians. But Pastrana, the charismatic former mayor of Bogota,
has his work cut out for him. Colombia is the cocaine capital of
the world and one of the most-violent places on earth. More people
are kidnapped for ransom, or because they work for foreign oil
companies, in Colombia than anywhere else. And previous government
have held peace talks with the rebels and achieved little. So, why
should Pastrana be any different? (Emling, Cox News Service).

   MORELAND _ Regina Moreland wanted 10 children, just like her
mother. She bore only two. But wanted more. So over the years, she
and husband, Phillip, filled their house with other kids _ foster,
adopted, a mentally retarded grandchild. Regina also opened her
arms to a passel of great nieces and nephews who visited the
Moreland home at 633 Homewood Ave. But in less than nine months,
four children have died while at the Moreland home _ three
grandchildren, and a great-niece, ages 3 and younger. Montgomery
County Coroner James H. Davis has ruled the deaths homicides by
aphyxiation and suffocation. A child in the Moreland household has
emerged as the main suspect _ a revelation that has split family
loyalties between those who want cooperation with police and those
who reject authorities' suspicions. (Lyles, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL _DAYTON, Ohio _The growing number of children accused of
serious crimes is confounding the juvenile justice system in Ohio
and elsewhere. A plan to overhaul Ohio laws governing young
offenders is being drafted and may be presented to the legislature
as early as September. But until new laws replace ones drafted in
the 1960s, Ohio's juvenile justice system is severely limited in
how it can handle young offenders, especially those under age 12

   FLADEM _ Just when it should be gearing up to try to hang on to
the Governor's office in the November elections, Florida's
Democratic Party is in a shambles, victim of an eroding voter base
and a nasty racial controversy that has splintered its traditional
support among blacks. Last week the party's legislative leader
resigned and announced she won't run for reelection, leaving the
party rudderless. Tweaking the party in its misery has been State
Rep. Willie Logan, a black Miami Democrat who was to have been the

   THREATS _ WASHINGTON _ As U.S. military forces moved to prepare
for a possible attack on Iraq last February, President Clinton
received a top-secret briefing at the White House. For much of the
month, he learned, military computer systems around the country had
been penetrated. While the computer commandos eventually proved to
be a couple of California teenagers, the incident helped push
Clinton to announce a new national effort against not only
cyber-attacks but also ``nuclear, but also chemical or biological,
to use disease as a weapon of war.'' (Deans, Cox News Service)

</P>
<P>
   THREATS-COMPUTER _ WASHINGTON _ It starts with an unexplained
power blackout in a major southeastern city. As utility workers
struggle to restore service, telephone systems across the country
become paralyzed. Quickly, the problems spread to oil refineries,
banking and financial systems, communications networks and even the
military. This scenario, outlined in a recent report by the Rand
Corp. for the Defense Department, provides a chilling picture of
how the Information Age has left the United States vulnerable to a
``digital Pearl Harbor.'' (Glass, Cox News Service 1000).
</P>
<P>
   THREATS-GERM _ WASHINGTON _ In the spreading chaos that could
develop if terrorists deliberately started an epidemic of smallpox,
ebola or another deadly disease in America, the country's first
line of defense would be the doctors, nurses, hospital personnel
and public health workers who would care for victims and try to
figure out what was going on. Yet the Clinton administration, which
plans to spend about $1.3 billion next year to defend the country
against chemical or biological warfare attacks, would invest only
about 3 percent of that amount _ $42 million _ to reinforce an
underfunded and poorly equipped network of state and local health
departments. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 1050&AMP;add).

<P>
   THREATS-GERM-POX _ WASHINGTON _ The doctor who headed the World

   TECH-LOBBYING _ WASHINGTON _ Last fall, the high-tech industry
lost a legislative skirmish in its multi-year battle with the FBI
and U.S. spy agencies over who will control encryption of messages
on the Internet. Scared and enraged by a loss that threatened the
growth of their industry's profits, high-tech rivals stopped
dissing each other long enough to chip in more than $5 million to
form a lobbying coaltion called Americans for Computer Privacy and
convince a lot of their customers, suppliers and sympathizers to
sign up. Launched in March, the $5 million lobbying alliance of
more than 90 companies and 40 associations already has won some
early rounds in its fight against the FBI and U.S. spy agencies.

   LOGGING _ Slide Hollow is a place that time forgot, where
streams tumble pure and ancient trees stand tall. This enclave of
forest primeval in the Tennessee mountains is the poster child for
the fight for the last remaining unprotected areas of the South's
national forests. And nowhere in the National Forests is that more
important than in the Southern Appalachians, where more than 6
milion acres in six states comprise the largest block of public
land east of the Rockies. Slide Hollow is also a place where winds
of change are buffeting the Forest Service, slowly and reluctantly
evolving from a timber-cutting overlord to a group of men and women
more concerned about protecting these last vestiges of the nation's
natural heritage. Main story 40 to 50 inches. (Harmon, Atlanta

`THE LUCKY 13' WIN $295.7 MILLION POWERBAL LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ind.)  (th) 
 By PAM BELLUCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTERVILLE, Ohio _ Long before Thursday, they called themselves
``The Lucky 13.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the country was seized by a fevered frenzy of
lottery mania, jamming traffic in towns across the country as rabid
ticket-buyers waited endlessly in line for a fantastically slim
chance at instant riches, they were ponying up a few dollars a
week, figuring that someday their luck would change.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen men of very modest means, assembly-line workers at an
industrial parts factory here just north of Columbus, got the
winning ticket for the biggest American lottery ever, the $295.7
million Powerball lottery jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time to believe we actually hit it,'' said John
Jarrell, one of the 13, a stocky man with a droopy mustache. He and
his wife, Sandy, stood outside their northeast Columbus home
wearing black motorcycle T-shirts and jeans and said one of the
first things they would buy would be a ``hers'' Harley-Davidson to
match the one Jarrell already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from totally excited to scared to death,'' said
Jarrell, 34. ``We're really getting nervous and scared what we're
going to do with all this money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell was the first of the 13 to publicly identify himself
Thursday. The rest of the men had decided to remain anonymous as
long as they could, said a lawyer, Laurence Sturtz, who spoke on
behalf of the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to figure out what they're going to do with the
rest of their lives,'' Sturtz said. ``These are guys who decided
every night whether they were going to work overtime or go home and
be with their family. They don't have to do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 men, ranging in age from 20 to 50, all work in the
machine shop at Automation Tooling Systems in Westerville. They
christened themselves ``The Lucky 13'' years ago when they began
playing the Ohio lottery every week, Sturtz said. At various times,
he said, other workers had wanted to join, but the baker's dozen
kept their club exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the men each kicked in $10 to buy 130 tickets for
Wednesday's drawing, the only time they had played Powerball
besides May's big jackpot. One of them drove 100 miles to a
Speedway gas station and convenience store in Richmond, Ind., the
nearest store selling them, and made copies of the tickets for each
of his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The men opted to take their winnings in a lump-sum payment of
about $161.5 million, said Indiana lottery officials, who still
have to verify the winning ticket. Each expects to collect about
$12.42 million before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Jarrell saw the winning numbers _ 8, 39, 43, 45, 49, and
Powerball 13 _ on television Wednesday night and by midnight, there
was a party at the Jarrell's modest house. Thursday, the couple was
already buying toys for their three children, ages 15, 10 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lucky 13 went to work Thursday, at least to break the
news. Sturtz met with them there Thursday morning to give them some
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we took the ticket to a safety deposit box,'' he said.
``Then we talked about getting a financial adviser, getting legal
advice, writing trusts, and finally how to say `no' to people and
how to hang up the phone.''
</P>

<P>
   The record Powerball lottery stirred everyday people into
pandemonium over a prize that everyone knew was virtually
impossible to win, with 80.1 million possible combinations for the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and New Jersey, scalpers were selling Powerball
tickets for twice the price, and finding desperate buyers. Stores
along state lines in 20 other states and the District of Columbia
had lines of salivating ticket buyers waiting for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Upscale Greenwich, Conn., the first interstate exit and the
first train station over the state line from New York, was so
flooded with fortune seekers that Connecticut Lottery Corp. agreed
to suspend ticket sales there if nobody won the lottery this round.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov. John Rowland said he would reimburse the town for the
police overtime required to keep the hordes from New York and New
Jersey from urinating in public or otherwise running amok.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut sold more tickets than any other state _ $32 million
worth _ but cash registers at all 45,000 outlets selling Powerball
tickets were whirring overtime. All told, 210,800,000 one-dollar
tickets were sold for this drawing, said Charles Strutt, executive
director of the Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs
Powerball.
</P>
<P>
   The blizzard of ticket-buying was so furious that even the
co-creator of Powerball was taken aback. This was not exactly what
he had intended, said Edward Stanek, the commissioner of the Iowa
Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inappropriate for someone to wait in line for three to
eight hours for a game,'' Stanek said. ``It is inappropriate for
someone coming home from work to get caught in a traffic jam trying
to exit the freeway or for someone to suffer heat exhaustion
waiting to buy a one dollar ticket. You would expect those kinds of
lines for a Rolling Stones concert or a sporting event, but the
lottery is supposed to be more consumer friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record jackpot for a single winner, $195 million,
was won just two months ago by a retired electrician, Frank Capaci,
from Streamwood, Ill., a working-class suburb of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected to have another jackpot like this so soon,''
Strutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanek added: ``There are also some philosophical issues that I
certainly don't have the answers to. Is there such a thing of
having too big of a jackpot? This is probably something that should
be a matter of review.''
</P>
<P>
   At Automation Tooling Systems, which employs about 170 people in
an office park just north of Columbus, excited workers high-fived
each other Thursday. Management then ushered the 13 out in a
departing lunch crowd so they could get past the swarm of reporters
and cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a deer-in-the-headlights feeling all around
here today,'' said Barbara Palmer, an account and administration
manager for the company. ``Everyone's either shocked because they
won or shocked because they didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Put out a notice that we're going to need help. I
don't think all of them are going to be coming back.'' &QL;

EXPERIMENT SUPPORTS THEORY THAT LIFE BEGAN IN VOLCANIC
ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea that life on Earth began in the furnace-like
temperatures of a volcanic environment has received support from an
experiment designed to reconstruct the chemical events that may
have led to the first living cells.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, reported in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, shows that peptides, short protein chains, can form
naturally under conditions that might plausibly have existed on the
early Earth some four billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carl R. Woese of the University of Illinois, a
microbiologist who believes that life may have begun at high
temperatures like those found near volcanoes and in the undersea
vents where magma gashes through the ocean floor, described the
result as ``another step in the grand march.''
</P>
<P>
   But a dash of cold water was thrown by Dr. Stanley Miller of the
University of California at San Diego, a leading advocate of the
view that life evolved at temperatures similar to those of today.
</P>
<P>
   The chief author of the experiment, a new voice in discussions
of the origin of life, was Dr. Gunther Wachtershauser. Although his
day job is as a patent lawyer in Munich, Germany, Wachtershauser
(pronounced VEK-terz-hoi-zer) has a degree in organic chemistry,
and his papers have been accepted by leading scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing idea about the origin of life is that prebiotic
chemistry _ the chemical reactions that led to the first living
cell _ probably occurred in some kind of watery environment. As a
graduate student in 1953, Miller provided striking evidence for
this theory by showing that many chemicals used by living cells
will form naturally from a mixture of water and gases subjected to
electrical discharges that mimic lightning.
</P>
<P>
   But it has proved very hard to take Miller's classic experiments
much further. The problem is that a pinch of chemicals in watery
solution do not bump into one another often enough to create the
more complicated molecules of life.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtershauser has developed a quite different concept: that
prebiotic reactions occurred not in solution but on a surface,
probably of some common catalyst like the ores of iron and nickel.
Chemicals bound to a surface would be much more likely to meet and
combine into the more complicated molecules typical of life, he
believes. In other words, prebiotic chemistry started in 2-D, and
only later did the first systems escape into three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   With a government grant and the help of a chemist colleague, Dr.
Claudia Huber of the Munich Technical University, Wachtershauser
has been conducting a series of experiments to test the elements of
his theory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he showed that an active, carbon-based chemistry could
get started in a simple mixture of iron ore, nickel and the
volcanic gases hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide. In their
latest paper, he and Dr. Huber show that in similar conditions,
amino acids, the building blocks of today's proteins, can make the
characteristic link known as a peptide bond that forms the backbone
of proteins. In the conditions of their experiment, chains of two
and three amino acids were assembled in a novel chemical reaction,
they report.
</P>
<P>
   This experiment started with amino acids already in the mixture.
It showed, however, that had amino acids formed under these
conditions, they could go on to form peptide bonds. Amino acids
formed in space are thought to have been delivered to the early
Earth by meteorites and comets. Wachtershauser is also trying to
show how amino acids might have been generated under volcanic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Pace, an expert on early life at the University of
California at Berkeley, said the new reaction showed that it is
relatively easy to make biological compounds from inorganic
chemicals
</P>
<P>
   . ``Wachtershauser's concept of mineral-based chemistry being
able to generate biologically active compounds is wonderful,'' Pace
said. ``I think the milieu of a geothermal environment is far
superior to the sparking bottles of Stanley Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller remains unconvinced by the proponents of a
high-temperature origin of life. He has a forceful objection: Many
of the essential components of living cells are unstable at high
temperatures. In a paper published this month in The Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, he reported that constituents of
DNA lasted as little as 19 days at the temperature of boiling
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conclude that a high-temperature origin of life may be
possible, but it cannot involve adenine, uracil, guanine or
cytosine,'' he wrote with a touch of acerbity, referring to four of
the five main components of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.
</P>
<P>
   In Wachtershauser's theory, however, the nucleic acids are a
late adornment of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the oldest days,'' he said, ``all the molecules of life
participated in the reproduction and inheritance process, and it is
only later that the nucleic acids became enthroned.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also said that carbon monoxide, an important ingredient
of Wachtershauser's experiments, was not known to be produced by
deep-sea vents and that an earlier report to the contrary was based
on an erroneous measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Woese, of the University of Illinois, said he considered this
``a minor drawback compared with the drawbacks of the soup
theory,'' the soup in question being the watery environments in
which Miller seeks the origin of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since all this chemistry that Wachtershauser works with is
novel,'' Woese said, ``we have to cut him a little slack rather
than close the door on it immediately.''

MARKETPLACE: A HEALTH PLAN'S RELAPSING STOCK TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is it time for investors to stick a toe in? The stock
of Oxford Health Plans, the troubled managed-care company, has long
been down and out, after plunging last year when the company told
investors to expect an enormous loss. Now, the stock has again
fallen precipitously, losing nearly half its sharply reduced value
in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It closed on Nasdaq Thursday at $8.4325, after touching a new
low of $7.375 during the previous day's trading.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford's shares traded above $20 earlier this year, buoyed by
takeover speculation and the news that the fund group run by
Michael F. Price, the renowned value investor, had bought the
stock. Texas Pacific, a savvy private investment group led by David
Bonderman, also rode to Oxford's rescue with badly needed capital.
</P>
<P>
   But following that smart money has not led the average investor
to more riches, and the stock does not strike many as a bargain
even at its low, low levels today. Price's group, Franklin Mutual
Advisers, which bought about 4.2 million shares late last year, has
apparently seen the value of its investment dwindle, and it
declined to say whether it still owned that stake.
</P>
<P>
   The other big shareholders, Texas Pacific and Dr. Norman C.
Payson, Oxford's new chief executive, are well insulated from the
effects of any bad news when the company reports its second-quarter
results in mid-August. Under the deal struck by Texas Pacific, the
price of its stake depends on the stock's price next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Payson, who plunked down $10 million of his hard-earned
money for Oxford's stock _ at $15.52 a share _ stands to get
options on 1 million shares based on the price at the time of the
company's annual meeting in late August. His options on 2 million
more shares can be exercised at $15.52.
</P>
<P>
   These investors have an advantage over someone who might wade in
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a better piece of paper,'' said Larry Feinberg of
Oracle Partners, a hedge fund that specializes in health care and
who is not buying the stock.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be driving the share price down in recent days is
the growing anxiety of investors over the company's financial
results, which are expected during the week of Aug. 10. Oxford is
keeping mum, and some stock analysts fear a sizable loss _ at least
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it's anyone's guess. ``Given Oxford's lack of communication
with the investment community, it is difficult, if not impossible,
to form realistic earnings expectations,'' Roberta L. Walter, a
Merrill Lynch analyst, recently said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also concerned about the consequences of the
company's turnaround plan, outlined in a letter sent to doctors
last week. In the letter, Payson warned that the health care
provider, which is still losing money, would be cutting fees to
doctors and raising premiums to return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Frazier, an analyst with Bear Stearns, like most of his
brethren on Wall Street, is not recommending the stock. ``Oxford is
not going to be the Oxford of old and the Oxford for everyone,'' he
aid.
</P>
<P>
   The health care provider's popularity with patients _ it still
has more than 2 million customers _ has been built on the promise
of an affordable health plan that allows consumers to go to a
doctor of their choice. No one knows if the plan will remain a
crowd-pleaser if premiums go up sharply or if doctors, unhappy with
lower fees, start leaving the network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the share price hitting new lows, even investors with a
reputation for sniffing out bargains look like daredevils.
</P>
<P>
   According to Technimetrics, a New York investor-relations
research company that studies quarterly filings of stock ownership,
the Franklin fund group picked up its Oxford shares late last year,
when they were trading in the mid-teen's or higher. Next month,
investors will find out if Franklin still owned the shares at the
end of June. If Franklin is selling now, it will not be disclosed
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Such big questions leave other buyers of the common shares with
little to go on. Even if they are not concerned with how much
Oxford may have lost for the quarter, information is scant about
the company's progress in sorting out the extensive systems
problems that caused it to lose track of its costs. Oxford may
still not know how much it costs to deliver care, making it
difficult to decide how much to charge its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Additional losses, especially if they are sizable, would also
eat into capital, a danger for a company that must adhere to
certain state requirements. ``If losses persist,'' Ms. Walter of
Merrill Lynch said, ``Oxford might have to raise additional capital
to meet statutory reserve requirements,'' further diluting existing
shares. The company secured $710 million in financing earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   One hope, of course, is that the company will prove to be an
attractive takeover candidate for a competitor wanting a strong
market position in the New York area. But it is unclear just how
many members Oxford will have once the dust settles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the franchise is predicated on an underpriced business, how
good is the franchise?'' wondered one analyst, who spoke in
exchange for anonymity. Just as investors seem to be holding off,
potential acquirers might want to wait until Oxford's business
position is clearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the next three months that will change the
fate of the stock,'' said Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein, who thinks that the company could be a great
value for an investor with the patience to stick it out for a year
or two.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Oxford's stock has hit bottom, investors may want to
wait until its earnings come out before they go fishing. The water
looks awfully muddy right now, and some investors have better bait.

 BC- FALCONS-NOTES31-COX &HT;    For some, the answer to injury is play hurt
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Falcons' list of walking wounded didn't
grow any shorter Thursday as three players missed the morning
practice and four missed the afternoon session on the seventh day
of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Being injured means different things for different players.
</P>
<P>
   For backup guard Scott Adams, who has been with eight teams in
eight years, including the Falcons twice, it means unless your leg
has fallen off, you practice. The former Georgia standout has a
strained hamstring and a badly sprained ankle. But he has missed no
time, hobbling through practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like me, who's always been concerned just with making
the team ... hey, I'm going to be out there,'' said Adams, who has
been to 10 training camps on rosters in Dallas, Atlanta, Minnesota,
New Orleans, Chicago, Tampa Bay, Denver and Atlanta again. ``Maybe
if you're an All-Pro you don't take any chances. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, that means convincing the medical or training staff
you're all right when you're really not. ``I've told my share of
lies, but none recently,'' said Adams, who also played for the
Barcelona Dragons of the World League in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran cornerback Randy Fuller, who has missed six straight
practices _ or half of camp _ also has a badly sprained ankle. But
his situation is different from Adams'. If Fuller goes out and
tries to play, it can only do harm for him to stumble around as
receiver blow past. Then again, if the graduate of Spencer High in
Columbus doesn't come back soon and show what he can do, that won't
help either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting very antsy,'' said Fuller, a four-year veteran who
played the last three seasons in Pittsburgh. ``It hurts me because
this is the most crucial point in training camp ... when you're
learning all the defenses. Every day I miss, I fall further behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only as good as your last play, and ... mine was in
Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will practice at 9 this morning, and after meetings
this afternoon, fly to Jacksonville for Saturday's 8:15 and 2:15
scrimmage-practices. The team will be off Sunday, other than
evening meetings, and practice twice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon was the hottest yet: 92 degrees with 60
percent humidity, producing a heat index between 100 and 105
degrees. It was 93 one afternoon last week, but the humidity was
below 50 percent. Players were pleased there was no conditioning
after the afternoon practice, a first this camp, but most of them
had lifting scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler _ Worked all day with the first unit, and threw
his share of drills. Connected of 5-of-6 passes in the hurry-up
drill at the end of two-hour afternoon practice with Tony Martin,
Terance Mathis and Todd Kinchen as receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani _ Ditto, except with the second unit. Threw better
than a day earlier, but was 0-for-3 in hurry-up drill with Mercury
Hayes, Jammi German and Kevin Thornal as receivers. Also had
placement duties with kickers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg _ Ditto, but with third unit, no hurry-up drill.
Threw an interception (Jessie Tuggle) in the afternoon when there
was no receiver within 10 yards in 11-on-11s. Also had placement
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brennan _ Used in drills all day, and then he got one snap
with the No. 1 unit in the 11-on-11s near the end of the afternoon
practice. His job was to throw an interception. He missed when a
cornerback went the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad, and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: In afternoon 11-on-11s (minus tackling), while the
third-string offense was going against the No. 3 defense,
linebackers Ben Talley and Ruffin Hamilton sniffed out a screen
pass to Ken Oxendine and arrived in the backfield at the same time
as the pass from DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: In the hurry-up drill at the end of afternoon practice,
Graziani threw deep down the right sideline to German, who was in
double coverage. It didn't matter, though, because German broke off
the route.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: Chandler let a pass get away in the morning 11-on-11s, and
it went straight to defensive end Lester Archambeau, who found
himself all alone in rare pass coverage. Ugly II: Archambeau
dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   What they said
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie's popping it in the slot every time. It's really nice
to have a good, solid snap over and over.'' _ Chandler, on the
center-quarterback exchange between converted guard Robbie Tobeck
and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons water their three practice fields with giant
sprinklers, the water is drawn from the lake/pond next to
headquarters. It takes about 80,000 gallons each time, and the
water stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Home cooking
</P>
<P>
   Undrafted free agent receiver Corey Allen of Georgia doesn't get
a lot of chances to show his stuff, but got more than usual
Thursday. In the afternoon practice, he got open on a flag route
deep down the middle, catching a perfect pass from Graziani. Later,
in 11-on-11s, he ran a nice curl route of about 12 yards, caught
the ball, and fumbled it away.
</P>
<P>
   Run over him, and smile
</P>
<P>
   With receivers coach Rennie Simmons and defensive backs coach
Ron Meeks tutoring and head coach Dan Reeves observing, there was a
drill in the morning that had receivers trying to get off the line
of scrimmage, and DBs trying to jam them. There were two lines at
once, causing Reeves to tell them to alternate, and ``wait until
the (video) camera is on you.'' The Falcons videotape nearly every
aspect of practice, most of it from one of two tall, portable,
telescoping towers. Meaning: Even if coaches didn't see players
mess up on the field, they'll probably catch it later.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 1-on-1 drills where defensive linemen go against
offensive linemen, Thursday afternoon it was 2-on-2, and sometimes
2-on-3 (offensive linemen) as defenders occasionally stunted. ...
Shawn Swayda and Esera Tuaolo, who've been working at backup right
and left defensive tackle, respectively, switched for some reps in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Fumble!
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons spend 5-10 minutes in almost every practice working
on turnovers, doing different drills each day. Thursday morning,
running backs worked on protecting the ball as they tried to strip
each other from behind, wide receivers worked on recovering fumbles
on the run, and offensive linemen worked on recovering fumbles,
period. Defensive backs worked on recovering onsides kicks,
linebackers worked on recovering fumbles before they squirted out
of bounds (after being rolled toward the sideline by LB coach Don
Blackmon), and the defensive line worked on recovering fumbles.
Most days, they do a drill where DBs run up behind WRs and try to
strip the ball.

 &HT;    Wohlers won't go to minors
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Mark Wohlers has no interest in returning to
Richmond. If the Braves were hoping the struggling reliever might
retreat to Class AAA for another optional assignment, they better
get another plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying here,'' Wohlers said after Thursday's game. ``Even
if I strike out every hitter I face, it's got to be at the
big-league level. I'm aware of the circumstances. I understand my
playoff spot on the roster is in jeopardy. But if I got down there
and pitched great, then come back here and have two bad outings,
I'm in jeopardy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching at AAA is irrelevant. That's how I feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the club had not formally suggested that Wohlers take
another assignment _ he was away from the team for 22 games in June
and July _ officials were hopeful he might be persuaded to return
to Richmond, based on his struggles since returning. In his six
appearances since being recalled, Wohlers has given up 13 runs on
five hits and 14 walks in just 3 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had discussed the matter with manager Bobby Cox,
Wohlers replied: ``You know what? The last time, I got in a whole
lot of trouble when I had a conversation with Bobby. If he wants to
speak about it, I hope he feels free to talk about it. But I'm just
trying to make things less chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Wohlers' situation would be discussed in his meeting
with general manager John Schuerholz this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do what's best for him,'' Cox said. ``But I also
have to do what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to Cortes
</P>
<P>
   Last season, David Cortes was the talk of the low end of the
Braves' farm system, saving 23 games and striking out 55 in 48
appearances as he jumped from Class A Macon to Class A Durham to
Class AA Greenville. In the first two months of the season, when
the Atlanta bullpen was teetering, the club considered calling up
Cortes from Class AAA Richmond, where the 24-year-old right-hander
began the season.
</P>
<P>
   But he never got his chance because of shoulder trouble that put
him on the DL. And now he is gone, dealt to Colorado, along with
left-handed pitcher Mike Porzio (3-2, 2.51 ERA, two saves in 26
games) of Class A Danville (Carolina League).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you've got to give something to get something,'' Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cortes' numbers were not as strong at Richmond, but he was still
a strong prospect in a system pushed for relievers. He was 3-3 with
17 saves and a 2.82 ERA in 29 appearances. The International League
was hitting .227 against him, and he had struck out 46 in 44 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   No maximum John
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz is not in a suspendable mood. Still incredulous the
day after he was ejected by rookie umpire Hunter Wendelstedt when
the ump stepped on his foot, Smoltz said he would fight any fine or
suspension the National League might send down. He remains adamant
that Wendelstedt mishandled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing the replay, I don't think there's any
questionable doubt at all,'' he said.

 &HT;    It's Heritage time again
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As a continuation of last year's elaborate Jackie
Robinson celebration, the Atlanta Braves will recognize cultural
diversity in baseball in the second annual ``Heritage Salute'' this
weekend at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will wear the uniforms of the 1940 Atlanta Black
Crackers of the Negro League in their games Saturday and Sunday
against the St. Louis Cardinals, who will wear the gear of the 1928
St. Louis Stars of the Negro League.
</P>
<P>
   Video memories from Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Dennis Martinez and
Juan Marichal, among many others, will be featured during the
games. There also will be a trivia contest on African-American and
Hispanic players.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there will be on-field ceremonies with the likes
of Jackie Robinson's daughter, Sharon Robinson, and former Negro
League players Joe Black and Buck O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a Major League Baseball/Negro League exhibit will be on
display in the Hank Aaron Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the quality of the events, and we're
excited about continuing to acknowledge these players who have
given so much to the game,'' said Dexter Santos, the Braves'
director of community relations and fan development.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have scheduled a Heritage Festival for Saturday
afternoon at Grant Park for 3,000 area youths, who also will be
invited to attend Sunday's game and participate in a pregame
parade, led by the New Orleans-based band Coolbone.

 &HT;    Nagano runner-up still achieving
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Figure skater Michelle Kwan is so popular that
10 days after her ``Mulan'' special on ice aired last month on ABC,
the network squeezed it back into the prime-time schedule on short
notice.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be shown yet again Saturday morning _ even the
``Seinfeld'' finale got only two airings _ and then Kwan will
appear live that night on TBS in the Goodwill Games. ``When I was
13, people told me I would be burned out by the time I was 18, but
here I am,'' said Kwan, who celebrated her 18th birthday on July 7
with a surprise party during a 59-city, 3 1/2-month skating tour.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a silver lining in being Olympic runner-up, Kwan has
found it. And she doesn't even consider her loss to Tara Lipinski
at the 1998 Olympics a dark cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things I could've done better, maybe,'' said
Kwan, who admitted to being overwhelmed by all of the fuss in
Nagano. But she added, ``I don't feel depressed about it. I'm proud
of what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan saw room for improvement in her speed and jumps as she
reviewed the Olympic videotape before the Goodwill Games, where
she's skating the same programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a smile on my face while I was watching it,'' Kwan said.
``At the end of my program (in Nagano), I couldn't believe I had
done it. ... But when I was watching it, I was saying to myself,
'Push Michelle, push. You can do it.' I needed a little more oomph
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The public couldn't have been more moved by Kwan's graciousness
in defeat. She has received thousands of letters, and a soap
endorsement fit in perfectly with her squeaky-clean image.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one lady, probably in her 70s, wrote that she had some
kind of disease and she was holding on for me until 2002,'' Kwan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan is determined to compete that year in the Salt Lake City
Olympics, although she says that she misses skating against
Lipinski, who was turning pro while Kwan was winning her second
world title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much what's out there. It's what I want inside. I
love competing. I love the challenge. That's what keeps me going. I
don't feel that I'll be that old, either. 21? I mean, please,'' she
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan says that staying eligible for the Olympics will allow more
people to see her skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like to share my skating with them and put them into
a trance, sort of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the perception that the Olympic silver medalist has
gotten more attention than the gold medalist, she pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I skate, it's always good sportsmanship,'' said Kwan, the
most introspective female skater of this decade. ``I believe that
competition's only a competition, and it only goes so far. If
things don't go your way, you just have to keep your head up high
and keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, she conceded, ``I thought if I didn't
win, my life would be over.''
</P>
<P>
   And now? ``The gold medal may be great, but I feel that there's
more to accomplish than just the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants to begin practicing her triple-triple combinations,
now that her fractured toe has stopped hurting. And then there is
``landing that triple axel I've been talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, Frank Carroll, said she's a young lady in charge of
her life. One day, he said, she was in ``a little bit of a funk''
and wasn't skating well. He offered to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to say and do nothing,'' Kwan told him. ``This
isn't your problem; this is my problem. Give me two or three
minutes and I'll be over it, and we'll be fine, but I'm the one who
has to snap out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes passed, Carroll said, ``And she was marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan's maturation also is visible in her glamorous look. She
appears at news conferences immaculately dressed, usually in black
linen or leather.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``Mulan'' special gave her the opportunity to do love scenes
with French heartthrob Philippe Candeloro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of retakes,'' she said. ``We'd have to be very
serious and in love. ... You know how we're just goofballs. We
looked into each other's eyes and, with the camera right next to
us, we'd bust out laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Games, Kwan will stay in New York City with her
sister, Karen, who's interning with designer Vera Wang. She'll
shop, see some Broadway shows and study for her final exams in
August before winging off to Hawaii. She will put off applying to
colleges until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   She's considered Harvard, but that would mean leaving Carroll
and Lake Arrowhead, Calif., where she will begin work soon on next
season's skating programs.
</P>
<P>
   And if she can't compete at the standard she has set for
herself? Kwan may skip next year's national and world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come out,'' she said, ``having the same old
Michelle.

 &HT;    Poll favors Gators over Tennessee
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Tennessee football fans are a proud bunch and
over the past five seasons they have good reason to be:
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Tennessee has posted a 50-11 record. Only one school
in the SEC has won more games _ Florida with 55.
</P>
<P>
   In that same span, Tennessee has averaged 10 wins per year. Only
Florida has been better, averaging 11 wins.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five seasons, Tennessee is 33-7 in SEC games.
Florida is 36-4 with four SEC titles to Tennessee's one.
</P>
<P>
   Are we detecting a pattern here? Tennessee fans have had a great
deal to celebrate lately, including the Vols' 1997 SEC
championship, being ranked in the Top 10 for 35 of the last 36
polls and the coming and going of the great Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who bleed Big Orange, who make the righteous trek
to Neyland Stadium on Saturdays each fall, there is something
missing. In all that success, in all that football glory, there
still is no win over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has won five straight over the Volunteers, and on
Thursday the Gators were picked to win the SEC championship again,
in a poll of sportswriters and broadcasters. Those same voters, by
a 41-4 vote, chose Florida over Tennessee in the league's Eastern
Division. In other words, few people here think the Vols will win
when they host Florida at Neyland Stadium in a nationally televised
(8 p.m., CBS) game on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   It is a theme that became familiar to coach Phillip Fulmer as he
toured the Tennessee booster clubs this spring. It was said in many
different ways, but the message was the same: ``Coach, we love you,
and we're glad you won the SEC. But when are we finally going to
beat Florida?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it bothers me,'' Fulmer said. ``Everybody has their own
goals and their own ego. We've accomplished an awful lot of good
things. But (beating Florida is) a hump we haven't gotten over
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee should feel good about its chances on Sept. 19.
Despite the loss of Manning, the Vols are expected to be very good
on offense again. The defense has a few holes to fill, but there is
plenty of talent. And they get to play at home before 107,000 fans,
the largest crowd in college football.
</P>
<P>
   But the size of Thursday's vote in favor of Florida spoke
volumes about who has the psychological edge in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for Tennessee is that beating Florida has
become a major cause for celebration. LSU's fans stormed the field
and tore down the goalposts. Georgia, which beat the Gators in
November after seven straight losses, put out a video. Goodness
knows what Tennessee's fans will do if Florida falls in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice compliment watching how those teams react after
beating us,'' Florida coach Steve Spurrier said. ``But as I recall,
both of those teams lost their next game. Shoot, we like being up
there and having folks take their shot. That's what makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's team has taken its cue from Spurrier on the Tennessee
game. They remain confident without being overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won them all lately, but it's always a dogfight,'' said
Terry Jackson, Florida's senior running back. ``We expect the same
up there.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the two teams will take different routes to the game.
Florida will play The Citadel and Northeast Louisiana in what
Spurrier called a couple of ``warm-up'' games. Tennessee, on the
other hand, opens Sept. 5 at Syracuse in what will be a noisy and
difficult task. The Vols take the next week off and then entertain
the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's losing streak, plus the fact that the Vols will be
without Manning, who never beat Florida, will make for an
intriguing prime-time event.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past few years, it was always the Peyton Manning game.
Everybody wondered if he could beat us,'' Florida defensive end
Jevon Kearse said. ``Now, they have another group of guys who are
ready to take their shot. It could be interesting.''

<P>
   MASTIGOUCHE, QUEBEC _ Stripped to the waist, wearing long braids
and deerskin moccasins, Pierce Brosnan is no James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan, who recently portrayed that Hollywood staple, Agent
007, in ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' has come to this wilderness camp
two hours north of Montreal to shoot one of the feature films that
is turning Canada into Hollywood North.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Grey Owl, the Indian trapper turned celebrity
conservationist, in Lord Richard Attenborough's coming film of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by a lucrative mix of tax credits, enthusiastic, less
costly local crews and a depressed Canadian dollar, now worth about
68 U.S. cents, foreign investment has turned the Canadian film and
television industry into one of the busiest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Added to these financial incentives, a number of bilateral
treaties make Canadian co-productions a convenient way to sidestep
local quotas on imported films and television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of treaties with some 40 countries, notably
excluding the United States, foreign co-productions also qualify
for a range of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   A French-Canadian production, for example, is considered French
in France and Canadian in Canada, gaining access to government
subsidies in both countries and bypassing restrictions on imported
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, the Canadian government sweetened production deals
still further, giving tax credits amounting to 11 percent of labor
costs. This is on top of similar credits offered by the various
provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is now the third busiest production center in the world,
after Los Angeles and New York, according to industry sources.
Vancouver, where ``The X-Files'' and other American television
series are shot, is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario alone, a third of film and television programs
generated last year _ 56 out of 161 _ were foreign productions,
according to the Ontario Film Development Corp. Other provinces
recorded a similar proportion of foreign to domestic production.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, total production amounted to $1.25 billion in the
three most active provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec,
according to statistics compiled by provincial film authorities, a
rise of $250 million over 1996 figures.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment accounted for $540 million, or slightly less
than half the 1997 total production budgets within the three
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and tiny Prince Edward Island
are getting in on the act, with a rising number of feature films
and made-for-TV movies being shot in these eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   All told, some 65,000 people work in film and television
production in Canada, according to the local film boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers save around 15 percent making a film in Canada over
making the same film in the U.S.,'' said Jake Eberts, a veteran
Canadian producer whose film credits include ``Gandhi,'' ``A River
Runs Through It'' and ``Grey Owl.''
</P>
<P>
   As a British-Canadian co-production, the Attenborough-Brosnan
film qualifies for tax breaks in both countries, amounting to
around $5 million to $6 million of the $30 million budget,
according to Eberts.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies for television productions are even higher, as much as
a third of production costs.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Paddington Bear,'' an animated series co-produced by the
Canadian company Cinar and the French television network TF1, 20
percent of the $9.3 million budget comes from Canadian subsidies
and a further 10 percent from French subsidies, according to Ronald
Weinberg, president and chief operating officer of Cinar. The
proportions reflect the amount spent on production in the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eberts and other filmmakers say they also appreciate the
chameleon quality of Canadian locations, with parts of Montreal
able to double for Liverpool in the 1930s and parts of Quebec City
standing in for a European city in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen Paris a million times, London a gazillion times,
but we haven't seen Quebec that often,'' Eberts said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others point to the ready availability of experienced
crew members as another advantage to Canada. ``The crews are also
very good at doing things with not very much money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian director Norman Jewison, who filmed ``Agnes of
God,'' ``Moonstruck'' and other films largely in Ontario, said that
there had been a quantum leap in film production in Canada in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost impossible to make a feature film in Canada 20
years ago,'' Jewison said. He was one of the first to set up shop
in Toronto in 1978, converting an abandoned warehouse into a sound
stage and editing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Toronto is teeming with film activity, with the Canadian
Film Center celebrating its 10th anniversary promoting local
productions and talent and at least four studios churning out
special effects and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Animators graduating from Sheridan College in Toronto are being
snapped up by Walt Disney Co., Warner Brothers and other Hollywood
companies, according to Jewison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian talent that used to automatically head for Los
Angeles and New York is staying in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by this growing pool of skills, even Hollywood
productions are relying on Canadian filmmakers.
</P>

Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, have achieved international
recognition.

   Still, despite the surge in Canadian production, films in
Canadian cinemas are overwhelmingly American. Only 1 percent of
films shown in English-speaking provinces and 3 percent in
French-speaking provinces are Canadian, King said. &QL;

WOMAN WOUNDED AT CAPITOL SHOOTOUT PRAISES SLAIN OFFICERS

 By TIM WEINER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angela Dickerson, who was wounded in last week's
shootings at the Capitol, said Thursday that she would carry no
deep scars, except perhaps emotional ones.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dickerson, who turned 24 Thursday, appeared astonishingly
sound and serene for someone who was hit in the shoulder by a
.38-caliber bullet and wounded in the face by a bullet fragment six
days ago. But beneath the surface, she said, the shootings left her
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more paranoid than I was before,'' she said. ``You never
know who's going to have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would be able to identify the gunman when called as
a witness in the case. But precisely because she will be a witness,
her lawyer limited what she could say Thursday about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dickerson had no trouble describing what she felt as the
Capitol's corridors exploded with gunfire: ``It was extremely
terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was seeing some of the sights of Washington for the
first time last Friday. ``I experienced a lot of `firsts,' '' she
said. ``Not only was it my first time to the Capitol, it was my
first time being shot.''
</P>
<P>
   One bullet passed cleanly through her shoulder, leaving only a
small scar. ``The bullet from my shoulder entered and exited, so
there was no need for surgery; just stitches to help the wound heal
with minimal scarring,'' Mrs. Dickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether that bullet was fired by Russell Weston
Jr., 41, who is charged in the attack, or by John Gibson, a
detective on the Capitol Police who was guarding the office of Rep.
Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, and was one of two
police officers killed in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   A fragment from a second bullet lodged just below Mrs.
Dickerson's right eye. A fraction of an inch of difference would
have cost her the vision in that eye, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dickerson expressed concern for Weston's family, and a
deeper emotion for the slain officers, Jacob Chestnut, 58, and
Gibson, 42, and their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to their families and friends for having to
experience such a terrible tragedy,'' she said at a news conference
in her lawyer's office. ``If Officer Chestnut and Special Agent
Gibson could hear me now, I'd tell them: `Thank you for doing such
a wonderful job and for protecting and saving so many lives. I only
wish that there were three surviving victims instead of me. May God
bless you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She had high praise for the ambulance workers and emergency
medical personnel, and for the staff at George Washington Hospital,
where she was treated. And she said she had received ``a ton of
flowers'' at her home, as well as a telephone call from President
Clinton on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dickerson, a decorator for Ethan Allen, and her husband,
Stephen, a sales manager for Sears, Roebuck and Co., live in
Chantilly, Va., a suburb of Washington. She said she would be back
to work next week.

   MASTIGOUCHE, QUEBEC _ Stripped to the waist, wearing long braids
and deerskin moccasins, Pierce Brosnan is no James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan, who recently portrayed that Hollywood staple, Agent
007, in ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' has come to this wilderness camp
two hours north of Montreal to shoot one of the feature films that
is turning Canada into Hollywood North.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Grey Owl, the Indian trapper turned celebrity
conservationist, in Lord Richard Attenborough's coming film of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by a lucrative mix of tax credits, enthusiastic, less
costly local crews and a depressed Canadian dollar, now worth about
68 U.S. cents, foreign investment has turned the Canadian film and
television industry into one of the busiest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Added to these financial incentives, a number of bilateral
treaties make Canadian co-productions a convenient way to sidestep
local quotas on imported films and television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of treaties with some 40 countries, notably
excluding the United States, foreign co-productions also qualify
for a range of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   A French-Canadian production, for example, is considered French
in France and Canadian in Canada, gaining access to government
subsidies in both countries and bypassing restrictions on imported
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, the Canadian government sweetened production deals
still further, giving tax credits amounting to 11 percent of labor
costs. This is on top of similar credits offered by the various
provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is now the third busiest production center in the world,
after Los Angeles and New York, according to industry sources.
Vancouver, where ``The X-Files'' and other American television
series are shot, is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario alone, a third of film and television programs
generated last year _ 56 out of 161 _ were foreign productions,
according to the Ontario Film Development Corp. Other provinces
recorded a similar proportion of foreign to domestic production.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, total production amounted to $1.25 billion in the
three most active provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec,
according to statistics compiled by provincial film authorities, a
rise of $250 million over 1996 figures.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment accounted for $540 million, or slightly less
than half the 1997 total production budgets within the three
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and tiny Prince Edward Island
are getting in on the act, with a rising number of feature films
and made-for-TV movies being shot in these eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   All told, some 65,000 people work in film and television
production in Canada, according to the local film boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers save around 15 percent making a film in Canada over
making the same film in the U.S.,'' said Jake Eberts, a veteran
Canadian producer whose film credits include ``Gandhi,'' ``A River
Runs Through It'' and ``Grey Owl.''
</P>
<P>
   As a British-Canadian co-production, the Attenborough-Brosnan
film qualifies for tax breaks in both countries, amounting to
around $5 million to $6 million of the $30 million budget,
according to Eberts.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies for television productions are even higher, as much as
a third of production costs.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Paddington Bear,'' an animated series co-produced by the
Canadian company Cinar and the French television network TF1, 20
percent of the $9.3 million budget comes from Canadian subsidies
and a further 10 percent from French subsidies, according to Ronald
Weinberg, president and chief operating officer of Cinar. The
proportions reflect the amount spent on production in the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eberts and other filmmakers say they also appreciate the
chameleon quality of Canadian locations, with parts of Montreal
able to double for Liverpool in the 1930s and parts of Quebec City
standing in for a European city in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen Paris a million times, London a gazillion times,
but we haven't seen Quebec that often,'' Eberts said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others point to the ready availability of experienced
crew members as another advantage to Canada. ``The crews are also
very good at doing things with not very much money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian director Norman Jewison, who filmed ``Agnes of
God,'' ``Moonstruck'' and other films largely in Ontario, said that
there had been a quantum leap in film production in Canada in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost impossible to make a feature film in Canada 20
years ago,'' Jewison said. He was one of the first to set up shop
in Toronto in 1978, converting an abandoned warehouse into a sound
stage and editing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Toronto is teeming with film activity, with the Canadian
Film Center celebrating its 10th anniversary promoting local
productions and talent and at least four studios churning out
special effects and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Animators graduating from Sheridan College in Toronto are being
snapped up by Walt Disney Co., Warner Brothers and other Hollywood
companies, according to Jewison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian talent that used to automatically head for Los
Angeles and New York is staying in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by this growing pool of skills, even Hollywood
productions are relying on Canadian filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to suffer from the `coffee-boy syndrome,' where the
Americans brought in everyone but go-fers to fetch coffee,'' said
Alan King, president of the Directors Guild of Canada. Now programs
like ``The X-Files'' hire Canadian directors, some of whom, such as
Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, have achieved international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the surge in Canadian production, films in
Canadian cinemas are overwhelmingly American. Only 1 percent of
films shown in English-speaking provinces and 3 percent in
French-speaking provinces are Canadian, King said. &QL;

 c.1998 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ They are probably the youngest self-made millionaires
in the Middle East: the four Israelis who founded Mirabilis Ltd.,
then sold the company and its ICQ software in June to America
Online Inc. for $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arik Vardi, Amnon Amir, Yair Goldfinger, and Sefi Vigiser, who
met after they had served their compulsory three years in the
Israeli Army, have distributed ICQ free on the Internet since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They will receive additional payments of as much as $120 million
from AOL starting in three years, provided that certain milestones
are met.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Mirabilis provides the latest evidence that
Israel is becoming a force in the computer industry. High-tech
exports accounted for more than a third of overall Israeli exports
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ICQ (I Seek You) enables subscribers dialing into the Internet
to alert friends and acquaintances who are on-line at the same
time. Users who find each other using the program can then exchange
typed messages in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The program now has more than 12 million subscribers _ with
thousands of chat groups set up by users themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICQ users are very loyal, almost like fans of a pop group or
supporters of a football club,'' said Yossi Vardi, chief executive
of Mirabilis and father of one of the founders. ``And they bring
their friends. It's incredible _ we're getting a million new users
every 19 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mirabilis founders took a gamble when the decided to give
away their program. ``Getting the market share was the most
important thing,'' said Vardi. ``Our long-term strategy was to
gravitate users to ICQ. We had 10 different scenarios in our head
as to how the asset would be converted into value.''
</P>
<P>
   Until AOL bought the company, it had raised $3 million through
private issues. AOL's offer included the contractual promise _
important to its founders _ to keep the company in Israel, and
retain all of its 70 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, a country of 5.8 million, has sprouted hundreds of
high-tech companies that are producing cutting-edge
Internet-related technology.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has about 4,000 high-tech firms, 70 of which trade of
Wall Street with a combined market capitalization of more than $22
billion, according to the Israeli Export Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech explosion was partly fueled by the influx of
thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the early
1990s. Many of them were trained in computer programming and now
serve as the backbone of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Another push came, ironically, from the demise of the defense
industry in Israel, which forced employees of government-run firms
into the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the advanced military systems Israel uses creates a
youthful, energetic high-tech work force straight out of the army.
The three founders of another success story, GEO-Interactive, met
in the Israeli Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IDF was, in a way, our university,'' said Eli Reifman, 28,
the vice president of marketing and sales at GEO-Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes Emblaze software, which delivers video,
animation, and sound over the Internet in real time. The software
compresses information so that it is able to move more quickly over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of GEO-Interactive raised money by borrowing
through credit cards and taking loans from banks _ asking their
parents to sign guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, GEO-Interactive made an initial public offering
on the Alternative Investment Market in London.
</P>
<P>
   The GEO-INteractive founders raised their money by themselves,
but many Israeli high-tech companies have had help from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli governments have poured money into start-ups,
assisting them with funds specifically for marketing and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Tick, an entrepreneur from Jerusalem, quit his job to take
a gamble on his idea _ a ``virtual newspaper'' that delivers an
electronic version of print publications directly to the user's PC.
Tick wanted to produce a program that would make it look like the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Tick's start-up company, Zebra Pushware
Solutions, produced the Infopager, which has generated interest
among newspapers and magazines all over the world, and now has a
distribution agreement with International Business Machines Corp.
(IBM).
</P>
<P>
   The stalled Mideast peace process does not seem to have had much
of a negative effect on Israel's nascent high-tech industry.
``Fortunately, people still invest here,'' Tick said.
</P>
<P>
   That is borne out by the figures. In 1997, high-tech exports
brought in $6 billion, or 34 percent of overall exports, figures
from the Israeli Export Institute show. &QL;

   TEL AVIV _ They are probably the youngest self-made millionaires
in the Middle East: the four Israelis who founded Mirabilis Ltd.,
then sold the company and its ICQ software in June to America
Online Inc. for $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arik Vardi, Amnon Amir, Yair Goldfinger, and Sefi Vigiser, who
met after they had served their compulsory three years in the
Israeli Army, have distributed ICQ free on the Internet since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They will receive additional payments of as much as $120 million
from AOL starting in three years, provided that certain milestones
are met.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Mirabilis provides the latest evidence that
Israel is becoming a force in the computer industry. High-tech
exports accounted for more than a third of overall Israeli exports
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ICQ (I Seek You) enables subscribers dialing into the Internet
to alert friends and acquaintances who are on-line at the same
time. Users who find each other using the program can then exchange
typed messages in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The program now has more than 12 million subscribers _ with
thousands of chat groups set up by users themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICQ users are very loyal, almost like fans of a pop group or
supporters of a football club,'' said Yossi Vardi, chief executive
of Mirabilis and father of one of the founders. ``And they bring
their friends. It's incredible _ we're getting a million new users
every 19 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mirabilis founders took a gamble when the decided to give
away their program. ``Getting the market share was the most
important thing,'' said Vardi. ``Our long-term strategy was to
gravitate users to ICQ. We had 10 different scenarios in our head
as to how the asset would be converted into value.''
</P>
<P>
   Until AOL bought the company, it had raised $3 million through
private issues. AOL's offer included the contractual promise _
important to its founders _ to keep the company in Israel, and
retain all of its 70 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, a country of 5.8 million, has sprouted hundreds of
high-tech companies that are producing cutting-edge
Internet-related technology.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has about 4,000 high-tech firms, 70 of which trade of
Wall Street with a combined market capitalization of more than $22
billion, according to the Israeli Export Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech explosion was partly fueled by the influx of
thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the early
1990s. Many of them were trained in computer programming and now
serve as the backbone of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Another push came, ironically, from the demise of the defense
industry in Israel, which forced employees of government-run firms
into the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the advanced military systems Israel uses creates a
youthful, energetic high-tech work force straight out of the army.
The three founders of another success story, GEO-Interactive, met
in the Israeli Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IDF was, in a way, our university,'' said Eli Reifman, 28,
the vice president of marketing and sales at GEO-Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes Emblaze software, which delivers video,
animation, and sound over the Internet in real time. The software
compresses information so that it is able to move more quickly over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of GEO-Interactive raised money by borrowing
through credit cards and taking loans from banks _ asking their
parents to sign guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, GEO-Interactive made an initial public offering
on the Alternative Investment Market in London.
</P>
<P>
   The GEO-INteractive founders raised their money by themselves,
but many Israeli high-tech companies have had help from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli governments have poured money into start-ups,
assisting them with funds specifically for marketing and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Tick, an entrepreneur from Jerusalem, quit his job to take
a gamble on his idea _ a ``virtual newspaper'' that delivers an
electronic version of print publications directly to the user's PC.
Tick wanted to produce a program that would make it look like the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Tick's start-up company, Zebra Pushware
Solutions, produced the Infopager, which has generated interest
among newspapers and magazines all over the world, and now has a
distribution agreement with International Business Machines Corp.
(IBM).
</P>
<P>
   The stalled Mideast peace process does not seem to have had much
of a negative effect on Israel's nascent high-tech industry.
``Fortunately, people still invest here,'' Tick said.
</P>
<P>
   That is borne out by the figures. In 1997, high-tech exports
brought in $6 billion, or 34 percent of overall exports, figures
from the Israeli Export Institute show. &QL;

<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith, a singing piano player and chatty radio disk
jockey who created Howdy Doody and then teamed up with the puppet
on one of early television's most enduring children's shows, died
Thursday at a hospital in Hendersonville, N.C. The cause was
cancer, said his family. Smith was 80 and lived in Flat Rock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, kids, what time is it?'' Buffalo Bob would ask his Peanut
Gallery of children aged 3 to 8 years, gathered in an NBC studio in
New York at 30 Rockefeller Plaza every afternoon, five days a week,
in the late 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time,'' they'd respond with the lung power
that only children of that age can demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   And then they'd sing their Howdy Doody theme, set to the tune of
the French ditty, ``Ta-ra-ra-Boom-der-e:''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time
</P>
<P>
   It's Howdy Doody time
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith and Howdy, too
</P>
<P>
   Say `howdy doo' to you
</P>
<P>
   Let's give a rousing cheer
</P>
<P>
   'Cause Howdy Doody's here
</P>
<P>
   It's time to start the show
</P>
<P>
   So kids, let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   Such doings made ``Howdy Doody'' one of the first shows NBC ever
produced in color and the first to have live music.
</P>
<P>
   For many years in the 1950s, Buffalo Bob and Howdy were on
Monday to Friday at 5:30 p.m. After the theme, they'd be joined for
an hour by their friends, some human, some made of wood. These
included Clarabell the Clown, human, (he said nary a word but
hopped around honking a Harpo Marx-type horn stuck in his belt,
which he would remove to honk in Buffalo Bob's ear, which he
usually also sprayed with seltzer); Chief Thunderthud, human,
official representative of the Ooragnak Indians (``Ooragnak was
kangaroo spelled backwards); Princess Summerfall Winterspring (she
began as a puppet, then was transformed into a human because
Buffalo Bob, who hired actress Judy Tyler, wanted something
beautiful and life-sized for girls to identify with and Ms. Tyler
was all of that); and such puppets as Phineas T. Bluster, the
always grumpy but never evil mayor of Doodyville, his Latin and
Anglo brothers, Don Jose Bluster and Hector Hamhock Bluster, and
Flub-a-Dub, a meatball-eating wild animal made up of eight
different animals that Buffalo Bob claimed he had caught in a
jungle in South America.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a machine of sorts, a Super Talkscope, that
enabled Buffalo Bob and Howdy to instantly see what was going on
any place in the world, any time they wanted to. There were songs,
too, one of which was ``Iggily Wiggily Spaghetti,'' a big hit with
the Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a big man with an easy smile who almost always wore a
fringed cowboy outfit. At first Howdy called him ``Mr. Smith,'' but
as the years progressed, he became known to one and all as Buffalo
Bob, a name that had nothing to do with the Wild West but rather
with his hometown in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy started as an unprepossessing piece of wood in 1947 after
Smith talked NBC into letting him do a children's show. He grew out
of a character Smith had created on his radio show, ``Triple B
Ranch,'' called Elmer, who would greet Smith with a ``howdy
doody.'' His audiences soon came to call the puppet Howdy Doody.
That first Howdy was quickly retired when NBC and Smith got into a
dispute with Frank Paris, the puppet-maker, who declared that Howdy
was and forever would be his property and nobody else's, the
creative fortunes of Buffalo Bob and his writer notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then found Velma Dawson, the arist who refined Howdy into
27 inch-tall boy, with prominent ears who wore jeans, a bandanna
and a checked shirt. He had 48 freckles, one for each state. His
delivery sounded suspiciously like that of Mortimer Snerd, a dummy
hayseed who had been created on radio by ventriloquist Edgar Bergen
for the madcap top-hatted wisacre, Charlie McCarthy. The second
Howdy was so successful that Smith commissioned a second puppet as
a stand-in, whom he called Double Doody, and a third puppet with no
strings attached who posed for photos. He was called Photo Doody.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffalo Bob was neither a ventriloquist nor a puppeteer and
he never tried to engage in the kinds of pungent exchanges that
occurred between Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. Professional
puppeteers off camera manipulated Howdy's movements whenever he and
Smith had a conversation. Smith pre-recorded all Howdy's responses;
when they were on television, the exchanges between Buffalo Bob and
Howdy were all controlled by an engineer who simply put his finger
on the record and stopped the turntable when Smith was talking,
then took his finger off and let the turntable roll when it was
Howdy's turn. Not exactly high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy, as he was developed by writer Eddie Kean, was neither
excruciatingly thick like Mortimer nor wickedly and unredeemably
sophisticated as Charlie. Howdy was somehow direct without being
intrusive and friendly and supportive of Buffalo Bob without
becoming dull to the Peanut Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Howdy Doody was a sissy,'' said Kean on one
occasion. ``He was me as a child. I always preferred to study than
to play baseball. I never hit anybody. No one ever hit me. He was
the dullest character on the show. No offense to Bob, but he was
because I made him so.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Clarabell was Bob Keeshan, who went on to become
Captain Kangaroo. Clarabell never had a line to say until the show
went off the air (after 2,343 performances) on Sept. 30, 1960, at
which time he looked into the camera and said simply and wistfully,
``Goodbye, kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob moved to Florida from Mount Vernon, N.Y., bought
three radio stations and a liquor store, and thought he was out of
the Howdy Doody business.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. It could never be a permanent goodbye for
the youngsters who grew up watching Buffalo Bob, then went off to
serve in the war in Vietnam or to oppose it. After the tumult of
the 1960s, they felt they needed to return to simpler times. A
Howdy Doody revival started at the University of Pennsylvania in
1970. Someone asked students there what they would like to do most
of all, and many of them said they would like to revisit the world
of Howdy Doody.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, 1970, Buffalo Bob and Howdy showed up at Penn and
hosted a repeat of Howdy's 10th anniversary show of Dec. 28, 1957.
They were a hit and Buffalo Bob never stopped being Buffalo Bob
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith was born Robert Schmidt on Nov. 27, 1917, in
Buffalo, N.Y., the son of Emil H. Schmidt and Emma Kuehn Schmidt.
Schmidt had for years earned his keep as a coal miner in Illinois.
After a cave-in in which Schmidt was one of only three miners to
survive, his wife suggested that he leave the mines. He agreed,
taking his family to Buffalo, where he became a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Young Bob was encouraged to learn to play the piano and organ
and by the time he was 15 years old, he was on a Buffalo radio
station singing. He formed a three-man vocal group called the
Hi-Hatters. One member of the Hi-Hatters was Foster Brooks, who in
later years became famous as the drunk who frequently appeared in
Dean Martin's television program in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of making his way on upstate New York radio,
he came to New York City in August 1947, and got a job as a disk
jockey on radio station WEAF, then owned by the National
Broadcasting Co. Early in his career, he changed his name to Robert
E. Smith. By 1947, Smith had a Saturday morning quiz show for kids.
The Howdy Doody show started that same year, at first on Saturdays,
then on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, finally, five times a
week, where it lasted for an hour. It was successful from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdy Doody'' was so popular that people gathered in the
streets before appliance store windows to watch it, as they did
with baseball games and wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy's popularity being what it was, it was announced in 1948
that he would run for president of all the boys and girls. Harry
Truman also happened to be running that year, and he won the
election over New York Gov. Thomas Dewey. But Howdy did get a great
many votes, becoming president of the boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Smith ran afoul of NBC executives when, during his
early morning talk show, he announced that a spaceship had landed
in Virginia and that it had contained that bodies of
Liliputian-like men attired in 15th century outfits. He read it as
though it had come from the wires of United Press, and although it
did not cause the alarm of Orson Welles' ``Martian invasion'' of
1938, it frightened a great many people, especially those living in
Virginia. NBC told him never to do anything like that again.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, an overworked Smith suffered a heart attack,
and for a time he did the show from his home in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith is survived by his wife, Mildred, to whom he was
married for 57 years, his three sons, Robin, Ronald and
Christopher, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. None of
them went into show business.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ After a funeral procession 15 miles long
journeyed from his hometown in rural Virginia to the nation's
Capitol and along the parade route of presidents, John Gibson was
buried here at the nation's cemetery Thursday with full military
honors.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 police cruisers from across the country
accompanied the black hearse bearing his body as the cortege rolled
north up Interstate 95 into Washington under the midday sun.
Traffic came to a standstill as hundreds of drivers stopped their
cars on overpasses and side roads to glimpse the procession.
</P>
<P>
   Once it passed the Capitol _ where Gibson, a Capitol Hill
detective, was killed in a shootout six days ago _ the procession
wove past the federal courthouse where lawyers for the suspected
gunman were meeting with a judge. It then crawled past the Lincoln
Memorial and across the Potomac River, where a dozen officers from
the U.S. Park Service Police, mounted on horseback, guarded the
gateway to Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the lead 260 officers in the motorcade peeled
off, lined their motorcycles along the length of Memorial Drive and
raised their hands in a final salute.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the day for police officers to honor Gibson, and
they showed up in force, from the California Highway Patrol to the
Minneapolis Police Department to the Nassau County (N.Y.) Police
Department. Gibson's mahogany coffin, glinting in the sun, was
borne to the grave by uniformed officers as two dozen members of
the Pipe and Drum Corps of the Emerald Society of the Chicago
Police Department played ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief ceremony, Gibson's wife and three children placed red
roses on the coffin. Accompanying them was the family of a second
officer, Jacob Chestnut, who was also killed in the gunfire and who
is to receive a similar ceremony here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will not be buried next to each other. Cemetery
officials said that Chestnut is to be interred elsewhere on the
612-acre grounds because 21 other funerals are scheduled for
Friday, some in the area where Gibson was laid to rest Thursday,
and they did not want the expected public outpouring for Chestnut
to conflict with those services.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chestnut, who served in Vietnam, Gibson was not a
military veteran. But the secretary of the Army granted permission
for him to buried at Arlington, where more than 250,000 people are
interred beneath identical white stone markers. Arlington is the
second-largest national cemetery in the country after the Long
Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale, N.Y., where more than
300,000 people are buried.
</P>
<P>
   After Gibson's coffin was lowered onto a platform by nine
uniformed pallbearers, three police helicopters flew overhead and
seven riflemen fired three volleys of gunfire over the grave.
Cemetery officials said this was not a 21-gun salute, which is
reserved for heads of state. Rather, the volleys are an old war
tradition, in which each army would fire three shots to indicate
that they had removed their dead from the battlefield and were
ready to resume fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Many officers wore their dress uniforms, which are made of wool,
and in the sticky afternoon heat, at least a dozen collapsed from
heatstroke, medics said. A handful of people _ a former Capitol
Hill officer, a current officer on disability, the mother of an
officer and a bicycle messenger _ stayed after the service to watch
the coffin be lowered into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be here through the end,'' said the woman
whose son works on the Capitol force. ``When I'm with my son from
now on, I'll know this was painful, and I just came to feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   George Culberath, the bicycle messenger, said he delivered
packages to the Capitol and knew the officers. ``I just feel a
loss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formal tributes were paid earlier at Gibson's home church, St.
Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Lake Ridge, Va., about 35
miles from Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Hamilton said the best way to honor Gibson, who
served in the protective detail guarding Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
would be for Congress to pass laws that eliminate violence.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Dewolse, Gibson's best friend, said that Gibson was hoping
to be part of the protective detail assigned to guard the many
members of Congress who plan on accompanying Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, to Florida in October for his second trip into space.
</P>
<P>
   He said to his absent friend: ``Now, John, you'll have the best
seat in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the suspected gunman, Russell Weston Jr., was still
recuperating in a nearby hospital and remained under heavy police
guard. His lawyers said he should be well enough by Aug. 18 to
appear in court. Magistrate Deborah Robinson authorized four mental
health experts to examine Weston in the hospital. He has been
charged with murder in the killing of a federal law enforcement
officer.

   WATSONVILLE, Calif. _ Tension and fear hover over the strawberry
fields of the Coastal Berry Company here like the morning fog. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the lush fields outside of this small
city 70 miles south of San Francisco have become a battle ground in
an increasingly nasty and nationally significant
two-and-a-half-year struggle by the United Farm Workers to unionize
the men and women who pick the sweet red berries, often for short
pay and long hours: their backs bent, their heads down, their hopes
low. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, there have been threats, arrests, beatings of UFW
supporters, a disputed union election that a rival group won, a
one-day strike to protest the election and a hearing at the state
Capitol on Tuesday on the entire bitter harvest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disturbed about what I heard,'' said state Sen.
Hilda Solis, D-Los Angeles, the co-chairwoman of the hearing.
``There's violence in the fields, intimidation. A union vote should
never have been taken in that kind of environment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the UFW said it would file legal papers with the
California Agricultural Labor Relations Board, seeking to have the
results of the union vote at Coastal Berry, the largest strawberry
grower in the country, thrown out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The UFW maintains that the election on July 23 was unfair and
was held in a climate of violence and fear; it refused to
participate in the vote. The union also contends that the group
that won the election, the Coastal Berry Farm Workers Committee, is
a ``sham union,'' a front for the company and the powerful Western
Grower's Association, a farming industry organization in Irvine,
Calif., which has long opposed the union's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are so high that all of agri-business has come
together to stop us,'' said Dolores Huerta, the co-founder of the
UFW. There are 20,000 strawberry pickers in California, where 80
percent of the nation's strawberries are grown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both the company nd the association deny they had anything to
do with the election or its results.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply,'' said Doug Kerr, general counsel for the
association, ``the UFW is lashing out at anyone they can over their
frustration at being unable to organize the Coastal Berry
employees.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The UFW tried to stop the election but the labor board allowed
the vote to go forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coastal Berry Farm Workers Committee, a group that did not
exist a few weeks ago, won the right to represent the company's
more than 900 field workers with 54 percent of the vote, even
though the committee had no agenda, no list of demands on behalf of
the workers and no organizing strategy beyond defeating the UFW. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Coastal Berry President David Smith conceded that the
workers' committee had a limited purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have structure,'' Smith said of the new union.
``They don't have management. They don't want to collect dues.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   One of the leaders of the group, a 22-year-old truck driver,
Jose Fernandez, was arrested and charged with assaulting a police
officer who interceded in a confrontation between members of the
workers' committee and UFW supporters in the fields on July 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of tension for the last couple of years,''
the president of the UFW, Arturo Rodriguez, said. ``But we never
expected they would just openly rush a field and beat up workers
loyal to the union.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three workers were sent to the hospital, where they were treated
and released, but Smith said the violence was relatively minor:
rocks, fists and boxes of strawberries were thrown, in one case
hitting a frightened woman in the face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Agricultural Labor Relations Board tried to investigate
the incident before the union election, Coastal Berry refused to
cooperate, citing a fear of more violence, the labor board's
general counsel, Paul Richardson, said at Tuesday's joint hearing
of the state's Senate Committee on Industrial Relations and the
Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the board wanted to investigate the incident to
determine if the election should go forward, but without the
company's cooperation it decided to proceed with the voting, partly
to avoid any more trouble in the fields. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of the ALRB,'' Richardson said, ``is to vote now,
litigate later.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That statement and several others from labor board officials
seemed to inflame state Assemblyman Richard Floyd, D-Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, the co-chairman of the hearing, said the board was
``absolutely condoning'' the violence when it refused to block the
election. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither the growers' association, the Coastal Berry Company or
its new union appeared at the hearing, although each group was
invited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, Smith said Coastal Berry was now
cooperating with labor board investigators and that he did not care
what union if any represented his workers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We would negotiate with the UFW,'' he said. ``They have done
some good things for their workers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the UFW was picking on the wrong company, because
Coastal Berry provides some of the highest wages and best benefits
in the $600 million a year strawberry industry, which is known for
its low wages and poor benefits. Smith said workers earn a base pay
of $6.50 an hour, which can increase to $10 or $11 in the peak
picking season, depending on how much a worker picks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The union said that during the peak season, the base pay goes
down and the amount of money the pickers earn per box of
strawberries goes up from about 35 cents per tray to 75 cents per
tray. An average worker picks about four to six trays an hour.
``It's back-breaking work,'' said Lupe Lara, a picker for 15 years,
who said he was dismissed last Monday after participating in a
one-day strike to protest the election. ``But I want my job back. I
have no choice. I have six children.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodriquez, the UFW president, and several workers, agreed that
conditions in the fields ``have improved dramatically.'' But they
credit that to the union's efforts to organize, not the policies of
Coastal Berry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the union campaign began, said Jesus Anaya, 46, a picker
for years, conditions were poor. ``Now the company is giving us
health insurance,'' he said, ``because of the union.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, after nearly three years of effort and considerable help
from the AFL-CIO, the UFW has not been able to gain a solid
foothold in the strawberry fields of Watsonville. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said that at first, the goal of his group was to keep
the UFW and any other unions out of the fields. It was only after
it was determined to be more effective for the group to represent
itself as a union that the workers' committee was formed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said the UFW has failed because ``we got tired of them
harassing us to join the union at our homes, after work, before
work, at the park, on the street.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for his new union, Fernandez said he is not sure what it will
ask for at the bargaining table, if the committee ever gets that
far. ``Maybe we'll try to get some bonuses,'' he said. ``We don't
promise nothing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for the hearts and minds of the strawberry pickers
is far from over. Ms. Solis said she planned to hold another
hearing about the election and intended to review the labor board's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in 14 years we're actually having an
oversight hearing of the ALRB,'' the senator said. ``It won't be
the last.''

 &HT;    Post office honors 50-year employee, former pitcher
 &HT;    By Delbert Ellerton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- One-hundred-fifty years of service.
</P>
<P>
   That's what 83-year-old Melvin Echols Sr. wants for his family.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Echols, a still-working 50-year U.S. Postal Service
employee and a former Negro Leagues pitcher who once struck out 22
players in a baseball game, inched closer to that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Echols' service was honored by management at an employee
appreciation celebration held at the main Atlanta Post Office on
Crown Road.
</P>
<P>
   Echols, who is a custodian and also has worked as a postal
service guard, has two sons who are letter carriers.
</P>
<P>
   As a family, the Echolses have a combined 109 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going when I get ready to go,'' Echols said when asked if
he had any plans for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark-blue work uniform topped with an Atlanta Black
Crackers baseball cap, Echols stood before a crowd of co-workers,
microphone in hand, thanking God and introducing his older son,
Melvin Jr., 51. Echols' younger son, Michael, 49, could not make
the celebration. Melvin Jr. has worked for the postal service for
31 years, and Michael has been on the job for 29 years. During his
playing days with the Atlanta Black Crackers, the Atlanta White Sox
and other Negro League teams, Echols was known as Sunny Jim Echols.
An Atlanta Daily World sportswriter nicknamed him ``Sunny'' while
writing an article, and his grandmother had nicknamed him Jim years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he found success as a baseball player, Echols never
encouraged his sons to be athletes. Instead he pushed them toward
music and careers with the postal service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his dream, to get us here, to come to the post office
and work,'' said Melvin Jr.

MEDIA MAY MIRE MCGWIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ITAL)``I don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Louis' Mark McGwire on Tuesday night after he hit his 45th
home run but suffered through the Cardinals' 13-10 loss.(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Is Mark McGwire's high-wire act finally getting to him? Is the
media pressure going to make him topple? Who will he blame if he
lands in the safety net a few knocks short of Roger Maris'
single-season home run record?
</P>
<P>
   In order, the answers are sort of, no and probably himself.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's surliness toward the media in recent weeks appears to
have been magnified as he gets closer to saving the game of
baseball ... rather, hitting another bushel of tape-measure blasts
in the final 50-odd games he'll play in to break the Maris
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Not as much has been written or said about similar
media-perceived pressure put on Seattle's Ken Griffey or Chicago's
Sammy Sosa on the same chase _ maybe because they've trailed
McGwire from the beginning, maybe because the intensity hasn't been
as severe.
</P>
<P>
   That the unending focus is on McGwire, the former USC star with
the bulging biceps and devilish goatee, is something he'll have to
somehow deal with for the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   From Sports Illustrated cover stories (current issue, check out
the media swarm on page 43) to the daily graphics on the sports
pages tracking his every swing, it's only going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of June, the Cardinals' media-relations staff has
invoked the ``McGwire Rules'' as far as interviews go. During
Cardinals road trips, where the new flock of writers and TV crews
are sent out to report on every move by this out-of-town sensation,
the only time the media can talk to him about his chase is in a
30-minute session 3{ hours before the first game of each series.
The rules are a bit more lax during home series. And after every
game, he can decide whether he'll make himself available to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   If he hits a home run, he'll usually talk. But then again,
there's not much to say in the case of earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think he's having fun and wants to break the record
more than anyone knows _ yet _ but he's been so agitated with the
way the team has underachieved that it's taken a lot of the luster
off it,'' said Joe Buck, the Cardinals' TV play-by-play man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more frustrated by the team than the media attention.
Look at Tuesday: I'll guarantee you 40,000 people left Busch
Stadium satisfied even though the team blows the game on a
ninth-inning grand slam given up by a rookie closer. They still saw
McGwire's 45th homer. It's very strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if he wouldn't trade some of this personal glory
in just for the team to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's trade to the Cardinals in the middle of last season
was precipitated by him wanting to get out of Oakland because the
Athletics, where he played on a World Championship club in 1988,
are in the process of rebuilding. The Cards had designs on the NL
Central title entering the season but aren't even in the wild-card
race in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Personal glory was something that drove a player like Reggie
Jackson during his chase of Maris' record in 1969, when he had 37
homers at the All-Star break and hit only 10 the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really regret the fact that the media attention bothered me
so much in 1969 that I couldn't get that record,'' Jackson said
recently. ``I hope the same thing doesn't happen to these players
this year because, trust me, you don't want to be in a position to
say 30 years later that it was the media that bothered you. The
media isn't as important as hitting 62 home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the Washington Post, McGwire was quoted as saying:
``I'm getting tired of seeing my mug on TV and in the paper.
Sometimes you just don't want to know. The newspaper... I just pick
it up and throw in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   You do what you've got to do to keep your sanity. That's
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   You also do what you have to do to keep yourself from feeling
you're letting the entire sport down if you don't achieve this
milestone. McGwire might not have figured out how to deal with that
yet, although you won't find many (unlike when Maris competed with
teammate Mickey Mantle for Babe Ruth's record) who are rooting
against him. Even the media, whose members aren't supposed to be
openly rooting for anything, are in this case privately enjoying it
as much as the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say he's going to crack, but I don't see the media
attention as a factor,'' said Buck, who has a chance to make the
record-breaking call on TV at the same time his father, Hall of
Famer Jack Buck, is doing it on the Cardinals' radio broadcast.
``He's a guy who can separate the circus from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything that's going to distract him, it'll be his
want to not disappoint the fans. He's into this chase more than he
lets on. When he breaks it, he won't be able to contain himself.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the question is: Will the media be able to contain
itself?
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST PICTURE SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Get a good mental image of Steve Mason and John Ireland, because
as of today, their 6 a.m.-to-9 a.m. ``Big Show'' has ceased
simulcasting between KXTA-AM (1150) on radio and Fox Sports West 2
on TV as it has been for the last 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   The call was made by those who run the radio side _ and,
incidentally, pay the guys' salaries. Fox, which sold a sponsorship
package for the TV show but had no other financial stake, isn't
thrilled to have to replace it with fitness shows and more Fox
Sports News. But the Jacor execs didn't feel as if the quality of
the show should be compromised just for the cross-promotion on TV.
</P>
<P>
   So  &UR; !ital! &LR; sayonara to waking up to that vision of Shoshona,
boys.
</P>
<P>
   LISTEN UP
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rome's ``Last Word'' on Fox Sports Net continues to be taped
at the Fox studios in Century City, and an audience will watch it
live from the All Star Cafe in New York. The New Yorkers will be
able to ask questions of Rome and the guests. It all starts
Monday....
</P>
<P>
   Irv Kaze's show tonight _ on KIEV-AM (870), which recently
changed ownership _ focuses on probably the two best role models
for women involved in athletics today: Donna DeVarona, the former
Olympic swimmer and ABC broadcaster who chairs the FIFA women's
world soccer championships that will be in the U.S. next year, and
Anita DeFrantz, the head of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los
Angeles recently elected vice president of the IOC....
</P>
<P>
   The 3.7 rating NBC received for Sunday's final round of the U.S.
Senior Open at Riviera was the only sports program that did better
than a 3.0 for the weekend. It is a 32 percent jump over the 2.8
the tournament received on the final day last year.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Al Michaels' and Bob Costas' appearances
``as themself'' in TV's ``Arli$$'' and the cinema's
``BASEketball,'' which comes out today. In the former, the intended
comedy is so putrid that the sports-broadcasting icons look like
nothing more than cheap props. In the latter, the fact Costas can
scream _ and make a risque reference to how excited he is _ and
Michaels can gaze at some voluptuous cheerleaders and remember when
they were schoolgirls, is not just closer to the pure definition of
parody. It's just funnier, which is something Robert Wuhl's guys
might learn from David Zucker's.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   How much slack do we give Fox Sports Net's Lauren Sanchez before
she ends up hanging herself? There's an apparent in-studio contest
between her and Brad Goode!arrow! for most blunders per show by a
news reader (using the term literally) without any idea of what
they just said. If credibility is what FSN wants in its competition
with ESPN's cast of SWM (Single White Male) clones, start by hiring
more qualified folks who not only look pretty (which mostly applies
in Goode's case) but also are a little clued in on what they're
feeding the viewers.

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ The big Tudor house on the corner wasn't
exactly the old Granville place in ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' and
the man who lived there for nearly 50 years until he died last
summer was named James Stewart, not George Bailey. But 918 N.
Roxbury Drive, with its towering trees, wide lawn and walled
English garden, was a landmark on a leafy street where the
neighbors included Lucille Ball, Jack Benny and Ira Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   Now the house, which was sold in the spring for $5.6 million, is
gone, demolished over the last three weeks by its new owner to make
way for an Italian-style villa twice as big, and all that remains
is a hole in the ground. It is just one of the latest casualties in
that affluent Tinseltown tradition, the ``teardown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm haunted by the knowledge that this house will be torn down
the minute I die,'' said the Stewarts' next door neighbor, Albert
Moxie, an 86-year-old retired history professor from the University
of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The latest demolition was no surprise to Moxie, who has lived on
Roxbury Drive since 1929. The house on the other side of his was
torn down after its owner, Pandro Berman, who produced the Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals at RKO, died two years ago, and a
new house is just being finished there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In good economic times, people are willing to do teardowns
because they say, `I want exactly what I want, and I don't want
anything less,''' said Fred Sands, a leading luxury real estate
broker here. ``During a recession, people will do some remodeling.
But for many people now, it's simply the price of admission: you
buy it, and you tear it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sands should know. Last year he sold O.J. Simpson's old house in
Brentwood for nearly $4 million, after the bank that foreclosed on
it had spent $200,000 on elaborate renovations to make it more
attractive. This week the new owner, an investment banker named
Kenneth Abdalla, sent in bulldozers to reduce it to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is it was somewhat dated, and it was still subpar
for a $4 million house,'' Sands said. ``The second-story master
suite wasn't what it should be for today's environment. The buyer
brought in the architect and talked about gutting the second floor
but then decided he might as well take the whole thing down.''
</P>
<P>
   In most markets, spending $4 million or $5 million on a dwelling
only to demolish it would be unheard of. But in affluent areas like
Beverly Hills or Silicon Valley, where land is precious and parcels
like the Stewart family's 1.4-acre plot almost never come on the
market, the lure is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trend in major metropolitan markets where the land is
in acute short supply and the prices are high,'' said Gopal
Ahluwalia, director of research for the National Association of
Homebuilders in Washington. ``It was much more common five or 10
years back, and then land prices diminished somewhat, and now
they're on the upswing again. It's the culture of this country.
Here people move pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of Simpson's former neighbors were distraught at the demise
of his house at 360 N. Rockingham Ave. It had been a magnet for
curious tourists since he was arrested there four years ago and
charged with the murder of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   But on Stewart's old stretch of Roxbury Drive, neighbors like
Rosemary Clooney, who since 1953 has lived just up the street in
the house where the Gershwin brothers wrote ``Our Love Is Here to
Stay,'' mourned the end of an era. Ms. Clooney and her husband,
Dante DiPaolo, returned from an out-of-town trip a couple of weeks
ago to find the Stewart house flattened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only we'd known,'' she said. ``We'd have taken a brick or
something.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greg Field, the lawyer for the Stewart estate, said, ``I think
it's fair to say the family's preference would have been to leave
the house standing and perhaps renovate it in some fashion, but
they fully understood that the buyer had the absolute right to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The property's new owner, Steven Wallace, who founded Pacific
Brokerage Services, an online discount brokerage that he sold to
Mellon Bank last summer, was unsentimental about his acquisition,
which was built in 1928 by director King Vidor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house was just a dump,'' Wallace said in a telephone
interview. ``How he could have lived there, I don't know. There
were cracks everywhere. The gardens were magnificent, but when I
looked at it, I said: `Why buy it? It's a total teardown.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the large corner lot that seduced Wallace,
who already lives on the street, just up the block from Ms.
Clooney, but wanted a bigger place. He plans a 12,800-square-foot
house with a three-car garage to replace the old 6,300-square-foot
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be kind of an Italian villa,'' said Wallace, who has
hired the Stewarts' longtime maid as his own. ``It'll look old, but
be new.''
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that Wallace can build so big a house only because
more than 30 years ago Stewart himself doubled the size of his
property by buying the house next door and tearing it down to build

 UNDATED: Doody business.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it was not to be. It could never be a permanent goodbye for
the youngsters who grew up watching Buffalo Bob, then went off to
serve in the war in Vietnam or to oppose it. After the tumult of
the 1960s, they felt they needed to return to simpler times. A
Howdy Doody revival started at the University of Pennsylvania in
1970. Someone asked students there what they would like to do most
of all, and many of them said they would like to revisit the world
of Howdy Doody.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, 1970, Buffalo Bob and Howdy showed up at Penn and
hosted a repeat of Howdy's 10th anniversary show of Dec. 28, 1957.
They were a hit and Buffalo Bob never stopped being Buffalo Bob
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bob Smith was born Robert Schmidt on Nov. 27, 1917, in
Buffalo, N.Y., the son of Emil H. Schmidt and Emma Kuehn Schmidt.
Schmidt had for years earned his keep as a coal miner in Illinois.
After a cave-in in which Schmidt was one of only three miners to
survive, his wife suggested that he leave the mines. He agreed,
taking his family to Buffalo, where he became a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Young Bob was encouraged to learn to play the piano and organ
and by the time he was 15 years old, he was on a Buffalo radio
station singing. He formed a three-man vocal group called the
Hi-Hatters. One member of the Hi-Hatters was Foster Brooks, who in
later years became famous as the drunk who frequently appeared in
Dean Martin's television program in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of making his way on upstate New York radio,
he came to New York City in August 1947, and got a job as a disk
jockey on radio station WEAF, then owned by the National
Broadcasting Co. Early in his career, he changed his name to Robert
E. Smith. By 1947, Smith had a Saturday morning quiz show for kids.
The Howdy Doody show started that same year, at first on Saturdays,
then on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, finally, five times a
week, where it lasted for an hour. It was successful from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdy Doody'' was so popular that people gathered in the
streets before appliance store windows to watch it, as they did
with baseball games and wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy's popularity being what it was, it was announced in 1948
that he would run for president of all the boys and girls. Harry
Truman also happened to be running that year, and he won the
election over New York Gov. Thomas Dewey. But Howdy did get a great
many votes, becoming president of the boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Smith ran afoul of NBC executives when, during his
early morning talk show, he announced that a spaceship had landed
in Virginia and that it had contained that bodies of
Liliputian-like men attired in 15th century outfits. He read it as
though it had come from the wires of United Press, and although it
did not cause the alarm of Orson Welles' ``Martian invasion'' of
1938, it frightened a great many people, especially those living in
Virginia. NBC told him never to do anything like that again.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, an overworked Smith suffered a heart attack,
and for a time he did the show from his home in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith is survived by his wife, Mildred, to whom he was
married for 57 years, his three sons, Robin, Ronald and
Christopher, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. None of
them went into show business.

SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW IN PRIME MINISTER'S CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Keizo Obuchi took office on Thursday as prime minister
and named a cabinet which, while it largely reflects his loyalty to
factions of the governing Liberal Democratic Party that insured his
election, also made a nod to younger members pushing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister because his party colleagues defied
the wishes of their constituents, who overwhelmingly preferred his
rivals and who have already voiced their displeasure with the
ruling party by voting it out of power in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will he have to satisfy voters at home, he will have to
prove to a world clamoring for action to right the Japanese economy
that he can abandon the cautious consensus-building that brought
him to power and make bold, even daring moves.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was not the choice of the upper house, which chose Naoto
Kan, head of the largest opposition party, the Democrats, as prime
minister. But in such a split the candidate chosen by the more
powerful lower house gets the job. The division will mean, however,
that Obuchi will be working overtime to curry the favor of Japan's
splintered opposition parties if he wants to push through
controversial legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet will have to address major issues including rising
unemployment, a banking crisis and global fears of a surge in
Japanese exports helped by a weak yen.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi turned responsibility for the powerful Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications, which controls a big chunk of Japan's vast
pool of private savings, over to a woman, Seiko Noda, and appointed
a highly regarded academic, Akito Arima, as education minister.
</P>
<P>
   And he entrusted Japan's sick economy and fragile financial
system to Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister and party
veteran who has a long record in international economic
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   While Obuchi's cabinet reflected the factional power within the
governing party, commentators suggested that in some cases he had
made his own selections from among faction members rather than
allowing the faction leaders to choose.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets withheld judgment of the new cabinet,
which was not officially announced until after many Asian markets
closed, although the new cabinet members' names were circulating on
Thursday morning. The yen held steady against the dollar in Tokyo
but fell in New York on Thursday after Miyazawa indicated he might
not move to prop up the currency or the stock market as past
governments have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting it very simply, whether it is the yen or stocks, we
should rely on the markets to move on their own,'' he said. The
Nikkei basically shrugged its shoulders, rising 43.51 points to
16,201.60.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, 78, has been involved in crafting policies to deal
with Japan's banking crisis, and his global reputation for
financial savvy goes some way toward dispelling doubts in world
capitals about Obuchi's ability and commitment to aggressively
address that problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have serious worries about the current economic
situation,'' Miyazawa said during a news conference with other
appointees. ``I think tackling it speedily is the most important
thing we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For foreign minister, the position Obuchi held before becoming
prime minister, he selected Masahiko Komura, who served as his
right hand in the Foreign Ministry since 1996. Komura, 56, is
considered an expert on Japan's relations with Russia, which Obuchi
has emphasized as a focus of his administration. He, like Ms. Noda,
is a member of the Komoto faction, the smallest segment of the
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In giving two prime Cabinet seats to such a politically
insignificant faction, Obuchi could have been making an attempt to
avoid reflecting internal party politics in the national
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Noda's appointment, however, could also be construed as an
olive branch to Seiroku Kajiyama, one of the two men who challenged
Obuchi for the party president's job, as well as to younger members
of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Noda, whose grandfather was a ranking Liberal Democratic
politician, supported Kajiyama. She has in the past openly worried
about the Liberal Democrats' ability to win the affections of
voters.
</P>
<P>
   One of five women currently sitting in the lower house and the
youngest Cabinet minister in postwar history, Ms. Noda, 37,
emphasized that in her position she can be instrumental in
developing new industries and jobs for Japan in telecommunications
and information services.
</P>
<P>
   Arima, the new education minister, is a nuclear physicist who
was president of Tokyo University from 1989 to 1993. He is a
political novice, having won his first term in the upper house
during the recent election.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the job at a time when Japan is agonizing over its
educational system, which has been rocked by a series of knifings
in schools and by concerns that its rigidity stunts creative
thinking that the country needs in a competitive global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan's future in the international community depends on how
well we can raise powerful and vivid young people,'' he said on
Thursday.

STUDY LINKS RADIATION TO MOLECULES THAT LED TO LIFE ON EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The left-handed molecules that led to the beginning of life on
earth may have been singled out for their eventual role in biology
by a type of radiation that astronomers have discovered in a
star-forming cloud some 1,500 light years away.
</P>
<P>
   A team of astronomers in Australia reported in the issue of
Science magazine published Friday that they detected strongly
polarized radiation from a celestial cloud of hot dust and infant
stars in the constellation Orion. Its discoverers believe that
similar radiation could account for the uniform twist of key
molecules in living creatures and help explain how life arose.
</P>
<P>
   The form of infrared radiation they found is said to be
circularly polarized _ that is, the crests and troughs of its waves
follow corkscrew paths as they travel through space.
</P>
<P>
   Using a large, specially equipped telescope on Siding Spring
Mountain in Australia, the scientists detected the corkscrew rays
streaming from a bright nebula known as M42 in the constellation
Orion. This vast, luminous cloud is known to be a stellar nursery,
where thousands of new stars are condensing from the surrounding
gas and dust, probably along with new planetary systems that might
one day support life.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, Dr. Jeremy Bailey of the Anglo-Australian
Observatory and his collaborators from Britain, France and Japan
say that their discovery supports the view that such radiation can
help concentrate the molecules vital to life.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said in a interview this week that the discovery came as
a complete surprise. He said that members of his group had intended
merely to investigate the composition and distribution of dust in
the Orion nebula and had not expected to see the high levels of
circular polarization they detected.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery may shed light on the chirality _ or handedness _
of terrestrial biology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1848, Louis Pasteur discovered that some carbon-based
molecules come in two mirror-image forms, matched with each other
just as pairs of gloves are matched. One of the molecular types in
such chiral, or handed, partnerships rotates beams of light to the
right, and the other rotates light to the left.
</P>
<P>
   After Pasteur's discovery, other scientists found that the
building blocks of life themselves _ amino acids and sugars _ are
also chiral.
</P>
<P>
   When chemists synthesize amino acids in the laboratory, the
result is a mixture of roughly equal amounts of the left-handed and
right-handed forms. Scientist call such mixtures ``racemic.'' But
living creatures, including humans, are assembled exclusively from
left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars.
</P>
<P>
   Why and how this should be so are among the central mysteries of
the origin of life, and such questions have prompted much
scientific investigation and debate.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: single-handedness, or homochirality, is an
essential property of the amino acids and sugars incorporated into
living organisms. This is because mixtures of left-handed and
right-handed types would create molecular mismatches. Animals and
plants cannot build coherent peptides and proteins from mixed pairs
of amino acids, or mixed pairs of such sugars as ribose and
deoxyribose _ the corkscrew backbones of genetic RNA and DNA. It
would be like trying to put a left glove on a right hand.
</P>
<P>
   But how the gift of homochirality was bestowed on earth as a
mold for life is an unsolved mystery; single-handedness had either
to arise on the earth itself, or to arrive from outer space, but
which? Scientists also wonder why biological amino acids happen to
be left handed rather than right handed, which would be just as
suitable for life; was the choice decided by random chance, or was
there some physical influence favoring left-handedness?
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report from Australia lends weight to a growing body of
evidence that homochirality is extraterrestrial in origin.
</P>
<P>
   One theory consistent with this idea is based on the fact that
amino acids tend to decompose when they absorb ultraviolet
radiation. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that if this
radiation happens to be circularly polarized, it preferentially
decomposes either the left-handed or the right-handed amino acid
type, depending on the direction of the beam's corkscrew rotation.
</P>
<P>
   If the ultraviolet preferentially decomposes right-handed amino
acids floating through interstellar space, this would leave an
excess of left-handed ones. Such an imbalance, Bailey and others
say, could have started amino acids out on the homochiral road to
life. Left-handed amino acids and other chiral molecules, selected
by the action of polarized radiation, could have been swept up and
carried to earth on comets, meteoritic dust or asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey acknowledged in the interview that although his group
found circularly polarized infrared in the Orion nebula, this did
not prove that circularly-polarized ultraviolet was also present.
But the same process that produced the infrared polarization,
possibly the scattering of light by magnetically aligned dust
particles, is likely to have produced circularly polarized
ultraviolet as well, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultraviolet radiation from distant sources does not penetrate
interstellar dust clouds or even the earth's atmosphere to an
appreciable extent, and it therefore cannot be detected with
earth-based instruments. But Bailey said he hoped that ultraviolet
detectors capable of measuring polarization would someday be sent
into orbit above the atmosphere. An orbiting instrument of this
kind could perhaps find a window through the dust shrouding much of
the Orion nebula and measure ultraviolet polarization directly.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators concluded that the meteorite's amino acids
could be explained in terms of terrestrial contamination by
bacteria and other biological sources. Others argued that the amino
acids were extraterrestrial in origin.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Dr. John Cronin and Dr. Sandra Pizzarello of
Arizona State University completed tests that all but settled the
debate. They found a pronounced excess of left-handed amino acids
in the meteorite _ not only amino acids found in life, but amino
acids unknown in living organisms. The latter are therefore likely
to be extraterrestrial in origin.
</P>
<P>
   The latest observations from Australia may demonstrate the
mechanism that imprinted a preponderance of left-handed amino acids
in the Murchison meteorite _ and perhaps on those in earth's
creatures as well.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists remain skeptical of all theories of
extraterrestrial sources of the attributes of life. Among them is
Dr. Stanley Miller of the University of California in San Diego,
whose experiments beginning in the 1950s showed that amino acids
could be created from simple mixtures of terrestrial gases exposed
to heat or artificial lightning bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has contended over the years that life probably
originated on the earth itself, without help from the depths of
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report by Jeremy Bailey and his colleagues shows that
their work was very carefully done,'' Miller said in an interview,
``but I'm very skeptical of the inferences they draw. For the
moment, let's concede that circularly polarized ultraviolet can
preferentially decompose either left-handed or right-handed amino
acids.
</P>
<P>
   ``This radiation from a star gets polarized by scattering it
from the dust in the vicinity of the star. The direction of twist
of the polarized ultraviolet will depend on where the dust grains
lie with respect to the star. Dust grains north of the star might
scatter radiation with a left-handed twist, while grains south of
it would give the radiation the opposite twist. The effects would
cancel out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey said that the excess of left-handed amino acids need
not be large. It might start out as small and become amplified by
some physical process. Either way, he said, ``the ultimate source
is likely to be extraterrestrial.''

   East meets West Coast in brotherhood of basketball
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Theirs is a relationship that has spanned cultures
and eras, jumped borders and survived political ideologies,
bouncing along like the ball in the game that is in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Small world, this ever-shrinking basketball planet from which
Donn Nelson and Sarunas Marciulionis have come from opposite sides
to be more than blood brothers. They are friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend asked me to do him a favor, and I obliged,'' said
Nelson, giving the simplest response to a question about how an
American-born hoop junkie of Swedish and German descent came to sit
on the bench as an assistant coach for the Lithuanian national
team, which defeated the United States 84-82 on Thursday at the
World Championship of Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The story began a decade ago, when Nelson, the son of Dallas
Mavericks coach and general manager Don, traveled through Europe
and became familiar with a hard-nosed guard who played for the
former Soviet Union. That guard, Marciulionis, became one of the
first highly recruited foreign-born players by the NBA and wound up
at Golden State, playing for Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   In Donn Nelson and Marciulionis, East met West Coast, and the
pair who spoke the language of the game forged a bond that would
grow deep enough so that when the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991,
one friend could ask another to devote himself to a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 50 years, Lithuania has always had a passion _
basketball _ that made it different from the rest of Europe,''
Nelson said. ``It wasn't soccer. It was always basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was the tiny republic that produced most of the greatest
players on the Soviet Big Red Machine that won the gold medal at
the 1988 Olympics. Marciulionis played with Arvydas Sabonis and a
handful of others, and even though it was the Soviet national
anthem they heard as they received their medals, those proud
players _ and the rest of the Soviet Union _ were aware who made up
the heart of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``During 40 years of being held captive by this dark political
force, basketball was always the way for the Lithuanians to thumb
their noses at the Soviets,'' Nelson said. ``They'd take their team
into Moscow and whip the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that sense of national pride for which Marciulionis
appealed to his American buddy Nelson when he wanted to prepare
Lithuania for its first Olympic appearance in 1992. That was the
year the first U.S. Dream Team dominated the headlines and the
games. But who expected different from a team that included Michael
Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Charles Barkley?
</P>
<P>
   But Lithuania, led by the feisty veteran guard Marciulionis and
the young American assistant coach, that achieved the real Olympic
dream, winning the bronze medal, beating none other than Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The jubilant Lithuanians jumped up and down on the victory stand
wearing their tie-dyed warm-up shirts provided by the Grateful
Dead. While the U.S. team bickered over corporate logos in
Barcelona, Marciulionis and his countrymen wore the Deadheads' rock
'n' roll skeleton and partied.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged in the locker room. They doused the then-president
of their country, Vytautas Landsbergis, with champagne and cried
when they sang the Lithuanian national anthem, Nelson included.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the single proudest moment of my life,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Proud for what he had contributed. Prouder for a friend whose
country finally was free.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Lithuania has added an Olympic bronze and a
silver at the World Championship. Marciulionis has retired as a
player and runs the Lithuanian pro league.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call him the godfather of basketball in his
country,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the godfather has not had to make Nelson an offer he can't
refuse to keep helping. Nelson says he's committed to his adopted
country for the long haul, even in two years when he is under
contract to succeed his father as Mavs coach.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, like Marciulionis, is excited about the play of the
young Lithuanian team (2-0) but admits disappointment over the
absence of the NBA stars for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand all sides of the argument,'' he said. ``But I
believe that when your country asks you to serve, whether it's war,
sports or anything, you do it. Through these people, through
Sarunas, I have learned how deep patriotism can run.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing their champagne, their hugs, their tears.
</P>
<P>
   For Nelson and Marciulionis, what a long, strange trip
friendship has been.

FOR 101 RIDERS, THE TOUR DE FRANCE WILL CARRY ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEUCHATEL, Switzerland _ The Tour de France continued without
incident Thursday as the 101 remaining riders yielded to the
enormous implications of aborting the bicycle race for the first
time since it began in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   The riders staged two sit-down protests on Wednesday and
threatened not to start if police persisted in what the riders
regarded as brutal methods of questioning them in a widening drug
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   French police did check four teams at their hotels after
Wednesday's finish and took a leading rider, a coach and a team
doctor into custody, but the racers decided that their rights had
not been violated and set off Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Many teams with riders high in the overall standing and with a
chance at prestige and a share of the $2.2 million prize list are
happy to keep racing until the end in Paris on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams, like the U.S. Postal Service, which is adamant
against doping, remained ``for the glory of the sport and because
this is the focus of our entire season,'' as Dan Osipow, the team's
director of operations, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Another major factor in the continuation was that such firebrand
teams as ONCE, led by Laurent Jalabert, the world's top-ranked
rider and one of the leading protesters, pulled out Wednesday and
did not participate in the discussion the riders had Thursday as
they rolled together at the start.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, too, how many favors were called in by the organizers
and how many deals were struck by them with the coaches of the 15
teams still in the race. Twenty-one teams and 198 riders began the
three-week Tour in Dublin on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal over illegal performance-enhancing drugs originally
embroiled the Festina team from France, which was expelled from the
Tour, but has since spread to TVM from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion has also fallen on Big Mat-Auber from France and the
four teams whose hotels were searched Wednesday night: ONCE from
Spain, Casino from France, La Francaise des Jeux from France and
Polti from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The rider taken into custody, Rodolfo Massi, an Italian with
Casino and the leader in the climbing competition, was still being
held, as was Nicolas Terrados, the doctor for the ONCE team. The
coach of Francaise des Jeux, Marc Madiot, was released too late to
make the start.
</P>
<P>
   Four teams withdrew Wednesday and one pulled out Thursday before
the start of the 18th of 21 daily stages, 136 miles from Aix les
Bains, France, to Neuchatel, Switzerland, as cowbells rang out to
celebrate the racers' brief incursion.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds in France were more reserved, with spectators expressing
disappointment over the annulled stage Wednesday but not anger
toward the protesting riders. In many conversations with fans, they
voiced indifference to the doping scandal and cited the special
role that the Tour has in French life and culture.
</P>
<P>
   In sunny and hot weather Thursday, the winner of the mass sprint
was Tom Steels, a Belgian with Mapei. Erik Zabel, a German with
Telekom, was second and Stuart O'Grady, an Australian with Gan, was
third. They, and 42 other members of the pack, finished in 4 hours
53 minutes 27 seconds, a speed above 27 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Pantani, an Italian with Mercatone Uno, continued to wear
the leader's yellow jersey by 5:42 over Bobby Julich, an American
with Cofidis, and by 5:56 over Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom
and the defending Tour champion.
</P>

<P>
   The previous fourth-place rider, Fernando Escartin, a Spaniard
with Kelme, was stricken from the rolls when his team joined the
three others from Spain and withdrew Thursday. Massi, the rider in
custody, had been in seventh place over all.
</P>
<P>
   Over their breakfasts of pasta mixed with eggs and wheat germ,
Julich and another American with Cofidis, Kevin Livingston, talked
about their feelings at the conduct of the race, confessing anger,
sorrow and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty by association is not the correct way of doing
things,'' Julich said. ``Just because a friend of yours steals a
car doesn't mean that you're a car thief. The problem here is being
publicly ridiculed and physically violated by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Julich and Livingston both worried about the reaction in the
United States. American riders are known for their aversion to
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a sport where we're constantly pushing ourselves
to the limit and vitamins and daily recuperation are a must,''
Julich said. ``That's why our doctors are here. There's no reason
other than that. It's a tough sport that we do, 200 kilometers a
day, day after day, and recovery is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said: ``Not too many people understand what's going
on, including us. But if it goes on like this, there won't be any
sport. It can't go on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Julich agreed. ``We're killing the sport in the most beautiful
race in the world,'' he said. ``Riders like myself have peaked
their season around this three-week period. For all this to happen
now takes away from all the hard work and sacrifices we've made.''
</P>
<P>
   As the second-place rider, Julich also worried that if he stood
on the one-two-three final victory podium in Paris, his triumph
would be devalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've worked for my whole career and it takes a
little away when, 10 years down the line, you may see an asterisk
by the result. I hope that isn't the case. I hope I've gained
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, it's only a bike race. I was looking through the
newspaper and on the page after all the stuff about the Tour de
France, there's a picture of a starving kid in Sudan.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: LAVER'S STRENGTH? NO WEAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   It seemed a perfect nickname: Rocket. For when Rod Laver was
playing top-flight tennis, and dominating his sport as few others
have _ he is the only player to win the Grand Slam twice, sweeping
all four major tournaments in 1962 and 1969 _ he looked like the
rocket's red glare.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, sure, relatively small, at 5 feet 8{ inches and 150
pounds, with a patch of red hair that resembled a rooster's comb
when in flight, a profusion of freckles, a beaklike nose, bandy
legs, left-handed and a will to reach and whack back every shot at
every conceivable angle on the court, the spectator saw a scarlet
blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as if I have a good chance tomorrow afternoon in the
final against Rocket,'' wrote Arthur Ashe, about an ATP tournament
in Philadelphia, in his book/diary, ``Arthur Ashe: Portrait in
Motion,'' published in 1975. ``But then, I always feel as if I have
a good chance against him, and most times I play a good match. The
only thing is, every time he wins. Laver has won 17 straight from
me without ever losing.'' The next day's entry began: ``18-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashe was hardly alone (though he did finally beat the
Australian, finishing his career 2-22 against him). Laver beat most
people with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Rocket's best years,'' Don Budge, the first tennis player
to win the Grand Slam, in 1938, said this week by telephone, ``John
Newcombe had a better serve and forehand, Ken Rosewall had a better
backhand, Tony Roche had a better net game. But each of them had a
weakness. Laver's strength was that he had no weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at age 59, Rocket Rod, who for years has made his
home in Newport Beach, Calif., demonstrated a weakness of a
different kind. While recording a television interview for ESPN on
the century's greatest athletes, he suffered a stroke. Laver lost
partial movement in his right hand, arm and leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible at this time to say whether he is going to
have a 100 percent recovery,'' said Neil Martin, a neurosurgeon and
director of the University of California at Los Angeles Stroke
Center, where Laver is being treated. ``But I expect a dramatic
improvement in his condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver, who has continued to participate in charity and
``Legends'' tennis events, is in ``splendid physical condition,''
added Martin, and that, he said, should aid in his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Any listing of history's greatest tennis players is subject to
the same kind of subjectivity that any list of greatest novels,
greatest movies, greatest plumbers would be. But Laver's name would
certainly merit at least serious consideration for the top tennis
spot, along with such as Tilden and Budge and Vines and Gonzalez
and Kramer and Borg and McEnroe and Connors and Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The 100 Greatest Athletes of All Time,'' Bert
Sugar listed Tilden the first male tennis player, at No. 20, and
Laver next, at No. 32. When Gene Scott's newspaper, Tennis Week,
made imaginary draw sheets of the greatest players a few years ago,
it had Pancho Gonzalez beating the Rocket in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in one of the most thrilling sports events I have
witnessed, I saw Gonzalez play Laver in a $10,000 match in Madison
Square Garden in January 1970. Laver was 31 and had just won his
second Grand Slam, Gonzalez was a 42-year-old grandfather with
graying, leonine hair. Laver went up two sets to zero _ his leaping
overhand smashes were spectacular _ and Gonzalez roared back to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, I recalled that match to Laver. ``The bloke knew
where I was going to hit the ball every time,'' Laver said.
``Pancho often played me like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not always, of course. In what Bud Collins, the peerless tennis
aficionado, called one of the most exciting matches he has seen,
Laver beat Gonzalez in 1964 in the rain at Longwood Cricket Club
outside Boston, coming back to win in four sets after losing the
first set.
</P>
<P>
   Laver reached the No. 1 ranking in the world in 1961, when he
was 23. He was in the top 10 (No. 7) as late as age 37. He played
and practiced ferociously. I remember watching him work out with a
young college player at a tennis club in Manhattan in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He began a stream of conversation with himself (sarcastic: ``Oh,
that was a good shot, Rod''), with the ball (``You rotten ball''),
with the racquet (haughty: ``The ball too high for you?''), with
the net (``Hitting your tape enough?'') and with the kid who made a
good shot (``Rats!'').
</P>
<P>
   In the final five minutes of the hour, the Rocket asked his
companion to throw up some lobs, and the red-headed Laver chased
what appeared to be a thousand tennis balls into every corner of
the court at once. It seemed the court was ablaze. It was
beautiful. &QL;

PAUL ALLEN EXPANDS CABLE HOLDINGS BY AGREEING TO BUY CHARTER
COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Mo., Ill.)   (af)  
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The billionaire investor Paul Allen on Thursday expanded his
holdings in the cable business by agreeing to buy more than 90
percent of Charter Communications, the nation's 10th largest cable
operator, for $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's company, Vulcan Ventures, already owns Marcus Cable.
Combining the two, each with about 1.2 million subscribers, would
make Allen the owner of nation's seventh-largest cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   William Savoy, the president of Vulcan, said Thursday it was
paying roughly 14 times Charter's projected cash flow. That is a
relatively high multiple in an industry in which buyers had been
paying about 12 times cash flow. Allen paid $2.8 billion for Marcus
Cable last April _ about 12.4 times cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of AT&AMP;T's deal to purchase of
Tele-Communications Inc., validating the importance of cable as a
means of delivering telephone and interactive data services to
homes, prices for cable systems have been escalating, said Sharon
Armbrust, senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a media
consulting firm. ``There seems to be a certain urgency as people
pair up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who amassed his wealth as co-founder of the Microsoft
Corp., already has other major media investments including 24
percent of Dreamworks, the film, television and record company and
a holding in USA Networks, the home shopping and television
production company. He also owns the Seattle Seahawks football team
and the Portland Trailblazers basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Savoy said he was very
bullish on the revenue that cable operators can potentially
generate from alliances with other service providers in the near
future _ in banking and shopping, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armbrust said, ``The tickler is Paul Allen's expectation of
transactional revenue if you are looking for a handle in
understanding why he is paying these multiples.''
</P>
<P>
   Savoy continued: ``Our investment strategy has been a
recognition that low-cost computing power is a very dramatic
paradigm shift from the communications chances people have had
historically. Our investment has been communications-centric, in
spite of the fact that there are some sports franchises, the bulk
of the portfolio is companies that participate in this convergence
of broadband and computer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's stake in Dreamworks was somewhat separate,
but that Allen's stake in USA Networks was related since it is in
electronic communications and offers the opportunity for
transactions on line.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy made it clear that Allen's company was still interested in
acquiring more cable operations. It is already rumored to be
interested in Century Communications, another cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy also said he was convinced there would be ``a new class of
service that consumers are willing to pay for it.'' He added, ``I
can justify these values for cable because scale is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter is a privately owned cable operator founded by Barry L.
Babcock, Jerald L. Kent and Howard L. Wood, along with the
investors Ed Gaylord of Gaylord Entertainment Co., Charterhouse
Group International and Kelso &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Although exact terms of the deal were not disclosed, Gaylord
said Thursday that it expected to receive $370 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kent said Charter had considered going public in order to let
its financial investors cash in on their investment, but chose
instead to sell.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles market, Charter and Marcus combined reach
400,000 subscribers. If Allen bought Century, that would add
800,000 subscribers in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Charter and Marcus also have systems in Dallas, and Charter has
systems in Missouri and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus will serve as chairman of the combined cable company and
Kent will become president.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's discussions with Charter were reported Wednesday by
Broadcasting and Cable magazine. News of his purchase Thursday
strengthened the shares of publicly traded cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision Systems Inc. rose $3.375, to $82.75; Comcast Corp.
increased $1.9375, to $46.8125; Cox Communications Inc. gained
$2.3125, to $49.375, and Adelphia Communications Corp. soared
$6.125, to $39.625.

MARKET GAINS REVERSE SUMMER SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rose sharply Thursday, ending a two-day
losing streak and pushing the Dow Jones industrial average back
above 9,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gains came with heavy trading volume and reversed a volatile
summer slump that in the last weeks had seen most of the major
indexes fall more than 4 percent from all-time highs set earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Dow rose 111.99 points, or 1.26 percent, to
9,026.95, leaving the blue-chip barometer about 300 points below
its all-time high of 9,337.97, which was set on July 17. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also gained sharply, climbing
17.74 points, or 1.58 percent, to 1,142.95.
</P>
<P>
   Although investors continue to be jittery about signs that
profit growth is slowing, Wall Street analysts said prices had been
beaten down too sharply in the last few weeks and that share prices
were ripe for a recovery Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a rubber-band situation,'' said Larry Wachtel, a
market strategist at Prudential Securities. ``We took the Dow down
about 500 points. But this is the biggest and best bull market in
history. It doesn't just go away on a random day in July.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel and other analysts said that although earnings had been
less than spectacular, there had been some bright spots. On
Thursday, for example, Clorox, one of the largest consumer products
companies, said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit soared 32 percent,
well above analysts' expectations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, profit growth in the second quarter has been anemic. With
reports in from about 80 percent of the companies that make up the
S&AMP; P 500, operating profits have risen just 1.7 percent from the
period a year earlier. In the first quarter, profit growth was
equally meager, at 1.3 percent, according to IBES International,
which tracks corporate earnings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The result has been the weakest profit growth in the first half
since 1991. Expectations for the third quarter are also being
trimmed, and that has many investors worried.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot, however, is a healthy economy with low interest
rates and strong retail sales, which are helping offset the sharp
economic downturn in Asia. Many investors are also betting that
profit growth will recover later this year or next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed market strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said in her weekly report this week that the
most serious concerns revolve around Asia, but that she expected
the economies in that region to stabilize and to see U.S. corporate
profits re-accelerate in 1999. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen views the current sluggishness in the U.S. stock
market as part of a ``choppy trading range'' that has persisted
since April. As for second-quarter earnings, she said, ``So far, so
good,'' noting that most companies have reported results that
exceed consensus estimates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, some of the biggest gainers were technology stocks,
which have been clobbered in recent days, following sharp gains in
the early part of the summer. The Nasdaq composite index, which is
heavy with high-tech stocks, soared 38.09 points, gaining more than
2 percent Thursday, to 1,919.58. Microsoft, Intel, Dell Computer
and Cisco Systems all rose sharply. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Taylor, the chief investment strategist at United
States Trust Co., said investors had soured on many stocks in
recent weeks, and that it was simply time for them to start buying
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Things had become so negative,'' he said. ``And when there's a
consensus on the negative side, people start moving to buy again.
That's how the market works technically.''

JETS' YOUNG PUNTER IS EITHER HIT OR MISS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ This is not the time of year for a punter _
even a punter whose youth is so prized by Coach Bill Parcells of
the Jets _ to be shanking his kicks.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Nick Gallery booms one of his 70-yarders _ that's
right, 70 yards _ and his teammates whistle in admiration on the
sideline, he will come right back and shank a 25-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went during Thursday's morning workout, at which
attention was paid to special teams: Gallery, the little-known
23-year-old from Iowa whom Parcells refers to as ``the outhouse or
the castle,'' vs. the oldest Jet, 37-year-old Brian Hansen.
Parcells has been so solicitous of Hansen's age that he does not
abuse him by making him punt too often.
</P>
<P>
   You do not get too many boomers from Hansen, but then again, you
do not get squibs. He was in the middle of the National Football
League pack last year with a net punting average of 35.3 yards. His
overall average was 43.2, but the net is what is important to
Parcells, and he would like at least a 37.
</P>
<P>
   Gallery was on the Jets' practice squad for part of last season.
And he caught the coach's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are two positions in my career I'm spoiled about,''
Parcells explained, ``it's punters and tight ends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's exactly what I think of the punting now,'' he said.
``If Brian were the punter, we'd be in the middle third of the
league, which is where we were last year. I think the other guy
could be the outhouse or the castle. With him you see a chance to
improve your punting a substantial amount. But I don't want some of
his punts hitting my earphones.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants, Parcells pointed out, the outstanding punter
was Dave Jennings followed by Sean Landeta, a boomer. Jennings, now
a broadcaster, reflected on punting life under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I punted for him two years when he was head coach,'' Jennings
said. ``What he demanded was production _ the same as he demands
from anyone. Then, in 1985, I was 33 years old and he told me he
wanted to go with a younger player. I had one of my best camps. But
he cut me for Sean Landeta. The next day I became a Jet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen was briefly an ex-Jet last year when Parcells first told
him he was too old. But a week before the season, after Parcells
had actually cut Hansen in favor of the rookie Todd Kurz, Hansen
was brought back. Kurz was too inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being very realistic about this,'' Hansen said Thursday.
``I know they're considering getting rid of me. I guess I wasn't
even supposed to be here in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen also has a philosophical view of his chances. ``I don't
know if I'm competing,'' he said, ``as much as it's up to Nick. I'm
kind of an insurance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite their 9-7 record, their housecleaning and their
attitude adjustment, the Jets remain a team in transition. And
their coach, looking everywhere for youth, is as grouchy as ever.
Bill Parcells looked at the films of Wednesday's scrimmage, and
took it out on several players on Thursday. It is getting close to
showtime: the Jets will open their preseason schedule at
Philadelphia next Thursday. Parcells was especially hard on Jerald
Sowell, the second-year player the coach wants to be his fullback
over 34-year-old Keith Byars. But Sowell did not block so well
during the scrimmage, and in front of his teammates on Thursday
morning, Parcells shouted at him, ``You're one of those guys good
enough to get on the team and not good enough to play. I know you
have the ability, but this is what held you back at Tulane.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Quarterback Glenn Foley, after being told he had Parcells'
``benefit of the doubt'' as the top quarterback: ``I'd like to have
a definition of `benefit of the doubt.''' &QL;

MEDICATION THAT CAN HELP STIFLE THE URGE TO DRINK

trials for the drug acamprosate is being sent to NYT graphic

(js) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug widely available in Europe that may reduce the urge to
drink is being tested in the United States, which has an estimated
13.7 million alcoholics. Its French maker hopes to have it on the
U.S. market in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts on dependency say the drug _ acamprosate, which
would be sold in the United States as Campral _ is badly needed.
Only two other medications can treat alcoholism, and both can have
unpleasant or potentially dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say they can prescribe acamprosate to help alcoholics
remain sober, possibly saving thousands of people from painful
relapses while reducing the cost of rehabilitation, which was $5
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Acamprosate's expected arrival, though, has ignited a
controversy in the health-care community, pitting specialists who
argue that alcoholics should be treated with counseling alone
against doctors who insist that drugs are crucial tools.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has become rousing at times, with acamprosate's
champions deriding opponents for their ``medieval'' outlook.
Advocates of drug-free treatments say their approach has worked for
decades; why take chances?
</P>
<P>
   Acamprosate's maker, Lipha SA, a subsidiary of the German drug
maker Merck KGaA, is undeterred. It plans to take on a U.S.
marketing partner and stress acamprosate's success rate.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 clinical trials with 3,338 alcohol-dependent patients in
Europe, 50 percent of those patients using acamprosate abstained
for three months _ the period when alcoholics are most likely to
regress _ compared with 39 percent of those using a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. trial, with 600 alcohol-dependent patients at 21 sites
nationwide, should be completed early next year. Lipha officials
are so excited about acamprosate's benefits that they hope it will
eventually be available over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acamprosate has been shown to help prevent relapse,'' said Dr.
Karl Mann, a professor of medicine at the University of Tubingen,
who conducted the trial in Germany. ``Once patients give up alcohol
and go on with their lives, they see it, smell it, dream about it.
Acamprosate helps them get through all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors hope acamprosate will become popular because it is cheap
and simple to take. In France, the average cost is $1.94 a pill,
about the same as a red wine at the local bistro. Patients take two
500-milligram pills in the morning and two more at night; the main
side effect is mild diarrhea, which usually goes away after several
days.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, American Home Products' Antabuse, introduced in
1951, can be toxic if the patient drinks enough alcohol, while
naltrexone, made by DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical, can cause liver
damage if prescribed in too high a dose.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is no substitute for detoxification. A patient's
alcoholism must be treated before it can do any good. But moderate
drinkers might also turn to it to try to control their drinking.

 UNDATED: their drinking.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some patients, acamprosate has worked well. Diagnosed with
breast cancer in 1981, Gudrum Hellinger, a 57-year-old school
secretary who lives near Munich, Germany, began sipping wine and
Champagne to cheer her mood. Ms. Hellinger gradually became a heavy
drinker and tried repeatedly to quit, always failing within about
two months. In 1995, she became suicidal and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took acamprosate for six months,'' Ms. Hellinger said.
``I've been sober for three years. I just didn't want a drink
anymore when I was on acamprosate. I don't think I could have given
up drinking without it. But you need more than the drug to do it.
I'm still in counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors, however, noting that only two other medications
for alcoholism have been introduced here since 1951, have renewed
their criticism of the pharmaceutical industry for not developing
more drugs to help addicts through withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The captains of large drug companies won't spend money on
medications to treat alcoholism, doctors say, because addicts
frequently do not take their drugs. Other patients simply make
better customers. As evidence, doctors note that while only 1.8
million American men were treated for erectile dysfunction last
year, according to IMS Health, an industry consultant, six new
treatments are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as many Americans were treated for alcoholism last year _
1.4 million, according to addiction experts _ but only two drugs,
including acamprosate, were being developed to aid withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies ``wouldn't get their money back from these
drugs,'' said Dr. Herbert Kleber, medical director of the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   For acamprosate's advocates, the strangest twist in the
controversy is that the debate exists at all. Alcoholism, after
all, is a devastating illness, one that tears families apart, ruins
careers and kills tens of thousands of people a year. A study by
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that
alcoholism and its treatment cost U.S. businesses $67.7 billion in
lost productivity in 1992, the latest statistics available.
Treatment is not cheap, either: a two-week stay in a clinic can
easily cost $450 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen percent of the U.S. population will be dependent on
alcohol at one time in their lives,'' said Barbara Mason, director
of the Division of Substance Abuse at the University of Miami
School of Medicine and the principal investigator of the nation's
clinical trials on acamprosate.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts call the synthetic drug a therapeutic breakthrough.
Invented by Lipha in 1980, acamprosate, also known as calcium
acetylhomotaurine, is thought to work by restoring normal activity
on certain neurotransmitters in the brain that become overexcited
by the withdrawal of alcohol. This hyperactivity can last a year,
experts say, leaving the alcoholic prone to relapse.
</P>
<P>
   But in the European studies, the drug remained somewhat
effective over time. The percentage of patients who took
acamprosate and abstained from drinking fell to 35 percent after
six months and 33 percent after a year. The number of people who
took placebos yet still stayed off alcohol declined to 23 percent
after six months and 21 percent after a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the higher success rate for those taking the drug is
encouraging. Lipha officials are confident that acamprosate will be
profitable in the United States despite a limited market. Sales of
alcohol withdrawal drugs in the United States totaled a modest $21
million last year, according to IMS Health, largely because of the
side effects of available drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big potential market,'' said Dr. Sylvie Chabac,
international strategic product manager for Lipha.
</P>
<P>
   For some researchers, acamprosate is more than just a promising
treatment _ it is an important new weapon in the arsenal against a
double addiction of alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, research has shown a strong link between heavy
smoking and drinking. An 11-year study by the Mayo Clinic showed
that those with a dual addiction were far more likely to die from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leading cause of death among alcoholics who smoke is lung
cancer,'' said Dr. David Lewis, director of the Center for Alcohol
and Addiction Studies at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Even with acamprosate's benefits, no one is passing it off as a
magic bullet. Experts insist that patients should also undergo
counseling and maintain it long after they are sober. Critics also
note that the drug is of no use in detoxification and that it has
never been proved to reduce a craving for alcohol, even though
patients repeatedly contend that it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a stigma that alcoholism is a moral weakness,''
said Dr. Richard Fuller, director of clinical and prevention
research at the alcoholism institute. ``I find it very distressing.
Alcoholism has a biological basis like hypertension. We treat that
with medications. Why can't you treat alcoholism the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   That argument, however, does not sit well with some clinicians.
``Alcoholics should not be given drugs, unless it is to treat an
organic illness like diabetes,'' said Dr. Joseph Pursch, who is
best known for treating Betty Ford and Billy Carter for alcoholism.
``All these drugs _ Xanax, Valium _ that doctors prescribe for
alcoholics can be addicting. What good is it to switch dependence
from one drug to another?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an import from France may be alcoholics' best hope for a
new medication. A 1995 report by the Institute of Medicine found
that U.S. drug and biotech companies avoided developing drugs for
addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasons: Many doctors would probably refuse to prescribe
them, many patients would probably decline to take them and
insurers might balk at reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry denies that it has neglected drugs for
addictions, noting that 19 such medications are under development,
including one for alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kleber, an author of the Institute of Medicine report, said
he was frustrated by the industry's inertia. ``I'm just glad we may
get acamprosate,'' he said. ``God knows we have a gazillion
antidepressants. Now at least we'll have more than one drug to
treat alcoholism.''

LEWINSKY DRESS TO BE TESTED FOR DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Probe-Dilemma)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr turned over a
dress owned by Monica Lewinsky to the FBI Thursday, with the
expectation that laboratory analysts would search for DNA evidence
that might provide proof of a sexual encounter between President
Clinton and the former White House intern, a source close to
Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has told Starr the dress contains a stain caused by
Clinton that could prove that she engaged in a sexual relationship
with the president, the source said. Lewinsky has saved the dress
for months without cleaning the stain, the source said, thus
preserving proof of at least one sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the dress, which had been previously reported,
then denied, then long rumored, took on renewed importance Thursday
as the possible tie-breaking evidence in what many observers
believe will become a classic he said/she said showdown between
Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky spent part of Thursday meeting with prosecutors from
Starr's office, providing greater details of her likely testimony
when she appears before the federal grand jury, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with her testimony said Lewinsky could appear
before the grand jury as early as next week, but more likely the
following week. She was given a sweeping form of immunity on
Tuesday, and as part of that arrangement with Starr, she turned the
dress over to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also gave prosecutors some tape-recorded telephone
messages from Clinton that are not expected to be particularly
incriminating, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI took possession of the dress, Clinton was touring
North Carolina, unveiling an environmental initiative involving
river preservation. He ignored reporters' shouted questions on his
own testimony and the Lewinsky immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are low level rumblings in the White House about
the possibility of Clinton making a public statement after
providing his secret grand jury testimony on August 17. Some
Clinton aides believe it is essential that Clinton tell the nation
the details of his testimony, if only because his chief nemesis,
Starr, will have the opportunity to do exactly that when he files a
report to the Congress on his findings in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   However, in prior proceedings when Clinton has supplied
testimony from the White House his aides usually release a one-line
statement simply acknowledging the event. For now, aides said,
there is no immediate plan to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If past is prologue, and it usually is, he won't be saying
anything,'' said Paul Begala. ``But that's still 18 days away.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the dress, as well as Clinton's upcoming testimony,
seemed to raise the stakes in the unwinding investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that after six months of silent strategizing,
Clinton is now left with just two options: Repeat his denial of a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky to the grand jury, or admit to an
affair and, in effect, confess to the federal crime of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Those analysts and his own advisers said the absolute worst
political and legal strategy Clinton could pursue would be to
compound a prior lie about his relationship with Lewinsky with a
fresh one before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The venue of the grand jury, analysts said, is far more serious
than any civil proceeding, especially a suit which has since been
dismissed as the Paula Jones sexual harassment case was. The
penalty for such a lie, analysts added, would be far more severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors take perjury in a grand jury much more seriously
than in a civil deposition,'' said Bob Ullman, a partner at the
Boston law firm of Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish and a former federal
prosecutor. ``In my experience, perjury in a civil case is rarely
prosecuted. And prosecuting perjury in a dismissed civil case is
unheard of. Prosecuting perjury in a grand jury is done every
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal advisers are sending out initial signals that
the president does not plan to deviate from his adamant denial in
January, when he told Jones lawyers he did not have an affair with
Lewinsky, then declared to the public, ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.'' It is the truth, his advisers say, and
it will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the dress, there is also the expectation of reams of
circumstantial evidence gleaned from White House visitor logs and
testimony from the likes of Clinton's personal secretary, his close
friends, including Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan, and the Secret
Service agents assigned to watch him all day and all night. And
there will also be the testimony of Lewinsky herself, who
reportedly plans to tell the grand jurors that she carried on a
lengthy affair with the president and discussed ways with him to
keep it a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Among Clinton allies on the inside and outside of the White
House, there is a general sense of jubilation that he has agreed to
testify to the grand jury and hastened the completion of the Starr
investigation, which has virtually rendered their domestic policy
agenda dormant for the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those allies, speaking on a not-for-attribution basis, said that
even if Clinton admits to a lie in the Jones deposition and says he
had a sexual affair or an encounter with Lewinsky, he will survive
both politically and legally. The public, they said, has already
accepted the possibility Clinton has lied.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are well aware of the latest wave of poll
results which seem to provide a foundation to this belief. Fully
two-thirds of those asked in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released
Thursday said they believe it was definitely or probably true that
Clinton had some form of sexual relations with Lewinsky. Only 24
percent of those polled believed that if Clinton had tried to
obstruct justice, it would be a matter serious enough for Congress
to consider impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the poll gave Clinton a 65 percent approval
rating -- a remarkly high figure for a second term president facing
what his critics have said is a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If he admits wrongdoing, some advisers inside and outside the
White House said, he would have to address the nation, apologize
for his indiscretions and vow to return to the business of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of that view, coupled with a queasiness over the
sexual nature of the probe, was echoed widely on Capitol Hill,
among Republicans and Democrats alike, who have said repeatedly
they do not want to be presented with a case solely about the
president's sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Republicans are looking forward to a Judiciary
Committee hearing on the president's sex life,'' said Rep. Martin
Meehan of Massachusetts, a member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   All along, critics have said that the far more serious charge
that can be levied against Clinton will be obstruction of justice.
But legal analysts said that even if the dress does reveal DNA
evidence, obstruction charges will be difficult, at best, to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky reportedly has told Starr's prosecutors that she
discussed with the president possible scenarios about keeping their
affair secret. In addition, Clinton seemed to take great pains to
help Lewinsky land a job in New York City, even involving Jordan
and the US ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, in
the search.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Washington lawyer Stanley Brand, ``It's very hard
making an obstruction case. It's usually in the mafia, and it's an
explicit, `I'll break your legs' kind of thing.''

SOX DEAL, GET DEALT A LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ As zero hour nears for the trading deadline,
Steve Avery knows the clock could be approaching midnight for him,
too.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight start, the Red Sox lefthander failed to
make it past the third inning, this time in a 6-5 loss to Oakland
Thursday that simultaneously ended a four-game Boston winning
streak and a nine-game A's losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Avery had little choice but to acknowledge that
if general manager Dan Duquette deals for another pitcher, he could
lose his spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that helps the team is great,'' said Avery, who
walked four and gave up four hits in 2 2/3 innings before being
yanked with Oakland leading, 4-1, and well on the way to its first
win against Boston in eight meetings. ``I think I've done a pretty
fair job until the last couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much leeway I'll get, but I'm not happy that
I've lost a couple of times while the team has been playing some
good ball. I'm going to do everything I can to change it and keep
hoping that I'll get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams wasn't prepared to say Avery could be
dropped from the rotation, even though he has yielded 15 runs (13
earned) in his last three starts, but it is not Williams's style to
tip anything off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other pitchers have gone through the same thing,'' Williams
said. ``I'm sure Cy Young went through it, too, though I don't
remember. There isn't a pitcher who hasn't gone through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Avery isn't Williams's only concern. The lefthander
might have been spared his fourth loss against seven wins,
especially after the Red Sox scored three times in the eighth, two
runs coming on Nomar Garciaparra's fourth home run in the last five
games and 21st of the season. But by then, Rich Garces had given up
his third tape-measure homer in barely a week, Matt Stairs taking
El Guapo over the center-field fence for a two-run shot that made
it 6-2 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Garces has bone chips in his right elbow that will require
surgery after the season and keep him from pitching in back-to-back
games. But he has now been scored upon in each of his last five
appearances, which raises questions about how much he can
contribute down the stretch after playing such a valuable role to
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' Garces said, continuing to downplay his condition.
``I was so worried about the runner on first base (Mike Neill),
keeping him from stealing a base, that I left the pitch up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a split-fingered pitch that didn't break until it cleared
the wall. The home run by ex-Sox substitute Stairs was his
team-leading 16th of the season, but it was runner-up for longest
home run of the day.
</P>
<P>
   That distinctionbelonged to Billy Ashley, the peroxide giant
who is seen less often than Wally the Green Monster and may become
even less visible now that the Red Sox are bringing back Mike
Stanley to serve as the righthanded DH.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley, who has had only 24 at-bats in the five weeks since he
was promoted after the Jim Leyritz trade, cleared the left-field
bleachers in the fifth with his third homer, meaning he homers
almost as frequently as the Great McGwire. But Ashley also whiffed
twice against lefty starter Kenny Rogers, giving him 11 strikeouts,
or virtually one every two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   And in the ninth inning, when the game could have been tied with
one swing of the bat, Ashley was lifted for a pinch hitter, Darren
Bragg, who lined out to shortstop against righthander Billy Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley could be headed for a return trip to Pawtucket, though he
would seem to have some usefulness as a righthanded pinch hitter,
with Keith Mitchell sent back to the PawSox instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crossed my mind,'' Ashley said when asked whether he
thought his days with Boston were numbered. ``Whether via trade,
though I haven't heard that anybody's interested, I don't know
where this leaves me. I'd love to stay and contribute. These guys
are great, and we still have a very good chance of being in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I wasn't able to do more for myself to get in
on a more frequent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, it's on to Anaheim for a reunion with Stanley and a
three-game set with the Angels, a possible playoff opponent. All
the while, the Sox will be keeping an eye on the scoreboard,
because the Orioles Thursday won for the 17th time in 20 games and
have shaved their wild-card deficit from 15 1/2 to eight games in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez, Red Sox Nation turns its lonely eyes to you.

TURF STARS' SCHEDULE TO SEE CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When it comes to turf-course racing, California
grass is usually best. Of the past 18 national champions in the
male and female turf divisions, 12 won major stakes in the state
where grass is green year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The local circuit's turf-stakes schedule is in for some changes
because of the cancellation of the 1998 Arlington Million (which is
gone for good if Arlington International racetrack doesn't reopen
in '99) and the addition of a fillies-and-mares turf race to the
Breeders' Cup program (starting in '99).
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Million, which has been run in late August,
might prompt Del Mar to move the Eddie Read Handicap to the end of
the summer season or raise the purse for the Del Mar Invitational
Handicap. Either change could only help the track by keeping local
stars in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup change will force changes in two major
late-season stakes for fillies and mares. The Yellow Ribbon Stakes
will have to move from the end to the beginning of the autumn Oak
Tree meeting at Santa Anita, where it would serve as a
steppingstone to the Breeders' Cup race. The Matriarch, at
Hollywood Park in November, will shorten up to 1[ miles from 1\
miles, the distance of the Breeders' Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the local effect of the Arlington Million's absence
is likely to be seen in a stronger-than-usual field for the
$250,000 Del Mar Invitational on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be seen in the $300,000 Eddie Read Handicap on Sunday,
which combines with the $300,000 Ramona Handicap for fillies and
mares on Saturday to form one of Del Mar's biggest weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Among the challengers for top-weighted Labeeb (121 pounds) and
Hawksley Hill (120) is only one out-of-towner, Subordination (117),
the New York 4-year-old who won the Hollywood Derby in November.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Drysdale trains both Labeeb and Hawksley Hill. Drysdale
could have a huge weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Fiji, the nation's top-ranked turf filly, in the
Ramona and it appears he'll let her run despite being unhappy with
the weight assignments under which Fiji's 125 is seven more than
next-highest Different.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Legal dance: &LR;  Laws prohibit the California Horse Racing Board
from identifying trainers suspected of medication violations until
an investigation is complete, but not from announcing Thursday that
accusations are being drafted against seven trainers whose horses
tested positive for clenbuterol.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers are being told privately that follow-up tests of
urine samples confirmed initial results, and no timetable has been
set for making the names public, the CHRB said. However, state
agents are known to have searched the barns of Bruce Headley,
Robert Marshall, Darrell Vienna and Ted West.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 20 horses tested positive for the drug, which aids
breathing and thus can improve performance, following races at
Hollywood Park, Golden Gate Fields and Cal-Expo in Sacramento
between May 16 and July 11, the CHRB said.
</P>
<P>
   Clenbuterol became legal this year under FDA regulations,
meaning it may be used in training. But it's still prohibited in
post-race samples, and improved tests can find left-over traces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seasons change: &LR;  Last summer, when Kent Desormeaux won the Del
Mar riding title, he gave credit to leading trainer Bob Baffert,
for whom Desormeaux was the regular jockey.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gary Stevens has first call in the Baffert barn, and
Desormeaux has been feeling the effects. He needed 21 tries to ring
up his first Del Mar winner on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Baffert hasn't been doing much better. He won once
with 11 starters last week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More 'Mo: &LR;  The good news for Desormeaux is that he'll keep
riding Real Quiet while Stevens sticks with Victory Gallop for the
Aug. 9 Haskell Invitational at Saratoga. It was up to Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet was assigned 126 pounds for the Haskell. Victory
Gallop, who nosed him out of the Triple Crown in the Belmont
Stakes, gets 125. Coronado's Quest gets 124.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More Baffert: &LR;  The latest on Silver Charm is that he'll stay in
light training while Baffert looks for signs that he's ready to
race again. But the Aug. 15 Pacific Classic at Del Mar is
definitely out.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm finished last on Saturday in the San Diego Handicap
won by Mud Route. A post-race exam showed a mild case of
respiratory bleeding. Baffert thought the trouble might stem from
the colt's fever and antibiotics treatment the week he pulled out
of the Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Another thought: Silver Charm is only the latest horse who seems
to not be quite the same after making the long trip to the $4
million Dubai World Cup. He won the race against some of the
world's best in March.
</P>
<P>
   Might trainers think twice before sending their horses halfway
around the globe in the future?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sit on it: &LR;  The Kentucky Derby prep race formerly known as the
Jim Beam Stakes has a new sponsor and a clumsy new name for at
least the next three years. It's the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Turfway Park in Florence, Ky., announced a deal under which the
Houston-based furniture company will put up $500,000 of the
$750,000 purse. Gallery is owned by James McIngvale, a horse owner
who made his shaky reputation in the sport by capriciously firing a
series of trainers last spring.
</P>
<P>
   If McIngvale expects people to walk around saying, ``I love a
horse in the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes,'' he's got another thing
.coming. &QL;

PROSECUTORS SEEK GENETIC TESTING OF LEWINSKY'S DRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-MEDIA, CLINTON-PERJURY) 
(sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors are seeking genetic testing of a dress
belonging to Monica Lewinsky that she says contains physical
evidence of a sexual encounter with President Clinton, according to
lawyers close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky turned over the dress to the office of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr on Wednesday, lawyers said. It had been kept
for the past seven months in the New York apartment of Ms.
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, putting her in jeopardy of an
obstruction of justice charge for concealing evidence that
prosecutors had sought on a search of Ms. Lewinsky's Watergate
apartment earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs. Lewis were given broad grants of immunity
from prosecution this week in exchange for providing full accounts
of Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the president. They also agreed
to turn over evidence, including the dress and answering machine
tapes containing messages to Ms. Lewinsky from the president, the
lawyers said..
</P>
<P>
   The messages were innocuous, according to a lawyer who has heard
them. In one, just before Christmas last year, the president told
Ms. Lewinsky that the brother of his private secretary, Betty
Currie, had died. In another, the lawyer said, Clinton said, ``Hey,
it's me. Sorry I missed you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky met for several hours with prosecutors at an
undisclosed location on Thursday afternoon in preparation for her
grand jury testimony, which could begin as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The president has maintained a resolute silence on the Lewinsky
matter since late January, when he vehemently denied a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and said that he had not told anyone
to lie under oath. Since then, the White House strategy has been to
delay the investigation with as many legal roadblocks as could be
constructed while seeking to undermine the legitimacy and fairness
of Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision to submit to grand jury questioning
came after numerous requests from Starr over a period of months,
culminating in a subpoena issued on July 17. Many of the
president's advisers urged him to resist or ignore the subpoena,
but he decided that giving testimony now was the quickest way to
bring the investigation to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the grand jury will hear Clinton's explanation
two weeks from Monday, there is no sign that the president is
prepared to speak to the American people on the matter any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no reference to the Lewinsky matter on a trip to
North Carolina on Thursday, ignoring shouted questions and not
addressing the issue in a speech on the environment and later at a
political fund-raising dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said the president is
scheduled to make an announcement on the economy Friday in the
White House Rose Garden and may take questions from reporters that
would almost certainly concern the revelations of the past several
days.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president would decide whether to answer
questions ``depending on how hot it is out there.'' He was not
referring to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry said that Clinton had no intention of speaking to
the news media or the American public in any detail in the next two
weeks about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky or about any of the
other questions arising from the months-long perjury and
obstruction-of-justice investigation being conducted by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all talked about it,'' McCurry said. ``He clearly has to
testify and he has to stay focused on that. Until we know what the
testimony is, none of us is in a position to give advice on what he
should say publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on what Ms. Lewinsky tells the grand jury when she
testifies and whether other testimony and physical evidence
supports her story.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's dress may be sent to an FBI forensics lab to
determine whether there is a stain containing Clinton's semen, as
lawyers familiar with the case say that Ms. Lewinsky has asserted.
Such a stain would retain DNA material for many years, unless the
dress has been cleaned with detergents, according to experts in DNA
testing. Dry cleaning alone would not remove it, nor would storage
under poor conditions, they said.
</P>
<P>
   If semen is found on the dress, prosecutors then would likely
seek a saliva or blood sample from the president to determine
whether it matched. The tests are extremely reliable, according to
prosecutors and defense lawyers who use DNA testing in trials.
</P>
<P>
   With modern instruments and computers, matching could be
completed in a matter of days, according to Barry Scheck, a
prominent New York defense attorney and an expert on genetic
testing. He served as a consultant for the defense in the O.J.
Simpson murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no sperm on the dress, that's the end of the
hysteria,'' Scheck said. ``If there is, there is no legal basis for
the president to resist giving a DNA sample, a simple swab from the
inside his cheek.'' The entire process could be completed in 72
hours, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To keep the results secret until Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony to
set a ``perjury trap'' for the president would be unfair to Clinton
and bad for the nation, Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, stung by accusations that his office leaked sensitive
grand jury material to the media, issued a two-sentence statement
on Thursday with Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers denying that they were the
source of news accounts this week about Ms. Lewinsky's proposed
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported this week that Ms. Lewinsky told members of
the independent counsel's office that she had had a sexual
relationship with Clinton, despite both of their denials under oath
in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones against
Clinton. It has also been disclosed that Ms. Lewinsky is willing to
testify that she and Clinton agreed they would deny the
relationship to keep it private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, Jacob A. Stein and Plato Cacheris,
and the Office of Independent Counsel met for the specific and
mutually shared purpose of preventing the dissemination of
speculative information concerning the OIC's investigation and its
dealings with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the statement said. ``Suggestions in
the media that Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers or the OIC are the source of
such information are untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The procession of witnesses before the grand jury continued on
Thursday, with seven Secret Service officers appearing before two
separate panels at the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has sought the officers' testimony to determine whether or
when Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together in the White
House or whom else she might have seen during her 37 White House
visits after she left her job there in April 1996.

 &HT;    Political riptide washes away in N.C.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST JEFFERSON, N.C._ Along a pastoral stretch of the ancient
New River overflowing with Democrats, bluegrass music and the
excitement of a first-time presidential visit, President Clinton
escaped Thursday from the political uproar rising from his
relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd vote for you again, Bill,'' a young woman yelled from the
crowd of several thousand who crammed a narrow spit of farmland
next to the South Fork of the New River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you,'' another shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, smiling and brushing a hand through his thick silver
hair, ignored those calls. But he acknowledged others with waves
and brisk salutes amid the kind of hooting and hollering that these
mountain folk typically reserve for fine fiddle playing.
</P>
<P>
   In this traditionally Democratic corner of North Carolina that
bumps against Virginia and Tennessee, people seemed mildly offended
by the mention of Lewinsky on this historic day for their revered
river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people hear about all that trash, the more they like
him,'' said Nancy Vannoy, 71, who traveled with her husband, Fred,
from the nearby Todd community. ``They're plumb disgusted with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, White House Chief of Staff
Erskine Bowles and North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt arrived by
helicopter to honor the New River, which begins as the South Fork
and North Fork in northwestern North Carolina. In a geological
oddity for a North American river, it flows northward rather than
southward, through Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's motorcade arrived in a rush of rock music blaring from
speakers and flashing lights atop police cars. Clinton remained in
his vehicle for a few minutes, as security agents and dogs searched
a grove of trees on a hill overlooking the speaking platform. Then
the president arrived on stage dressed casually in two shades of
green.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of a spell of speeches that went on so long
that some old-timers grew faint in the muggy heat, Clinton signed a
document declaring the New River and 13 other U.S. waterways as the
country's first American Heritage Rivers. The rivers are now
eligible for federal money for further environmental protection and
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ancient river has flowed through this and for millions of
years, hundreds of millions of years,'' said Clinton, predicting
generations from now people will fish and paddle on the same gently
flowing waters as the Cherokees did centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   A cool breeze moved across the lush ridge on the other side of
the river, bringing a burst of rain that began falling just as
Clinton and his entourage disappeared from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Childress, 43, of Jefferson, praised Clinton for his
efforts to improve education, health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing his job, and as long as he is doing it well, leave
the poor guy alone,'' she said. ``It's a shame that people can't
leave his private life alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe McKenzie, 70, chairman of the Democratic Party in Sullivan
County, Tenn., reached back 24 summers to explain why he believes
Clinton's opponents are hoping to catch the president in a lie
about his relationship with the young White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans cannot forget about Nixon, and they want to
get even,'' said McKenzie, wearing a red badge endorsing Gore for
president in 2000. In 1974, President Nixon resigned rather than
face impeachment proceedings for his involvement in the Watergate
scandal. Back in West Jefferson, standing along the roadside where
they thought Clinton's motorcade would pass, two men held a
hand-painted banner. It read, ``America turn back! God must turn
his back_ or say sorry to Sodom!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This pretty much tells you how we feel about the Monica
Lewinsky scandal and the other things that President Clinton has
done,'' said Michael J. Woodman, the bishop of El Shechinah
Churches International, a Christian denomination based in Roanoke,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, along the president's route, elementary school teacher
Linda Ball decorated the doorway of her granite home in red, white
and blue letters spelling, ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is coming to honor the oldest river,'' said
Ball, who invited friends and family members to watch the motorcade
in lawn chairs in her shady yard.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children were eager to talk about what they knew
about the Lewinsky matter, but before they had a chance, a mother
scolded, ``Keep quiet, Seth.''

 &HT;    Stamping out breast cancer
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- What better way to help stamp out breast cancer
than a breast cancer stamp?
</P>
<P>
   A new first-class stamp that will provide money for breast
cancer research went on sale Thursday in the Miami Valley and
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp, which sells for 40 cents, costs 8 cents more than a
first-class letter stamp. The additional 8 cents will be divided 70
percent-30 percent between the National Institutes of Health and
the Department of Defense's Medical Research Program for breast
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the U.S. Postal Service has issued a
``semipostal,'' a first-class stamp with added cost. About 200
million of the stamps will be printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' says Judy Frost, 54, a five-year
breast cancer survivor from Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect them to find a cure in my lifetime and I believe
research is very important,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Jones, a postal clerk in downtown Dayton, says
customers began asking for the stamp Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   She believes many Americans will be willing to spend the
additional 8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women for sure, and some men that have wives or relatives or
friends (who've had breast cancer) and know what they've gone
through,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp, in green, blue, yellow and orange, features a drawing
of a woman with the slogan ``Fund the Fight, Find A Cure.'' It was
designed by cancer survivor Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, Md., and
illustrated by Whitney Sherman of Baltimore.

ENERGIZED AS TEACHER, COACH AND CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ At 27, Lea Loveless Maurer is a
world-champion swimmer. A high school teacher and coach. A wife.
And happy with the entire package.
</P>
<P>
   In the world championships in Australia in January, she won the
100-meter backstroke. She teaches freshman and sophomore English at
Lake Forest High School outside Chicago and coaches its boys' and
girls' swimming teams. She gets coaching help from her husband,
Erik, whom she met at Stanford when both were collegiate champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erik knows I'm still swimming as part of my life, not as my
whole life,'' Maurer said. ``He understands the balance I have. He
knows I need to be flexible. But I have no expectations. I do this
one step at a time. I don't know when it will end. Sooner or later,
I won't have the energy to do what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, at the Nassau County Goodwill Games Swimming and Diving
Center, she has had plenty of energy. She is a co-captain of the
United States women's team. In the novel four-team dual-meet
format, she helped the Americans rout China, 88-34, on Tuesday
night and swam against the World All-Stars Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   When she started at 9, Lea (pronounced Lee) Loveless became a
swimming prodigy from Crestwood. Her career was honed in the
50-yard pool of the Badger Swim Club in New Rochelle, where Coach
John Collins put the 13-year-old in the same practice lane as a
male backstroker, Rick Carey, who won three gold medals in the 1984
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would lap me twice over 400 meters,'' she recalled. ``But I
was very young and he taught me a lot of stuff. He taught me to
keep aware of what I do well and what I want to do the most. He
taught me to swim hard every day, read a lot, keep on top of my
academics.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned. She has won seven national titles. She won a gold
medal and a bronze medal in the 1992 Olympics. But she did not make
the United States team for the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1996 Olympic trials were probably the worst meet of my
life,'' she said, ``and when they ended I asked myself: Do I teach?
Do I coach? Do I have a baby? Have I been swimming because I want
American records, or do I like the sport? I think I was doing it
for the right reasons. I like to race.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept racing, and in this year's world championships she
shocked herself by setting an American record of 1 minute 1.16
seconds for the 100-meter backstroke. She wants to be the first
woman to break one minute (the world record is 1:00.16).
</P>
<P>
   So she is still swimming, still looking forward to the daily
drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have everything I want now _ a great career, a great
husband,'' Maurer said. ``I can walk away from swimming. But my
career has been unusual, and I don't recommend that anyone follow
my footsteps.''

RACE ISSUE PERMEATED BRAWLEY CASE, SOME JURORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-BRAWLEY-SHARPTON) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON and DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ They were six people thrust together by
chance and lawyers' calculations.
</P>
<P>
   One was a white woman who had never heard of the Rev. Al
Sharpton before last November. Another, a postal worker originally
from the Bronx, was the jury's sole black woman and nearly came to
blows with a white man a day before the verdict. A third, a black
man who grew up in Arizona, said he had not been raised in ``the
black community'' but learned much about it during the course of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from the rest of the world, the jurors in the Tawana
Brawley defamation trial said they tried to decide the case only on
the evidence. But called upon to resolve one of the most
contentious racial cases in New York's history, they found that
race often intruded in the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the jury of two blacks and four whites awarded just
$345,000 in damages to Steven Pagones, the white former prosecutor
who sued for defamation after Miss Brawley's advisers said he raped
and kidnapped Miss Brawley, a black woman, in 1987, when she was
15. Some of the white jurors had pressed for a much higher number.
One said he had in mind $1.5 million but compromised, he said, to
try to win unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with four of the jurors after Wednesday's verdict
showed that they viewed the voluminous evidence presented to them
through the prism of race. There were sometimes emotional
confrontations based on racial differences. They were, after all,
``six different people from six different worlds,'' said Patrick
Cody, the foreman.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors needed each other, another juror said, because no one
else understood what they were going through. They were ``like
survivors of a shipwreck,'' he said. Several jurors said they had
formed enduring relationships. An alternate and a juror, newly
single, have a date to go to the zoo this week.
</P>
<P>
   As in any jury deliberation, their work was often a balancing
act. The jurors decided, for example, that the Rev. Al Sharpton was
less culpable than the other two Brawley advisers, C. Vernon Mason
and Alton Maddox, because they were lawyers and he was not.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors said they were often able to bridge racial gaps, for
example, by focusing on literal facts of the trial, like the
precise wording of statements Pagones said were defamatory. But
when racial divisions surfaced, they served as a reminder of the
volatility of the case. Several jurors said that a pivotal conflict
developed between L. Williams, the black woman, and Mark Urbin, 37,
a white toolmaker at a manufacturing company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, a postal clerk, declined repeated requests for an
extensive interview. In a brief conversation, she denied that she
was motivated by race, but several jurors said she appeared to feel
most intensely the pressure that could come from scrutiny of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believed in Tawana; all the rest of the jurors believed in
the evidence,'' Urbin said. Other jurors said Urbin was the most
aloof member of the panel and seemed least sympathetic to Miss
Brawley's three black advisers. He acknowledged that Ms. Williams
at one point asked him to put himself in one of the black
defendants' shoes. He refused. ``I didn't do it,'' he said. ``I
needed to look at the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-simmering tensions between Ms. Williams and Urbin
erupted Tuesday, as the jurors were beginning to consider what
damages to assess after the eight-month trial. Urbin said he was
one of the jurors pressing for a heavy damage award. ``She said she
felt I was using race in the discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other people who were there said the two were yelling at each
other. Ms. Williams exploded in anger, jabbing a pen toward Urbin's
face. A court officer entered the jury room, and deliberations were
suspended for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, 40, had attracted wide public notice when she
refused to sign the verdict sheet July 13 that declared the
advisers had defamed Pagones 10 times. In news accounts, there had
been speculation that she was isolated as a dissident on the jury.
But in the interviews, other jurors said her position within the
panel was far more subtle. She had participated in the
deliberations and had voted with the majority more than half the
time, two jurors said.
</P>
<P>
   But, other jurors said, she seemed to grow concerned about how
her role as a black juror would be portrayed publicly. Glen
Heinsohn, 45, a white man who moved here 12 years ago from the
Bronx, said he and Ms. Williams became close friends, sharing
memories of the Bronx and praying together.
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn said it was obvious that Ms. Williams felt great
pressure because of her race. He said he would not betray her
confidence. But, he said, ``maybe one of the instincts is
self-preservation.'' Heinsohn, who works at a school for autistic
children, said he had wanted to assess $1.5 million but relented to
encourage Ms. Williams to participate in the deliberations. She did
and voted for the damage award. But then, when the jury was polled
in the courtroom, she surprised the others on the panel by saying
that she did not approve of the $345,000 verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypothetically,'' Heinsohn said, ``you're a black female,
you're going to leave this process, maybe you're already getting
flak. You're hearing this. You've got a family to think of.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other black juror was James Boone, 45, an engineer at IBM,
whose perspective was very different from Ms. Williams'. He had
grown up among whites in Tucson, Ariz. In an interview Thursday he
said that shaped his view of the world, and he noted that he is
married to a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't raised in the black community, so, culturalwise, I
didn't know a lot about it,'' he said. ``I've learned a lot about
it during this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors said Boone tended to see the case much as they
did. ``Jimmy looked at all the evidence,'' said Urbin, ``and when
he wasn't sure, we'd show him the evidence and he'd change his
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, however, could not be so easily swayed. She often
talked about the oppression of blackpeople in American history when
others wanted to talk about such details as the wording of one of
the defamatory statements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams said she understood the importance of the advisers'
work more keenly than the four white jurors or even Boone possibly
could. Boone recalled her explanation: ``Althea always said, `Hey,
I grew up in New York City. I've seen other people who wanted for
things and had no way to get them except through people like Al
Sharpton.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For all the jurors, the length of the trial and the fact they
were more or less trapped in a room with the defendants meant that
they all experienced what one of the jurors likened to ``Stockholm
syndrome,'' the process of identifying with one's captors.
</P>
<P>
   But the underside to that, several of the jurors said, was that
they were prisoners in their own lives. Heinsohn, who lives alone,
said that even though he does not drink, he often went to a bar and
nursed club sodas just to hear people talk about life outside the
Brawley case.
</P>
<P>
   An alternate said she sometimes took a mental break by talking
to salesmen on the telephone. Even the jurors with spouses and
children often talked to each other on the telephone at night
because they found they could not find solace with people who were
living outside their tightly contained world.
</P>
<P>
   When they were deliberating the first phase of the case, the
judge, S. Barrett Hickman, asked the jurors if they wanted to be
sequestered. Most of them said no. A day later, that changed. In
the interviews, the jurors said they simply could not bear the
feeling of estrangement from everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like loneliness in a crowd of people,'' said Heinsohn.
``It's like we were survivors of a shipwreck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the phase devoted to determining the size of the monetary
award to Pagones, the jurors said they had widely divergent ideas
about how much to assess. ``We all had numbers in own heads,'' said
Cody, 32, a warehouseman who was the foreman. ``So we decide to
divide it up,'' averaging the amounts proposed by each juror as a
starting point for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their efforts to keep their deliberations
dispassionate, the jurors' perspectives on race almost always
returned as a subtext. In apportioning damages among the three
defendants, the jurors ultimately penalized Mason and Maddox more
heavily than Sharpton. They said that was partly because, as
lawyers, they had ``the rule book'' about what was permissible in
making accusations, and Sharpton did not.
</P>
<P>
   But in the interviews, the white jurors appeared more accepting
of Sharpton generally than they were of Mason and Maddox, partly
because Sharpton's efforts to enter the political mainstream in New
York made him seem more appealing. ``He's a likable guy,'' said
Heinsohn. ``I've heard him on the Imus show.''
</P>
<P>
   As they haggled over what damages to assess, a pattern emerged.
The four white jurors were pressing for higher damages. Ms.
Williams was arguing to keep the damages to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   On the fence was Boone, who says he identifies himself as
racially mixed. But as the deliberations grew more intense, he
said, he found himself feeling pressured to vote a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among those who perceive me as black,'' he said, ``they would
look at me and say, `You have to do things based on your black
culture.'''
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle, Boone says, he sided with Ms. Williams.

SHARPTON CLAIMS VICTORY, BUT MAY STILL APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRAWLEY-JURY) 
(bl) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton claimed victory Thursday, a day
after a Dutchess County jury ordered him to pay $65,000 to a white
former prosecutor whom he had accused of kidnapping and raping a
black teen-ager 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that he would appeal the decision, and he
suggested that his appeal might revolve around something a jury
member said Wednesday after the decision on damages _ that Sharpton
may have been duped by C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, the two
other advisers to the teen-ager, Tawana Brawley, and so under the
law he should not have been held liable for defamation.
</P>
<P>
   Former prosecutor Steven Pagones had sought $395 million from
the three advisers to Ms. Brawley, whose story of being attacked
was later found by a grand jury to be a hoax. The judge will
determine what damages she owes at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference Thursday, Sharpton said that the low
damages were a victory in a case that was always ``about the right
of advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Pagones' lawyer, William Stanton, had
said that the defamation trial was about holding the advisers
accountable for self-serving distortions and falsehoods that
injured his client's good name.
</P>
<P>
   After the closing arguments, which ended an eight-month trial
that revisited the racially divisive case, a jury decided that
Pagones was defamed when the three advisers to the Brawley family
made public statements linking him to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, that jury awarded Pagones $345,000 in compensatory
and punitive damages. They set Sharpton's total damages at $65,000,
Maddox's at $95,000 and Mason's at $185,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton and his lawyer, Michael Hardy, said they were
encouraged by juror comments that suggested Sharpton had believed
Ms. Brawley's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said of the damages and whether he had enough money to
pay them: ``I've said that if it was $1 or a million, I was going
to appeal. Its certainly going to cost more to appeal, which is
important to clear my name.''
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Maddox, who represented himself, and Stephen
Jackson, the lawyer for Mason, said they still believed that
Pagones had attacked Ms. Brawley. Hardy walked a fine line, never
saying whether he believed that Pagones was guilty. Instead, Hardy
argued that Sharpton, as the spokesman for the Brawley family, had
a duty to represent them zealously.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sharpton evaded lingering questions about whether
he still believed Ms. Brawley's story and whether he believed that
Pagones was involved in the attack. When asked whether he still
believed the story, Sharpton would say only, ``Ms. Brawley says he
was among her attackers'' and ``surely, here today, I believe there
was enough evidence for Steven Pagones to be prosecuted like anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the jury's decision on damages _ after calls from
Pagones' lawyers that jurors bankrupt the advisers _ a victory
against ``the political forces that were trying to use a civil case
to stop Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton refused to say he made a mistake in championing Ms.
Brawley's cause, saying, ``I've tried over the last 10 years to do
what is right, and with each case I try to do it better.''

   SPREWELL'S SUIT AGAINST NBA IS TOSSED OUT
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million civil suit Latrell Sprewell filed in an attempt
to make the National Basketball Association and the Golden State
Warriors pay for punishing him after he attacked his coach, P.J.
Carlesimo, was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in
San Francisco on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's suit challenged the suspension he received and
alleged that his civil rights and racial discrimination laws had
been violated. The suit also alleged that he was punished twice _
by the team and the league _ for choking Carlesimo. Walker said the
suit had ``manifold deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell assaulted Carlesimo during a Dec. 1 practice session,
which led the Warriors to terminate his $24 million contract and
the NBA to suspend him for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case that should have never been brought,'' said
Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer. ``It is entirely
baseless, and we are, of course, very pleased with Judge Walker's
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The league was not successful at all on another legal front
Thursday. In U.S. District Court in New York City, Judge Barbara
Jones denied the NBA's motion to stay a jurisdictional hearing by
John Feerick regarding a request for arbitration filed by the union
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Feerick listened to arguments for just over an
hour concerning whether he had jurisdiction to arbitrate a
grievance filed by the union on behalf of players whose contracts
call for them to be paid during the NBA's owner-imposed lockout.
Once Feerick decides the jurisdictional issue, which could take a
day or two, a hearing on the merits of the case will be scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the union's request for arbitration, the NBA sued
the union, contending that the league should not have to pay
players during the lockout and that it should not have to go to
arbitration. The league also asked for Feerick to be removed as
arbitrator on the grounds that his term had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Feerick's name is known all too well within the league. In
March, Feerick ruled that the termination and suspension Sprewell
received were excessive. He ordered that Sprewell be reinstated by
the Warriors and that the suspension be reduced. But Sprewell did
miss 68 games without pay because of the part of the suspension
that was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Walker gave Sprewell the opportunity to re-submit the complaint
but urged him to consider dropping the matter completely.
</P>
<P>
   WOOING JORDAN FROM A DISTANCE
</P>
<P>
   Tim Floyd, the Bulls' coach-to-be, has been unabashed in his
effort to woo Michael Jordan and prevent himself from being known
as the man who forced the superstar out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's monthlong lockout has prevented Floyd from contacting
Jordan directly, but he has become cozy with Buzz Peterson,
Jordan's roommate at the University of North Carolina. The two have
talked repeatedly about Jordan, and messages have been relayed.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that Floyd may try to lure Peterson from his
coaching job at Appalachian State and make him a well-paid
assistant in order to please Jordan. But Floyd's efforts may be
futile.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's decision to come back may have more to do with Scottie
Pippen's future than with Phil Jackson's departure from the Bulls
and with Floyd's arrival. Pippen will be a free agent when the
lockout ends, but his market value may be diminished after his back
surgery this week. Phoenix may think twice about offering $60
million to a player who has been through so much wear and tear as
he nears 33.
</P>
<P>
   This could help the Bulls' bargaining position. If Jerry
Reinsdorf, the Bulls' owner, is willing to pay his star forward
enough to lessen the friction Pippen has for General Manager Jerry
Krause, there might be a way of keeping Pippen and Jordan on the
floor together with Floyd as the coach.
</P>
<P>
   With or without Pippen and Jordan, Floyd will be the coach
despite the transparent attempt by Reinsdorf to announce Floyd as
Jackson's successor last week by installing a surprise twist to his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to wipe his fingerprints off any plan that might
force Jordan out, Reinsdorf said Floyd would be kept as director of
basketball operations if Jackson wanted to return and coach Jordan
again.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was puttering around on a motorcycle, feeling the wind
nip at his tie-dyed T-shirt when he had to put the brakes on. He
stopped to tell reporters, who had gathered at his summer home in
Flathead Lake, Mont., that he was not going to return to the Bulls
as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect I'd have to re-retire,'' Jackson said. ``But I
guess it's important that I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   OAKLEY'S ADVICE FOR KNICKS
</P>
<P>
   Players and teams are not allowed to talk during the lockout,
not even former players and teams. But Charles Oakley, who was
traded to Toronto for Marcus Camby on the night of the NBA draft,
did squeeze in a conversation or two with the Knicks' team
president, Ernie Grunfeld, after the trade and before the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most who buy into the theory that the Knicks' point guard
position needs a makeover with a big trade, Oakley was campaigning
for the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ernie to re-sign Charlie Ward,'' Oakley said. ``But
that's up to them. They shouldn't short-change him. He's a starting
point guard, so you've got to treat him like one.'' &QL;

 UNDATED: their drinking.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some patients, acamprosate has worked well. Diagnosed with
breast cancer in 1981, Gudrum Hellinger, a 57-year-old school
secretary who lives near Munich, Germany, began sipping wine and
Champagne to cheer her mood. Ms. Hellinger gradually became a heavy
drinker and tried repeatedly to quit, always failing within about
two months. In 1995, she became suicidal and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took acamprosate for six months,'' Ms. Hellinger said.
``I've been sober for three years. I just didn't want a drink
anymore when I was on acamprosate. I don't think I could have given
up drinking without it. But you need more than the drug to do it.
I'm still in counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors, however, noting that only two other medications
for alcoholism have been introduced here since 1951, have renewed
their criticism of the pharmaceutical industry for not developing
more drugs to help addicts through withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The captains of large drug companies won't spend money on
medications to treat alcoholism, doctors say, because addicts
frequently do not take their drugs. Other patients simply make
better customers. As evidence, doctors note that while only 1.8
million American men were treated for erectile dysfunction last
year, according to IMS Health, an industry consultant, six new
treatments are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as many Americans were treated for alcoholism last year _
1.4 million, according to addiction experts _ but only two drugs,
including acamprosate, were being developed to aid withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies ``wouldn't get their money back from these
drugs,'' said Dr. Herbert Kleber, medical director of the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   For acamprosate's advocates, the strangest twist in the
controversy is that the debate exists at all. Alcoholism, after
all, is a devastating illness, one that tears families apart, ruins
careers and kills tens of thousands of people a year. A study by
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that
alcoholism and its treatment cost U.S. businesses $67.7 billion in
lost productivity in 1992, the latest statistics available.
Treatment is not cheap, either: a two-week stay in a clinic can
easily cost $450 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen percent of the U.S. population will be dependent on
alcohol at one time in their lives,'' said Barbara Mason, director
of the Division of Substance Abuse at the University of Miami
School of Medicine and the principal investigator of the nation's
clinical trials on acamprosate.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts call the synthetic drug a therapeutic breakthrough.
Invented by Lipha in 1980, acamprosate, also known as calcium
acetylhomotaurine, is thought to work by restoring normal activity
on certain neurotransmitters in the brain that become overexcited
by the withdrawal of alcohol. This hyperactivity can last a year,
experts say, leaving the alcoholic prone to relapse.
</P>
<P>
   But in the European studies, the drug remained somewhat
effective over time. The percentage of patients who took
acamprosate and abstained from drinking fell to 35 percent after
six months and 33 percent after a year. The number of people who
took placebos yet still stayed off alcohol declined to 23 percent
after six months and 21 percent after a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the higher success rate for those taking the drug is
encouraging. Lipha officials are confident that acamprosate will be
profitable in the United States despite a limited market. Sales of
alcohol withdrawal drugs in the United States totaled a modest $21
million last year, according to IMS Health, largely because of the
side effects of available drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big potential market,'' said Dr. Sylvie Chabac,
international strategic product manager for Lipha.
</P>
<P>
   For some researchers, acamprosate is more than just a promising
treatment _ it is an important new weapon in the arsenal against a
double addiction of alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, research has shown a strong link between heavy
smoking and drinking. An 11-year study by the Mayo Clinic showed
that those with a dual addiction were far more likely to die from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leading cause of death among alcoholics who smoke is lung
cancer,'' said Dr. David Lewis, director of the Center for Alcohol
and Addiction Studies at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Even with acamprosate's benefits, no one is passing it off as a
magic bullet. Experts insist that patients should also undergo
counseling and maintain it long after they are sober. Critics also
note that the drug is of no use in detoxification and that it has
never been proved to reduce a craving for alcohol, even though
patients repeatedly contend that it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a stigma that alcoholism is a moral weakness,''
said Dr. Richard Fuller, director of clinical and prevention
research at the alcoholism institute. ``I find it very distressing.
Alcoholism has a biological basis like hypertension. We treat that
with medications. Why can't you treat alcoholism the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   That argument, however, does not sit well with some clinicians.
``Alcoholics should not be given drugs, unless it is to treat an
organic illness like diabetes,'' said Dr. Joseph Pursch, who is
best known for treating Betty Ford and Billy Carter for alcoholism.
``All these drugs _ Xanax, Valium _ that doctors prescribe for
alcoholics can be addicting. What good is it to switch dependence
from one drug to another?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an import from France may be alcoholics' best hope for a
new medication. A 1995 report by the Institute of Medicine found
that U.S. drug and biotech companies avoided developing drugs for
addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasons: Many doctors would probably refuse to prescribe
them, many patients would probably decline to take them and
insurers might balk at reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry denies that it has neglected drugs for
addictions, noting that 19 such medications are under development,
including one for alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kleber, an author of the Institute of Medicine report, said
he was frustrated by the industry's inertia. ``I'm just glad we may
get acamprosate,'' he said. ``God knows we have a gazillion
antidepressants. Now at least we'll have more than one drug to
treat alcoholism.''

 &HT;    Brickyard good to Irvan again
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Ernie Irvan was first out in qualifying Thursday
for Saturday's Brickyard 400, then put a record 179.394 miles per
hour lap on the board to win the pole for the second consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   It was Irvan's first pole of the year, his winning speed two
miles an hour faster than last year's 177.376 mph lap.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, the 1996 Brickyard champion, joins Irvan on the
front row with a speed of 178.596 miles per hour. Jeff Gordon,
178.324 mph, and rookie Kenny Irwin, 178.260 mph, make up row two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we got to figure out how to win this race,'' said Irvan,
who gave his Skittles team their first career pole. ``I don't know
how I could have gotten a better lap. The car did everything we
expected it to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to start on the pole is a definite plus. I knew the
Pontiacs could run with the Fords in qualifying, and when we get it
ready to race, we'll find out how it stacks up in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had been fastest in prequalifying practice and took his
best shot at Irvan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with that, I wasn't at all disappointed,'' Gordon
said. ``I've got everything going. I'm starting to see 1994 (when
he won) come back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Buckshot Jones surprised himself with a 15th place
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal just to make this race,'' Jones said, ``but a
real big deal to make it in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody was in such a good mood. Defending champion Ricky
Rudd qualified 27th; 1995 winner Dale Earnhardt was 23rd and Bill
Elliott, the only driver with four top 10 finishes here, slipped
all the way to 37th.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, making his debut with his new Tyler Jet team,
got off to a bad start, qualifying 42nd in the Tabasco Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   On Hold
</P>
<P>
   A gold watch that was to be presented to Gordon honoring his
Driver of the Year Award was part of a shipment from Switzerland
being held in New York by U.S. Customs agents. The Chopard watch
had not arrived because other watches in the shipment had bands
made from skins of endangered species of lizards or snakes.
Gordon's watch has a leather band and should clear Customs today.
</P>
<P>
   Tight rookie race
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin takes a 22 point lead over Jerry Nadeau into today's
Brickyard, while Kevin Lepage is only 39 behind. Steve Park likely
will not be a factor, having missed most of the season with a
broken leg suffered in Atlanta in March.
</P>
<P>
   Unser return
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr. is at the Brickyard this week to participate in
today's IROC event. It's his first visit since 1994 when he won the
Indianapolis 500. He failed to make the field a year later and in

different kind of car.''

THOMPSON NAMES BOB JEFFREY AS PRESIDENT OF ITS NEW YORK OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bob Jeffrey describes himself as someone who ``loves
challenges.'' He has certainly come to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey is the new president of the flagship New York office of
J. Walter Thompson USA, part of the J. Walter Thompson unit of WPP
Group PLC. He was hired in March by Chris Jones, chief executive at
Thompson, from Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, where he had been executive
vice president and managing director of the San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey's mission is formidable: to help Thompson New York wipe
away the tarnish put on its reputation by almost two years of
turnover in accounts, shortfalls in several high-profile reviews
and turmoil in the top executive ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong agency that needed to be kick-started back to
life,'' said Jones, who, since becoming chief executive last year,
has also changed the leadership at other offices, including those
in Chicago and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jeffrey, 45, had no experience running a big agency like
Thompson New York, which has $847 million in estimated billings and
440 employees, he is praised for his skills in the care and feeding
of large clients as well as his ability to stoke the fires of new
business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, three months after his arrival, Thompson New York
emerged victorious in one of the biggest, most closely watched
reviews so far this year, landing the $85 million account of
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objectively, it was great,'' Jeffrey said, ``but
psychologically it was also great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning Merrill Lynch was an important achievement that really
defines how JWT New York will go forward in a new era,'' he added.
``I really believe we're on a new track.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jeffrey, a 20-year veteran of Madison Avenue, faces
daunting difficulties in reviving Thompson New York. In an
interview last week, he acknowledged what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``JWT is a great brand name, and New York has great accounts,''
he said, ``but it needs resuscitation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told people that a year from now, I want the image of the
agency to be significantly transformed inside and outside,'' he
added. ``The existing perception is neutral to negative, that it's
a sleepy agency without a lot of excitement. I want it to be an
exciting agency doing new things, and not just creatively.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's an amazing amount of talent'' at Thompson New York,
Jeffrey said, ``a lot of young and middle-level people who want to
transform the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just looking for the leadership to do it,'' he added.
``And one key thing is that you have to get people to communicate
with each other. I believe if you have the right leadership, the
right people and better communication, there's no reason why a New
York office can't do great work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey's remarks recall some of the problems that were said to
plague Thompson New York under his predecessor, Susan Gianinno, who
departed abruptly in October.
</P>
<P>
   There had been widespread complaints, as reported by the trade
publication Adweek, that Ms. Gianinno _ who subsequently took an
important post at the D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications
unit of MacManus Group in New York _ had not been inspiring enough
to employees because of a reluctance to delegate that discouraged
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had not been a focus on getting everyone to work as a
team,'' Jones said. ``In the end, the agency business is like team
sports. Agencies need team players, and Bob really wants to play on
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Merrill Lynch pitch was arduous and drawn out,'' he said,
``but the agency came together fantastically. And Bob had a big
part in that.''
</P>
<P>
   A question that arose when Jeffrey was hired for Thompson New
York after 18 months at Lowe _ part of the Lowe Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Cos. _ was whether an outsider could win the
confidence of longtime staff members, something he would need to
remake the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency has that old boy network reputation,'' Jeffrey
said, ``but when I started meeting people, I didn't find them
close-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on all the tsouris they experienced,'' he added, ``they
were open to new people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said: ``I had been very public, since the time Susan went,
that I wanted to go outside for her successor. The agency was not
only prepared for it, but everyone felt it was the right thing to
do, for new blood and fresh leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Jones observed that ``if an outsider comes in
and behaves like an outsider, he or she is likely to be treated as
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bob has amazingly impressed everyone,'' he added, ``and
has been welcomed with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey said that the Merrill Lynch pitch gave him a glimpse of
how well Thompson New York could perform when everyone cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of commitment and a lot of passion,'' Jeffrey
said, ``and I'm a big believer in the passion factor in this
business because if you don't have people aiming high, with passion
and excitement, where's the satisfaction?''
</P>
<P>
   As for what's next, Jeffrey said, he is sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, how many opportunities do you get to do
something like this?'' he asked. ``I excel in an underdog
situation; it's basically my nature. I have a lot of optimism.''

 &HT;    Falcons counting on Dronett
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Shane Dronett likes to talk about ``getting skinny,''
but he has to come up big this season for the Atlanta Falcons, and
he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 1/2, 300-pound defensive tackle backed up starters
Travis Hall and Dan Owens last year and did a good job, with 40
tackles and four sacks. He also blocked two field goals and knocked
down five passes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the team needs more. Owens is with the Detroit Lions,
and Dronett will start at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big deal for a guy with one career start at the
position after being drafted by Denver in the second round as a
defensive end in 1992, the last year Falcons coach Dan Reeves was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest difference in being a starter is the
responsibility,'' said Dronett, who was first team All-America in
1991 as a junior at Texas before leaving school early. ``Guys are
counting on me.''
</P>
<P>
   You might recognize Dronett, who wears No. 75, from Falcons ads
showing him, Hall and end Chuck Smith trying to block a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett has seven career blocks, four short of the NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about getting skinny, which isn't easy when you're
300,'' he said. ``You're thinner when you turn sideways ... at the
line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it as fast as you can at the snap, before (offensive
linemen) get their pads together and form a wall. You get in the
crack, drive and get your hands up. My height is a big factor
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dronett's height also has helped him knock down 21 passes in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three seasons in Denver, he had 165 tackles, 19
sacks, 15 passes deflected and four field goals blocked while
playing end. But knee surgery and a change to tackle in 1995 added
up to a poor season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta signed him as a free agent before the '96 season, but he
asked to be released five games into the season. Detroit signed him
but cut him at the end of training camp in '97. The Falcons brought
him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the preseason against us last year, he made some really
good plays at tackle,'' Reeves said. ``(Defensive line coach) Bill
(Kollar) had him before and really didn't like what he'd seen. But
I had him look at some more film ... and we felt like he was a guy
we needed to bring in.''
</P>
<P>
   When Owens didn't play against New Orleans in November, Dronett
got his only career start at tackle. He responded with six tackles,
two sacks, a blocked field goal and a deflected pass. He was player
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett added 10 pounds in the offseason but still has work to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to work real hard at keeping my pads down (and
staying low),'' he said. ``I've had to change my stance a lot, but
I'm starting to feel powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are counting on it. They signed Dronett to a
two-year, $1.6 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a very good pickup,'' Reeves said. ``About the only
thing he needs to work on is keeping his pads down. He's got
everything else.''

PRESS APPROACHING LEWINSKY INQUIRY A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUSLY SECOND
TIME AROUND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf to fix Mike McCurry's name)  (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-PERJURY) 
(sw) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The period of press hand-wringing and soul-searching is long
past. The harsh critique of the news media in Brill's Content is by
now old news. And the Monica Lewinsky story is back with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, news organizations are proceeding as usual:
plastering their front pages and leading their television reports
with news about developments in the case. But news executives say
they are doing things differently this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all being a bit more cautious in making sure
that we get things in perspective,'' said Walter Isaacson, managing
editor of Time magazine. ``But I'm really not sure that there were
any major transgressions made the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Steven Brill, who harshly criticized coverage of the
Lewinsky case as irresponsible in his magazine on the news media,
said he had noticed a slight change in approach on the part of
several news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being a little more careful about identifying
sources,'' Brill said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, said: ``As
the chum in the water, I can attest it's the same feeding frenzy.
The press has but one speed on this story and it's fast forward
with too few editors who press the pause button.''
</P>
<P>
   While many newspaper, magazine and television journalists have
defended their initial coverage as appropriate, some news
executives say the accusations of Brill and other critics prompted
a healthy self-examination about reliable sourcing and getting too
far ahead of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my level best to make sure everything we
publish feels very solid and is based on our reporting, not on
second- or third-hand reporting,'' said Stephen Smith, who recently
resigned as editor of National Journal to become editor of U.S.
News &AMP; World Report. ``Watching the big press, which got so
competitive on this story, was a real lesson for me. You could see
people pushing the story further than it really wanted to go
because they were so locked into being first.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Wolinsky, managing editor for news at The Los Angeles Times,
said criticism of the press had forced his newspaper to try to
provide better context and to winnow out gratuitous, salacious
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make sure these stories have material that
says to the public, `This is why it's important,''' Wolinsky said.
``There has been a real focusing on what the real story is _ Is
there suborning of perjury? Are there crimes that would affect the
future of the presidency? _ as opposed to details of sex lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One element complicating the coverage, Wolinsky said, is that
news organizations are getting conflicting information from
different sources. As a result, he said, journalists from one news
organization at times wind up reporting what other news
organizations are saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are constantly leaking and spinning,'' Wolinsky said.
``Trying to get corroboration _ to not use gossip _ is much more
difficult on a story like this than it would be on any other story.
We're trying not to go out on a limb that might be sawed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, news organizations continue to rely heavily on anonymous
sources, making it difficult for the public to evaluate where the
information is coming from and why. In addition, with a scarcity of
concrete developments to cover and an abundance of air time to
fill, several television programs have continued to speculate about
impeachment and compare Clinton's predicament at this point to that
of President Richard Nixon after disclosure of the contents of the
Watergate tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a danger of lowest-common-denominator journalism,''
said James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel. ``In
an effort to avoid being scooped, often journalists will all try to
match the latest salacious story. When you're reduced to reporting
what other people are reporting, then you've abandoned your own
standards and adopted the other organizations' standards and I
think that's a dangerous path to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some news executives say, much of what they
reported in the early days of the story has proved accurate. ``In
many ways it's remarkable how the evidence in January is the
evidence today,'' Isaacson of Time said. ``It's not like, `Oh, that
was totally wrong. There were no tapes; there were no dresses.'''
</P>
<P>
   News organizations have been in retreat about the ``talking
points,'' intended to coach Linda Tripp on possible testimony about
Clinton. While there had been rampant speculation in the news media
about who in the Clinton administration might have written them,
Ms. Lewinsky herself has apparently claimed authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather, the CBS News anchor, said he subscribed to the view
``Better to be last than to be wrong'' but said news organizations
were operating in an increasingly crowded marketplace, which can
cloud judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive pit is much larger, much fiercer,'' Rather
said. ``One news organization will report something and the
pressure is immediate and immense to match it. But that's not an
excuse. ``There is no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation Journalism
Fellowships at Harvard University, said that however important the
story might be, coverage of it had been premature _ covering leaks,
not actual news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still crystal clear that the press is being used by
sources to an extent that really raises questions about just how
independent the press is,'' Kovach said. ``If I were an editor, I
would try to avoid publishing conclusionary statements about what
people are going to testify, because we don't know what they're
going to testify.''

INDY DUE FOR REAL THRILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be stock cars racing on the first of August, not
open-wheel Indy cars running at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   But the track for this week's NASCAR Winston Cup stop in Indiana
is still the storied Indianapolis Motor Speedway. And the prize
money will be the richest on the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than enough to make Saturday's Brickyard 400 one of
the premier auto racing events of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with the Indianapolis 500 now the property of the
struggling Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing drivers
like Al Unser Jr., Michael Andretti and Alex Zanardi boycotting the
event, many say Saturday's Brickyard will be the best race in
Indiana this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those big dances,'' said Kodak Chevrolet driver
Bobby Hamilton. ``Everybody brings their best stuff. ... You can be
in one-millionth place in the points and never have finished better
than last all season, but win the Brickyard 400 and you've had a
pretty successful year.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver Jeremy Mayfield of the Kranefuss-Penske team agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money, a ton of prestige and more people than we
race in front of anywhere else,'' Mayfield said. ``Man, it's
Indianapolis. That alone says something.''
</P>
<P>
   Prize money totals $5,385,081. Five drivers will have a chance
at the winners share of that purse plus an additional $1 million as
part of the No Bull 5 program.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, Rusty Wallace, Bobby Labonte, Mark Martin and Dale
Jarrett are each eligible for the bonus based on their
first-through-fifth finishes at May's Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   Shame, shame: NASCAR was not pleased by the fighting initiated
by driver Jeff Purvis following a crash with Mark Green at
Saturday's Busch Grand National race in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Purvis has been suspended for four races and fined $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Green's crew chief, Kenneth Campbell, was put on probation and
fined $2,500 for his role.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip to pilot hot (sauce) car: Darrell Waltrip was finding
himself changing cars so often in 1998, one might have thought the
three-time Winston Cup champion had suddenly been transformed into
Morgan Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   After beginning the season in his No. 17 Chevy, Waltrip sold his
team to investor Tim Beverly and began filling in for injured Steve
Park in the No. 1 Chevy owned by Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   With Park ready to drive again at this week's Brickyard 400,
Waltrip was to return to Beverly's No. 17 car this week.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, Beverly bought an interest in the
struggling Team Tabasco. And Waltrip on Saturday will drive the
No.35 Team Tabasco Pontiac _ driven by Todd Bodine up until his
release three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The move promises a return to stability for Waltrip. He signed a
deal to drive the car through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tight race: Kevin Harvick's victory Sunday at the Kidde Safety
200 at Pikes Peak International Raceway vaulted him past Sean
Woodside back into the NASCAR Winston West points lead.
</P>
<P>
   Harvick led 168 of the 200 laps and took the checkered flag with
a 6.8-second lead over runner-up Austin Cameron. It was his fourth
victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia's Woodside finished fourth and saw his four-point lead
become a 16-point deficit to Harvick.
</P>
<P>
   Four races remain on the 1998 calendar: Aug. 15 in Monroe,
Wash.; Oct. 11 at Sears Point in Sonoma; Oct. 17 at Bakersfield's
Mesa Marin Raceway; and Nov. 7 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   To the rescue: TNN Motorsports has stepped in to broadcast the
NASCAR Winston Cup Pepsi 400, postponed from July 4 to Oct. 17 by
Florida wildfires earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast rights were given up by CBS because of conflicts
with other planned events.
</P>
<P>
   TNN's live coverage of the prime-time event, Daytona Motor
Speedway's first major race under the lights, will begin at 5 p.m.
Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   IROC finale: The fourth and final International Race of
Champions event of the season will be held today at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Mark Martin, series winner in three of
the past four seasons, leads in points with 62. Only Jeff Burton
(54) and Jeff Gordon (45) have a real chance to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Dale Earnhardt started the season in grand
fashion, breaking a 59-race winless streak with his first Daytona
500 title. But he hasn't won since. The Daytona triumph is his only
one since winning in Atlanta in 1996, a span of 77 races. ... CART
defending champion and current points leader Alex Zanardi said he
will decide by mid-August whether to stay with Ganassi Racing or to
accept one of several reported offers to return to Formula One...
Eddie Irvine will return for a fourth year with Ferrari's Formula
One team in 1999. Ferrari recently also signed its top driver,
Michael Schumacher, to a three-year deal... For the fifth straight
year, Jeff Gordon _ who turns 27 Tuesday _ will be the youngest
driver in the Brickyard 400. &QL;

   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ No one here begrudges President Clinton a
weekend getaway, what with that nettlesome Lewinsky matter back in
Washington. But of all places, why would he choose a Long Island
town that becomes a parking lot in the summer for people who
consider themselves plugged-in and beautiful, as well as for those
who attend to their many needs?
</P>
<P>
   Why seek shelter in a cell-phone storm?
</P>
<P>
   Harold Bennett, a retired ironworker, knew why and needed no
words to convey the answer. Inside the Amagansett American Legion
hall, perhaps the last redoubt for native sons and daughters _ who
call themselves ``bubbies'' and just about everyone else
``carpetbaggers'' _ he raised a hand stained with paint and rubbed
forefinger and thumb together in a universal gesture that means
money.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is where cottages rent for $10,000 a month,
where a 15-ounce box of Cheerios costs $5, where year-round
residents swap stories about being cut off by stretch limousines.
This is where the entertainment executives from Los Angeles, the
Wall Street titans from New York and millionaires from just about
everywhere else come to play and preen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his presidential entourage are expected to descend
upon East Hampton early Friday afternoon and leave sometime Sunday
afternoon. In the span of those 50-odd hours, he is scheduled to
attend three fund-raising events: a $25,000-a-couple soiree on
Friday night, a $5,000-a-person luncheon on Saturday afternoon and
a more proletarian gathering on the expansive lawn at the home of
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, for which tickets start at $250.
When Air Force One departs this easternmost spit of New York State,
the Democratic National Committee will be some $2 million richer.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to East Hampton is not so easily measured. Some welcome
Clinton, crowing that it will be the first time this century that a
sitting president has visited the island's South Fork; others sniff
that he is just another celebrity, whose sole contribution to the
community will be adding some Secret Service sedans to the traffic
nightmare that is Route 27.
</P>
<P>
   The debate plays out in microcosm at the American Legion bar,
where people address concerns about endangered species with bumper
stickers on their cars that say, ``Piping Plover Tastes Like
Chicken.'' With suspenders stretched over a T-shirt stained with
sweat, Harold Bennett may not dress like Alec Baldwin, but he is a
proud Democrat _ so proud, in fact, that he will be among the
volunteers working to make the Baldwin-Basinger event a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, he's my president and I'm happy to see him here,''
Bennett said. ``All we're gonna do is make him welcome. And they're
gonna raise a ton of money.''
</P>
<P>
   His drinking partner and childhood friend, Joe Holmes,
courteously removed a toothpick from his mouth to speak. A
disaffected Democrat now running for local office on the
Independent Party ticket, he muttered that he would like to take
Clinton out on his clam boat with him. ``Make a man of him,'' he
said. Holmes noted that it took him 27 years to earn $30,000 as a
mailman. The idea of spending $25,000 on anything, much less a
one-night date with the upper crust, left him speechless _ almost:
``It's all for the bucks, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   While Holmes rakes the harbor bed for littleneck clams,
politicians traditionally rake the East Hampton summer scene in
another way. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., was out
here last weekend for a fund-raising event, and New York's GOP Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato might as well be an honorary resident.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, not only has he hit the fund-raising
trifecta, but he is also said to be staying at a fortress of an
estate owned by filmmaker Stephen Spielberg. The neighbors this
week are complaining about helicopters, not mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Puff Daddy,'' said Judith Hope, state Democratic
chairwoman and full-time East Hampton resident, by way of Arkansas.
``This is not movie stars or show people descending on the East End
this weekend. This is the commander in chief. Maybe some cynical
New Yorkers scoff at that. But to a lot of local East Enders, it's
a privilege and an honor to have the president in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hope, who was once the town supervisor for East Hampton,
said that she had been overwhelmed by requests for the
Baldwin-Basinger affair and by an outpouring of support from local
residents. ``There are some very touching stories,'' she added.
``Senior citizens have gone to the bank with their passbooks and
drawn $250 to buy a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Down at the East Hampton Senior Citizens Center on Fireplace
Road, none of the staff members could think of anyone who had
bought a ticket to any of the Clinton functions. They pondered the
very idea as they cleaned up after the day's lunch of breaded fish,
vegetables and oatmeal cookies. ``I wouldn't pay to see any
celebrity,'' said Ida Smith, the office assistant, pausing for a
moment from the task of rolling quarters. ``Plus, the traffic here
is horrible to begin with, and he'll be the only one able to get on
the road and move around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ann Mack, the office assistant, argued that the presidential
moment was worth some inconvenience. ``If I could afford the $250,
I would go,'' she said. ``It's going to be a historic event for
East Hampton and when I look back, I could say I saw the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Jack Rudin, a retired schoolteacher and a Democrat,
walked in. He cited recent developments in Washington _
particularly Monica S. Lewinsky's decision to cooperate with
prosecutors investigating the president _ as evidence that Clinton
had demeaned the office and therefore was not worth a moment of
anyone's free time or a penny of anyone's savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind his visit so much if he was coming here to
better the community,'' Rudin said. ``But to destroy a town for
partisan purposes? That's the only reason he's coming here: to
raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will do anything presidential _ between raising
money and playing a round or two of golf _ was of as much interest
as the effect his visit will have on traffic. Some people hope,
even expect, that he or his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will
appear at one of the apolitical fund-raising events taking place
around town.
</P>
<P>
   In his fantasy, said Rossetti Perchik, an architect who runs the
annual sand castle contest to benefit community projects, the
president stops by to add his support; in reality, he said, one of
his judges dropped out to attend a Clinton fund-raiser. Richard
Rosenthal, who runs the town's disabilities office, has invited the
president to a $6-a-plate dinner at Whalebone Village, a subsidized
housing complex; although it conflicts with the Baldwin-Basinger
party, Rosenthal said, ``I'd expect him to find an hour or two to
be the president for all of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dawn Zimmerman, the director of the Child Development
Center, a school for disabled children, extended an invitation to
the president and the first lady for a fund-raiser on Sunday
afternoon. So far, she said, the invitation has not been accepted
or declined. But a few days ago a man from Washington _ she was not
sure whether he was from the White House _ visited the school. ``He
came to check it out, and actually had a good time with the kids,''
she said. ``But he didn't say much.''
</P>
<P>
   That air of mystery, created by a continuing vacuum of
information about the president's visit, has also brought some
giddiness and sense of the historic to a town that takes pride in
its egalitarian distribution of parking tickets to Porsches and
pickups alike.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy DeSanti, the owner of Dreesen's Market, plans to serve 750
doughnuts _ cinnamon, powdered sugar and plain _ at the
Baldwin-Basinger gathering. And for this contribution he and two
helpers had to undergo a Secret Service background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do our job and leave,'' he said, sounding almost
patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bennett of the American Legion is looking forward to the
Saturday night event. Tonight he and dozens of other volunteers
were to gather under the billowing white tent on the
Baldwin-Basinger estate to be given their assignments. But there's
only so far a ``bub'' will go for a ``carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't cuttin' no grass,'' he said.

HOUSE MOVES STEADILY TOWARD DECISION ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.Y., Texas)  (js) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Thursday picked up the pace on its
campaign finance debate and began making its way through more than
three dozen amendments to bipartisan legislation that would cut
back on money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Like hockey goalies, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Rep.
Martin Meehan, D-Mass., kept up an effort to block 16 of the 37
amendments proposed to their bill. They asserted that the proposals
were intended to divide their coalition and drive away supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective today is to defeat all the poison pills,'' Shays
said. ``We're still alive. This is the bill that won't die. But
we're in the middle of a minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation would effectively ban unlimited and
unregulated contributions to political parties, or soft money,
which were at the heart of the 1996 campaign finance abuses. The
bill would also restrict independent advertising by single-issue
advocacy groups in specified periods before elections.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation _ with a companion bill in the Senate _ is
fiercely opposed by the Republican leadership and most
rank-and-file Republicans. Some view it as a way to erode their
party's traditional advantage in fund-raising while others call it
an unconstitutional abridgement of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout weeks of intermittent night-time debate, the
coalition supporting the Shays-Meehan bill has managed to defeat
several amendments and competing proposals and show that it has
majority support.
</P>
<P>
   After stretching out the debate for months, the House is now
pushing toward a final vote on the overhaul of the campaign finance
laws early next week, when the Senate will already be on its August
recess.
</P>
<P>
   With Shays-Meehan supporters increasingly confident of victory,
the Senate recess will eliminate the possibility that Democrats
could capitalize on House action and try to force the Senate to
take up campaign finance legislation immediately. Similar
legislation died in the Senate earlier this year when it drew a
slim majority but not enough votes to cut off a filibuster.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the amendments under consideration Thursday night were
several, strongly opposed by Democrats, that would change the
``motor voter law'' on voter registration to allow states to
eliminate mail-in registrations and to require photo IDs for
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment would require candidates for congressional
seats to raise at least 50 percent of their campaign contributions
inside their districts. Democrats get more of their money from
political action committees than Republicans do, and this change
would make it harder for them to rely on political action
committees.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of why Shays and Meehan have been leery of amendments,
a wide array of 65 groups concerned with immigrants' rights came
out against the campaign finance legislation on Thursday because of
passage earlier in the month of an amendment sponsored by Rep. Vito
Fossella of Staten Island. The amendment would ban contributions by
noncitizens who are legal residents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Rep. Tom Delay, the House majority whip, welcomed the
opposition, groups ranging from Catholic Charities Immigrant
Services in Honolulu to the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, R-Texas, has led the fight against Shays-Meehan _ as well
as the strategy of trying to sink it through amendments. ``We've
always been against Shays-Meehan,'' said John Feehery, DeLay's
spokesman. ``Now we've won some converts.''

KING SHOOTS 8-UNDER-PAR 64, LEADS DU MAURIER CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ Betsy King joined the LPGA Tour in 1977, the
year that Se Ri Pak was born.
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, King is still on the tour,
competing against Pak, Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb and other
young stars. The future may belong to the talented 20-something
set. But Thursday's best round in the du Maurier Classic _ one of
the tour's majors _ belonged to King.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting an 8-under-par 64, and finishing with back-to-back
birdies, King held a 1-stroke lead over Meg Mallon and Wendy Doolan
after the first round at Essex Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who is trying to win her third consecutive major as a
20-year-old rookie, shot a 69 to remain within striking distance,
tied with 19 others for 30th place, 5 strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Green, Lisa Hackney, Chris Johnson, Emilee Klein and
Dottie Pepper were in a five-way tie for fourth place, at 66.
</P>
<P>
   For King, who will turn 43 next month, Thursday's round was
another statement that she remains a formidable player. Taking
advantage of favorable conditions _ virtually no wind, coupled with
overcast skies that kept the greens soft _ King put together a
machinelike round, hitting every green in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   King had eight birdies without a bogey, and she ended the day in
style, with birdies on Nos. 17 and 18. Can King keep it up? She was
eager to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely the best round I've played this year,'' said
King, whose most recent victory was in last year's Nabisco Dinah
Shore. ``I got off to a good start, and for me that's really key.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When King lists her accomplishments in golf, the resume is
impressive. She is a member of the LPGA Hall of Fame. She has won
31 tournaments. And she has won six majors, including two U.S.
Women's Open championships.
</P>
<P>
   But King has never won the du Maurier, the only women's major
that has eluded her. That will motivate King this week, and she is
also trying to secure a spot on the U.S. Solheim Cup team that will
compete against Europe in September.
</P>
<P>
   As the LPGA's all-time leading money winner, with more than $6
million, King has the financial security to retire whenever she
wishes. However, quitting is something she rarely thinks about. She
still hits 245-yard drives, her short game has actually improved
over the past five years and Thursday she made four birdie putts of
15 feet or longer, including 20-footers on No. 17 and No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay out here as long as I can,'' she said. ``The
money keeps getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   While King breezed through her round, Pak struggled early,
standing at 1 over par through six holes. However, a 13-foot putt
for a birdie on No. 7 changed the momentum in Pak's favor. Then she
took advantage of her length at the par-5, 450-yard No. 9, reaching
the green in two shots, then two-putting from 25 feet for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 10, Pak birdied again, hitting a 3-iron approach shot to
within three feet of the cup. Pak's final birdie came at the par 5,
490-yard No. 14, when she reached the green in two shots again,
then two-putted from 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Pak was pleased with her position, although she felt
some pain in her left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, a little sore, just from playing golf and
practicing,'' said Pak, who was followed throughout her round by at
least 15 photographers from her native South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``My driving and my irons weren't that sharp, so at 3 under par
I'm happy. I'm surprised to see such low scores, but everything is
perfect _ good greens, good conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pak-Sorenstam-Webb threesome drew the largest gallery of the
day, around 1,000 people at its peak. Sorenstam won their personal
battle, shooting a 4-under-par 68, while Webb shot a 69 to tie Pak.
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of Koreans in Pak's gallery, urging her on,
and she appreciated the support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised, because the Korean economy is not that
good,'' Pak said. ``But they want to come see me. It makes me want
to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   The fever surrounding Pak reminded King of the enthusiasm
generated by Nancy Lopez in 1978, when she won five consecutive
tournaments and attracted many more fans to women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Se Ri is bringing more attention than Nancy did,''
King said. ``Se Ri has worked hard to learn English and endear
herself. I see great things in the future for Se Ri and the LPGA.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, nobody was better than King. She has come close to
winning the du Maurier before, losing to Brandie Burton in 1993 on
the first hole of a sudden-death playoff in London, Ontario. This
time, she hoped for a different outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, at 42, still able to compete, so yes, I feel
good,'' King said. ``You don't get tired of winning. I'm going to
give it my best shot.'' &QL;

LAWMAKERS WANT ANSWERS ABOUT DEATHS, NEAR ABORTION OF FULL-TERM
BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A select committee of lawmakers will meet next month
to ask Arizona state regulators to explain the bleeding deaths of
two women and the near abortion of a full-term baby at a Phoenix
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   A-Z Women's Center was apparently able to operate unlicensed
because state law requires no license for clinics owned by doctors
who neither keep patients overnight nor administer general
anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to discipline the clinic after the first woman
bled to death in 1995 might indicate that state laws are inadequate
or not enforced, said House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some questions about what the Board of
Medical Examiners has been doing,'' he said, ``and what the Arizona
Department of Health Services has been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The board, which regulates doctors, has suspended the license of
Dr. John Biskind, the doctor involved in the three incidents. But
Brad Christensen, spokesman for the state Health Department, said
state law exempts the clinic from licensing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exemptions from licensure are drawn up by the Legislature,''
Christensen said. He added that the department does license more
than 500 outpatient centers that treat everything from arthritis to
heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost said he will be co-chairman of the 10-member committee.
The speaker and the other co-chairman, Sen. David Petersen, R-Mesa,
are foes of abortion. But Groscost said patient safety will be the
focus and that political views on a woman's right to choose will be
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Miller, executive director of Arizona Right to Choose, was
not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exploitation of an unfortunate medical situation,''
Miller said. ``The problem is really the Board of Medical
Examiners. The speaker, the Senate president and the governor could
have fixed this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Miller predicted that a committee dominated by abortion
opponents will embark on a ``thinly veiled attempt to chip away at
a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Members opposed to abortion are Reps. Marilyn Jarrett, R-Mesa;
Linda Aguirre, D-southwest Phoenix; and Sens. Ed Cirillo, R-Sun
City West; and Mary Hartley, D-west Phoenix. Those who support
abortion rights are Sens. Ann Day, R-Tucson; and Victor Soltero,
D-Tucson; and Reps. Susan Gerard, R-central Phoenix; and Debora
Norris, D-Sells.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost acknowledged that media coverage of the incidents at
A-Z Women's Center prompted the legislative probe. And he said he
expected legislators to propose abortion limits outside the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Groscost and Senate President Brenda Burns insisted that the
panel would hold hearings only on regulation of outpatient clinic
staff and operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're pro-life or pro-choice,'' Groscost
said. ``It's abhorrent that you've had two ladies die in that
clinic. We are going to hold agencies accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Howard, president of Planned Parenthood of Central and
Northern Arizona, said he would accept Groscost's word that the
legislative inquiry is aimed at clinic operations and not abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Howard said, ``the Arizona Legislature for the past
two sessions has been fertile ground for anti-choice initiatives.
We're watching carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to hold at least two hearings
beginning next month, dates to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   The June 30 abortion procedure that turned into a delivery and
the April bleeding death of LouAnne Heron, 33, are under
investigation by a Maricopa County grand jury. &QL;

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE THOMAS SPEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas unloaded on his critics the other day,
twisting the case against him just as he did seven years ago when
the Senate was considering his nomination to the Supreme Court.
Then he complained he was the target of a ``high-tech lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   This week he charged critics with vilifying him because he is a
black who does not hold their liberal views. He said he would
``refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though I was an
intellectual slave because I'm black.'' What Thomas seems unable to
appreciate is that the issue is not his race, but the content of
his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that his staunchly conservative positions on
social issues have been denounced by civil rights leaders as
damaging to the welfare of minorities. That they happen to come
from a black jurist is incidental, though disappointing to many
blacks. The fact that he himself benefited from programs that
opened up educational opportunities to minorities adds to the
resentment. But it is the substance of his views on matters of
affirmative action, criminal justice and voting rights that has
drawn attack from liberals of all races.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, of his critics argue that Thomas should espouse a
certain set of beliefs just because he is black. By the same token,
he should not expect to be embraced or supported by the black
community because of his race. His instinct to turn antagonism
toward his ideas into a racial matter is an odd impulse for a man
who wants to be judged on his intellect and ideas alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the antipathy toward Thomas is the result his own
combative style. During his time as head of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, he dismissed mainstream black leaders as
whiners, making it clear he had little interest in their views. He
has also made it clear he will not compromise his own political
beliefs. That being the case, it is no wonder that many liberal
groups have little interest in hearing him state his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fact that he was invited to speak before the
nation's largest association of black lawyers shows that he remains
an important figure by virtue of his position on the Supreme Court.
The speech was received politely, but his impact on American law
remains a bitter matter for those who see advances in social policy
being steadily eroded. &QL;

<P>
   With thousands of extras seeking work every day, assistant
directors can afford to be picky. ``A typical call might be for six
stand-ins, five police officers, three hookers, five criminals and
two bailiffs, but we have to be careful because the assistant
director may then complain that they don't want to use the same old
faces,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a subtle skill to blend the right ages, body types and
ethnicities. ``The key to doing this is you need to make the
details look real so that the background doesn't take away
attention from the foreground,'' Teitelbaum added. ``We tell them
that extras do the walking and actors do the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   The agencies make their money, typically, by charging production
companies an 8 percent cut for union members and 10 percent for
non-union. Veterans say that fly-by-night scammers will
occasionally open an office for a few weeks, pocket the pay and
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this kind of business, there are people who prey upon those
who have a big desire to succeed,'' said Gavin Troster, SAG's
executive administrator of production services.
</P>
<P>
   Within the world of extras, the most lucrative gig is for
commercials at a rate of $259.20 for eight hours, along with
residuals that can go into tens of thousands of dollars. ``The
catch is that there's not much commercial work available,'' said
Carl Joy, senior vice president at Central Casting in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   More typically, extras pick up more money for being asked to
show up with additional clothing or props. A police uniform or
formal wear equals $18 more on the paycheck; showing up on a
Harley-Davidson motorcycle pays another $100; bringing a pet is
worth $23 more; a tennis racquet adds $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   Non-union extras usually receive slightly less and making the
move into union work is capricious. The most typical route is to
fill in for a SAG member three times, then pay the SAG initiation
fee within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant admonitions that going the extra route is no
way to stardom, it's inevitable extras will believe they're the
exception to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I worked as an extra on `Ned &AMP; Stacey,' we were at this
muffin cafe on the Sony lot all day and I felt badly for these
girls who were freezing because they were wearing low-cut dresses
because they wanted to be noticed,'' said Robin Roberts, a North
Hollywood screenwriter. ``Sometimes, you get to eat great food, but
no one's going to discover you when you're an extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the extra work originates at an anonymous, two-story
office building on Burbank Boulevard at Central Casting
headquarters, several miles east of the Walt Disney and Warner
Bros. studios.
</P>
<P>
   Central specializes in union members and is on the second floor;
Cenex is for the non-union people and on the first floor. Both
companies are owned by Entertainment Partners, which also operates
a major payroll service company for studios and producers.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, agencies like Central, Cenex and General Casting
will have to supply thousands of extras for a single show.
Observers agree that the most massive calls in recent memory _ each
needing about 10,000 bodies _ were for 1979's ``The Rose'' for
concert scenes at Long Beach Municipal Auditorium and 1996's ``The
Fan'' for crowd scenes at Anaheim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with demand, Central operates one of Hollywood's
longest-running rituals. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, dozens
of extras drop by for ``visiting'' _ a chance to meet briefly with
the 15 casting directors, to drop off photos and remind them of the
looks they can do. ``Upscale business'' is the most prevalent look,
while ``formal,'' ``casual,'' ``homeless'' and ``freak'' are also
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 15,000 performers registered but we never know
how many we actually have because when they leave, they don't tell
us,'' Joy said. ``That's especially true with the non-union people,
so we really have to stock up almost as a defensive exercise. We
also go through people quickly in categories like beautiful women
and handsome guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the explosion of cable networks and movie multiplexes,
production levels are at all-time highs and the siren call of
Hollywood is louder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference nowadays is that you don't get to know
extras like you used to, when they were all catalogued in my
head,'' Joy said. ``The group that did the work used to be
significantly smaller and more stable and it was easier to make a
living at it. We used to get perhaps 10 new people in here each
month; now we get several hundred in a week.''

LITTLE GLAMOROUS IN LIFE OF FILM EXTRA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every day at 4 a.m., thousands of anonymous
Hollywood actors and actresses drag themselves out of bed to appear
on shows like ``The New Love Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   They hit the streets early looking for the cryptic, Day-Glo
signs usually posted at freeway off-ramps for directions to the
set. They never speak once the cameras roll, their names never
appear in the credits and they get paid as little as $46 for eight
hours' work.
</P>
<P>
   Their Hollywood isn't the glamorous Hollywood people imagine.
</P>
<P>
   They are the extras, scrambling to make ends meet by playing the
file clerks, homeless people, partygoers and other faces in the
crowd that have made scenes look like real life since Hollywood
began cranking out movies eight decades ago. An estimated 15,000
union members pulled in $63.3 million last year from extra work.
Tens of thousands of non-union members _ who supply the bulk of
bodies when hundreds or thousands are required _ no doubt made even
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank's legendary Central Casting is the dominant player in
the extras business, a Goliath to dozens of small, specialized
agencies in the field. But serious competition emerged earlier this
year when several industry veterans created General Casting to
compete head to head with Central as a full-service agency, an Avis
to Central's Hertz.
</P>
<P>
   General executives see a huge opportunity for themselves amid
booming local production. ``Central probably always will be the
largest, but the smaller ones can't handle 30 shows like we can,''
said Central executive casting director Robert Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   A few starry-eyed novices may remind themselves that John Wayne,
Dustin Hoffman, Robert Wagner and Patty Duke all started as extras.
But most are soberly realistic that they're just part of the
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a screen test in 1942 and I got the message that I
wasn't going to be another Ann Sheridan,'' said Judy Woodbury, a
veteran of hundreds of extra roles over the last five decades. ``I
really can't complain about it. I'm making good, hard-earned
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other actors, extras often work several other jobs,
like waitressing, data entry, phone solicitation and delivery, that
can be ditched with the simple explanation of ``I've got an acting
job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Extras, also known as ``background'' and ``atmosphere,'' work
for the very non-starlike base rate of $90 for eight hours if
they're members of the Screen Actors Guild and $46 if they're not.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, part of the Hollywood myth will come true. A
director will give an extra a speaking part, meaning the actor has
been ``upgraded'' and will receive the standard Screen Actors Guild
day-player salary of $576, plus residuals.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the upgrade artistically and financially satisfying,
it also means the actor or actress is immediately eligible to apply
to become one more of SAG's 90,000 members. Though the guild has
the somewhat daunting initiation fee of $1,152 plus annual dues of
$42.50, newly eligible are often happy to pay because membership
allows them to compete for a far better class of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, though, the extras' prime desire is that the
day's schedule go beyond eight hours to time and half, double time
and then into ``golden time,'' which provides the day's base rate
for each hour starting with the 16th hour.
</P>
<P>
   That's why extras don't necessarily mind waking up at 4 a.m. ``I
prefer a call time of 6 a.m. because then you get through the
8-hour base early in the afternoon and you start getting into at
least time and a half on most shoots,'' said Howard Johnson, who
has done the work for the last 15 years. ``By that time, you've
made a nice piece of change.''
</P>
<P>
   What's Johnson's secret to surviving 14-hour days without losing
his mind from boredom? ``I'm a puzzle nut,'' he said. ``I buy
overstocks, usually 40 or 50 at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Union membership is required for the first 15 extras on a
prime-time television show and the first 40 on a feature. Stand-in
work _ which means doing little more than standing in one spot,
sometimes for hours at a time, so that cameras and lighting can be
adjusted _ is probably the most desirable not only because the
higher base rate of $115 per day but also because the work can last
for months or even years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job and I'm very grateful,'' says Lonna Montrose,
who has done stand-in work for Lacy Chabert, Jennifer Love Hewitt,
Bette Midler and Dolly Parton. ``It's a lot of fun and not much
responsibility, because I get to dress up and I don't have to
memorize lines at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting directors say finding the right people is tricky. And
the life of an extra is far from glamorous. Most spend a lot of
time on the telephone to snag work for the next day or pay a
service to do it for them; they often have to bring several changes
of clothes to a set; and they often spend much of the day and night
cooped up in holding areas near the set.
</P>
<P>
   Extras can cause major headaches on the set if they make the
wrong move or start whining about not having their own hairstylist.
``I like to look people in the eye so I know that they'll show up
on time and not cause any problems,'' Teitelbaum said. ``If they
make problems, we hear about it right away and we don't ever hire
them again.''

PHOENIX WOMEN'S CLINIC CLOSES DOORS AMID CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The A-Z Women's Center in central Phoenix is closing
its doors today amid criminal investigations into reports that a
doctor there nearly aborted a full-term baby in June.
</P>
<P>
   The same doctor is under investigation because a patient in his
care bled to death at the clinic in April.
</P>
<P>
   A-Z's landlord said last week that he would not renew the
clinic's lease at 10th Street and McDowell Road. The lawyer who
represents the clinic and its owner, Dr. Moshe Hachamovitch,
confirmed Thursday that A-Z is closing.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Phoenix-area clinics operated by Hachamovitch, under
the name Family Planning Institute, also appear to be closed. But
Hachamovitch's lawyer, Paul Giancola, could not confirm Thursday
that those clinics were closed permanently.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know exactly why A-Z is closing, but cited
problems with the landlord as one reason.
</P>
<P>
   Giancola added, ``We're fully cooperating with the
investigations that are occurring.'' He said he does not know
whether Hachamovitch plans to operate elsewhere in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Police began investigating Dr. John Biskind after he nearly
aborted the full-term baby girl June 30. An earlier examination by
clinic personnel had shown the fetus to be 23 weeks along; it
turned out to be 37 weeks along, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind stopped the abortion and instead delivered the baby.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered lacerations and a skull facture during the
attempted abortion. Police said a Texas couple planned to adopt
her.
</P>
<P>
   Police are also looking into the death of 33-year-old LouAnne
Herron, who bled to death after undergoing an abortion performed by
Biskind in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners is conducting
an investigation of Biskind. His license has been suspended
temporarily, pending a hearing before the state Office of
Administrative Hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Board records show that Biskind was issued a letter of concern
eight years ago for nearly aborting another full-term baby. In 1995
he was censured for gross negligence after a patient bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind, 72, is a Cleveland gynecologist who keeps a second home
in Scottsdale. He had worked for A-Z for about 10 years, and also
worked at Cleveland-area clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Biskind or Hachamovitch, a doctor in New York, have
responded to repeated requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   After media coverage of Biskind's troubles, Hachamovitch
reportedly had difficulty finding doctors and staff to work at his
Arizona clinics. Some patients were referred to other Phoenix-area
doctors, and employees began answering the phones simply ``doctor's
office.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the administrator at the A-Z clinic declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Hachamovitch clinic on Scottsdale Road in Scottsdale no longer
has a sign on the building, and workers there last week were boxing
up items and clearing shelves. Another clinic, on 27th Avenue in
west Phoenix, was locked Thursday afternoon.

LOS ANGELES: them again.''

<P>
   That's why agencies tend to send out the same people over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``With extras casting, you just want someone who's intelligent
enough to show up, bring the right amount of clothes and be
set-wise,'' said veteran casting director Michael Heitt.
``Production coordinators don't want a hard time because it's very
hard keeping things organized, so you're looking for people who
have great attitudes. If it's drudgery for them, it's going to be
drudgery for everyone around them.''
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of extras seeking work every day, assistant
directors can afford to be picky. ``A typical call might be for six
stand-ins, five police officers, three hookers, five criminals and
two bailiffs, but we have to be careful because the assistant
director may then complain that they don't want to use the same old

EDITORIAL: REFORMING WELFARE WITH EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   An important amendment approved by the Senate to the bill
reauthorizing the Higher Education Act would give states the option
of allowing welfare recipients to enroll in postsecondary education
or vocational training for two years without losing their welfare
benefits. The provision, sponsored by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
should be retained in the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing welfare recipients the opportunity to gain real skills
is the most promising approach to getting families off welfare.
Recipients who have more education are more likely to find
higher-paying jobs that offer economic self-sufficiency. But
current law allows education or vocational training to count as a
work activity for only 12 months, after which the student must work
20 hours a week to continue getting benefits. For many recipients,
that requirement means dropping out of school.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-month limit is particularly constraining for people who
need English-language classes in addition to vocational courses.
Even among English-speakers the need for more education is
substantial. Some 40 percent of all recipients lack a high school
diploma. More than 60 percent of those who have been on welfare for
five years or more have no diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The education gap may also be contributing to racial shifts in
the welfare population. As recently reported in The New York Times,
blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites to have a high
school diploma and the skills to find a job. That fact is one
reason minorities are having a harder time leaving welfare than
whites.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare law is too tilted toward short-term work activity,
allowing little attention to skills development. The current law
also sets a cap on the percentage of the welfare population that
can be enrolled in educational or vocational training at any one
time. By 2000, all teen-age parents pursuing high school diplomas
would be counted under the educational cap, thus reducing the
number of adults who can enroll in training and still receive
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Wellstone amendment would prevent teen-age parents from
being counted in the educational cap. Republicans are resisting
these sensible changes, fearing they amount to backsliding on
welfare reform. On the contrary, letting states encourage education
is the best investment the nation can make toward a long-term
welfare solution. &QL;

BROKER RUNS AFOUL OF SEC IN SHARE MANIPULATION CASEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas)   (af)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rafi M. Khan, a stock promoter, was accused by federal
regulators Thursday of manipulating the shares of two companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the
Securities and Exchange Commission accused Khan, 47, a stock broker
and promoter, of using a variety of schemes to manipulate the
shares of the two little-known companies in an effort to drive up
the prices of those shares and reap huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   While Khan had been accused in several lawsuits of being
involved in stock manipulation in the early 1990s, Thursday's
complaint is the first time that federal regulators have accused
Khan of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a guy who has been reputed in the past to have been
involved in questionable activities and here are two cases where we
have good evidence he manipulated two stocks,'' Ronald E. Wood, an
assistant regional director at the SEC office in Los Angeles, said
Thursday. ``He used multiple schemes to get the price of those
stocks up.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is seeking to have Khan repay $552,500 in illegal
profits, along with other fines and penalties. The commission also
charged Timothy Tyrrell, who regulators say acted as a trader for
Khan at Reynolds Kendricks &AMP; Stratton in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
whose parent company is now J.B. Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   The commission contends that Tyrrell co-conspired in
manipulating the shares of the two companies. The commission is
seeking to have Tyrrell repay $224,800 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to Khan's lawyer, Bernard L. Burton in Melville,
N.Y., were not returned. Efforts to reach Tyrrell, whose home
telephone number is unlisted, were also unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Khan and Tyrrell are accused by regulators of manipulating the
shares of Future Communications Inc., a cable television
programming company in Dallas that went bankrupt in 1993, and the
shares of the L.L. Knickerbocker Co. in California, which sells
collectible dolls and teddy bears that have been endorsed by
celebrities like Marie Osmond and Annette Funicello.
</P>
<P>
   The manipulations, regulators said, resulted in huge runups and
then great falls. Shares of Future rose from $6.50 to $27.25 on the
Nasdaq stock market in a two-month period before collapsing in
1993. And in just over a month in 1995, shares of Knickerbocker
climbed from $6 to $52 on the Nasdaq market before plummeting,
according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Khan, the commission said, orchestrated an elaborate scheme to
drive up the prices of those two stocks, including buying up a
substantial share of the available stock, restricting access to the
stock, ``parking stock'' in the names of fictitious accounts and
creating demand for the stock by ``making misleading statements and
touting wildly exaggerated earnings projections.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Khan was also accused of promoting the stock of
Future on the expectations of growing viewership of Billy Bob's
Country Countdown, a one-hour music television show, and MSTV, a
cable network, even though he knew, according to regulators, that
the owners of those two outlets had said they were not affiliated
with Future Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Khan earlier made headlines in 1993, when he became embroiled in
a nasty proxy battle with Milan Panic, the former prime minister of
Yugoslavia and chairman of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Costa Mesa,
Calif., and eight other board members over control of the company.
ICN and Khan have been locked in a legal battle over whether Khan
used insider information to try to gain control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a federal judge blocked Khan's proxy fight and
suggested Khan may have perjured himself in sworn testimony. In
ordering an injunction, The judge, John Sprizzo of the federal
district court in Manhattan, said that he would ask federal
prosecutors to investigate Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Sprizzo said that Khan had concealed information about his past,
which included an investigation by British authorities into Khan's
involvement in British Gas, the subject of another securities fraud
case.
</P>
<P>
   Khan, whom some investors and portfolio managers considered a
stock wizard, managed to convince mutual fund companies like
Fidelity Investments and the Invesco Fund Group to buy into his
stock picks in the early 1990s. Invesco, for example, bought a
large stake in ICN Pharmaceuticals in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Khan, a former stock broker for Reynolds Kendrick Stratton (with
Tyrrell) and later at Shamrock Partners, was also sued in the early
1990s by investors who accused him of manipulating the stock of
Future Communications.

IRVAN'S `SECRET' FORMULA WINS BRICKYARD POLE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It's no secret that Ernie Irvan has found the
fast lane around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But don't expect
Irvan to divulge the magic setup that for the past two summers has
produced record-setting pole runs for the Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a secret, I wouldn't tell you. And I don't think I
do,'' said Irvan, who earned the No. 1 qualifying spot for
Saturday's NASCAR Winston Cup race with a hot lap at 179.394 mph
yesterday evening. ``It just goes to show you I get around the Indy
racetrack fairly good. You can't do it without an awesome car and
an awesome lap. You have to put 100 percent dedication to get your
line perfect, and have a car capable of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   And under unsettled weather conditions like yesterday's, it also
helps to get out first and get it over with. Qualifying to lock in
the first 25 of 43 available positions was scheduled to begin at
1:30 p.m. But a rainstorm delayed the start until 5:14, when Irvan
was first out on a green track _ one devoid of rubber laid down
during two days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going first might have set the precedent to run that fast,''
said Irvan, a former Daytona 500 champion who is in his first
season of driving the No. 36 Skittles Pontiac Grand Prix for Read
Morton. ``A lot of times when the racetrack is green, that's when
it sticks the best. Our car seemed to handle perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Irvan toured the 2.5-mile IMS layout at a stock car
record of 50.637 seconds/177.736 mph in the No. 28 Texaco Havoline
Ford Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Irvan clipped off a lap in 50.169 seconds/179.394 mph
to claim his first Bud Pole with crew chief Ryan Pemberton. The
pole _ a first for Pontiac at this event _ was the 20th of Irvan's
Cup career in 281 starts and made him the second driver to win two
series poles at IMS. Reigning Cup champion Jeff Gordon, winner of
the inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994, started from the pole in 1995
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, it was Gordon who had the last shot at knocking Irvan
off the point.
</P>
<P>
   The 47th of 50 cars to make a qualifying attempt, Gordon ran off
a lap at 178.324 mph that placed the No. 24 DuPont Automotive
Refinishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo third and inside on the two-car
second row.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan was joined in the front row by Dale Jarrett, the 1996
race-winner and Irvan's former Robert Yates Racing teammate.
Jarrett, who beat Irvan to the finish line after a no-team-orders
brawl here in 1996, lapped yesterday at 178.596 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an incredible lap Ernie put up there, especially
being the first car out,'' said Jarrett, driver of the No. 88
Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus. ``But we've got a good
race car and I was happy to get that in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's No. 2 start is a career-best at IMS, topping his
third-place effort in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing the pole, Gordon now has qualified on the front
row in nine of the past 10 races this season _ and won two of the
last three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to see 1994 again,'' said Gordon, who has a
62-point lead on Mark Martin after 18 of 33 races. ``We qualified
third (that year) and had one of the fastest cars in practice. We
qualified third here today. I hope we get the same results on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kenny Irwin Jr. _ who was introduced as Irvan's
replacement here one year ago _ nailed the No. 4 qualifying slot at
178.260 mph in the No. 28 Taurus. He and fifth-place qualifier Jeff
Green, introduced yesterday as the newest full-time driver of the
newly responsored No. 46 The Money Store Chevy,
</P>
<P>
   were the last drivers to break Irvan's former qualifying record.
Green ran 177.915 mph, and will be joined in Row 3 by Gordon's
Hendrick Motorsports teammate, Ricky Craven, at 177.701 mph in the
No. 50 Bud Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Among those failing to qualify was defending race-winner Ricky
Rudd, who stood 27th at 175.750 mph in the No. 10 Tide Taurus. He
was trailed by seven-time Cup champion and Daytona 500 winner Dale
Earnhardt at 175.668 mph in the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus
Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-first-round qualifiers were separated by 1.027 seconds.
Second-round qualifying is scheduled for this afternoon.

EDITORIAL: THE MASTER OF BROADWAY AND BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   Lights dimmed for a moment last night on Broadway, the theater
world's way of honoring Jerome Robbins, one of the century's great
choreographers. Robbins, who died in New York City on Wednesday at
age 79, left his legendary imprint on every Broadway show he
touched, on every ballet he crafted and on audiences who felt his
untethered genius behind the athletic rumble in ``West Side Story''
or in ``Watermill,'' a ballet executed with such exacting slowness
that George Balanchine described it as being without time.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a tough, even tyrannical artist, Robbins made the same
demands of himself, assuring that each dance form pushed into new
creative territory. ``I am a perfectionist,'' he once explained
with a touch of indignation about such pedestrian criticism. ``I
wear that badge proudly. I think that's what art is about. ...''
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, Jerome Robbins was a familiar name on the
playbill, as choreographer or director of such Broadway classics as
``Gypsy,'' ``Peter Pan,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``The Pajama
Game'' and ``The King and I,'' to name only a few. His most famous
musical, ``West Side Story,'' the movie version of which won him
two Oscars, and his first musical, ``On the Town,'' about three
sailors on leave in New York, were both done with Leonard
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who wrote the book and lyrics for
``On the Town,'' recalled Thursday how the Robbins dance vernacular
was so vast that he never seemed to repeat himself. The humor was
startling or subtle, never descending to vaudeville, they said. As
Green explained, ``Things that might at first seem ordinary, he
made it seem that you had never seen them before.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of his colleagues, his only misstep was an appearance
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities when he named
eight colleagues in a local Communist Party rather than risk being
blacklisted on Broadway. That act stirred great controversy among
those in the arts community, where many saw his cooperation with
the committee as unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   Over his 79 years, with his work on Broadway and his last ballet
in 1997 set to Bach concertos, Robbins took millions of people to a
new place, as he once put it, a world ``where things are not
named.'' &QL;

HARRIED MARKETSPAN CHAIRMAN IS SAID TO PLAN RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Amid mounting pressure from stockholders,
public officials and board members, the embattled chairman of the
newly formed Marketspan energy company, Dr. William Catacosinos, is
negotiating the terms of his resignation, company officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking official with close ties Catacosinos said the
chairman's resignation could be announced as early as Friday, when
the company's board meets in Manhattan to discuss, among other
things, the controversy over Catacosinos' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos' resignation would end a brief but stormy reign at
the company that was formed in part from the remnants of Long
Island Lighting Co., which Catacosinos had led since 1984. In
recent weeks, he has been harshly criticized over the $42 million
in severance that the LILCO awarded him as its chairman just before
he took over his new post at Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan's public relations office declined to comment on
Catacosinos' fate except to say that any decisions would be made by
a three-member committee that the directors designated to review
the situation with the advice of an outside law firm, Simpson
Thacher &AMP; Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   But one company official said he thought it unlikely that there
would be another large severance package for Catacosinos. All the
top officials at Marketspan are working without contracts, and his
guarantees for severance payments came from his previous LILCO
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for Catacosinos' resignation have lasted several
days, company officials said. An agreement was nearly reached, but
Catacosinos backed away, according to those same officials. But
now, they say, a deal is close at hand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The resignation preparations came amid a crisis atmosphere on
the eve of Friday's crucial board meeting. The meeting's location
was switched at the last minute from the company's Long Island
headquarters to Simpson Thacher's office in Manhattan. The
directors face a struggle for control of the company and demands
from Gov. George Pataki for Catacosinos' ouster.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors swirled about Catacosinos' departure, his supporters
on Wall Street complained of political interference with the
company. One leading investor demanded a special meeting of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan was formed barely two months ago when the Brooklyn
Union Gas group merged with what was left of LILCO after New York
state bought most of LILCO's electricity service amid fanfare and
high hopes. But the ensuing dispute over Catacosinos' severance,
plus $25 million paid to 25 other LILCO executives, rapidly
escalated into full-blown corporate warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who engineered the state takeover of LILCO's electricity
service to enable a 20 percent cut in Long Island's electricity
rates, had accused Catacosinos of ``a secret act of greed'' and
charged that the payments violated state agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos' departure would be a big coup for the governor, who
is running for re-election. He could claim credit for reducing
electric bills and getting rid of both LILCO and Catacosinos, a
lightning rod for public resentment when Long Islanders were paying
the highest rates in the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that Mr. Catacosinos must resign, and the
sooner he does, the better off Marketspan is, the better off LIPA
is and the better off Long Island is,'' said Richard Kessel, the
governor's appointee as chairman of the Long Island Power
Authority, the state agency that took over LILCO's electricity
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians have also been clamoring for Catacosinos'
removal, some specifying that they wanted Robert Catell, formerly
Brooklyn Union's chairman and now Marketspan's president, to
succeed Catacosinos as chairman, or one of their own members or
someone else from the outside. Since Catacosinos served as both
chairman and chief executive, the board could also split his titles
between two people.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is control of Marketspan's board and management, the
fate of its highest executives, its mission and strategy _ even its
existence, according to company officials and industry analysts.

PEARSON FACES NEW SCRUTINY IN ITS SIMON &AMP; SCHUSTER BID
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British media group Pearson PLC is facing a new round of
scrutiny from U.S. antitrust regulators in its bid to become the
world's biggest educational publisher with the purchase of most of
Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, the Justice Department extended its examination
of the competitive impact of Pearson's purchase of Simon &AMP;
Schuster's educational, professional and reference publishing
business from Viacom Inc. But a Pearson spokesman in London said
Thursday that this phase _ known as a second request review _ was
not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought there would be a second request,'' the
Pearson spokesman said. ``Back in May, we said that we expected to
complete this transaction in the second half of 1998, basically by
the end of this year. And we have no reason to revise that view.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson agreed in May to buy Simon &AMP; Schuster's operations for
$4.6 billion, striking a revised deal to sell the reference unit to
the American buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst for $860
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the Justice Department's regulators have
demanded additional information from a handful of other publishers
specializing in the science, medical and legal fields. In those
cases, the reviews did not prevent the mergers. It remains rare,
however, for companies to face this more intensive review. Last
year, more than 3,700 companies filed notices in connection with
mergers, but of those only 120 were subjected to the second level
of review.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
confirmed that a review was taking place, but declined to comment
about any other aspect of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson declined to disclose what information the Justice
Department is seeking, although a person who has been briefed on
the review said regulators were examining the merger's impact on
the diversity of textbooks for students in the kindergarten through
high school market and the potential concentration in the college
market in textbooks for chemistry, biology, math and physics.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Authors Guild, which unsuccessfully
challenged Bertelsmann's merger with Random House, said that it
approached the Justice Department last week with an offer to
provide information about potential concentrations in the
educational market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our concerns _ which parents and educators should share
_ is that eliminating competition in textbook publishing could lead
to higher costs, less diversity of opinion and a lower incentive to
improve texts,'' said Paul Aiken, executive director of the guild,
which represents published authors.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken said that Pearson might have expected the new level of
review, but ``one may go to the dentist expecting a root canal and
that doesn't make it any more pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a company enters the second phase, the investigative
process could take from four weeks to eight months, according to a
Washington lawyer specializing in antitrust matters. The lawyer
said that federal regulators had tended to demand more narrow
information from publishers about competing titles.
</P>
<P>
   At Simon &AMP; Schuster last week, employees received a reassuring
newsletter that described the additional review and predicted a
merger in the fall, noting that typically companies ``find a
mutually acceptable way to address the regulator's concerns in a
way that allows the transaction to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Greco, associate professor at the business school at
Fordham University, said the new round of examination was
significant for Pearson because it could raise the prospect of
reshaping the merged companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would anticipate some problems,'' said Greco, who has
studied publishing industry consolidation. ``To wrap it up, they
may have to consider divesting some properties. And someone in
Washington might say you have to get rid of certain titles, certain
imprints.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: LOTTERY FEVER _ STATES FEED IT, AND CATCH IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a Bronx waiter is so overcome by Powerball fever
that he plunks down $3,000 that should have gone for his
trade-school tuition, when presumably solid citizens waste hours
standing in line to buy a pipe dream, when ill will flows likes a
river outside overburdened lottery shops in Greenwich, Conn., some
people question the wisdom and even morality of government turning
itself into a numbers runner.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Wexler has been asking that question for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler is a counselor on compulsive gambling from Bradley Beach,
N.J., and has himself had to grapple with addiction demons that
first seized him in the early 1960s. He liked playing the numbers
in those days, when they were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I bet, I hit the number,'' he recalled. ``The
second time I bet, I hit the number again. I thought it was an easy
way to make money. Then for the next seven years, I didn't hit
another number.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a ruinous life, as it is for millions of Americans who
are gambling addicts. They are hardly helped by the fact that the
one who now urges them to place a bet is the Governor instead of a
numbers racketeer.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a lottery ticket, states tell taxpayers. New York state
alone makes $1.5 billion a year from its various games. And the
beauty of it, New York and other states say, is that you support
education with every dollar you put down. They could just as easily
say that your lottery money supports welfare and prison programs,
since all government revenues are, as the budget makers would put
it, fungible. But how many Lotto tickets would be sold with a cry
of ``support welfare''?
</P>
<P>
   Governments also make good money taxing sales of liquor, tobacco
and pornographic videos. Somehow, you never hear elected officials
urging their constituents to do their civic duty by drinking up,
lighting up and turning on while Debbie does Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what would happen if they did that?'' Wexler
said. ``People would go nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Governments do not think twice, though, about dangling before
people the chimera of instant wealth through state-sponsored
numbers games. Make that instant UNEARNED wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Even a moralist like Mayor Rudolph Giuliani does not blink when
it comes to pocketing gambling money. Not to pick on the mayor; he
is no better or worse than most on this issue. But more than most,
Giuliani casts his policies as moral imperatives, whether he is
talking about methadone maintenance as being part of a culture of
addiction, or welfare as erasing the work ethic, or sex shops as
corroding neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even he becomes a strict pragmatist when it comes to the
idea of a possible casino on Governors Island. Go for the money, he
says. His concern becomes not to keep New Yorkers off the road to
perdition but, rather, off the road to Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   As Wexler sees it, government itself has become hooked. ``The
states are addicted to gambling revenue,'' he said. ``They think
they've found a painless way to steal your money.'' And with
something like the Powerball frenzy, he added, ``you've got
gamblers in recovery who are getting urges, flashes, thoughts,
anxieties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be some relapses,'' he said. ``No question about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several studies, including one by the Harvard Medical School,
conclude that the spread of casinos and state lotteries has been
accompanied by sharp increases in the incidence of compulsive
gambling among adults and, even more so, among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Council on Problem Gambling, a nonprofit
group based in Albany, compared 1996 with 1986 and found that the
number of New Yorkers with gambling problems had increased by 74
percent. It has reached the point, the council said, that 7.3
percent of New Yorkers over 18, or more than 750,000 people, have
experienced trouble at some point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no doubt that state lotteries make it
worse,'' said Laura Letson, the council's executive director. And
she argued that the state has ``a moral and social obligation to
set aside funds to help people to suffer the adverse effects of its
gambling policies.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, New York puts up $1.5 million a year to support
programs for problem gamblers. That amounts to one-tenth of 1
percent of its lottery profits. If that were the kind of money that
came with the top Lotto prize, many bettors would not waste their
time buying tickets. &QL;

FERRARO PLAYS THE GENDER CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Asserting that Congress has suffered because of the
scarcity of women in its ranks, Geraldine Ferraro said Thursday
that she should be elected to the Senate because she could, as a
woman, bring a perspective to a variety of issues, from child care
to the economy, that her male competitors could not match.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro played what her advisers believe may be her strongest
political card _ she is the only woman in the New York Senate race
_ as she spoke in Manhattan to an audience of women who own
businesses. She described herself as ``a woman with a national
profile'' who would bring ``a kind of suasion without parallel'' to
the male-dominated world of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, a Democrat, said there was a ``need for women in
leadership positions'' because ``we bring another dimension to the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roles as caretakers, nurturers and mothers cannot help but
give us a different perspective,'' she said, looking straight into
the camera and blinding lights that her campaign had set up to tape
the speech for use in a television advertisement. ``It's not
necessarily better. But it is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said that she was not ``putting down men'' in making
what was a notably undisguised appeal for votes based on sex. But
she approvingly cited Carol Gilligan, a psychologist from Harvard
University, in describing characteristics that Ferraro said were
particular to women and in short supply in the government today.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Dr. Gilligan, instead of engaging in
confrontation, women are more apt to negotiate,'' Ferraro said.
``Instead of looking at short-term solutions to problems, women are
more apt to think in terms of generations to come. Instead of
thinking in win-lose terms, women are more apt to see the gray
areas in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Ferraro seemed to put at least a temporary end to
what has been a fallow period in her campaign. The presence of the
camera crew at her speech, along with the fact that her aides
encouraged coverage of it, suggested that Ferraro will try to do
what a number of women running for office have tried to do without
success in New York over the last decade: turn their identities as
women to their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, a former candidate for vice president, is facing two
men in the Democratic primary who are seeking to challenge Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, this fall: Mark Green, the public
advocate for New York City, and Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal to the women's vote has been a constant if, until
Thursday, subliminal theme in all the statewide races this year.
Female voters are certain to be critical to the outcome of the
Sept. 15 primaries and the general election in November. There are
also women running in the Democratic primaries for governor,
attorney general and lieutenant governor. And candidates from both
parties have been paying particular attention to the kind of issues
_ like day care and health care _ that polls indicate are of
particular concern to women.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual about Ferraro was the directness of her appeal,
which she made in a breakfast speech to about two dozen members of
the National Association of Women Business Owners. Later in the
day, both Green and Schumer questioned her remarks, each contending
that his positions and record were more significant than his sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing for a candidate to run based largely on
appeals to gender, ethnicity or religion,'' Green said by telephone
from Buffalo, where he was campaigning. ``My grandma said I was a
nice Jewish boy, but I wouldn't dream of seeking voters purely, or
largely, on that basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer pointed to legislation he has sponsored in Congress that
is of particular interest to women, like allowing abortion clinics
to sue protesters who block their buildings. &QL;

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seems a good time to drop in on Candace Bushnell,
the sex columnist who spawned what this summer has become one of
HBO's best-rated sitcoms: ``Sex and the City,'' starring Sarah
Jessica Parker, a journey into Ms. Bushnell's 1990s Manhattan
demimonde of models, investment bankers, designer G-strings and
threesomes. Actually, any time is an amusing time to drop in on Ms.
Bushnell, but as it happens there are developments in her life.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at 6 a.m., she got up from her sofa bed in her tiny
Upper East Side apartment (she says she has not made as much money
as people think) and tried to write the first sentence of a novel.
Instead she ended up looking at the first sentences of other novels
_ ``Anna Karenina,'' ``Persuasion,'' ``The Group'' _ for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just made me nervous,'' she said. ``It's, like, the
stupidest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever confused Ms. Bushnell with Tolstoy, Jane Austen
or even Mary McCarthy. On the other hand, her talent for capturing
the mating rituals of the Bowery Bar crowd in her New York Observer
``Sex and the City'' column catapulted her out of the freelance
world of the women's magazines, where she wrote about love and
make-up, and into the lap of Disney, for whom she just finished a
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would spend a week, I swear to God, working on a paragraph
about mascara,'' Ms. Bushnell said. One year in the early 1990s,
when she made only $14,000, she was thrown out of her sublet for
failing to make the $300-a-month rent. She moved in with a
boyfriend, and when that soured, into a friend's office in a
residential building, where she still lives. ``When you're in that
low point,'' she said, ``you wake up every morning at 4 a.m. in a
cold sweat and say, `I've got to make it, I've got to make it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell ran her hand through expensive blonde hair as she
chain-smoked in her dark three-room apartment. Her friend uses one
room for her office. Ms. Bushnell uses the center room for
sleeping, and a small kitchen for writing. The sink works, but not
the stove, which is OK _ Ms. Bushnell does not like to cook in the
city, or have meals during daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't eaten breakfast since I was about 8,'' she said. ``I
hate breakfast. Sometimes I eat lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, 39, was wary but cooperative during an
hour-and-a-half-long conversation (she is cozier on the phone), and
stood out from her prosaic surroundings in a body-hugging white Miu
Miu minidress and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana faux leopard high-heeled boots.
Tan, carefully made-up and model-thin, with nasal tones, she looked
like the kind of woman who is trouble but may be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Her former boyfriend is Ronald Galotti, the onetime publisher of
Vogue who is now Tina Brown's colleague at Miramax and immortalized
as the odious `` Mr. Big'' in Ms. Bushnell's column. ``Ron used to
read my column and say, `Cute, baby, cute,' '' Ms. Bushnell said.
Her current boyfriend is Robert Guccione Jr., who sold Spin
magazine last year for $43.3 million, and is the son of the founder
of Penthouse. Some of Ms. Bushnell's friends say her taste in men
assures she will never run off with Mr. Reliable. She does seem
genetically incapable of falling in love with a nice-guy, a
$750,000-a-year lawyer who would be a good father. Anyway, she
would scare him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get married and have kids more when I was in my
late 20s,'' she said. ``Now I accept the fact that I may not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her background does not suggest a future sex columnist, but it
did school her in elites. She grew up on three acres in an 1826
pale-peach Federal in Glastonbury, Conn., with two younger sisters
and three horses. Ms. Bushnell rode on the local circuit and ran
the family barn. ``She was a take-charge person,'' said her father,
Calvin Bushnell, who helped develop the fuel cell that powered the
Apollo space missions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell graduated from Glastonbury High School, went to
Rice University (``I guess I must have been majoring in English''),
then dropped out to pursue an acting career in New York. ``I was
horrible,'' she said. She was better at going every night to Studio
54. She made her way through the women's magazines, among them
Ladies Home Journal and Self, and still remembers writing headlines
like ``Four Fabulous Fiesta Dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her turning point came when she started writing freelance
profiles for The Observer, which in 1994 offered her ``Sex and the
City,'' a fiction column that was to be based on her own life.
Peter Kaplan, The Observer's editor, named the column and with his
colleague Peter Stevenson helped talk Ms. Bushnell through it.
Kaplan said at times that there was ``blood on the floor'' after
editing sessions, but that ``very often she'd bring in the steak
cooked and just drop it on the desk.'' The column is now on hiatus,
and The Observer is eager to have it back, but Ms. Bushnell is
vague about her intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I'm not going to go back,'' she said.
``Because I don't want to hurt their feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   For now she will revise her Disney screenplay about a woman who
meets men at sporting events, and work on her novel, about a group
of Manhattanites over a decade. And she loves watching Sarah
Jessica Parker on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're closer to 40, you end up being a little happier
with your life,'' she said. ``You don't feel compelled to try to
get your happiness from somebody else.'' &QL;

NOEL BEHN, WRITER AND PRODUCER, DIES AT 70
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By NOEL BEHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Noel Behn, a Manhattan novelist, screenwriter,
theatrical producer and celebrated raconteur who held court nightly
at Elaine's, the Upper East Side watering hole, died here Monday at
Beth Israel Hospital. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Behn died in his sleep from a heart attack after a yearlong
battle with cancer, said Tom Fontana, the executive producer of the
NBC series ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' for which Behn was a
creative consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Involved in theater for more than 50 years, Behn was at the
forefront of the creation of the off-Broadway movement as the
producing director of the Cherry Lane Theater in the 1950s and
'60s, during which he presented the New York premiere of Sean
O'Casey's ``Purple Dust'' and the world premiere of Samuel
Beckett's ``Endgame.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote seven books, including the novels ``Seven Silent Men''
and ``The Shadowboxer.'' His first novel, ``The Kremlin Letter'' _
which drew on his experiences in the U.S. Army's
Counterintelligence Corps _ was released as a motion picture in
1970, directed by John Huston and starring Orson Welles. ``The
Brink's Job,'' a 1978 movie starring Peter Falk and Peter Boyle,
was adapted from Behn's nonfiction work ``The Big Stick-Up at
Brink's,'' about the 1950 Brink's heist in Boston. His latest book,
``Lindbergh,'' a study of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, is
in development as a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1960s and '70s, Behn rented an office in the
same 57th Street building as screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky,
choreographer Bob Fosse and playwright Herb Gardner. The foursome
became inseparable, said Fontana, an ``unofficial club who worked
together and played together,'' their offices ``a fountain of
creativity where they shared ideas and helped each other on
whatever the other was working on.''
</P>
<P>
   A captivating storyteller both in his writing and his private
life, Behn could be found at the Russian Tea Room eating lunch in
the first booth and at Elaine's in the evening where, as the host
of his own table, he shared food, drink and conversation with
writers Gay Talese, A.E. Hotchner, Peter Maas and Pete Hamill.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he met Woody Allen, who also had his own
table, and through the years, each often joined the other's table.
Allen cast his friend in his films ``Another Woman,'' ``Stardust
Memories'' and ``Manhattan'' _ although his appearance in the last
one ended up on the cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work in film and theater, Behn wrote for
television shows, including ``Tattinger's,'' a series that Fontana
produced for NBC in 1989, with Blythe Danner and Mary Beth Hurt.
Since 1991, Behn had served as a creative consultant on ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' for which he wrote or co-wrote six episodes
and was writing a seventh at the time of his death. His script ``A
Many Splendored Thing'' was nominated for the 1994 Writer's Guild
Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.
</P>
<P>
   Among his friends, Behn was noted for his generosity in helping
younger people enter the arts world. ``Noel was one of these people
who loved young talent, whether it was writers, actors or
directors,'' Fontana said. ``All the way back to his theater days,
he was always there for people who were trying to get into the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Noel was also in the counterintelligence, so there are a whole
lot of mysteries, both in his life and in his writing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Behn, who was divorced, is survived by his mother, Dorothy Behn,
of Miami Lakes, Fla.

CHARLES TILLINGHAST, 87, TWA CHAIRMAN, BROWN CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., R.I., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles C. Tillinghast Jr., a lawyer, businessman and investment
banker, who was chairman of Trans World Airlines and a former
chancellor of Brown University, died July 25 at his summer home in
Little Compton, R.I. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He died of heart disease, a spokesman for the family said.
</P>
<P>
   Tillinghast, who built his career as a law partner at the New
York firm of Hughes, Hubbard, Blair &AMP; Reed, went on to play a
leading role in a handful of America's best-known companies,
including Bendix Corp., TWA and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   As TWA's chairman, Tillinghast steered the airline through
considerable turbulence, including the oil crisis of 1973-74,
winning credit for saving the airline from a disastrous combination
of fast-rising fuel prices and falling ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   The son of the late Charles C. and Adelaide Shaw Tillinghast,
Charles Carpenter Tillinghast Jr. was born in Saxtons River, Vt.,
on Jan. 30, 1911. He attended the Horace Mann School in Riverdale,
where his father was headmaster and from which he graduated in
1928. Four years later, Tillinghast graduated from Brown
University, where he played center on the football team.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Columbia Law School in 1935, he spent
three years as a Wall Street lawyer, and then worked for two years
for the Manhattan district attorney at the time, Thomas E. Dewey,
before returning to Hughes, Hubbard, Blair &AMP; Reed. He became a
partner in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Tillinghast's law practice provided the foundation for a
substantial business career. In 1957, he was appointed vice
president and a director of Bendix Corp., the Detroit auto parts
company that would eventually become part of the Allied Signal
Corp. Four years later, he was named president and chief executive
of TWA, later becoming chairman. His management during a period of
falling demand for air travel brought Tillinghast praise and the
public eye, and his picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from TWA in 1976, he became vice chairman of
White, Weld &AMP; Company, an investment banker that was acquired by
Merrill Lynch in 1978. The acquisition led to Tillinghast's
becoming a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, a post he held until his
retirement in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Tillinghast became a trustee of Brown University in 1954, and
its 15th chancellor in 1967. Brown awarded him an honorary degree
in 1967 and the Susan Colver Rosenberger Medal in 1982. In the last
two years, two professorships were established there in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Tillinghast is survived by his wife, Lisette Micoleau
Tillinghast; a son, Charles C. Tillinghast 3d of La Jolla, Calif.;
three daughters, Elizabeth Nadeau of Rochester, Jane Roberts of
Stowe, Vt., and Anne Tillinghast of Providence, R.I.; two brothers,
John A. Tillinghast of Exeter, N.H., and David R. Tillinghast of
New York City; 12 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.

redesign of the Cabbage Patch doll for the mass market as well as
other commercially successful dolls, died July 20 from breast
cancer at her home in Mill Neck, N.Y. She was 59.
</P>
<P>
   Her vinyl recast of the formerly all-cloth Cabbage Patch doll in
the early 1980s for the toy company Coleco Industries set off a
frenzy among parents to obtain the dolls for their children or,
perhaps, for themselves. Mrs. Albert had devised a way to
manufacture the dolls with variety in eye color, facial features
and clothes, so that each one looked unique. Like the originals,
they also came with birth certificates, suggesting additional
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were beating each other up in the store aisles, trying
to get one,'' recalled Christopher Byrne, editor of Playthings
Market Watch, a toy-industry newsletter. ``There were stories about
people flying to Europe to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Carman, a native of Rockville Centre, N.Y., graduated
from the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan and joined
Ideal Toy Co., then based in Queens, New York City, in 1960. She
remained there for more than 20 years, said her husband, Arthur,
whom she met when he joined the company in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Together _ she was the designer, he was the marketer _ they
worked on a series of dolls, including Betsy-Wetsy, Tiny Tears,
Tiffany Taylor and Chrissie, a doll heralded in television
commercials for her ``beautiful hair that grows, and grows, right
down to her toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie, Mr. Albert said, was inspired by a television show he
and his wife were watching one night about Rapunzel. ``The hair
gave us the idea,'' he said. Chrissie, whose hair could be rewound
with a knob attached to her torso, inspired a line of other dolls,
including Velvet, who had purple eyes, Mr. Albert said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1981, the couple had left Ideal because they did not want to
follow the company when it relocated to New Jersey. They
established their own company, called Alberts Design, and continued
working on dolls and other toys. Among their successful projects
was the Puffalumps series of dolls made by Fisher-Price Inc. _ now
part of Mattel Inc. _ one of the first toys to be made of the
synthetic fabric used in parachutes, and, more recently, the
company came out with Singing Bouncy Baby, which sings when bounced
on a child's knee, and Happy Hugs, which has a ``hug-o-meter'' that
measures how hard a child squeezes it.
</P>
<P>
   Thin, exuberant and always meticulously dressed, Mrs. Albert was
a fixture at the annual Toy Fair in Manhattan for many years, where
she now and then dressed in clothes matching whatever Tiffany
Taylor, a Barbie-type doll made by Ideal, was wearing that season.
In her spare time, she painted, sketched, raised prize-winning
dahlias and tended a poolful of ornamental goldfish called koi on
the grounds of the house she and her husband designed and built
together in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Her instinct for what would make a doll appeal to children
appeared to be innate. Not only would she design a doll, but she
would also design the showroom for the manufacturer, said Maurene
Souza, a former executive at Hasbro Inc. who worked with Mrs.
Albert over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always understood the connection the child makes with the
toy,'' Byrne said. ``Toys that have long-term value really aren't
complete without the child.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, of Mill Neck, Mrs. Albert is
survived by her mother, Florence Carman of Franklin Square, N.Y.; a
stepson, Ross M. Albert of East Norwich, N.Y.; a stepdaughter,
Ronda Kornfeld of Greensboro, N.C., and four stepgrandchildren.

Lithuania 
gets past 
U.S. team
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ In case they were getting full of themselves,
these young Americans who want to rule the basketball world found
out the hard way Thursday that reputation won't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Any strut the Americans had is gone after Lithuania outplayed
them, survived an impressive U.S. rally topped by a missed
3-pointer at the buzzer, and won 84-82 at Peace and Friendship
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Lithuanians rolled up a 16-point lead with former Seton Hall
standout Arturas Karnisovas throwing in 29 points. But the United
States stormed back with a barrage of 3-pointers and would have
pulled out an unlikely, probably undeserved win if Jimmy Oliver's
open-look 28-footer at the buzzer had not been a fraction of an
inch long, careening off the back rim, then the front rim and
bouncing out of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the United States to 1-1 in the opening round
of the FIBA World Championship of Basketball. It was the first loss
by a U.S. men's international team since the semifinals in the 1990
World Championship. Since then, the United States had won 26
consecutive games with NBA players leading each team in the
Olympics (1992 and '96) and the World Championship ('94).
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we weren't invincible,'' said David Wood, who had a
key 3-pointer during the comeback. ``After Italy (in an exhibition)
and Brazil (in the tournament opener) played us close in the first
halves of those games, we knew that. It was pretty high intensity
when we were getting our rears kicked in the first half. It was
like, `What's going on here?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird feeling having a United States jersey on and not
be winning by 40 points. But they played very well in the first
half, and we made an excellent comeback. We made a lot of clutch
shots. We just came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point in this tournament, the Americans expected to be
in a do-or-die situation. They just didn't expect it to come this
quickly. If the wrong scenario pops up today, they could be one of
only four teams that do not qualify for the second round.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. team can't beat South Korea, and if Brazil were to
beat Lithuania, the Americans would finish last in Group C and be
left to fight it out with the last-place finishers of the other
three groups for 13th place in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania beat South Korea by 41 points, so the U.S. team will
be favored. Still, it's never fun to be in a must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday, Rudy Tomjanovich's team has nobody to blame but
itself for being in a tough situation in the first round. And its
defense disappeared long enough in the first half to give Lithuania
an insurmountable head start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was a very disappointing game for us,''
Tomjanovich said. ``They really dictated the tempo. They had us
backpedaling from the start. To their credit, they made some real
big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some big plays also, but I thought it was amazing the
way the game was going that we had a chance to win the game at the
buzzer. I'll put my money on Jimmy Oliver to make that shot every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had fallen behind by a double-digit margin because
their defense was outsmarted by the Lithuanians. The U.S. defense
was horrible in the opening 20 minutes. Lithuania shot 54 percent
in the half but went 11-for-12 in a stretch when it turned a 10-7
deficit into a 34-20 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not playing good defense early,'' Tomjanovich said.
``They were just running by us.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trailed by 12 with seven minutes to play but scored on
seven consecutive possessions, the last on Wood's 3-pointer with
3:54 to go, to pull within 76-73.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and Michael Hawkins hit 3-pointers as the U.S. kept up
the pressure. Down just 83-81 after Oliver's trey with 13 seconds
left, the Americans fouled Karnisovas, who made just the second of
two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a 3-pointer to tie, the U.S. instead was sent to the
free-throw line as Hawkins was fouled with 2.5 seconds left. He
made the first, then intentionally missed the second and the ball
was batted out of bounds by the Lithuanians with 0.5 seconds
showing.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough time to catch and shoot, which is what Oliver does
best. He popped out and was wide-open, but the shot refused to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the circumstances, I think I had a great look at
the basket,'' Oliver said. ``It just rattled in and came out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was surprising Oliver ended up alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally screwed up their assignments,'' Wood said. ``It
was an unbelievable screwup on their part. It was a gift, an
unbelievable gift that we didn't quite receive. What a great win
that would have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will be chalked up as a wake-up call for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should affect us, and I want it to affect us _ in a
very positive way,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I told our team when we
started in Chicago that we had to become better as we get
experience. We have to learn from lessons like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I told our guys (after the game) was that the test of a
good team, a real team, is how you handle disappointments and
obstacles. We felt that it was going to be a tough tournament all
along. I feel like we did a pretty good job of letting this team
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Miller, who led the United States with seven rebounds, said
the team lacked the confidence it displayed in the opening blowout
of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come with that attitude, and I don't think we
showed that attitude on the court,'' Miller said. ``We just kind of
showed up with the reputation. We started out a little sluggish.
You get down so much, and it's not the points, it's that the other
team has the confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tomjanovich said: ``They had a very aggressive offensive
game, and by the time we got them under control, it was too late.
Their team was a little better than our team was today.''

WORLD'S 1ST `HYBRID' CAR COMING TO U.S. IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Story has also moved in `f' category code) 
(mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Toyota Prius, the world's first mass-produced
hybrid vehicle, has been a success in Japan since it went on sale
last December. In about two years, Americans will have a chance to
sample the car for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius (pronounced PREE-us) combines a gasoline engine with
an electric motor, thereby promising pollution levels nearly as low
as those of fully electric vehicles but with the everyday
practicality of a conventional gasoline-powered automobile. For
that reason, many engineers are more excited about the potential of
hybrid vehicles than they are about electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months the Prius has been on the market in Japan,
more than 7,700 have been sold. That certainly qualifies as a
success, at least as measured against the modest expectations for
any alternative vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Sales are strong partly because Toyota is selling the vehicle
for 2.15 million yen, about $15,500 _ well below the car's
development and production costs and only about $1,500 more than
the similarly sized Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says the Prius will reach the American market late in
2000. The price in the United States and other details of the
American model have not been determined, but the challenge here
will be greater than in Japan. Gasoline prices in the United States
are a fraction of Japanese prices. Moreover, Toyota must
substantially tweak the design if the Prius is to deliver its
promised fuel economy and low emissions under American driving
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan's standard fuel-economy test, the Prius gets a
remarkable 66 miles a gallon, about double the fuel efficiency of a
similar gasoline car. It also has half the gasoline car's carbon
dioxide emissions and only 10 percent as much output of carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota executives said at a recent news conference here that
their goal was for the American version to qualify for California's
new proposed category of ``super ultra-low-emission'' vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Prius uses gasoline, it cannot be a zero-emission
vehicle. But under a proposal before the California Air Resources
Board, such ``super ultra low'' vehicles would be granted some
credit toward meeting the future requirement that 10 percent of the
vehicles sold by major manufacturers meet zero-emission standards.
</P>
<P>
   While Toyota might at first concentrate in California and some
other environmentally conscious markets, it eventually hopes to
sell nationwide and does not want the car to be typecast as a
fringe vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Okuda, Toyota's president, recently announced in Japan
that the company plans to export 20,000 Priuses a year starting in
2000, many of them no doubt bound for the United States. By
contrast, in the last year only a few hundred electric vehicles
have been sold in the United States by all manufacturers combined.
</P>
<P>
   Fully electric vehicles are expensive and can only be driven
about 100 miles or so before the batteries must be recharged, a
process that takes several hours. The Prius, by contrast, can be
filled up at a gasoline station like any other car. It uses power
from the gasoline engine to recharge the batteries as the car is
driven, so it is never necessary to go to a recharging station.
</P>
<P>
   Because the batteries and gasoline help each other, the Prius
can get by with smaller versions of each, cutting costs and weight.
The batteries, for instance, weigh only about one-fifteenth as much
as those in a fully electric vehicle. And the gasoline engine has a
capacity of only 1.5 liters.
</P>
<P>
   Under complex computer control, the Prius switches from battery
power to gasoline power, or a combination of the two, automatically
and seamlessly. The driver just steps on the fuel pedal and is
oblivious to what is powering the car.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the car is idle or starting up at slow speed, it is powered
by the batteries alone. Therefore, there is no pollution or
gasoline wasted when the car is, say, mired in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   At moderate speeds, the car is powered by the gasoline engine.
Some of the engine power that is not used to drive the vehicle is
diverted to a generator to make electricity used to recharge the
battery.
</P>
<P>
   At very high speeds or during full-throttle acceleration, the
battery and the gasoline engine work together.
</P>
<P>
   The small gasoline engine alone, for instance, can make the car
go as fast as 80 mph. But with the batteries kicking in, the speed
can hit 110. Once the batteries run down, the speed would drop back
below 80, even though the driver maintains constant pressure on the
accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   This situation would not be faced by most drivers. At lower
speeds, the Japanese version of the Prius performed just like a
regular car. In a short test drive, it was virtually impossible to
tell when the car shifted from battery power to gasoline and back.
</P>
<P>
   The squat four-door sedan, designed at Toyota's studio in
Newport Beach, Calif., can seat five, four quite comfortably, with
enough room in the back seat for tall people. Its acceleration is
somewhat sluggish, but that is not unusual for a car of its size.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius' dashboard contains a small video screen that displays
a schematic diagram of the car's inner workings, using moving
arrows to show how the energy is flowing at any given instant,
whether from the battery or the gasoline engine. This quickly
becomes distracting to the driver. Most drivers probably wouldn't
care what is happening under the hood anyway, since it has no
bearing on how they drive.
</P>
<P>
   But what was most revealing was when a button labeled ``fuel
economy'' was pressed. The display changed to a bar graph showing
the car's fuel economy over the last half-hour, broken up into
five-minute intervals.
</P>
<P>
   What's this? In one 20-minute test drive mainly on city streets
with one two-mile stretch of Los Angeles freeway, the Prius
achieved only about 24 mpg, far less than the 66 mpg advertised and
not even as good as many small all-gasoline cars.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, test drivers accelerate more quickly than an average
motorist would, but that is not the whole story. The fuel economy
and low emissions of a hybrid come mainly from using batteries
instead of gasoline. But that happens mainly at speeds up to about
10 mph. At higher speeds, when the car relies mainly on gasoline,
the Prius is not much more fuel-efficient than other cars.
</P>
<P>
   In the Japanese mileage test, which simulates congested city
driving, the vehicle travels at an average speed of about 14 mph,
according to Toshihiro Oi, the chief engineer of the Prius. Even
near downtown Los Angeles, we were going much faster than that.
Moreover, we had the air-conditioner running, meaning the gasoline
engine was working while the car was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota officials acknowledge that they have work to do to
deliver the promise of the Prius under American driving conditions.
Right now, for instance, the Japanese version of the car would
qualify only as a ``low-emission vehicle'' in California, two ranks
below the rating Toyota hopes to obtain with the American version.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Toyota has managed to design an alternative vehicle
that elegantly succeeds in functioning like a gasoline-powered car
_ perhaps too much so.

HOUSE BARS FUNDS TO IMPROVE LAND NEAR TRUMP PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a slight to Donald Trump, the House of Representatives voted
late Wednesday against the use of federal highway funds to move a
stretch of a New York City roadway that is next to Trump's luxury
condominium project, now being built on Manhattan's Upper West
Side.
</P>
<P>
   But Trump responded that the road suits him fine where it is.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice vote, the House approved a one-sentence amendment to
its transportation appropriation bill for the next fiscal year that
bars the use of any of the money for improvements to the stretch of
the West Side Highway near Trump's project, Riverside South.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was proposed by an opponent to Trump's plan, Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from the Upper West Side. He said the
highway relocation was an effort by Trump to ``subvert hundreds of
millions of dollars of taxpayer funds'' for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler failed to kill a $6 million study of the project that
Congress approved earlier this year as part of the largest
public-works program in the nation's history. The study is to
include an examination of design and engineering options for moving
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the highway would clear the way for a 21.5-acre park to
be included in Riverside South.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said that moving the highway would enhance the view of
the Hudson River from the project's apartments and condominiums,
allowing Trump to charge higher prices and arrange more favorable
financing for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is also controversial because the part of the
highway that would have been moved was just renovated about three
years ago at a cost of $80 million, and has an estimated life of at
least 35 years, according to Nadler's office.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the federal government denied Trump's application for
government mortgage insurance for the next phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Trump declared victory after learning
about the latest vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is a much simpler one for me if we leave the highway
in place,'' he said. ``It's not a highway issue. It's a park
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump said the highway would not affect the view from his
high-rise condominium project, and said he is getting fabulous
rents for the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Nadler is my best friend, economically,'' Trump said.
``He's played right into my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler replied that Trump's response is belied by his efforts to
get federal funds for the project. But he acknowledged that Trump
and his supporters could seek funds again in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sue Kelly, R-N.Y., had requested the funds for the study
project and said Thursday that moving the highway continues to
enjoy ``broad support among local civic, labor, environmental and
business groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment will be reviewed later this year by the conference
committee that will reconcile the House and Senate transportation
bills.

GIMELSTOB WORKS TO REALIZE POTENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Justin Gimelstob used to feel time was moving as
fast as the 124-mile-per-hour serve he blistered past poor Vince
Spadea on Thursday. He couldn't get a piece of his racket on his
goals, much less pierce the sweet spot.
</P>
<P>
   He already was older than fellow American Michael Chang when
Chang became the youngest player to win a main-draw match at the
U.S. Open. He wasn't that much younger than American Pete Sampras
when Sampras won his first professional singles title.
</P>
<P>
   When chair umpires chimed, ``Time,'' at the end of changeovers,
Gimelstob took it personally, as if they were passing judgment on
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being barely old enough to drive and feeling as if
you've fallen two sets behind in the match that is your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point the big fad was being a great pro when you were
16,'' Gimelstob said after beating Spadea to advance to a
quarterfinal match today against top-seeded Patrick Rafter in the
Mercedes-Benz Cup at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. ``All those
guys like Sampras and Chang were playing great. It put a lot of
excess pressure on kids. It did for me. When I look back on it, it
was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Gimelstob, 21, has a better angle on success. The
third-year pro out of UCLA isn't trying so hard any more to be the
next coming of Sampras or Chang or Andre Agassi. After going
through more identities the past few years than rackets, from The
Next Great American Hope to top-ranked player Martina Hingis'
boyfriend, Gimelstob has gone back to the one that served him so
well as a junior:
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-working player in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one of the hardest-working, anyway. Spadea, Gimelstob's
second-round opponent, retired in the 44th minute of their match at
high noon after dropping the first set, falling behind 3-0 in the
second and drawing a conduct warning for getting coached from the
stands. Afterward, the world's 44th-ranked player said a stepped-up
training regimen aimed at cracking the elite ranks has left him
physically and emotionally exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not have even started the match,'' said Spadea, 24,
who splayed balls all over the court in the second set, when he
bothered to chase them down at all. ``My training regimen has been,
like, 24 hours a day. Every day it's a tormenting feeling for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spadea looked so miserable before, during and after the match,
it begged the question: Why bother?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the price you have to pay to try to make it to the elite
group,'' said a clearly weary Spadea, the youngest American to
finish 1994 and 1995 ranked in the top 100 globally.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, the 98th-ranked Gimelstob never pinched any minutes
when it came to training. He gave every single waking second he had
to tennis. When he turned pro, after two stellar years at UCLA, his
focus was diffused by the myriad distractions that are part of pro
tennis' traveling circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came out on the tour, I was the only (USTA pet
project) out there and there was a lot of pressure on me,''
Gimelstob said. ``I started losing a lot, which I wasn't used to. I
got frustrated and I started getting away from the work ethic and
focus that had made me special as a younger player.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that his family, which always had rallied around
him, was bowing under the weight of a terrible tragedy. The same
year Gimelstob turned pro, his older brother Josh, then a junior on
the tennis team at Tulane, killed a man in a hit-and-run accident.
He pleaded guilty and spent six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sometimes don't even realize how much something distracts
you until it's behind you,'' said Gimelstob, who had followed his
older brother into tennis as a child. ``That was a tough time. It
was brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the back injury that sidelined Gimelstob for two
months earlier this year seemed benign. His game benefited from the
time off, as Gimelstob returned to the circuit having re-dedicated
himself to tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a certain period of your life to do this as well as
you can,'' Gimelstob said. ``So you've got to put all your energy
and focus on tennis while you can, even if it means you have to
miss out on little things, like having a relationship or going out
and drinking beer with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his most famous friend, Gimelstob said of Hingis, ``I
liked her. She liked me a lot. It didn't work out. It was a hard
situation because tennis is a very selfish sport. You have to be
that way, you have to be completely focused on what you want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob is so clear on what he wants to accomplish here that
he proceeded to the practice court after his abbreviated match with
Spadea and hit balls for another hour with former UCLA player and
fellow pro Pat Galbraith.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the gregarious Gimelstob was more animated there
than he had been against Spadea on the Stadium Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week I've been getting here at 8:30 in the morning so I
can be the first one on the court,'' Gimelstob said. ``I'm not
comfortable to win just a couple of matches like I was last year.
I'm looking to have that breakthrough tournament. I think I'm
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer than five years ago, for sure.

N.J. LEGISLATORS APPROVE OPEN-SPACE BALLOT MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In one of the nation's most ambitious efforts to
preserve vanishing farmland and woodlands, the New Jersey
Legislature passed a ballot measure Thursday that will ask voters
in November to approve borrowing $1 billion to protect half of the
state's remaining 2 million acres of undeveloped land over the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a major political triumph for Gov. Christie
Whitman, who had made preserving 1 million acres of open space the
top priority of her second term. It came just days after members of
her own party dealt her a major blow by rejecting her other top
priority: an increase of 4 cents a gallon in the gasoline tax, to
be phased in over three years, for mass transit and highway
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman outlined her proposal to preserve open space in her
inaugural speech in January to address mounting concern from
residents and local officials about the impact of rapid development
on the state's landscape and the quality of life in fast-growing
towns.
</P>
<P>
   She said she realized that dramatic steps had to be taken
because, traveling around the state in her first term, she could
see that much of the state's rural character was quickly
disappearing because of development pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal officials across New Jersey had embraced development
for years, mainly to expand their property tax bases. But now a
growing number of local officials are finding that unchecked growth
is driving up local property taxes and causing traffic congestion
and overcrowded public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people see what is happening around them,'' said Michael
Catania, executive director of the Nature Conservancy of New
Jersey, a nonprofit organization that has helped protect
environmentally sensitive lands from development for more than a
decade. ``They see what is being lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Although New Jersey voters have strongly supported open-space
bond referendums in the past, Whitman said that she would campaign
aggressively during the next several months to win voter approval
for this measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the bill unanimously; the General Assembly
voted 70-3 in favor, with little debate. Supporters in the
Legislature described the resolution as one of the most important
initiatives for the state's future.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Republican leaders rejected Whitman's initial
proposal to pay for the preservation of 1 million acres with a
gasoline tax increase of 2 cents a gallon. Whitman agreed instead
to push for legislative approval of a bond referendum that asked
voters to consider the $1 billion borrowing plan.
</P>
<P>
   But she continued to fight for a 4-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax
increase for transportation projects until Republican legislative
leaders in the Assembly canceled a scheduled vote on it this week
because it lacked bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats, who had banded together on Monday to oppose
the gasoline tax, considered trying to block the open space
legislation Thursday to hand Whitman yet another setback. But
statewide polls have consistently shown that protecting the
environment and open space has ranked high among New Jersey voters'
priorities, making the bill politically impossible for most
Democrats to dismiss. Democrats, in the end, voted overwhelmingly
in both houses for the measure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since 1961, New Jersey voters have approved nine bond
referendums that have raised $1.39 billion to help protect more
than 400,000 acres of farmland and other land from development.
Also, 53 New Jersey towns and 13 counties have approved tax
increases that range from 1 to 5 cents on each $100 of assessed
property value to protect undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the state has permanently preserved 922,000
acres from development out of a total of 4.8 million acres of land
in New Jersey. Preserving an additional million acres of open
space, including 500,000 acres of farmland, would mean that almost
2 million acres statewide _ two-fifths of the state _ would be
protected from development.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are looking to provide matching funds to towns
and counties that come forward with plans to protect farmland or
turn other undeveloped land into parks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the state would spend the proceeds from the
$1 billion bond issue, along with $450 million from sales tax
revenue, to preserve 1 million acres of open space over the next 10
years. The referendum would not increase the sales tax, but would
dedicate sales tax revenue for the land acquisition and for
repayment of the borrowing costs. It would take 30 years to repay
the debt, which with interest is estimated to total between $2.5
billion and $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's open space proposal, and her renewed commitment to a
statewide master plan, have caused some concern among developers
who point out that they are building residential developments in
outlying areas in response to market demand.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Keefe, head of the New Jersey Builders Association,
said that the association had no position on the resolution adopted
by the Legislature Thursday. He pointed out that the association
had supported smaller bond referendums for open-space protection in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at some point,'' O'Keefe said, ``the administration will
have to take out a map and show us which million acres they are
talking about, and I think at that point, it will be a much more
meaningful discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Council on New Jersey Outdoors, which recommended
to Whitman late last year that the state protect a million acres,
has suggested that the state preserve 500,000 acres of farmland,
200,000 acres of open space for recreation, 100,000 acres for
watershed protection and 200,000 acres for greenways, trails and
corridors.

APPRAISAL: CHANGING VISIONS OF PUBLIC ARCHITECTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More jazz, please. Less Colossi of Memnon. With less
reverence toward history and more susceptibility to rhythm, the new
plan to develop the Coliseum site on Columbus Circle could become
the architectural breakthrough New York has been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, the plan
is a thoroughly reworked version of the scheme Childs prepared in
the 1980s for the original developer of the Coliseum site, Mortimer
Zuckerman. That plan, which aroused opposition from civic groups
because of its size, was an explicit homage to the Century and the
Majestic, Irwin Chanin's great twin-towered apartment buildings on
Central Park West.
</P>
<P>
   Childs' new design retains the old version's basic Art Deco
silhouette. But instead of sheathing the project's two towers with
masonry, the architect now proposes to dress them in glass. This is
a major improvement, one that will open up this potentially hulking
project to reflections of sky, light and space.
</P>
<P>
   This plan was chosen for financial, not esthetic, reasons. With
Time Warner pledged to come in as the building's major commercial
tenant, the Related Companies offered the most substantial deal to
develop the site. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani deserves major credit for
the decision to create a theater in the building's base that will
be the permanent home for Jazz at Lincoln Center. It's not possible
to imagine a better site to build a place for jazz. Chistopher
Columbus, when he sailed west, may not have known that he was
venturing forth to discover jazz. Four centuries later, we are
somewhat more informed. We know that jazz is one of this
continent's greatest gifts to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is the essential art form of a modern democratic society.
Jazz is urban, ethnically diverse, collaborative and mutable. It
will be fantastic to enter a jazz hall beneath the pillar with
Columbus standing on top. This guy insisted that Europeans explore
new worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Above the Jazz Theater will rise a base dedicated to shops,
movie theaters, restaurants and other commercial uses. Time Warner
will occupy the next highest level in this stacked, vertical city.
The two towers, rising to a relatively discreet height of 750 feet,
have been planned for residential use: apartments and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is much building going on in New York City these
days, there is little evidence of daring. When did New York
architecture become the screen for the projections of fearful
people? Decision makers who sit on boards like the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and the New York City Planning Commission
seem to envision themselves as bunny rabbits scuttling around in
small cages of their own making. Evidently, the best we can hope
for from such people is a quality that they take to be dignity but
the rest of us recognize as failure of nerve.
</P>
<P>
   A design like this one happens not because an architect
genuinely believes in it, but because somebody thinks that this is
something that somebody else wants. Since this project is not, in
fact, a genuine public work, but a private enterprise that will
occupy a publicly conspicuous site, there is enormous pressure to
make the architecture strive for an approximation of dignity. The
result is a design that will play no role in the cultural life of
New York or the history of architecture. It is skillful, earnest
and devoid of meaning.
</P>

PIAZZA'S STATUS REMAINS UP IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Mike Piazza hopes to be laughing about all this
someday, because right now, he isn't smiling at all.
</P>
<P>
   This was the year he was supposed to get the largest contract in
baseball history, continue to put up Hall of Fame numbers and lead
the Dodgers deep into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's playing for his third team, the New York Mets, in
three months and could join a fourth team in 1999. A month short of
his 30th birthday, Piazza still doesn't have a new contract and
there is no certainty that anyone will give him the $85 million he
rejected from the Dodgers in April.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like Piazza is living one of those steamy nights at
Shea Stadium with the planes roaring overhead, it's because he is.
</P>
<P>
   Sure he has an $8,000-a-month apartment on Manhattan's Upper
Eastside, enjoys his New York celebrity and has plenty of
commercial endorsements. But now he acknowledges that mistakes were
made by both sides in the attempt earlier this season to make him a
Dodger for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie, it's definitely been a tough year,
mentally,'' said Piazza, who will be facing his former team tonight
for the first time. ``Maybe in a year or two when everything is
boring, I can look back on all this and joke about it, remembering
how everything was so up in the air. Boring would be good right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Boring is not an option right now. The Mets, like the Dodgers,
are in the wild-card chase that could have a severe impact on the
look of these two teams next season.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, Piazza looks stressed. Even
when the Dodgers were fizzling at the end of the past two seasons,
he deflected most criticism by producing at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he batted .362 with 40 home runs and 124 RBI. His
numbers through the first five years of his career were better than
any catcher in baseball history. And he was best in the clutch,
batting .361 with runners in scoring position, including .306 with
two outs.
</P>
<P>
   This season the overall clutch numbers are down to .281, and
.118 with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best I ever saw at that,'' former teammate Raul
Mondesi said. ``Something must be up.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, New York has been an unforgiving place for Piazza. The
Mets were 24-20 without him in the first 44 games and 22-22 with
him the next 44. And though the Mets are a hot team, winning eight
of their past 10 entering Thursday's game against San Diego,
Piazza's numbers have a hollow ring and fans are upset.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit safely in 18 of his past 19 games and is batting .345
since joining the Mets on May 23. But Piazza, who was traded by the
Dodgers to Florida on May 15 and onto New York eight days later,
has only 23 RBI in 54 games.
</P>
<P>
   For that he has been criticized repeatedly by talk-show callers
and newspaper columnists. Every time he fails with runners in
scoring position, they wonder what he will be doing for the Mets in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been hints that the Mets are worried about his
signability and are willing to trade Piazza rather than lose him to
free agency at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That story originated after Mets general manager Steve Phillips
said he would never trade Piazza. Fans translation: Piazza must
have been available and then taken off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Mets co-owner Nelson Doubleday said recently, ``We will do
whatever it takes to re-sign Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza, who was seeking a seven-year, $105-million contract
from the Dodgers, hasn't sold the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   After the non-trade, trade story, Piazza responded by hitting
two home runs in a 7-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   But with the cross-town Yankees enjoying a record victory pace
in the American League, fans aren't too impressed with the Mets'
wild-card push.
</P>
<P>
   ``Booing is suddenly a big part of my life,'' said Piazza, who
heard it from Dodgers fans for the first time after turning down
three offers earlier this season. ``I understand. I'm not pleased
with the way things are going.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways there are many similarities here to the
Dodgers. The bullpen struggles for a while, then it's the offense
and then the starters have trouble. But right now we're not playing
well. That's how you win the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The future, however, remains clouded.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Mets said they hope to have Todd Hundley do some
catching down the stretch. Piazza replaced the popular Hundley, who
was out until mid-July after undergoing reconstructive surgery on
his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Several National League executives also said Piazza's desire to
become baseball's first $100-million-man was not realistic despite
his gaudy statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pedro Martinez signed a six-year, $75 million contract
last winter with Boston, baseball's record contract was the
six-year, $61 million deal signed by the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield,
then with Florida. Giving Piazza what he wanted would have been $39
million more than the biggest contract from just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's agent, Dan Lozano, maintains they never asked for $100
million. Lozano and Phillips have talked about a new contract, but
Piazza is expected to explore free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has told teammates he does not want to go to a rebuilding
team that would not provide protection in the lineup. That could
rule out expansion Arizona, which spent freely during its first
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, with a $70 million payroll, always are a free
agent's best friend. They could lose center fielder Bernie Williams
to free agency but are not considered in the running for Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contenders are Colorado and Baltimore, both
disappointments this season. Baltimore, which has a $73 million
payroll, could make room by not re-signing second baseman Roberto
Alomar and first baseman Rafael Palmeiro. They earned a combined
$12.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies could be looking at a complete overhaul, including a
new manager and general manager. Dante Bichette and Ellis Burks are
free agents and making a combined $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has said privately that he doesn't consider the Dodgers
an option for next year. His father, Vince, a close friend of new
general manager Tom Lasorda, wants Piazza to sign with
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dodgers' interest, Lasorda said, ``I can't say
anything about that, because he's not on our team. I think he likes
New York. I hope he's satisfied where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said his mistake was thinking the Dodgers would just open
the vault because of past performance. He said the Dodgers failed
because they did not recognize that give and take was part of the
negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have regrets in life,'' Piazza said, ``but I think
you're OK if you truly believe in your heart that you've made the
right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has been so draining, but it's been a learning
experience. You can sit and dwell on the negatives or make it a
positive, which I think will make me a better person and player in
the second part of my career.''

   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors are seeking genetic testing of a dress
belonging to Monica Lewinsky that she says contains physical
evidence of a sexual encounter with President Clinton, lawyers
close to the case say.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky turned the dress over to the office of the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, on Wednesday,
lawyers said. It had been kept for the past several months in the
New York apartment of Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, putting
her in jeopardy of an obstruction-of-justice charge for concealing
evidence that prosecutors had sought in a search of Ms. Lewinsky's
Watergate apartment earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Lewis were given broad grants of immunity
from prosecution this week in exchange for providing full accounts
of Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to turn over evidence, including the dress and
answering machine tapes containing messages to Ms. Lewinsky from
the President, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The messages were innocuous, said a lawyer who had heard them.
In one, just before Christmas last year, the president told Ms.
Lewinsky that the brother of his private secretary, Betty Currie,
had died. In another, the lawyer said, Clinton said, ``Hey, it's
me. Sorry I missed you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky met for several hours with prosecutors at an
undisclosed location on Thursday afternoon in preparation for her
grand jury testimony, which could begin as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The president has maintained a resolute silence on the Lewinsky
matter since late January, when he vehemently denied a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and said he had not told anyone to
lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision to submit to grand jury questioning,
which was announced on Wednesday, came after numerous requests from
Starr over several months, culminating in a subpoena issued on July
17. Many of the president's advisers urged him to resist or ignore
the subpoena, but he decided that giving testimony now was the
quickest way to conclude the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the grand jury will hear Clinton's testimony two
weeks from Monday, there is no sign that the president is prepared
to speak publicly on the matter. Much depends on what Ms. Lewinsky
tells the grand jury when she testifies and whether other testimony
and physical evidence backs her up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's dress is expected to be sent to an FBI forensics
laboratory for DNA testing to determine whether there is a stain
containing Clinton's semen, as lawyers familiar with the case say
that Ms. Lewinsky has asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no reference to the Lewinsky matter on a trip to
North Carolina on Thursday, ignoring shouted questions and not
addressing the issue in a speech on the environment nor later at a
political fund-raising dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said the president was
scheduled to make an announcement on the economy on Friday in the
White House Rose Garden and might take questions from reporters,
who would almost certainly ask about the revelations of the past
several days.
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry said that Clinton had no intention of speaking to
the news media or the American public in any detail in the next two
weeks about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky or about any of the
other questions arising from the months-long perjury and
obstruction-of-justice investigation being conducted by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all talked about it,'' McCurry said. ``He clearly has to
testify and he has to stay focused on that. Until we know what the
testimony is, none of us is in a position to give advice on what he
should say publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors first learned of the existence of a dress that might
be evidence in the case from tape recordings surreptitiously made
by Linda Tripp of conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, a lawyer with
knowledge of the tapes said on Thursday. It is not known whether
Ms. Lewinsky laundered the dress before sending it to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   If semen is found on the dress, prosecutors would then probably
seek a saliva or blood sample from the president to determine a DNA
match. The tests are extremely reliable, said prosecutors and
defense lawyers who use DNA testing in trials.
</P>
<P>
   Such a stain would retain DNA material for many years, unless
the dress had been cleaned with detergents, said experts in DNA
testing. Dry cleaning alone would not remove it, nor would storage
under poor conditions, they said.
</P>
<P>
   With modern instruments and computers, matching could also be
completed in a matter of days, said Barry Scheck, a prominent New
York defense lawyer and an expert on genetic testing. He served as
a consultant for the defense in the O.J. Simpson murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no sperm on the dress, that's the end of the
hysteria,'' Scheck said. ``If there is, there is no legal basis for
the president to resist giving a DNA sample, a simple swab from the
inside his cheek.'' The entire process could be completed in 72
hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the results secret until Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony to
set a ``perjury trap'' for the president would be unfair to Clinton
and bad for the nation, Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, stung by accusations that his office had leaked sensitive
grand jury material to the media, issued a two-sentence statement
today with Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers denying that they were the source
of news accounts this week about Ms. Lewinsky's proposed testimony.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported this week that Ms. Lewinsky told members of
the independent counsel's office that she had had a sexual
relationship with Clinton, despite both of their denials under oath
in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones against
Clinton. It was also disclosed that Ms. Lewinsky was willing to
testify that she and Clinton had agreed they would deny the
relationship to keep it private.
</P>
<P>
   The procession of witnesses before the grand jury continued on
Thursday, with seven Secret Service officers appearing before two
separate panels at the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has sought the officers' testimony to determine whether or
when Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together in the White
House or whom else she might have seen during her 37 White House
visits after she left her job there in April 1996.

 METS LOSE TO PADRES IN 10th, 3-1  
(mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine did everything he could to get Bobby
Jones a victory. The Mets' manager even let his starting pitcher
bat for himself leading off the eighth inning of a 1-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much Jones deserved something better than a
no-decision, the Mets' hitters could not help their starter. And,
after Dennis Cook allowed a two-out, two-run double to pinch-hitter
Carlos Hernandez in the top of the 10th inning, the Mets had not
only lost, 3-1, to the San Diego Padres at Shea Stadium Thursday
night, they had also squandered an opportunity to pull back to
within two games of the Chicago Cubs in the National League
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Cook created his own jam when he hit the former Yankee Jim
Leyritz with a pitch with one out in the 10th. One out later, Chris
Gomez moved the pinch-runner Andy Sheets to third with a single,
his third hit of the game. And then Hernandez drilled a 3-2 pitch
to the gap in left-center for what proved to be the winning runs,
as the Mets fell to 3-7 in extra innings this season. Trevor
Hoffman pitched a 1-2-3 10th for his 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was just the third in the last 11 games for the Mets
(56-49), who could have completed a three-game sweep of the NL
West-leading Padres if they could have scored just one more run for
Jones after Mike Piazza's second-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has now won only three of his last 17 starts at Shea,
dating to June 1997. And he has not won at all since July 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night the right-hander deserved better than his
third consecutive no-decision. He pitched nine dominant innings
with perhaps his best curve of the season, and he still left with
nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   The only run Jones allowed was in the third, on Gomez's leadoff
double and Quilvio Veras' one-out single to right, which kicked off
the heel of Butch Huskey's glove as he charged the ball and
prepared to throw home. That tied the score at 1-1, and negated the
472-foot home run Piazza hit to left to lead off the bottom of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Jones allowed only four other hits. Two were to Tony Gwynn, one
was to Leyritz and the other was to Gomez, leading off the eighth
of what was still a 1-1 game. Piazza, however, threw out Gomez on
what looked to be a botched hit-and-run attempt with San Diego
starter Sterling Hitchcock at the plate. Luis Lopez, who was
starting at short again for the injured Rey Ordonez _ Ordonez came
in as a defensive replacement in the 10th _ made a sensational
short-hop pick of the throw and then tagged out Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who at one point had struck out five Padres in a row,
then struck out Hitchcock swinging and Veras looking for his ninth
and 10th strikeouts of the game to tie his career high.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine let Jones bat for himself to lead off the bottom of
the eighth. The Mets' offense was sputtering against Hitchcock, who
proceeded to set the Mets down in order for the fourth time, as the
teams headed into the ninth still tied.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had basically matched Jones pitch for pitch. Aside
from Piazza's second mammoth homer in as many nights, Hitchcock
stifled the Mets. Their only hits through eight innings were a pair
of two-out singles by Carlos Baerga (one in the second and one in
the seventh), and a two-out fourth-inning double by Butch Huskey,
whom Hitchcock left stranded on second after striking out Bernard
Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock finally departed after allowing a lead-off single to
John Olerud to open the bottom of the ninth. The hit extended
Olerud's hitting streak to 13 games, currently the longest in the
National League. But reliever Dan Miceli came on and struck out
Piazza and Huskey in succession, before retiring Gilkey on a
harmless grounder to third.

Series veterans 
show rare form 
against Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It's possible to count on both hands the number of players
remaining from the Florida Marlins' World Series championship team
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Astros, Livan Hernandez and Cliff Floyd
are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez pitched a five-hitter and Floyd smacked a three-run
homer Thursday afternoon as the Marlins avoided a sweep with a 4-3
victory over the Astros in front of a crowd of 33,303 at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The broomsticks remained in the closet, as the Astros could not
complete their first sweep of a four-game series in more than a
year. The last time the Astros swept a four-game series was July
24-27, 1997, against the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to lose a close game; it always is,'' said
manager Larry Dierker, whose club dropped to 18-13 in one-run games
this season. ``You can think of a lot of things that could put you
in the winner's column.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (9-7), the Most Valuable Player of last year's World
Series, had a lot to do with that. The righthander retired the
first six batters before Tony Eusebio hit his first home run of the
season on a 2-0 pitch to start the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out seven and walked three in his sixth
complete game, third-most in the National League, in shutting down
an Astros offense that had outscored the Marlins 35-14 in five wins
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The top five spots in the Astros' batting order went a combined
1-for-17 with one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have to give Hernandez a lot of credit,'' Dierker
said. ``That guy was tough. The way we had been swinging the bat,
to hold us to five hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is 2-1 with a 2.24 ERA in three career starts against
the Astros, allowing only six earned runs in 24 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very difficult and good team,'' said Hernandez, who
struck out Ricky Gutierrez with runners on first and second to end
the game. ``I was just trying to change my pitches, change speeds
and keep him (Astros left fielder Moises Alou) from hitting home
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who entered the game batting .556 against his former team
this season, was 0-for-2 with two walks and had his streak of
consecutive games with a home run snapped at four, one shy of the
club record.
</P>
<P>
   Astros righthander Shane Reynolds (12-7) spotted the Marlins a
3-0 lead in the first inning before many in the Astrodome had found
their seats. Edgar Renteria singled with one out and stole second,
and after Mark Kotsay struck out, Todd Zeile walked. Cliff Floyd's
15th home run of the season, which came on an 0-2 pitch, gave the
Marlins a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Marlins' quick start, Reynolds retired 10 batters in a
row until Craig Counsell's leadoff single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with (my performance), but I kept the team close
and gave them some innings,'' said Reynolds, who after winning five
straight decisions has lost his past two. ``It's tough to beat them
four straight games and tough to go against their best.''
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio's solo homer pulled the Astros within 3-1. It also
snapped the longest homerless drought on the club _ a string of 191
at-bats for Eusebio dating to June 6, 1997, against San Diego's
Fernando Valenzuela.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point of the game came in the fifth inning. Counsell
beat out an infield hit when his grounder to first base was fielded
by Jeff Bagwell, who had no chance to complete the play as Reynolds
was slow off the mound to cover the base.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, it was downhill from there. Second baseman Craig
Biggio committed his 11th error of the season (he had 10 or fewer
in three of the past four seasons) when he couldn't handle a throw
from Gutierrez for what likely would have been a double play. Todd
Dunwoody sent a double to left field that Alou dropped as he
approached the wall, scoring Counsell from second base to make it
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurt the most was not covering first base,'' Dierker
said. ``That's something we start on the first day of spring
training. That could have saved us a run or at least put us in a
tie situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett added his 11th home run of the season in the fifth,
and Bill Spiers doubled and scored on Bagwell's sacrifice fly to
center field in the sixth to trim the Marlins' lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, one of only eight Marlins remaining from last year's
club, allowed only one hit over the final three innings and worked
out of a jam in the ninth after walking Alou and allowing Eusebio's
infield hit. He ended the game by getting a called third strike on
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Hernandez) had his best stuff, but he did what
he had to do,'' Everett said. ``We didn't take advantage of all the
hangers he threw. So you give him credit because he continued to do
it, and we continued not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida ended its 10-game road trip 2-8. A year after winning
the World Series, the Marlins are on pace to lose the most games by
a defending champion in major-league history. The 70 losses by the
Marlins match their total from all of last season, when they
finished 92-70 to clinch the NL's wild-card spot.

   Big-time gamble &QL; 
always entails risk
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HIS bag was on the bus, but Gerry Hunsicker lugged it off. There's
enough of a chance the Astros can pull off a trade today that the
general manager decided to stay here and work the phones from his
office, rather than try to juggle dozens of calls from a Pittsburgh
hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker's U-turn of sorts doesn't mean anything involving
Roger Clemens, Todd Stottlemyre or the Big Unit himself, Randy
Johnson, et al., is imminent, but it does mean hope springs eternal
in the GM's breast.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good. Because it definitely continues to spring in the
Astros' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros let one get away to the mealy Marlins on Thursday
afternoon, and Francisco Cordova, against whom they didn't hit a
lick last season, will throw for the Pirates tonight. Hence, there
seemed to be just a pinch more urgency in the voices of the veteran
Astros regarding Hunsicker's doing of a meaningful deal before the
clock strikes midnight in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Craig Biggios and the Jeff Bagwells are realists. They know
the Astros as they are presently constituted, no matter how well
they have performed to stay atop the Central Division for most of
the season, are teetering along on a tightrope. Particularly with
their two established arms _ Shane Reynolds' right one and Mike
Hampton's left _ having been underwhelming of late.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up with the Braves
</P>
<P>
   There's minimal margin for error as far as reaching the playoffs
is concerned, and once into October, the Astros can hardly be
judged the equal of Atlanta or San Diego in a best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've both got the three horses,'' Biggio said of the
Padres' and the Braves' starting rotations.
</P>
<P>
   So somehow, some way, the Astros must reel in a pitcher of the
caliber of the aforementioned. M-U-S-T.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years of this franchise,'' Biggio said, ``they've
hung only three (division-championship) banners from that roof.
Sometimes, when you've got a chance to win _ and this team does _
you just have to roll the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hunsicker can't, or won't?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably say, `damn,''' Biggio admitted. ``Sure, I'll be
disappointed. I really don't want to hear about losing prospects
for the future. I want to win now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry does, too. The GM doesn't need his bifocals to see the
window of opportunity the Astros have opened for themselves with
one of baseball's fiercest every-day lineups. But he's quick to
remind how trading under the gun of the deadline is ``high-stakes
poker,'' and sometimes you do lose your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Plus a Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, everybody who's willing to chat with the Astros
brings up Elarton, the organization's ranking whiz kid, and Richard
Hidalgo pretty quickly in the conversation. Yet who's to say
Johnson or Clemens or Stottlemyre will come in and help deliver the
Astros unto the World Series, the only goal worth shooting for?
</P>
<P>
   Remember how badly Stottlemyre stunk up things in the playoffs a
couple of years ago? And how about Johnson's feeble efforts against
Baltimore? And what, pray tell, has Clemens accomplished in the
postseason?
</P>
<P>
   These are not easy decisions. But I'm with Biggio. If there's a
deal that's doable for a high-impact pitcher _ no, Pete Harnisch
doesn't qualify _ it's imperative it gets done.
</P>
<P>
   Randy, Rocket or Todd?
</P>
<P>
   Clemens would be my first choice for a number of no-brainer
reasons, not the least of which is his contract doesn't expire at
the end of the season. And his returning to Houston would almost
match the magnitude of Nolan Ryan's long-ago homecoming. Just
because Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell failed to pay pennant-winning
dividends doesn't mean homeboys must forever be spurned.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Toronto isn't aggressively shopping the Rocket as
the Mariners are Johnson, who is desperately unhappy in Seattle and
counting the hours until he gains his freedom. He would be a
short-term hired gun, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   The short term is all we're guaranteed, though. Elarton, as
stout as he appears, is no sure thing. He's a pitcher, for cripes'
sake. Stuff happens to pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a solid-enough ballclub to win our division with the
players we have,'' manager Larry Dierker said when asked for his
two-cents' worth. ``If we don't win it, it will be our fault. But
obviously, I'd like to see us do something if the price is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Except the price is never right in these situations. The team
with the commodity sits there smugly while the team badly needing
same fusses, fidgets and sweats. At least the rich clubs can afford
to gamble and lose. They can throw money at the problem next season
to fix it. But if the Astros do the wrong thing, if their costly
``savior'' isn't one, there's no mulligan. The damage stays done.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Hunsicker stayed home. That hotel room might have
gotten pretty lonely.

PATAKI VETOES BILL BACKED BY VALLONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A centerpiece of Peter Vallone's campaign for
governor, a bill allowing New York cities to give preference to
in-state contractors over those from other states, has been vetoed
by Gov. George Pataki, whom Vallone hopes to oppose in November.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said in his veto message, dated Wednesday and made public
Thursday, that while he commended the bill's aim of promoting
business in New York state, it would actually hurt in-state
businesses by triggering a trade war with other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since New York state businesses are net exporters of goods and
services,'' the governor wrote, ``this bill will have a negative
impact on New York businesses seeking to contract in other states
and engender results contrary to the bill's stated purpose of
promoting economic development in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vallone, the Democratic speaker of the New York City
Council, said the Republican governor's motivations were political.
``This is a case of, if I say yes, the governor is going to say
no,'' he said. ``And you have a governor who wants to run for
president, and he's not going to do anything to upset business
people in other states who would oppose this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who left Thursday on a three-day fund-raising trip to
Colorado and California, was not available for comment. But a
spokesman, Charles Deister, said that Vallone ``doesn't have a
basic grasp on the facts,'' adding that the bill ``will cost jobs,
instead of creating jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the bill illustrates a broad theme of this
race: Pataki says that after three and a half years under him, the
state is doing well economically, while his four Democratic rivals
assert that New York continues to lag far behind the national boom
and that drastic policy changes are needed. The other Democrats in
the race are Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes and James Larocca, a former state
commissioner of energy and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The veto is more significant in the wake of a ruling early this
month by the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, striking
down a provision in the New York City Charter that allows the city
to bypass the usual rule requiring that government contracts go to
the lowest responsible bidder.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has for years given preference to contractors
based in the city, a policy that Vallone contends adds $1 billion a
year to the city's economy. The court decision outlawed that
practice, but the bill passed by the Legislature in June would have
effectively resurrected it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed with broad bipartisan support, would have
allowed a local government to bypass an out-of-state contractor who
submitted the low bid, and instead choose an in-state contractor,
as long as the New York company submitted a bid no more than 5
percent higher than the low bid.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Vallone has made the contracting preference a
prominent part of his economic plan, saying that as governor, he
would make it state policy. Meanwhile, he sought to make an
in-state preference city policy.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone had planned to have the Council pass a bill next Tuesday
taking advantage of the new state law, to make it city policy.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, opposed the plan and would
have vetoed it, but Vallone clearly had the votes to override a
veto.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Vallone appeared at the site of a planned bridge
across the Niagara River linking Buffalo and the Canadian city of
Fort Erie, to call on Pataki to give preference to New York
contractors in the bidding to build the span.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's try to do it in Buffalo, hire a Buffalo contractor, keep
the jobs in Buffalo,'' he said in an interview, after the event.
``I never believed that the governor would veto this. It's putting
the state at such a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council of New York State, the state's largest
large-business group, opposed the bill for the same reason given by
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's veto message also said that the bill was poorly
written, failing to make it clear that when an out-of-state bidder
is bypassed, a contract must go to the lowest in-state bidder. He
also contended that the bill was in conflict with federal law,
which requires that any project built with federal money go to the
lowest responsible bidder.
