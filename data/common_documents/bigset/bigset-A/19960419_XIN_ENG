<HEADLINE> Tibetan Pasture Coming Back to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangdag Pasture in eastern Tibet,
where the average altitude is above 4,000 meters. is being revived
from a withering state, after five years of management.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Tibetans in this major grassland have devoted
themselves to grass production, increasing per hectare yield by
1,125 kg.
</P>
<P>
The production volume of livestock by-products, which barely
met the demand of herdsmen there, is now more than what the local
people can consume, allowing them to sell 570,000 kg of beef,
15,000 kg of butter and over 4,000 cattle and sheep skins
annually. This has improved the ratio of animal by-products sold
from 10 percent to the present 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Per capita annual income of herdsmen in the pasture area is 600
yuan, a rise of 42.7 percent over 1988, when local herdsmen's per
capita annual income had reached a peak.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sets up First Transient Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Although some major cities in
China provide labor services for non-residents, the first
transient labor center of its kind has been set up in the nation's
capital to handle the growing population of migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
According to "Guangming Daily", the local transient labor
service center opened its first branch in the downtown's Xuanwu
District, close to the new Beijing West Railway Station.
</P>
<P>
The center is supposed to replace illegal labor markets that
have sprung up in the city, and to explore new opportunities for
transient laborers in a more orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that Beijing has some three million transient
people, 70 percent of whom are in commercial and industrial
work. The Xuanwu District has 2,900 companies employing workers
from outside.
</P>
<P>
Although in 1995 the city tightened regulatory controls for the
transients, there is still no really effective comprehensive labor
market. This has resulted in great confusion and disorder among
local employers and laborers.
</P>
<P>
According to local rules, outsiders who intend to work in the
capital should have qualification papers, and a residence and work
permit.

<HEADLINE> Many Okinawans Dissatisfied With Clinton's Diet Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Many Okinawans today expressed
dissatisfaction over U.S. President Bill Clinton's address to the
Japanese Diet (parliament), the Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some Okinawans argued that Clinton's apology for the rape of an
Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The rape of the 12-year-old girl last September, for which the
three American servicemen have been convicted and sentenced to
jail terms, sparked fierce protests across Japan against the
U.S. military presence on the southernmost main island, home to
28,000 of the 47,000 U.S. troops now stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.S. president said in the Diet: "The American
people profoundly regret the horrible violence done to the young
schoolgirl.
</P>
<P>
"Our hearts go to her, to her family and loved ones, and to the
entire Okinawan community. We are gratified that just has been
done," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But many Okinawans remained angered as they feel Clinton's
apology does not truly reflect the sentiment of the people in the
Okinawan prefecture, Kyodo said in a dispatch filed from Naha,
capital of the island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Mayumi Tengan, 28, who visited the United States in February to
seek Americans' understanding on the Okinawan situation, was
quoted as saying that "the president's speech is not enough to
dispel the fear and anxiety of women living in Okinawa as it
failed to promise future prevention of similar incidents".
</P>
<P>
Kyodo quoted Tetsuei Tamayose, head of Okinawa's liaison
committee for child upbringing, as saying: "It is nothing new for
the president to apologize for the incident."
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old said that the incident had caused irreparable
damage on the minds of many children in the prefecture. "Merely
scaling down the size of the military bases cannot be an effective
solution to the problem," he added.

<P>
SEOUL, April 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam said today that he asked the prosecution to punish those
who had violated election laws during last week's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Kim, also president of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP), made
the remark while meeting Kim Dae-jung, president of the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP).
</P>
<P>
It was the first one-on-one meeting between the two since Kim
took the presidential office in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
"I've not yet received a full report on the investigation,"
said Kim Young-sam, "but I think a considerable number of
lawmakers-elect will lose their newly-won parliamentary seats as a
result of the investigation."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that 108 legislators-elect had violated
the election laws in the 15th National Assembly elections held on
Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 79 were already booked while the remaining 29 are

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Turn State-owned Enterprises Into Stock Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will turn
some small and medium-sized enterprises into joint stock companies
in 1996 and 1997 as part of its efforts to restructure state-run
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to experiment the
joint-stock-company system in 150-200 enterprises, the local
English language newspaper "Vietnam News" quoted a senior
government official as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Phan Van Tiem, minister in Charge of the Committee for
Renovation of Enterprises, noted that the stock company system is
vital to the revitalization and restructuring of state-run
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are currently 6,000 state-run enterprises in
Vietnam and it is essential to maintain their leading role in the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The state-owned enterprises that cannot be merged into bigger
conglomerates and those on the verge of bankruptcy will be
eligible for equatization," he added.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new stock company system is aimed at
expanding capital resources, creating new dynamics, preventing
negative elements in business and making state-run enterprises
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the equities will be sold to
employees of the enterprise, other people and legal entities
outside it and in some cases, to foreign individuals and firms, so
as to attract more funds for development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the equities of merely eight small and medium-sized
enterprises in Vietnam have been sold to share holders. Only five
of them have started operation as legal joint-stock entities due
to differences over the new practice.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the experience in the implementation
of the stock company system in about 1.5-2 percent of Vietnam's
state-run enterprises would make it possible to work out a draft
law by the end of 2007, which could provide a firm legal base for
expanding the new system to more state-run firms in the future.

<HEADLINE> Jiang On Military Officers Returning to "Civvy Street" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that the work of arranging civilian jobs for
demobilized officers should be carried out as a political task.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Beijing, Jiang said all the departments involved
must take the overall situation into consideration.
</P>
<P>
"The 'heeding politics' principle must also be enforced in the
work of transferring military officers to civilian life," Jiang,
who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, told a
national conference of outstanding units and individuals in
arranging demobilization today. Premier Li Peng was also present
on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the work is "closely linked to the stability
and long-term building of the armed forces, and related to social
stability and the country's modernization drive as well."
</P>
<P>
Military officers are an important part of the Party's cadre
contingents, and after education and training in this "big school"
of the army, most of them not only have scientific knowledge and
management expertise to a certain degree, they also have "a firm
political belief and the revolutionary spirit of self-devotion and
struggle despite hardships," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Since the New China was founded in 1949, 3.2 million officers
have returned to civilian life, and made contributions to the
state with those advantages, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the army to train more talents who could also be
used outside the army. In addition to receiving a political
education and military science, army officers must also be taught
economics, culture and modern science and hi-tech, he
urged.

<HEADLINE> HK Construction Value Up in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The gross value of the
construction work in nominal terms amounted to 99.8 billion HK
dollars (12.9 billion US dollars) in 1995, representing an
increase of 11.9 percent over 1994, according to the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the department said that the increase was
mainly attributable to the intensified work on major
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the gross value of construction work performed at
public sector sites rose substantially by 39.4 percent in nominal
terms and 31.1 percent at constant (1990) market prices.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the gross value of construction work performed at
 private sector sites decreased by 1.5 percent in nominal terms
and 8.1 percent at constant market prices.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by end-use, transport projects, which covered airport
construction projects, accounted for the largest portion of the
gross value of construction work performed at construction
sites. The gross value of construction work performed in these
projects rose substantially by 33.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Residential building projects are the second largest category
of construction work and its gross value rose slightly by 1.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
Commercial building projects continued to constitute the third
largest category of construction work, but its gross value fell
by 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the fourth quarter of 1995 with the fourth quarter of
 1994, the gross value of construction work, in nominal terms,
increased by 12.5 percent. The corresponding increase measured at
constant market prices was 10.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Old Industrial Base Accelerates Industrial Transformation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coastal province developed into a leading heavy industrial,
metallurgical, machine-building and mining center in the 1950s.
So far the number of large and medium-sized firms in Liaoning has
grown to 1,400, accounting for one tenth of the national total.
</P>
<P>
However, 20 percent of its sizable industrial firms have found
themselves in a woeful predicament because of obsolete equipment
and old technology.
</P>
<P>
The governor, who is also an experienced manager of industrial
firms, attributed their difficulties to the long-term practice of
a planned economy, and pledged the government would bear the
responsibility of invigorating the majority of state-owned firms
by supporting firms with great potential.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-year program unveiled recently, Liaoning will give
top priority to the development of metallurgical and
petro-chemical industries, machine-building and electronic
information.
</P>
<P>
Its investment in industrial transformation in the next five
years will rise to 151 billion yuan, two-thirds of which will go
to the above-mentioned four pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged large and medium-sized state-owned firms to build a
modern enterprise system, accelerate the pace of mergers and
bankruptcies, and promote the reform of the social security scheme.
</P>
<P>
Official Statistics showed 36 enterprises applied for
bankruptcy in Liaoning last year, and the number is expected to be
even higher this year.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old governor feels quite confident in Liaoning's
future development as it commands a rich reserve of oil, gas and
marine resources, has a large contingent of skilled workers and
technicians, and is well-equipped with telecommunication and
transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, he stressed, one-third of the Japan's
investment in China, and 22 percent of the investment from the
Republic of Korea, had come to Liaoning, demonstrating the
attractiveness of this industrial base.
</P>
<P>
But Wen admitted there is a long road ahead for the industrial
transformation in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
"We will lay a solid foundation in the first five years and try
to yield remarkable results in the following five years," the
governor concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China is to increase its
cooperation with foreign countries and regions in a bid to spur
the country's agricultural development, Chinese vice premier Jiang
Chunyun said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome overseas businesses to participate in agricultural
construction through investment and other forms of cooperation,"
Jiang said at an international seminar which opened in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
"China will give top priority to agriculture, a pillar
infrastructure industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our countryside, with its 860 million residents, is a huge
potential market, and investment and trade in this field has a
promising future," added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China's agriculture benefited from
5.88 billion US dollars in overseas funds, up 156 percent from the
previous five-year period. It included 3.13 billion US dollars in
direct overseas investments, and advanced technology and improved
seeds and livestock.
</P>
<P>
"There is a large room and a good opportunity to develop
agriculture," Jiang said,"because two-thirds of China's farmland
is not very productive, and China has many uncultivated mountain
areas, as well as bodies of waters and beaches which can be tapped.
</P>
<P>
"The 1.2-billion population and industries are growing at a
high speed and have created a wide space for the expansion of
agriculture," the vice premier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic development in the countryside and rural economy
have also laid a solid foundation for fulfilling future
development targets."
</P>
<P>
China has also made efforts to apply science and technology in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that by the end of the century, science and
technology will account for more than 50 percent increase in
agricultural output. Currently output is increasing by 35 per
cent.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Overseas Investment in Agriculture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the next five years, China plans to steadily increase the
output of grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops. Annual grain output
will be pushed to between 490 and 500 million tons, maintaining a
relatively rapid growth in farmers' income to enable them to live
a comfortable life, and providing adequate food and clothing for
the 65 million poverty-stricken people in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"All are very tough tasks," Jiang said, adding that "given that
the population is growing, farmland and water resources are
decreasing. We have to reasonably develop and efficiently use and
protect resources to ensure a sustainable growth in agriculture."
</P>
<P>
The returns on agricultural investment are high and stable, and
the Chinese government will "support and help" overseas businesses
to invest in agricultural projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiang, Chinese minister of Agriculture, said that during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China will channel
overseas investment into processing farm and sideline produce,
raising output in low-quality farmlands, improving agricultural
infrastructure, establishing commodity grain bases, and releasing
poverty-stricken regions.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar is jointly organized by the Ministry of
Agriculture, the State Planning Commission, the State Commission
for Restructuring the Economy, and the Infocus, a Hong Kong-based
company specialising in organizing international conferences.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred officials from local government and more than
100 agro-business people from eight countries and regions,
including the United States, Japan, Denmark, Germany, and Hong
Kong are attending the seminar to discuss the challenges facing
China's agriculture, and to probe opportunities to invest in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Official Expelled From Party for Taking Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in south
China's Guangdong Province has been expelled from the Communist
Party of China (CPC) for taking bribes. He will face a criminal
trial.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang De, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, is alleged to have
accepted more than 100,000 yuan in bribes from a swindler between
the end of 1993 and early 1994, when he also served as secretary
of the municipal CPC committee in Dongguan city.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang De was deprived of the party membership by the
Disciplinary Inspection Committee of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In March 1993, a construction contractor built a private
building for Ouyang De in his hometown. In return, Ouyang De
helped the contractor win a waterworks project involving an
investment of more than ten million yuan. After the building was
completed, Ouyang De told a manager in Dongguan to do the
decoration work. In the course of building the houses, Ouyang De
accepted more than 400,000 yuan worth of construction and
decoration costs.
</P>
<P>
The standing committee of the people's congress of Dongguan
City decided to remove Ouyang De from the municipal and provincial
people's congresses in January 1996. He will also be tried for
criminal offences.

<HEADLINE> Old Industrial Base Accelerates Industrial Transformation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, one of
China's leading heavy industrial bases, is planning to sell shares
in a showpiece expressway to overseas investors, the provincial
governor said here today.
</P>
<P>
The billions of yuan raised will help provide income to drive
the province into the next century, Wen Shizhen, governor of the
province, said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning wants to offer for sale part of the stocks of the
country's first expressway to overseas investors to raise funds
for technical transformation of existing state-owned firms, he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The 375-km-long expressway between Shenyang and Dalian in
Liaoning has been valued at upwards of 6.6 billion yuan for the
growing important role it had played in the economic development
of Liaoning, and in the entire northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The roadway opened to traffic in 1990 at a cost of 2.2 billion
yuan. The current estimated value has been made by China
International Projects Consultants Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The governor revealed that a number of prestigious companies
from other countries and regions have shown a great interest in
the impending sale which will need the final approval from the
central government.
</P>
<P>
"This was part of Liaoning's efforts to use overseas investment
in optimizing its industrial structures and upgrading technology
of existing state-owned industrial firms", said Wen in his office.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning plans to sell shares of a dozen of large and
medium-sized state-owned projects in the near future, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
It will also absorb at least two billion US dollars-worth of
overseas funds to revamp 100 designated large and medium-sized
state-owned businesses in the form of joint ventures in each of
the next three years, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
The governor likened China's modernization drive as a race, in
which Liaoning, like a middle-aged man, is pitched against some
young fellows - a reference to economically developed provinces in
southern China.
</P>
<P>
"Only if the province redoubles its efforts, can it show great
vigor in a market-oriented economy," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al
Hariri has disclosed that each of the French and American
proposals have positive aspects, though certain amendments need to
be introduced. He has asserted that Lebanon is open to any
suggestion that may lead to the cherished solution.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) quoted Hariri as having said
in Damascus last evening that his consultations with Syrian
officials had covered all matters and issues of mutual concern as
well as the proposals put forth to end the Israeli aggression and
to restore the peace process to its course in line with the Madrid
principles.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized Lebanon's adherence to its full rights in
conformity with U.N. Security Council resolution 425, adding that
the Israeli aggression had reinforced Lebanon's determination and
nationalist will to proceed with its development and
reconstruction process, underlining that the aggression had
revealed the extent of Israel's hostility to Lebanon's economic
and cultural role.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the solution will only be a political
one, and that the Israeli aggression, no matter how brutal and
extensive it may be, will not impose a solution. He said that the
resistance was a consequence of the aggression, not the cause of
what is taking place and what has already taken place.
</P>
<P>
He said the massacres committed by the Israeli army against
Lebanese citizens had revealed beyond any doubt the false Israeli
allegations in justifying its incessant aggression against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Prime Minister left Damascus at an early hour
today after a brief visit to Syria.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that
Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF's) F-5E jet fighters have been
all grounded after the crash of one such aircraft Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar told the press at
the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang near here after his
12-day overseas trip that his ministry took the decision because
it did not want to take any risks.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said: "Since we do not know how the accident
happened, I feel it is best that we take the aircraft out of
service until the investigation is completed."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one F-5E jet fighter crashed in Kuantan's RMAF
base after the plane caught fire at the end of the runway. The
pilot escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The crash is the first involving an F-5E this year and the
fifth since the aircraft, manufactured by Northrop Corporation of
the United States, went into service with the RMAF in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the F-5Es would be phased out, Syed Hamid said they
were still reliable, especially for training pilots, adding the
experience of other countries showed that F-5Es would remain
airworthy if they were properly upgraded and refurbished.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Recovers Thanks to Doctor and Adoring Female Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Maomao, the Giant Panda that
dropped in for a 'teddy bear's picnic' at a Chinese village is
making a good recovery from an illness that cut short his stay
with local families.
</P>
<P>
And amorous advances of a younger female panda seem to have
been just the tonic that Maomao needed to put him on the road to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Maomao made his mark in a big way last month when he wondered
off the street into farmer Yu Yingming's home and stayed for
dinner. Yu's wife prepared a meal for the cuddly panda. He then
made his way to the kitchen and helped himself to dessert - a tin
of pure honey.
</P>
<P>
Maomao stayed with the farmer for several days at his home in
Shaanxi's Jiuchi village. But villagers became worried when the
friendly bear became ill.
</P>
<P>
The whole village turned out when Maomao was taken for
emergency treatment at the Shaanxi Provincial Precious Animal
Rescue and Breeding Center.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival, he has been taken good care by a special
group which was set up specially to look after Maomao.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Zhouzhi County Center, Li Baoliang, heads
the group.
</P>
<P>
Li and his four colleagues gave Maomao a thorough checkup,
measuring his temperature and blood pressure and carrying out
routine checks.
</P>
<P>
Maomao had suffered from diarrhea and did not want to eat
after his arrival. So he was put under special care around the
clock, and given glucose several times a day by drip feed.
</P>
<P>
What surprised the doctors and nurses was that unlike most
giant pandas, Maomao did not need sedating before treatment began.
</P>
<P>
While being drop fed, Maomao quietly watched the bottle and
nurses from time to time, causing no trouble at all.
</P>
<P>
After four days Maomao's stomach had recovered and he and was
in high spirits again.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Maomao and a five-year-old female giant panda,
Pingping have become good friends. They often hug and tumble with
each other and turn somersaults.
</P>
<P>
Maomao credits his doctor, Ma Qingyi as his "lifesaver."
</P>
<P>
At the sight of Dr Ma he stands up cheerfully and clasp his
hands to welcome him. Sometimes he snatches an apple from Ma's
hand to wolf it down.
</P>
<P>
Maomao was also given pills to get rid of roundworms. As a
result, he now has a good appetite. For example, on one day this
week he cheerfully tucked into a kilogram of rice, 2.5 kg of
apples and five kg of arrow bamboo shoots.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Admits Rivalry Fierce in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani admitted here today that the two major factions were in
a "fierce" rivalry in the Parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote for candidates of the Fifth Parliament
in the run-off elections, Rafsanjani told mass media "the
competition was serious."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the second round of the elections, the
62-year-old president and his government have come under attack
for corruption, inflation, for being anti-clerical and being soft
on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had even joined in
criticism waged by hardliners against Rafsanjani. Khamenei had
indirectly attacked the moderate president for corruption twice
within a month.
</P>
<P>
Despite the coldness of the citizens in today's voting, the
Iranian president urged the people to turn out in the election.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the legal, rational and logical duty of
every electorate to cast ballot in this elections.
</P>
<P>
"Abstention will do no good and will only be a sign of
indifference towards the fate of the country," Rafsanjani noted.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that today's turn out rate of the
eligible voters was quite low, about one third less than the
first round of the elections slated for March 8.
</P>
<P>
The polls for the run-off elections opened at 8:00 am this
morning and will remain open for 10 hours. The period will be
extended by the Interior Ministry if necessary.
</P>
<P>
In the political arena of Tehran, the two main factions -- the
Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) backed by Iran's Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei and Group-6 supported by President Rafsanjani -- are
fighting very hard for the majority of the 270-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the polls opened here this morning Ali Khamenei
cast his vote and called on electorates to "select those who are
truly committed to God and Islam."
</P>
<P>
He said that electorates should have no other consideration
other than pleasing the God Almighty. "This is of vital
importance," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The run-off elections are being held in 75 constituencies to
determine the fate of 123 seats in the 270-seat parliament. 246
candidates throughout the country are contending for the seats.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran constituency electorates are voting for 28 candidates
from among the 56 hopefuls today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Khorramian, political expert from the Foreign
Ministry, told Xinhua that he cast his vote for 28 candidates
proposed by the Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) headed by
hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
He said that he only voted for those who stick to late leader
Khomeini's line, follow Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and loyal to
Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Although I work in government department, I only vote for
SCC's candidates because I believe in them. I do not believe in
Liberals and moderates," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Torabian from the National Iranian Oil Company told
Xinhua that he had cast his vote for liberal candidates
proposed by the Group-6 supported by President Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
He said "members of the Parliament should be educated, have
expertise and committed to Islam. I would not vote for those who
are just good at empty talks and shouting political slogans."
</P>
<P>
Today is day-off in the Islamic Republic. Some people
preferred to climb mountain and go out rather than go to the
election centers, saying they have no interest in politics.
</P>
<P>
In the elections of March 8 only two candidates from Tehran,
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and Rafsanjani's
daughter Faezeh Hashemi secured the adequate number of votes to be
elected to the Parliament. The remaining seats will be decided
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the election law in the initial stage of the
elections each contending candidate should obtain at least one
third of the votes cast in each constituency.
</P>
<P>
However, in the run-off elections any candidate who obtains
the relative majority will be elected.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that two major conservative factions
backed by Khamenei were expected to capture the majority of the
270 seats in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The two groups, Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) and
Association for the Defense of the Values of the Islamic
Revolution (ADVIR), are competing against the liberal modernist
faction known as Group-6 supported by Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that this is the most important
parliamentary elections since the death of the architect of the
Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentary elections are important because whatever
group wins in these elections, it will have a better chance in the
presidential elections of 1997," a political science professor at
Tehran University told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, Rafsanjani cannot run for a third
consecutive term in 1997. His nemesis, Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, is said to be SCC's candidate for the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted the present domestic policy and
foreign policy would still remain unchanged despite what kind of
election results come out in the Islamic Republic.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Shocked by Israeli Shelling of Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he was shocked by the tragedy in southern Lebanon
caused by Israeli shelling on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that his Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
would shortly fly to the Middle East to talk with local leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president issued a statement urging Israel to
immediately stop its military operations against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked by the report about a new tragedy in Lebanon:
the shelling by the Israeli army of the base of the United Nations
forces, as a result of which dozens of civilians, who were seeking
shelter there, were killed. There are also casualties among the
U.N. peacekeeping contingent," Yeltsin said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that from the very beginning of hostilities, "the
development in Lebanon was completely unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"An end should be put to the massive violations of the
sovereignty of Lebanon or else the violations will lead to a real
humanitarian catastrophe in that country.
</P>
<P>
"It is also necessary to ensure the cessation of the shelling
of northern Israel," added Yeltsin, who warned that the current
peace process in the Middle East would otherwise be undermined.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that Russia, as a cosponsor of the peace
process, cannot help but be concerned about the situation in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is scheduled to leave on Saturday for urgent meetings
with the leaders of Syria, Lebanon and Israel to appeal for a
cease-fire and help put an end to the crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (xinhua) -- A senior Chinese foreign trade
official expressed his hope here today that the Republic of Korea
(ROK) should open its market wider to Chinese commodities so as
to narrow the country's trade deficit with the ROK.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade volume between the two countries amounted
to 16.98 billion US dollars-worth last year, while China had a
deficit totalling 3.6 billion dollars.

Hu Guocai, director of the Asian Affairs Department of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, told a
bilateral trade seminar that China has always been seeking for
methods to solve such imbalanced trade problems, by expanding the
total bilateral trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Hu also encouraged ROK investors to become fully involved in
the country's infrastructure construction and the technological
transformation of state businesses in accordance with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have started bilateral talks on possible
co-operation in the posts and telecommunications industry, and
automobile and aircraft manufacturing, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year the ROK became China's
fourth-largest trading partner, with the total bilateral trade
increasing by 26.5 percent to 3.9 billion US dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, by the end of last year China had utilized 2.3
billion US dollars in ROK investment.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that it
sent its first relief aid consignment to Lebanon Friday following
Israeli attacks on Lebanon.

endure difficulties so that they will be blessed with the victory
and dignity.

LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind today called for an immediate ceasefire to the armed
clashes between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview this morning, Rifkind said,
"We have to put maximum pressure on all sides to end violence."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the British government will be
"even-handed, calling for an immediate cessation of violence by
both sides."
</P>
<P>
"Because you do not get permanent peace by the Israelis ceasing
their attacks but by Hezbollah continuing to rain rockets upon
Israeli civilian areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said that Israeli shelling attacks, which killed 101
Lebanese refugees, were "disproportionate" and a "tragic mistake"
which the Israelis "bitterly regretted."
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said that he gave a late night phone call
to his Israeli counterpart Ehud Barak on Thursday, urging him to
agree to an urgent ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He added he was pleased to learn that Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres has indicated that Israel was prepared to have a
truce.

<HEADLINE> Police Officer Punished for Dereliction of Duty, Forging Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking police
officer in Tangshan City of North China's Hebei Province was
sentenced to eight years imprisonment for dereliction of duty and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
A court was told that the officer had failed to prevent an
armed attack which he had eye-witnessed, and had forged evidence
in an attempt to avoid trouble. The forged evidence claimed that
he was "not on the spot" of the incident.
</P>
<P>
On November 27 last year, Han Jizong, deputy head of Guye
Sub-bureau under Tangshan Public Security Bureau, went to a
restaurant for lunch with self-employed businessman Liu Jianhua.
</P>
<P>
At the restaurant Liu had a quarrel with a villager, and left
lunch table. He then carried a hunting gun back to the restaurant,
fired three shots at the villager's legs, and then fled the scene
in a car.
</P>
<P>
The crime was carried out in front of Han, who was in police
uniform at the time and was in charge of criminal cases. But he
did nothing to stop the armed attack.
</P>
<P>
Han also got others to forge false evidence that he was "not on
the spot at that time," in order to evade responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Han was arrested on February 16 this year. As he was also found
guilty of abusing power for personal profit in another case, he
was sentenced by a local court to eight years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Premier Expects Cease-fire in Few Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said here today that he hopes a cease-fire can be achieved
in four or five days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Hariri has proposed to make
necessary contacts with the Hezbollah, but stressed that a
ceasefire will take "some time" so that the Hezbollah could make
contacts with its various fighting groups.
</P>
<P>
Hariri returned here midnight Thursday from London via
Damascus, after a tour abroad seeking support to put to an end to
the Israeli raids.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the Lebanese government and army could not
disarm Hezbollah so long as Israel still occupies "part of our
lands."
</P>
<P>
"To disarm Hezbollah would mean we are helping the Israeli
occupation. We would never do so," he told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
A settlement of the conflict lies in the Israeli understanding
that it could not guarantee a security of its border through its
occupation of Lebanese lands, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres' claim that
the Israeli occupation was aimed at self-defense, Hariri said,
instead of self-defense, Israel was only protecting its occupation
of Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
The evidence was that the Israeli occupation forces fired
artilleries at Lebanon from the occupied Lebanese lands, rather
than inside the Israeli territory, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,000-square kilometer-long "security
zone" in south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent cross-border attack
against northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Today is the nineth day of Israeli air raids and bombardment
against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Some 110 Lebanese civilians were killed and more than 115
others wounded in the Israeli bombardment of an U.N. peacekeeping
military camp in Kana, southern Lebanon Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 Lebanese civilians were seeking sanctuary in the
camp during the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
It was the bloodest Israeli attack against Lebanese civilians
since the Jewish state was established in 1948.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The gross value of the
construction work in nominal terms amounted to 99.8 billion HK

increase of 11.9 percent over 1994, according to the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>

He said that the gross value of construction work performed at
public sector sites rose substantially by 39.4 percent in nominal
terms and 31.1 percent at constant (1990) market prices.

private sector sites decreased by 1.5 percent in nominal terms and
8.1 percent at constant market prices.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by end-use, transport projects, which covered airport
construction projects, accounted for the largest portion of the
gross value of construction work performed at construction sites.
The gross value of construction work performed in these projects
rose substantially by 33.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Residential building projects are the second largest category
of construction site work and its gross value rose slightly by 1.0
percent.

<P>
Commercial building projects continued to constitute the third
largest category of construction site work, but its gross value
fell by 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK Unemployment Rate Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate for the period from December 1995 to February
1996 was 3.1 percent, according to the latest labor force
statistics released today by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The provisional seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the
period from January to March 1996 was marginally higher, at 3.2
percent while the provisional underemployment rate continued to
edge lower to 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that during the period from
December 1995 to February 1996, the number of unemployed persons
with previous jobs was estimated at 86,100, while another 6,700
unemployed persons were first-time job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of underemployed persons was estimated
at 69,400.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent labor market situation in Hong Kong, a
government spokesman said that the growth in both total labor
supply and total employment accelerated to 5.3 percent and 4.6
percent respectively in the three months ending February 1996 over
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
He said that the increase in total labor supply was the fastest
ever recorded since the General Household Survey was first
launched in August 1981, while the increase in total employment
was among the fastest ever recorded from that survey.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, as employment was still not catching up with the
corresponding labor supply, the unemployment rate thus remained
high.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin gave an
interview today to the Russian newspaper "Segodnia", answering
questions about Sino-Russian relations, the Taiwan issue, the
current international situation, and other topics.
</P>
<P>
"President Boris Yeltsin and I are quite familiar with each
other and have met three times," Jiang told the interviewer,
Leonid Velekhov, at the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
"Next week President Yeltsin will pay his second official visit
to China and the third Sino-Russian summit will be held," Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
There are encouraging developments in long-term, stable ties
that are neighborly and mutually-beneficial between China and
Russia. These are inseparable from the close and frequent contacts
between the leaders, Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the contact maintained by the leaders has a
profound historic significance in promoting understanding between
the two countries and two peoples, deepening mutual trust, and
building and developing a constructive partnership for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during President Yeltsin's stay in China, the
two sides will sign political documents and a series of agreements
on bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"What should be mentioned is that President Yeltsin and I, and
the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan will
sign an accord in Shanghai on increasing trust in military affairs
in border areas," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first such political-military document in the
Asian-Pacific region, he said. As an exploratory, pioneering
venture, it will have a wide-spread and profound influence, not
only for establishing a lasting peace in border areas of the five
countries, but also in increasing mutual-trust and developing
neighborly relations among Asian-Pacific countries, he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed the hope that the Russian newspaper will
convey his good wishes to the Russian people.

JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli planes resumed air
raids against Hezbollah targets in the area of Tyre, south
Lebanon, and navy boats bombarded roads along the coast, reported

Israeli-occupied "security zone" to leave their homes, otherwise
they would risk their lives during Israeli attacks.

<P>
The announcement was broadcast through Voice of the South
Lebanon Radio run by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army. It said

Israel has apologized to UNIFIL for the bombardments Thursday
saying that it was the result of a human error. More than 100
Lebanese refugees and U.N. personnel were killed in the raids.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Rush to Invest in China During First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Contracted direct overseas
investment surged by 86.8 percent during the first quarter of this
year over the same period last year to 27.43 billion US dollars,
said a spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main reason for the dramatic rise in foreign
investment is that foreign businessmen rushed to establish joint
ventures in China before April 1, the day when all foreign-funded
enterprises ceased to enjoy the free import tariff policy.
</P>
<P>
It is ruled that foreign-funded enterprises established before
that day may continue to import tariff-free for one or two years
depending on the size of their investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that 7.66 billion US dollars were actually invested in
China during the first quarter of the year. This represents a rise
of 17 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 16.5 percent more foreign-funded projects were approved
during the first quarter of the year, and these projects were
larger in scale than the previous ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
The average new project involved 3.22 million US dollars in
foreign funds during the first quarter, compared with 1.21 million
US dollars in the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Nepalese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li Ruihuan said
here today that every minority ethnic group, including the Tibetan
people, is an inalienable member of the large family of China.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee (CPPCC), made this remark during his
meeting with visiting Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deupa.
</P>
<P>
China has established autonomous regions for certain minority
ethnic groups in the place where the majority of them live, such
as the Tibet Autonomous Region, he said. However, he added, some
ethnic groups are scattered across the country, and the Tibetan
people are distributed over the provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai,
Gansu and Yunnan, apart from Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people from other ethnic groups besides the dominant
ones also live in the autonomous regions, he added.
</P>
<P>
So, the concentration of an ethic group in a region cannot be
taken as a reason for splittism, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of Nepal's support for China concerning the
Tibet issue, and expressed his thanks for Deupa's recent statement
that Nepal totally accepts and supports the principle that Tibet
is part of China, and for the prime minister's banning of
anti-China activities in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Deupa recalled that Li's 1993 Nepal visit was deeply
impressive, and the frequent exchange of visits by senior leaders
of the two countries will help deepen understanding and enhance
the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that his current visit would, too, cement
the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China's assistance to Nepal over many years has played an
important role in furthering Nepal's economic growth and
increasing the living standards of the Nepalese people, he said.

electronics, foodstuffs and high-tech industry," an official of
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Co-operation and Trade said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Yongkang, deputy general manager of the China

<P>
TUNIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Libyan airliners and other charted
planes continued today to fly pilgrims to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the
official Libyan news agency JANA reported.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a Libyan plane flew 115 Moslem pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia in defiance of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has said that Libya's move was
"totally unacceptable", but it did not call for any measures
against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council demanded Tripoli to refrain from
committing similar violations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed travel sanctions on Libya in 1992 after Libya
refused to hand over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
flight over Lockerbie, Scotland. The explosion killed 270 people.

MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today joined other world leaders to denounce Israel's
nine-day attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said in a special announcement that Israel can find

<HEADLINE> China Builds Advanced Grain Storage Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to link 1,000
state granaries via a computer network this year, said a senior
Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
"The move is to improve grain storage and transport," said Luo
Zhiling, vice-minister of the Ministry of Internal Trade and
director-general of the State Grain Reserve Administration.
</P>
<P>
The first 200 state granaries in China were linked via a
computer network in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The central government has plans to construct a group of large
mechanized storage bins, and local governments and state-owned
grain enterprises will raise funds in various methods to upgrade
grain storages too, Luo told an international seminar on China's
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
"Our government is using loans to build an advanced grain
storage and transport network in northeast China, Beijing Tianjin,
the Yangtze Valley, and southwest China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Better technology is being applied to the storage of grain and
extending bulk transport to raise transport efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Over the past dozen years China has constructed more than
60,000 storage bins for grain reserves with a total capacity of
about 160 million tons and special railway lines totalling about
1,000 km.
</P>
<P>
China has installed grain conveyors and other
equipment. Electronic devices have also been widely applied to
ventilate and lower the temperature of granaries.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these efforts only one to two percent of grain
is now lost during the storage and transportation process,
according to statistics released by the State Grain Reserve
Administration.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the United Nations in the 1980s showed that
the percentage of loss in the storage and transportation process
in about 50 countries were between five and ten percent.
</P>
<P>
China has also drawn up a series of regulations to help
standardized grain storage and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Up 15.9 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
increased by 15.9 percent in March at current prices, with non-oil
domestic exports and re-exports expanding by 12.7 percent and 14
percent respectively, the Government Trade Development Board (TDB)
said today.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil rose by 22.5 percent in the month, it
said. The TDB added that on a monthly basis, non-oil domestic
exports and re-exports grew by 9 percent and 10.3 percent
respectively in March.
</P>
<P>
It said that the 12.7 percent growth in non-oil domestic
exports to about 5.6 billion US dollars in March was due mainly to
the strong double digit increase in exports of electronic and
related products to the US and Japanese markets.
</P>
<P>
Exports of electronic and related products to the US market
rose by 21.8 percent, while that to the Japanese market grew by
33.3 percent. The European Union (EU) market, however, registered
a more moderate growth of 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The TDB noted that Singapore's exports to the other two
traditionally major markets remained weak. Non-oil domestic
exports to Malaysia rose by a marginal 1.9 percent, while the Hong
Kong market shrank by 1.6 percent to about 404.3 million US
dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil increased by 22.5 percent in March to
about 1.1 billion US dollars, due mainly to increased shipment of
oil to Hong Kong for subsequent re-export to China, it said.
</P>
<P>
Imports increased by 17.7 percent to about 11.8 billion US
dollars in March, the TDB said. It said the growth was largely in
computer parts and peripherals, disk drives, blank computer tapes
and discs, integrated circuits, other semi-conductor devices, and
food and chemical products.

<HEADLINE> First Tumen Zone Intergovernmental Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Five Northeast Asian countries
made a decision here today to establish the Tumen Trust Fund in
order to guarantee the financing of the Tumen River Zone
intergovernmental co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which ended today, was attended by
delegates from five countries -- the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), Mongolia, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Russia and
China -- and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
Officials from Japan, Australia and Finland attended the meeting
as observers.
</P>
<P>
The five countries agreed that the intergovernmental
secretariat should be located in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Tumen River Economic Development Program aims to foster the
development of a broad trade bloc comprising northeast China, the
Far Eastern region of Russia, the DPRK, the ROK, Mongolia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The area is rich in natural and labor resources, with 300
million people and almost one third of the world's trade.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP agreed to support and coordinate the Tumen River
Development Program in 1991.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study completed recently shows that the Tumen
River Zone will become a hub of communications, trade and finance,
and an economic center as well as a new investment hot spot in
Northeast Asia through joint co-operation by the member countries
of the program.
</P>
<P>
With support from the governments of China, Russia and the
DPRK, construction of infrastructure, such as railways and
harbors, is well underway.
</P>
<P>
The Tumen River Zone, covering parts of China, Russia and the
DPRK, was once closed to the outside world, but has been opened
for trade and investment from other parts of the world since the
Tumen River Development Program was launched in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Population Growth Reported in Quake-stricken City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The population of Tangshan
City, about 150 km east of Beijing, has increased by 200,000
people, recovering from the devastating earthquake that hit the
city in July 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>
The quake killed 240,000 of the city's 1.38 million people and
seriously injured 160,000, 3,000 of them disabled. More than 4,200
children were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the city had 1.58 million residents,
most of them in the Central, East Mining, and New districts.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the quake, the death toll in the most
densely-populated district, Lunan, reached 45 percent, twice the
city's average death rate. Knowing that densely-populated
districts would face greater dangers in the case of an earthquake,
the city government moved residents to the three large districts.
</P>
<P>
Located in the former downtown area, the Central district has a
population of 700,000 and is the city's political, cultural, and
commercial center.
</P>
<P>
East Mining Area was built around the five mines of Kailuan,
and has a population of 400,000.
</P>
<P>
New District was built on the north side of the city, where
almost all the city's large firms are situated.
</P>
<P>
The three districts are about 25 km from each other, connected
by roads and railways, providing convenient access to
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Along with the natural growth, migrations of people from other
provinces and cities have been another reason for the city's
population growth. These amount to more than 100,000, many having
come to help rebuild the city after the quake, and staying after
construction work was finished.

<HEADLINE> Shahak Blames Hezbollah for Deaths of Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army Chief of Staff
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak last night blamed Hezbollah for drawing
Israeli army fire on civilians, following an Israeli artillery
barrage Thursday caused 75 people dead and about 60 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred around 2:00 p.m. (11:00 GMT) in Kana in
southern Lebanon when Israeli gunners tried to hit a Hezbollah
Katyusha rocket and mortar launching pad set up near a compound of
U.N. peace keeping forces, and missed by some 350 meters.
</P>
<P>
Shahak expressed no apologizes for the Israeli army shelling,
saying there had been no mistake in judgment and that the
shelling came in self-defense after mortar and Katyushas were
fire at Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
"When they fire on us from any place and it endangers us, we
will return fire at those who endanger us," today's Jerusalem Post
quoted the army chief as say, "I don't know any other rules."
</P>
<P>
He said that 15 minutes before the shelling, Hezbollah had
fired a Katyusha from a position about 350 meters from the U.N.
position with its civilian refugees were identical to Israeli army
data.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever remains in a spot from which we were fired upon needs
to know that he is doing so at great risk," said Shahak, adding
that the Israeli army notified U.N. personnel it intended to
return fire.
</P>
<P>
He said the blow was "so deadly and difficult and regretful,"
because more than 150 people had congregated in two structures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he offered to allow any of the wounded into Israel
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Following the shelling, Northern Command of the Israeli army
put all of its forces on high alert and warned the residents of
the North to remain in shelters, presuming Hezbollah would
retaliate at all cost.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report this morning, eight
Katyusha rockets were fired at the northern Israeli towns and
villages over last night, no one was injured, while several
damages were caused by the attacks.
</P>
<P>
At this point, the report did not mention whether the Israeli
troops returned fire at Hezbollah targets following the Katyusha
rockets attacks, as they have been doing for the last eight days
since the Operation Grapes of Wrath began a week ago.

Financial Times:

<HEADLINE> Transnationals Adopt Long-Term Commitment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 transnational firms
are making greater efforts to increase their share of China's
lucrative market, today's Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily quotes Zhang Shangtang, vice-chairman of the China
Association of Foreign-Funded Enterprises, as saying that these
enterprises have drawn up long-term investment strategies for the country
instead of pursuing short-sighted profits and returns.
</P>
<P>
In spite of impact from China's macro-economic control, these
enterprises withdraw few investments, and even pour most of the
profits earned here into business expansion.
</P>
<P>
With their cautious decision making, the enterprises are
conducting diversified business in China in different areas, which
are linked to their regional or global production, sales and
service networks.
</P>
<P>
In order to occupy markets in China and its neighboring
countries, the transnationals set up large-sized production bases
in the country, utilizing locally-available raw materials.

MANILA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Merrill Lynch, an international
research firm, today expressed optimism about the Philippines'
economic growth in the coming years thanks to expanding exports
and investments.
</P>
<P>
The firm praised the country's strong economic performance last

Service, a New York-based credit rating agency.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the Philippines is increasingly optimistic,
but challenges remain," said Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1995, it looked as though the Philippines' economy
might overheat due to an "expansionary policy mix," said the
research firm.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, monetary policy was later tightened once again and
fiscal policy has remained neutral, it said.

<HEADLINE> More Then 100 Killed in Israeli Bombardment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 Lebanese civilians were
killed, and 115 others were wounded in the Israeli bombardment of
an U.N. peacekeeping force military camp in Kana, southern
Lebanon, confirmed a Red Cross official here today.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Israeli warships fired artillery at a
military camp of the multi-national peacekeeping force's Fiji
contigent where some 1,500 Lebanese civilians from the town of
Kana and nearby villages were seeking sanctuary, said
an eyewitness. The civilians were forced to leave their homes due
to the Israeli raids in the past eight days.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitness said the Israeli warplanes also fired
air-to-surface rockets at the military camp. This was the bloodest
attack against Lebanese civilians by Israel since the Jewish state
was established in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Timor Goksel, the spokesman of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL), today condemned the Israeli attack, saying "it
was a completely massacre." He added that the peacekeeping force
had not received any warning from Israel before the
attack. Reports said some 15 Fijian soldiers were also wounded in
the bombardment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israeli warplanes also raided the
southern Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh Fauga Thursday morning,
destroying a three-Story building and killing 11 civilians,
including a four-day-old baby. Ten others were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon announced today a "day of national mourning" to grieve
for the Lebanese civilians killed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said today that Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri, in a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher Thursday, has promised to make necessary
contact with the Hezbollah, or Party of God, to ensure a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad Thursday,
Hariri urged the United States and France to work out a joint
proposal to ease the escalating situation in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Five Boxers Qualify for US Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Five boxers gained the
qualifications Thursday night for the U.S. team to this year's
Olympic Games to be held in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Middleweight Rhoshii Wells, a Georgia native, defeated Air
Force military policeman Ronald Simms 18-14, while lightweight

Washington by 11-6.
</P>
<P>
In the light middleweight division, another Philadelphia
boxer, David Reid, won a 20-5 easy victory over Darrell Wilson
of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
The pair, together with Bantamweight teenager Zahim Raheem,
formed an impressive trio of Philadelphia natives to fight their
way onto the Olympic team. Raheem defeated Steven Carter 16-4.
</P>
<P>
The final bout of the night was in the heavyweight
division. Chicago's Nate Jones won the first place by knocking
Davarryl Williamson of Washington 19-10.
</P>
<P>
The Box-off formula on Thursday night featuring 12 three-round
bouts spread over two nights. If the top-ranked fighter wins, he

wins, the two meet in a box-off Saturday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Becomes Third Largest Cashew Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam has become the third largest
cashew producer in the world, next only to India and Brazil, with
100,000 tonnes exported last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Vietnam's cashews reaped a total turnover of 100
million U.S. dollars and provided jobs for 15,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese cahsews currently occupy five to 10 percent of the
American market which consumes two-thirds of all cashews grown in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The American company Donafood in southern Vietnam plans to
triple its exports to the U.S. market next year, totalling 50
percent of its planned production.
</P>
<P>
However, the English language daily "Vietnam News " said,
problems remain to temper such optimism.
</P>
<P>
One imperative problem is how to fulfil the export
contracts. The processing companies cannot operate at full
capacity because of a lack of capital and raw material.
</P>
<P>
Weather vagaries can hurt production. Production this year has
decreased remarkably because of the cold and destructive insects.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also suffer losses through intermediaries as they can't
sell their product directly to prcessing companies.
</P>
<P>
Growers claim a proper policy with incentives is needed to tap
Vietnam's current strong potential on the international
market.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has ordered the postponement of local government
elections till end December this year under her powers in the
country's state of emergency, political sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The elections to the country's 300 Municipal Councils, Urban
Councils and Village Councils had been originally postponed to
June this year from June last year.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered the extension of the state of emergency
to the whole island on April 4.
</P>
<P>
The country's main opposition of the United National Party
(UNP) charged that the emergency order was the government's ruse
to postpone the elections, as most of the local government
positions are controlled by the UNP.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that it was necessary to have the island
covered by the state of emergency because Tamil rebels have
extended their activities to many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the local government polls would be
the first test for the government's popularity since it came to
power in August 1994, after defeating the UNP in the last
parliament election.

"Sanzijing", a famous Chinese didactic book, into Russian.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more Chinese literary works, mostly related to
Chinese philosophical thinking, have been translated into Russian,
such as the "Doctrine of the Mean", "Book of Mencius" and
"Analects".
</P>
<P>
After the Soviet Union was founded in 1917, Russian translators
made tremendous progress in introducing more Chinese masterpieces
to Russian readers, like the "Book of Odes", China's earliest
collection of poetry, the "True Story of Ah Q" and the "Homeland"
by Lu Xun, the best-known modern Chinese writer.
</P>
<P>
A new wave of translations of Chinese literary works into
Russian came after the founding of the People's Republic of
China. "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "A Dream of Red
Mansions", "A Pilgrimage to the West", "The Scholars" and other
famous works appeared in Russian versions.
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s and 1970s some Chinese ancient and
contemporary works were also translated into Russian, like
"Records of the Historian" by Sima Qian, a famous historian of the
Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), and "Besieged City" by Qian Zhongshu,
a popular modern novelist.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s works by leading modern Chinese novelists, such as
Wang Meng, Liu Xinwu, Feng Jicai and Gu Hua, were made available
in Russian versions.
</P>
<P>
At the moment translation work is proceeding on a 40-volume
comprehensive Chinese literature series.

<HEADLINE> "Water-Saving Irrigation A Must for China" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agriculture experts have
called on all localities to develop water-saving irrigation, which
has been proved to be the most effective way for agricultural
development in a country seriously lacking water, the "Guangming
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
China has been listed by the United Nations as one of the 13
water-short countries. Though the country's annual fresh water
resources total nearly 3.5 trillion cu m, ranking sixth in the
world, its per capita share of water is one fourth of the world's
average.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s an average of 27 million ha of
farmland has been hit by drought every year, which reduced the
country's annual grain output by 12.5 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
Though the national drive to build water-control projects has
expanded the irrigated area from 13 million ha to 47 million ha
over the past few decades, more than half of the country's
farmland can not get adequate supplies of water, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that over 80 percent of China's grain,
90 percent of its cotton and 95 percent of its vegetables are
produced on irrigated land. This constitutes a challenge for
China's goal of harvesting 500 billion kg of grain by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The experts stated that a major problem in irrigation is a huge
waste of water. As 95 percent of the farmland is watered by flood
irrigation, the waste of water is as high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the experts called for more efficient use of water
by popularizing drip or spray irrigation, which are widely used in
Britain, Switzerland, France, Romania and Austria.
</P>
<P>
These methods have also been tried out at some experimental
zones set up by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and
proved successful, the paper said.

Sino-US joint communiques, and perceive and handle Sino-US
bilateral relations from an overall strategic point of view,

back the bilateral relations to a stable and healthy track.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the statement at a meeting with former US Secretary

</P>
<P>
Dr. Kissinger is here attending the international conference on
China's economy and business, co-sponsored by the Development
Research Center under China's State Council and the US magazine
"Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Kissinger on his China trip, Jiang
praised him as one of the pioneers of normalization of the
relations between the two countries in the 1970s. For over a score
of years, Kissinger has been taking a strategic point of view of
Sino-US relations and has devoted himself to the improvement and

<P>
In the current world situation featured by important changes,
Kissinger continues to show his foresight and sagacity, making
active efforts to help maintain and develop the bilateral
relations, Jiang said, adding, "For all this, we highly appreciate
his efforts."
</P>
<P>
"So long as both the Chinese and American sides strictly abide
by the principles set out in the three joint communiques signed
between the two countries, and perceive and handle Sino-US
relations from an overall strategic point of view, looking forward
to the 21st century, Sino-US relations can embark onto a stable
and healthy track," the Chinese president stressed.

<HEADLINE> Export Earning Increases in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a source from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB),
the country's export earning during the period stood at 2.386
billion US dollars, 62.7 percent of the target of 3.8 billion
dollars for the whole fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the increase. But it was reported that
an accelerated rate of growth of ready-made garment exports, which
account for 60 percent of the total value of exports in
Bangladesh, was the main reason for the upsurge in the country's
exports.
</P>
<P>
In his speech recently, the EPB director general Mohammad Akmal
Hossain underlined the importance of ensuring the proper standard
of export goods in order to uphold the image of the country
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The EPB has urged all exporters to strictly follow the long
term export strategy in their effort to achieve the export earning
target.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Bangladesh's target of export earning in the
next fiscal year of 1996-1997 has been fixed at 4.3 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accepts U.S. Call For Immediate Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres
declared that Israel is willing to accept the U.S.'s call for an
immediate ceasefire with a condition that Hezbollah also accepts
it.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, according to an Israel Radio report this
morning, all Israeli military hardware in south Lebanon kept
silent overnight though Katyushas still fell on some areas in
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a midnight interview with CNN, Peres said Israel will stop
the attack as negotiations take place even though Israel has been
partially successful in taking Hezbollah out of commission.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can negotiate a solution to agreement without
shooting at each other," he said. "There is no need for fire in
order to reach agreement."
</P>
<P>
He also called for peace negotiations with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic change came after Israel's artillery barrage
killed 101 Lebanese civilians and U.N. personnel on a UNIFIL
headquarters compound in south Lebanon yesterday. The incident has
touched off world-wide condemnations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton last night called upon all sides to
agree to an immediate ceasefire. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher spoke by phone to Peres asking for a temporary and
immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross is due in
Israel this afternoon to push for a ceasefire. Christopher will be
in the region at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Americans have apparently changed their policies. Earlier they
backed Israel's operation as a pressure tactic to bring about a
diplomatic solution, first and foremost to the problem of
Katyusha firing into Israel.
</P>
<P>
The inner cabinet, which held an emergency session last night,
authorized Peres to conduct negotiations with the U.S. to end the
crisis.

XINING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A scientific education association
has made an effort to get the members of ethnic groups in Qinghai
Province, northwest China, to develop a sense of science and a

</P>
<P>
They range from exhibitions and video shows to consultations

groups and from the Han nationality.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai has 34 ethnic groups living in backward areas, whose
population accounted for 42 percent of the total. Some five of the
poorer villages and 1,000 families in ethnic areas have become
better off thanks to efforts of the association, which provided
scientific and technological information about farming, set up
rural science and technology training bases, and gave financial
support.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Hit by Severe Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is
going alarmingly dry because of a serious shortage of water supply
with no sign of immediate improvement.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the city's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA)
said its daily water supply at present was about 815 million
liters through 205 deep tube-wells, well short of the daily demand
of 1.29 billion liters in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Officials concerned noted that the loss of water in the
obsolete system and facilities made it even more difficult for
WASA to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its
surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The onset of the summer heat has further drained the ground
water in Dhaka while adding to the sufferings of some 6 million
thirsty residents in the old city.
</P>
<P>
The officials held no optimism about an easy solution to the
problem before a new water treatment plant starts operation.

<P>
HARARE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting World Bank senior
nutrition advisor Alan Berg has praised Zimbabwe's nutrition
program, saying it served as a model to other countries in the
world, the Daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alan Berg, who has been with the World Bank for 23 years, said
the bank made a nutrition study in 46 countries two years ago to
get a better understanding of their nutrition programs and
Zimbabwe came out to be the best.
</P>
<P>
As a result a booklet on nutrition in Zimbabwe was produced to
serve as a model to the other 45 countries,he said.
</P>
<P>
Bery said South Africa is discussing with Zimbabwe as it
requires technical assistance on nutrition matters. Nutrition
status in South Africa is very bad and that country has a lot to
learn from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the nutrition situation in Zimbabwe has improved
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
''Between 1988 and 1994 we found that there had been a decline
in stunting from 30 percent to 23 percent in Zimbabwe. This
comes at a time of drought and the economic hardships and
therefore one can only conclude that these government programs to
target the food to the needy children have been highly
effective,'' Bery said.

<HEADLINE> Driving Schools Boom as Chinese Hit the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Driving schools are becoming
popular in China's major cities as more Chinese than ever hit the
roads.
</P>
<P>
Many pay the equivalent of six months pay to fulfill their
dreams of getting behind the driving wheel of a car.
</P>
<P>
Others are preparing for the future when cars are more popular
in China.
</P>
<P>
Driving students come from all walks of life, including company
managers, factory directors, actors, officials from government
institutions, technical workers and ex-servicemen. In the past
only would-be professional drivers and a very few private car
owners went to driving schools.
</P>
<P>
In one driving school in Shenyang, capital city of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, beginners have to pay 3,000 yuan for
each training course, equal to an ordinary worker's income in six
months.
</P>
<P>
High fees have not stopped people from learning to drive
cars. Among the beginners, some are preparing to buy their own
cars, some think that mastering more skills means more job
opportunities, and some just want to experience the happiness of
driving cars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that many beginners are merely making preparations
for when cars become common for Chinese families.

NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Minister Joshua
Angatia noted the major town of Kisumu in western Kenya facing
grave environment and health problems that had resulted in
multiple outbreak of diseases.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting marking the World AIDS Day in Kisumu on
Thursday, Angatia said poor garbage management is one of the
major factors posing a serious threat to health in the town,
"Daily Nation" reported today.

council could only collect 3.9 percent of it, leaving the rest at
dumping sites,he said.

Urging the people to work for the protection of environment,
the minister warned that solution of garbage collection and
wastes disposal will depend on the people's involvement and their
health-related behaviour.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of population in Kisumu town are using unsafe
water, Angatia said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of Food Shortage in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian agriculture experts have
warned of a serious food shortage in the country in the next five
to ten years if it does not adopt new strategies to keep the
cereal production in pace with its spiraling population growth,
the National Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
The experts said India's current level of food production is
just about enough to meet the demand of the population, whose
growth rate far exceeds the global average.
</P>
<P>
This alarming fact is drawing increasing concern from policy
makers and warrants review of the present production status of the
country's principal grain crops, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
They said India should not be content with depending on a few
states such as Punjab -- the focus of green revolution -- as
granaries to feed its people.
</P>
<P>
They urged policy makers to lay more emphasis on introducing
newer technologies and creating more production facilities in the
hitherto neglected central and eastern India.
</P>
<P>
The experts also called for urgent attention on the production
of coarse grains, such as maize, which could supplement as cereals
for many poor people.
</P>
<P>
They said India should not depend solely on wheat and rice as
the source for cereals.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Treble Rolled Steel Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam plans to treble its annual
output of rolled steel to about three million tonnes by the year
2000, so as to boost its fledging metallurgical and foundry
industries.
</P>
<P>
As one part of the plan, Vietnam will reduce its imports of
rolled steel to as low as possible so that the young domestic
industry can have room to develop, according to the English
"Vietnam News" today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it would encourage the development and
reorganization of rolled steel production and the marketing rolled
steel in the domestic market and call for more investment from
both domestic and foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, Vietnam will increase its annual output of
rolled steel to 7.5 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's total plant capacity for rolled steel has been raised
to an estimated 1.5 million tonnes a year, but the industry only
turned out about one million tonnes last year.

<HEADLINE> Collective Buying Popular in Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Because of its convenience and
economic leverage, collective buying, whereby a group of people
buy commodities in bulk, is spreading in Shenyang, capital city of
northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The method has become increasingly popular after the trade
union of a research institute in Shenyang began to purchase goods
wholesale from local markets, in order to provide goods for its
employees at a price 20 to 30 percent below the market price.
</P>
<P>
A city government official says, "there are more than 30 such
consumers groups in Shenyang at present, and they now even buy
directly from manufacturers instead of through wholesale markets,
putting them one step ahead."
</P>
<P>
"In this way, we spend some 100 yuan less each month and are
spared many annoyances such as debating the price or haggling over
goods," one customer said.
</P>
<P>
Economists have pointed out that the phenomenon helps consumers
by reducing the amount of time and money spent without lowering
the quality.
</P>
<P>
This method of buying is done in a fairly orderly fashion and
tends to be further improved in cities.

<HEADLINE> US Company to Purchase Chinese Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Transamerica Corporation, one
of the largest enterprises in the United States, has plans to buy
containers valued at 110 million US dollars from China this year,
according to Frank C. Herringer, chairman and chief executive
officer with the corporation.
</P>
<P>
"The Transamerica Container Co. Ltd, an affiliate of the
corporation, has bought containers worth nearly 400 million US
dollars from 14 Chinese factories over the past five years,"
Herringer said during his current tour of China.
</P>
<P>
The container company is the second-largest transportation
equipment leaser in the world, said Herringer, "It has close
relations with the China Ocean Shipping Companies Group and a
Chinese express service since 1980."
</P>
<P>
Herringer visited Shanghai before he came to Beijing. He talked
with senior officials with the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade and the Shanghai municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of his tour is to get acquainted with China's
market, build good relations with the Chinese government and to
make preparations to get a license for the Transamerica Occidental
Life Insurance Company, another subsidiary of the corporation, to
operate in China.
</P>
<P>
"The Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company is an
innovator in promoting new life insurance products," Herringer
said. "It was the first in the world to offer flexible premiums."
</P>
<P>
Peter Kuo, chief representative in China of the insurer, said
that his company can help Chinese insurance companies improve
their services. "We have plans to select appropriate Chinese
insurance companies and help them design better products to meet
the demands of the customers."
</P>
<P>
The US insurance company has set up representative offices in
Beijing and Tianjin, and has applied to open another in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Over the past less than 20 years, China's insurance market has
expanded dramatically. Statistics released by the central bank
show that China's total insurance premiums increased by 23.6
percent to 61.57 billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Leading overseas insurance companies have tried a variety of
methods to venture into China. Senior officers of Sigma and Chubb,
both from the United States, the National Mutual Insurance Group
of Australia, and AXA, a leading French underwriter, have visited
Beijing over the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Major Crops Production Increases In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
harare, april 19 (xinhua) -- Production of Zimbabwe's major
crops which was hampered by the drought last year increased
significantly this season with maize rising by about 1.5 million
tonnes and cotton by over half.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary crop forecast released by the Central Statistical
Office yesterday painted a bright picture of the country's
agricultural production with good harvests.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector is expected to fuel the growth of the
rest of the economy this year. Communal farmers, most of whom
received drought relief food last year, have produced the bulk of
most crops this season.
</P>
<P>
Maize farmers can be expected to produce over 2.6 million
tonnes of maize, up from last year's 874,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is estimated to be about the same as last year, about
199 million kg with commercial farmers delivering the bulk of the
crop, about 197 million kg.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production will be more than doubled this year from
102,000 tonnes last year to an anticipated 226,000 tonnes, most
of it coming from communal cotton growers.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Herald noted today that good harvests will help
farmers reduce their debt burdens and allow postponed development
plans to be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Breast-Feeding Improves Babies' Tastes, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian researchers found
that breast-feeding would help babies to improve their tastes for
a wide range of nutritious foods at weaning.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales Lactation College's inaugural conference
was told that breast-fed babies were quicker than bottle-fed
babies to accept solid foods at weaning, today's Sydney Morning
Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
The study by the University of Western Sydney (UWS) showed that
breast-fed babies seemed to be used to a wider range of flavors
than bottle-fed babies. The study also showed that if their
mothers ate a lot of garlic during breast feeding, the babies were
more willing than other breast-fed babies to eat garlic-flavored
foods.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested that mothers might be able to influence
their babies' tastes by their own diet.
</P>
<P>
David Laing, professor of food technology at UWS, has studied
30 breast-fed babies aged between four and six months.
</P>
<P>
During the ten-day study, researchers provided garlic-flavored
pumpkin to the weanlings. Breast-fed babies started to eat the
food quicker and ate more by the end of the study period than
formula-fed babies did. Those with garlic-eating mothers were the
quickest and most gourmand ones to take up the food.
</P>
<P>
Laing said that breast-fed babies were exposed to a wide
variety of flavors. This helped them to accept new flavors.
</P>
<P>
Patricia McVeagh of the New Children's Hospital in Sydney said
that the study proved that breast milk was a "brain food."

<HEADLINE> Farmers Getting Used to Social Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's Zhejiang
Province will no longer depend exclusively on their sons for their
later years in the near future, thanks to a pension system has
been set up in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
About three million farmers in Zhejiang have joined the rural
pension plan, which started last year. The amount in the fund has
reached 562 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
People in villages used to have more children, especially sons,
to provide a guarantee for later in life, when they could no
longer work. When the province began to implement a rural social
security policy, people began to see an alternative to having more
children in the old-age pension.
</P>
<P>
The province also has ways to provide disaster relief for local
farmers for food, clothing, and building materials.
</P>
<P>
Some 408 homes for elderly farmers were set up last year, and
province-wide programs found employment for a total of 100,000
disabled persons.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is planning on expanding the rural
security system to attract more farmers to take part in the
pension plan, and to set up more homes for the elderly and help
more disabled people find jobs.

<HEADLINE> Russians Sing Praises of Chinese Singers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's cultural attache in
Beijing has been singing the praises of a Chinese singing group
who perform famous Russian songs.
</P>
<P>
"I am intoxicated by each of your performances. You have
brought about the revival of Russian songs on the Chinese soil,"
said Madame Kulikova, cultural attache of the Russian Embassy in
Beijing, in a congratulatory letter to Beijing-based Kalynka
Singing Group. The Russian word Kalynka means snowball flower.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of your group, which bears such a poetic name as
Kalynka, is powerful evidence for cultural exchanges between the
two countries, and a great promotion of mutual understanding and
friendship between the two peoples," wrote Kulikova, who is also
the vice-president of the Russian-Chinese Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Qian Guangjian, founder and head of Kalynka said, "It is a
shared love for songs of the former Soviet Union that has drawn us
together. We formed it mainly for the purpose of self-
entertainment."
</P>
<P>
"A doctor, teacher, reporter, engineer, and even an army
officer are among the members of the group, but none of us have
specialized in music or Russian language," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Within only a few years the 30-member part-time group has
become a hit in cultural and entertainment circles of the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
Almost the only foreign music in a quite long time, songs of
the former Soviet Union have deeply influenced China's past
generations since 1949. The music was extremely popular in the
1950's.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening up of China, and the influx of Western
pop music have not wiped the most familiar tunes from people's
minds, especially classics like "The Night of The Moscow Suburbs"
or "Katyusha".
</P>
<P>
"Most of these songs have been forgotten, even in our own
country. So I am impressed to see they are loved by so many people
in China," a Russian expert working in China said.
</P>
<P>
According to Qian, songs of the former Soviet Union are
cherished because they have beautiful lyrics and melodies, and can
give people power and faith.
</P>
<P>
"When I sing them, I always feel as if I am young again," Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite being an amateur group, Kalynka was invited last June
to give a public performance at the Beijing Concert Hall, the
country's highest temple of music, which for most of the time was
drowned in applause.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the concert, staff workers of the Russian Embassy
followed Madame Kulikova onto the stage, and sang with the group

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Price Dumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian wool price closed
sharply weaker at the end of this week's trade.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator closed at 547 cents per kg clean,
25 cents lower than two weeks ago, the Australian Council of Wool
Exporters announced today.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator closed at 524 cents per kg clean,
down 34 cents from its close before the Easter break.
</P>
<P>
Exporters blamed the fall of price on this week's massive
offering, which is 25 percent more than forecasted.
</P>
<P>
A total of 132,978 bales of wool were offered at auctions in
Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle this week, with 25 percent of them

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Achieves Higher GDP Growth in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP) of
Bangladesh achieved a growth rate of five percent in 1995, up from
4.6 percent in the previous year, said the UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) in a report available here
today.
</P>
<P>
The figure still fell short of the government's target of seven
percent, which was considered as necessary for the alleviation of
widespread poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the ESCAP report, the growth rate of agriculture
stood at a low 2.6 percent in 1995, primarily because of drought
and shortage of fertilizers, although it was up from 1.8 percent
in the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector's growth of 8.2 percent in 1995 was
slightly less than the 8.5 percent recorded in 1994, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's manufacturing, relying on small-scale industries,
registered a strong growth rate at 13 percent in 1995, but large
scale industries, such as textiles and chemicals, were less
dynamic.
</P>
<P>
The report said Bangladesh's large public industrial
enterprises performed poorly last year and continued to be a
serious drain on public sources.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's growth rate of 5.6 percent in 1995 was
slightly above the 5.3 percent of the previous year, which was
maintained through expansion in the communications and trade
sectors, said the ESCAP report.
</P>
<P>
It said an accelerated growth rate of ready-made garment
exports, which accounted for 60 percent of the total value of
exports, was the main contributor to the upsurge in exports in
1994, sharply rising from 8.6 percent to 16.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the industry was adversely affected in 1994-1995 by
irregular supplies and rising prices of imported inputs while
output prices faced downward pressure from increased competition.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has considerably improved its balance of payment
position in recent years, the report said, noting that both gross
national investment and savings have been steadily increasing over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested measures to enhance competitiveness and
emphasized efforts to deregulate and liberalize Bangladesh's
domestic markets and international trade to expose local producers
to greater competition.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested raising the level of investment and its
efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Nordic Nations to Become Schengen Agreement Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Five Nordic countries will
become observers of the Schengen Agreement which eliminates border
controls among its seven signatory nations.
</P>
<P>
The decision, to be effective from May 1, was made today at a
meeting in the Hague of foreign ministers from the five Nordic
countries and several European Union (EU) nations.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen Agreement allows passport-free travel across
borders within the Schengen zone to further promote integration
among European countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the five Nordic nations, Sweden, Denmark and Finland are
members of the 15-nation EU and observer status is the first step
toward becoming a signatory of the Schengen Agreement.
</P>
<P>
For Norway and Iceland, the two Nordic nations outside the EU,
observer status means that they will cooperate with the signatory
nations under a special agreement.
</P>
<P>
Border controls have been long abolished among the Nordic
nations.
</P>
<P>
However, passport checks will remain between the Nordic
countries and the Schengen nations until 1998.

<HEADLINE> Economy Shrinks Again in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Germany fell in
the first quarter of 1996 after a fall of 0.5 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1995, fueling fears that Germany is heading for
recession.
</P>
<P>
Although the Economics Ministry did not release figures, it
said in its monthly report that the economy contracted in the
first quarter of this year over the fourth quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Official first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data is
expected to be published in early May.
</P>
<P>
GDP contracted by a real 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of
1995 from the previous three months, after grinding to a halt in the
third quarter over the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Some countries define their economies as being in recession if
the economy contracts for two successive quarters. But Germany
uses a different definition involving a long-term moving averages.
</P>
<P>
So while conceding the economy is in trouble, German government
officials have been insisting the country is not on the verge of a
recession.

combat the kidnapping and disappearance of minors. It also
proposed that a police task force be set up to find and return the
children.

<HEADLINE> Demarcation of Russian-Chinese Border Goes Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Demarcation along the far eastern
section of the 2,400-kilometer Russian-Chinese border is
proceeding smoothly and will be finished as scheduled, Commander
of the Far Eastern Border District Aleksandr Golbakh said today.
</P>
<P>
The commander was speaking in the wake of Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Panov's criticism of Russian Maritime
territory leader, Yevgeny Nazdratenko for opposing the demarcation
of a disputed section of the Russian-Chinese border.
</P>
<P>
Panov accused the regional leader of trying to upset Russia's
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Golbakh said that 170 out of the 181 boundary markers have
already been set up, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted him as saying that a stable border is
important for the development of good relations and cooperation
between Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China share a 4,300-kilometer-long border. An
agreement on the western section of the border took effect in 1995
while another agreement on the eastern section has been in effect
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Demarcation is still in progress over a 61-kilometer-long
boundary river.
</P>
<P>
In late February, President Boris Yeltsin ordered Russian
officials to finish the demarcation in strict conformity with the
1991 border agreement between China and the then Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Offers Rewards for Tips on Illegal Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi caretaker
government has offered rewards for correct tips on the whereabouts
of illegal arms at large in the country as general elections are
drawing near, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, 3,000 taka (about 75 US dollars) will
be rewarded for information on a foreign-made gun or short gun and
15,000 taka (about 375 US dollars) for a foreign-made light
machine gun.
</P>
<P>
Information on each live bullet and each large powerful bomb
will be rewarded with five taka (0.125 US dollars) and 100 taka
(2.5 US dollars) respectively, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is now in full swing for the next parliamentary
elections, the exact date of which is yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
Both the former ruling and opposition parties have attacked
each other for hiring illegal arms in an attempt to force voters
to cast for the party of its own.
</P>
<P>
The problem of illegal arms has remained serious in Bangladesh
despite efforts of law-enforcing agencies to ensure free and fair
polls.

NEW DELHI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The US is expected to again put
India on the priority watch list under the special 301 provisions
in a bid to put pressure on the country for concrete measures to
protect intellectual property, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
A final US decision can be expected by the end of this month.
The list is reviewed every April by the US.
</P>
<P>
The US move could be aimed at pressuring the in-coming
government to amend its patent and trademarks laws in accordance
with the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPR)
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The US has at virtually every forum been putting pressure on
India to amend its patent laws. It has in the past used the
provisions of the special 301 and super 301 to force other
countries to fall in line. While India had been placed on the
priority watch list earlier, the US has so far not imposed trade
sanctions against the country.

<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 61 percent of
Bangladesh's 10 million urban population are absolute poor,
according to the country's Planning Commission today.
</P>
<P>
In its study published recently, the commission said that the
poor urban people were hurdling in shanties almost without basic
civic amenities and health services.
</P>
<P>
Flimsy shacks and makeshift structures constitute nearly 75
percent of housing of the urban poor and in the capital Dhaka, 89
percent of the poor households live in a single room of only 125
square feet, the study revealed.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that these urban poor spent 63 percent of their
earnings on food alone, while 40 percent children of school age do
not go to school.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a group of Dhaka University academicians worked as
the consultants of the study on 3,000 households in Dhaka and 9
other metropolis and secondary towns.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Drafts Banking Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A new banking law and plans for a
securities and stock exchange have been drawn up as part of
Vietnam's financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The banking law, described by Deputy Governor of the State Bank
Le Van Chau as essential for the continuing drive to modernize
Vietnam's banking industry, will be submitted to the National
Assembly later this year for adoption.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of a stock exchange is part of the government's
plan to transform state-owned companies into joint stock
companies. The program was set up two years ago, but the trading
of shares has so far been very small due to the lack of a proper
legal framework and support services, said Chau.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's network of financial institutions has flourished in
both quality and quantity during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
A domestic inter-bank market, a foreign exchange inter-bank
market and a treasury bill auction market have been established to
help stabilize the exchange rate, maintain the purchasing power of
the domestic currency, said Chau.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has four state-owned commercial banks, more than 50
joint-venture banks, two financial companies, 600 credit funds and
21 branches, and about 70 representative offices of foreign banks
from 48 countries.
</P>
<P>
The main tasks for the State Bank now are to improve its
formulation and implementation of monetary policy and to maintain
a balance between controlling inflation and promoting economic
growth, the bank deputy governor added.

<HEADLINE> British National Executed in Singapore for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A 35-year-old British national,
John Martin Scripps, was executed at the Changi Prison here this
morning for murdering a South African tourist early last year.
</P>
<P>
Police said that John Martin Scripps was charged in court on
March 24, 1995 with the murder of 32-year-old South African
tourist Lowe Gerard George.
</P>
<P>
Scripps first met Lowe at Singapore's Changi Airport on March
8, 1995 when they arrived in Singapore. Later that day, they
checked into Room No. 1511 of the River View Hotel, police said.
</P>
<P>
While in the room, it said, Scripps bludgeoned Lowe to death
with a hammer. Then, using the butchery skills he had acquired
while serving a prison term in the United Kingdom, Scripps
dismembered the victim's body and disposed of the body parts in
the Singapore River behind the hotel.
</P>
<P>
He checked out of the hotel on March 11 and flew to Phuket,
Thailand. Two days after he left Singapore, the victim's body
parts were discovered. And Scripps was placed on the "Wanted List"
by police.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Singapore from Phuket unsuspectingly on March 19
and was arrested at the airport.
</P>
<P>
During the trial against Scripps for murder, which lasted 16
days, Justice Sinnathuray, the trial judge, not only found him
guilty of murdering Lowe Gerard George, but also found him to be
involved in the murder of two Canadian tourists in Phuket,
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Scripps was convicted of murder on November 10 last year and
sentenced to death. He appealed against the sentence but withdrew
his appeal on January 8 this year, police said.

<HEADLINE> Solana Reassures Poland over NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana reassured Poland on Thursday that the alliance's expansion
is on track but avoided making a public commitment on Poland's
membership.
</P>
<P>
Solana, speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Warsaw as
part of a 12-nation tour of central and east Europe, said he would
work with Poland for its incorporation in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
But asked when Poland would join the alliance, he only said
"very soon".
</P>
<P>
Polish President Alekdander Kwasniewski said after meeting with
Solana that "it will not be a long time" before Poland becomes a
NATO member though much work and more negotiations are needed.
</P>
<P>
Solana stressed that opening NATO to new members would not mean
the "re-division of Europe" and the isolation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We want to maintain very profound, very open, very frank
relations with an important country for stability in the
continent, which is Russia," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he added that NATO would not allow Russia, which views
NATO's expansion as a threat, to dictate the terms of its
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Solana met with Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz and leaders of the House of Representatives and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief spoke highly of the economic progress the
country had made in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Poland plays a very important role in Europe for stability and
we are sure that it will continue in this role," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana is due to leave Warsaw Thursday afternoon for
Budapest. Thereafter he will visit the Czech Republic, Slovenia,
Croatia, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Balance of Payments Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's balance of
payments situation improved by almost 35 percent in the last
quarter in 1995, according to figures released by the Statistics
NZ today.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit in the December 1995 quarter fell
to 1.077 billion NZ dollars (721.59 million US dollars) from 1.649
billion NZ dollars (1.105 billion US dollars) in the September
1995 quarter, an improvement of 572 million NZ dollars (383.24
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The statistics office said the better situation was mainly due
to seasonal tourism movements as the number of overseas visitors
to NZ continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
But higher earnings from tourism were partly offset by a rising
deficit of the country's net investment income in the last
quarter, mainly reflecting a rise in returns to overseas investors
from their investments in New Zealand.

NEW DELHI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian ruling Congress party's
official newspaper today blamed Israel for violating Lebanon's
sovereignty with its military operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Herald, organ of the ruling Congress party, said
in its editorial that it is unfortunate that the Israeli military
operations against the Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon
are continuing, "violating in the process Lebanese sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that "the UN Security Council has not
been able to act quickly because of the traditional pro-Israeli
policies of the US."
</P>
<P>
The call for an immediate ceasefire made by many nations is
aimed at limiting the damage and deserves to be heeded quickly,

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A survey of 1,400 titles
published by 520 publishing houses indicated that only some 20
percent came up to national standards concerning content, binding,
printing and paper quality, the China Daily reported today.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Firearm Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese authorities have
vowed to tighten firearm controls in order to ensure a better
social order in the country, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jiahua, director of the Public Order Bureau under the
Ministry of Public Security, said three steps were needed to
control gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
First is to reduce the number of people who are entitled to
military guns, second is to tighten the grip on the production and
sale of civilian guns, and third is to intensify the crackdown on
illegal manufacture or smuggling of firearms.
</P>
<P>
A new law on the management of firearms, which is currently
being drafted, is expected to reflect these three measures.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Regulations on the Management of
Firearms, promulgated by the State Council in 1981, had played a
very important role in controlling firearms in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, new regulations are needed to keep up with current
social situations. The paper said that despite the nationwide
crackdown on illegal production and smuggling of firearms launched
by the Ministry of Public Security, illicit ownership of guns is
becoming a threat to public order.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's biggest
metropolis, played host to 291,700 overseas visitors in the first
quarter of the year, an increase of 10.6 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy fact is that March alone saw a total of
126,700 tourists from overseas, including 105,500 from foreign
countries, 3,500 overseas Chinese, and 17,700 from Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Shanghai Municipal Tourism Administration
attributes the growth mainly to the city's booming economy and
new landscapes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of tourists from the United
States, Japan, Canada, Italy, Britain, Germany and France has
grown by over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
One new thing is the fact that, instead of visiting relatives
and friends, compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are now
coming to the inland for sightseeing and business.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the domestic tourism in Shanghai is also
developing rapidly.

3,000 kinds of ancient coins.
</P>
<P>
The country's most ardent money-collecting county, Xiji has
everything from shell money from the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th
Century BC), the oldest ever found in the country to bank notes
issued not long after the founding of the new China in 1949.

<P>
Also in the collection are the only Sheng coin from the Han
Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), the "Qianlong Tong Bao" coin from the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) which is regarded as a category one
national treasure, and some rare coins made by ethnic minority
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the good condition of the ancient money in the

MANILA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves (GIR) soared to a historic high of 8.89

billion US dollars, accounting for almost half of the total volume

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Nearly four thousand organ
transplants have been carried out in Portugal since such
operations began in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Organ transplants have become far more common in the country in
recent years and Portugal has one of the highest success rates in
the world, a report by the National Organ Transplant Organization
said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994, Portuguese doctors had conducted 2,600
operations of kidney transplants, 563 cornea transplants, 130
heart and lung transplants, 444 marrow transplants, 78 liver
transplants and three pancreas transplants.
</P>
<P>
Increasing demand for organ transplants has led to a shortage
of donors, resulting in long waiting lists for operations.
</P>
<P>
Only 1,380 people have donated their organs for use in
transplant operations from 1980 to 1994, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that about 250,000 patients in the world are
waiting for organ transplants, of whom some 50,000 a year have
operations.

SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Middle-aged Chen Wenbing from
Shanghai felt depressed when he lost his job with a local
enterprise. Then he went on the dole after registering as
unemployed with a service organization -- picking up a monthly pay
packet of 203 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jobless people in Shanghai, China's largest city, are able to
receive unemployment pay if they register as unemployed within one
month of losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Jobless people can get the pay for a maximum term of two years,
and during the period they will receive job-training and be helped
by job-introducing organizations to hunt for new work.
</P>
<P>
If they unreasonably refuse three job introductions their
employment pay will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
The city handed out nearly 100 million yuan in unemployment
benefits last year.
</P>
<P>
The city began trials with unemployment insurance systems in
1986. Now a total of more than 13,000 units in Shanghai, including
state-owned, collectively-owned, and foreign-funded enterprises,
as well as share-holding or private firms, have joined the
scheme. It means that 95 percent of Shanghai jobless workers can
qualify for unemployment insurance.

<HEADLINE> EU To Help Former Soviet Bloc Improve Nuclear Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here today it will continue to help former Soviet bloc countries
to close or upgrade unsafe reactors of the Chernobyl type and set
up rules on nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer said the EU will
help former Soviet republics and east European countries to design
more advanced reactors and ensure their safe operation.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Moscow to attend a weekend summit on nuclear
safety, Santer said that 10 years after Chernobyl disaster, the
world is still uneasy over the safety of nuclear reactors in
former Soviet bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU would help these countries to set up a legal
framework on nuclear security and nuclear accident liability.
</P>
<P>
East European countries have signed the Vienna Convention,
which provides a structure that covers accident liability, but
have yet to adapt it into national legislation.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine, home to the Chernobyl nuclear plant, will
sign the Vienna Convention at the Moscow summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit comes on the 10th anniversary of the explosion of a
reactor in the Chernobyl plant on April 26, 1986, the world's
worst nuclear disaster. Some 2.5 million people, including
900,000 children, were affected by the accident, which sent a
radioactive cloud over vast areas of Belarus and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
To foot the massive bill to close the Chernobyl plant and
improve safety at others, EU has channeled 500 million Ecus, or
about 650 million U.S. dollars, to Ukraine, an EU report said
today.

SOFIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's foreign exchange
reserves have fallen by almost a half over the last four months,
the president of the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Lubomir Philipov, president of the Bulgarian National Bank,
said today that the country's foreign exchange reserves have
dropped by 560 million U.S. dollars from last December's 1.27
billion dollars to 703 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the bank expected increased exports to help stabilize
reserves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bulgaria's Finance Minister Dimitr Kostov told local
press that Sofia would pay back foreign debt of 1.2 billion
dollars this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Legislative Investigation of Samper Case to End Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A congressional
investigation into allegations that drug money was used to fund
President Ernesto Samper's electoral campaign in 1994 will end
next week.
</P>
<P>
A congressional commission in charge of the investigation said
today it has decided not to call Samper to give evidence at the
inquiry, because the questions the president needed to answer had
already been answered in the declaration he made in 1995, and
during formal questioning this year.
</P>
<P>
Forty eight people have testified to the committee since
February 14, when General Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso
formally accused Samper over alleged contributions
made by drug traffickers to his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Among those who have given statements are constitutional court
magistrates and members of the council of state, government
officials in positions of responsibility during the electoral
campaign and the ministers of foreign relations, of the interior,
and of communications.
</P>
<P>
After giving his statement on Wednesday, Communications
Minister Juan Manuel Turbay told the Supreme Court of Justice that
there is evidence showing that drug traffickers gave money for the
Samper campaign.
</P>
<P>
Turbay, the first minister to speak publicly on the affair,
said "how, when, and who were responsible for the injection of
drug money into the campaign" should be made known.
</P>
<P>
The commission investigators asked all banks and financial
organizations to surrender any information they have about the
accounts of those responsible for managing funds for the Samper
campaign.
</P>
<P>
So far, 15 organizations and the banking superintendency have
responded.

women's title.
</P>

The world number five completed one of the shortest matches in
the history of the European Championships when she beat the
unseeded German Stefanie Muller 11-O, 11-O to reach the last

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today called for "an immediate cessation of
hostilities by all parties in the current conflict between Lebanon
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously this evening, the council
expressed grave concern at the consequences which the ongoing
fighting could have for the peace and security of the region and
for the furthering of the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli shelling of a United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) position that killed at least 75
civilians and wounded over 100 more, the council expressed grave
concern at actions which seriously threaten the safety of UNIFIL
and impede the implementation of its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon all those involved to respect
the safety and security of civilians, to respect the safety and
security and freedom of movement of UNIFIL, and to allow the
U.N. peacekeeping force to fulfil its mandate without any obstacle
or interference.
</P>
<P>
It also called upon member states to offer humanitarian
assistance to alleviate the suffering of the population and to
assist the government of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Two draft resolutions on the same subject was put to vote this
evening. The one put forward by Arab countries, which strongly
condemned Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the bombardment
of civilians, got 4 votes in favor and 11 abstentions.
Representatives of Arab states criticized some countries adopting
"double standard" in dealing with such issues.
</P>
<P>
The current resolution was drafted by France, Britain, the
United States and five other countries. It contained no terms of
direct condemnation against Israeli attacks on civilians in
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Parties Continue to Get Big "Soft Money" Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of this
year both the Democratic and Republican parties continue to
collect "soft money" donations that are unaffected by limits on
campaign contributions enacted after Watergate.
</P>
<P>
"The contributions have to be viewed in the political context
in which they are given," said Joshua Goldstein with the Center
for Responsive Politics today. "Both parties are raising record
amounts of soft money, and the donations are coming from interest
groups that want to get something back."
</P>
<P>
The Democratic National Committee's (DNC) latest report to the
Federal Election Commission (FEC) shows that the party raised
nearly 5.3 million dollars in soft money donations from
corporations and another 822,000 from individual contributors from
January through March.
</P>
<P>
The party raised 25 million dollars in soft money last year,
bringing its 15-month total to 31.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
That's a pretty good start compared to the last presidential
election cycle, when the DNC raised 7.2 million in soft money
contributions from January 1991 through March 1992, according to
FEC figures.
</P>
<P>
The Republican National Committee raised 21 million dollars in
soft money last year. Its latest report for 1996 was not available
at the FEC yet.
</P>
<P>
The National Republican Campaign Committee, meanwhile, reported
today that it had raised 15.7 million from January through March,
of which 2.9 million dollars came from soft-money contributions.
The committee supports Republican House candidates.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Economy Declines in Early 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing output
in Colombia grew only 0.6 percent in the first two months of this
year, down from 6.5 percent in the same period last year, a
financial report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report from the National Industrialists Association (ANDI)
showed that production bogged down in the first two months of
1996, sales increased only slightly, inventories continued
accumulating and orders were stalling.
</P>
<P>
ANDI President Luis Carlos Villegas Echeverry attributed the
decline mainly to an excessively restrictive monetary policy,
which translates into high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said falling demand was also due to low world coffee prices,
a drop in construction activity and uncertainty caused by the
political crisis surrounding President Ernesto Samper, who has
been accused of taking money from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Villegas warned that the economy could go into recession by
the end of the year unless there was an improvement in aggregate
demand.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Guillermo Perry Rubio and Central
Bank Manager Miguel Urrutia Montoya said that inflation was
falling and tight management of the budget, the money supply and
exchange rates would turn the economy around this year.

that China hopes to see the economic, trade and other ties with
Canada, especially with the prairie province of Saskatchewan,
further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Glenn Hagel, speaker of the province's
Legislative Assembly, Qiao said that the Chinese government
supports enhanced exchanges and cooperation between China's Jilin
and Shandong provinces and Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
Saskatchewan is ready to augment friendship and cooperation
with China, Hagel noted.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow,
Qiao was briefed on the long-standing cooperation of Saskatchewan
with China in economy, trade, culture and education, as well as
the ongoing discussions on grain storage, husbandry and dairy
production projects in China.
</P>
<P>
Saskatchewan, which regularly accounts for almost 30 percent of
Canada's total annual exports to China, supplies almost two-thirds
of the wheat China buys from Canada and over half of its imported
potash.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 35 years, Saskatchewan and China have come to
depend on each other as trading partners, and as friends," Romanow
told the NPC leader.
</P>
<P>
"Economic and trade cooperation has been helpful" in furthering
the understanding and friendship between the two peoples, Qiao
responded. He hoped that the two countries would make joint
efforts in tapping the new fields of collaborations.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon held today for Qiao and his wife, Romanow
described Qiao's visit as "lending to the important relationship"
between the two nations and between his province and China.
</P>
<P>
"Saskatchewan looks forward to strengthening and expanding" the
important ties with China in the years ahead, Romanow noted.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Visits Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO will make a final decision
on who can join the military alliance at the end of this year
after separate negotiations with all 11 central and eastern
European countries applying for membership, visiting NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana said today.
</P>
<P>
NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) will soon start
seperate negotiations with all the 11 countries, including
Hungary, applying for membership. All 11 have the same opportunity
to join and the western alliance would like to admit all those who
meet its requirements, the Hungarian Telegraph Agency reported
Solana as telling Hungarian Defense Minister Gyorgy Keleti.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are expected to last till the end of this year,
and then, NATO will make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Keleti, the NATO chief also praised
Hungary's role in the peace-keeping mission in the former
Yugoslavia and in the Partnership for Peace Program, which it
signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Keleti reiterated Hungary's wish to join NATO, and said he
believed that Hungary will be among the first new member states.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia's ambassador to Hungary warned on Wednesday
that Moscow may be forced to take "measures of a military nature"
if Hungary joined NATO as part of the alliance's planned eastward
expansion following the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the end of
the Cold War. Russia has repeatedly objected to NATO's plan,
seeing it as a threat to its own security.
</P>
<P>
Solana's visit to Hungary is one stop on his 12-nation tour of
central and eastern Europe, which has already taken him to
Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland.
</P>
<P>
After Hungary, he is expected to visit the Czech Republic,
Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania.

MADRID, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Carlos

Israeli shelling of a UN base in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Australian Imports Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) today announced that the country's merchandise
imports fell by six percent in March, marking a slowdown of the
economy and raising hopes of improving the country's external
balance.
</P>
<P>
Australia's merchandise imports dropped to 6.31 billion
Australian dollars (4.98 billion US dollars) seasonally adjusted
in March from 6.738 billion Australian dollars (5.323 billion US
dollars) in February, said the ABS.
</P>
<P>
Imports of consumption goods fell by 9.2 percent from those in
February, while capital goods imports fell by 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures reflect a lower domestic demand and less business
investment in local industries, indicating a slowdown of the
economy that is sucking in less imports.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures were a welcome news to the new coalition
government, which has vowed to narrow the nation's current account
deficit and reduce foreign debt through micro-economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
A lower import growth and higher international prices for
Australia's commodity exports are expected to help slash the
country's current account deficit.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries should
actively transfer technology and investment to the developing
countries, a Chinese representative said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Fourth Session of the U.N. Commission on
Sustainable Development, Wang Baoqing said the highest priority
for the commission should be to implement the commitments made at
the 1992 U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent of the world's population who live in the
developing world was using only 20 percent of its resources.
Developed countries should actively increase the developing
world's access to technology and investment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Environmental concerns should not be used as an artificial
barrier to trade, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The developed world should provide new resources to facilitate
the achievement of sustainable development in the developing
world. Technology should be transferred on a subsidized and
preferential basis, he added.
</P>
<P>
The current session of the Commission on Sustainable
Development opened here today and will continue until May 3.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a body charged with monitoring the plan of
action adopted at the UNCED, also known as Earth Summit, will
feature a high-level segment from May 1 to 3, when a policy
dialogue will be launched in preparation for the upcoming special
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A number of government ministers, other senior officials and
senior executives of big companies will attend the meeting.

<P>
KIEV, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
today reaffirmed the West's commitment to helping Ukraine close
down the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the world's worst
nuclear accident in April 1986.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, Major
told reporters that Chernobyl will be discussed at this weekend's
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries.

"We're fully committed to implementing (the aid plan)," he

later this week."
</P>

The G-7 has promised to give Ukraine 3.1 billion U.S. dollars

developing new energy sources.

Kuchma that Britain will help Ukraine in energy development and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Britain's support for Ukraine's independence and
democracy and said Britain appreciates Ukraine's efforts to
overcome the difficulties Kiev is experiencing as it proceeds with
political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed European security, for which
Major said a smoothly-developing Ukraine is a decisive factor.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said Major's visit continued an active bilateral
political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Kuchma, Major and his Ukrainian
counterpart, Yevgeny Marchuk, signed two accords on cooperation in
crime-fighting.
</P>

Major will leave here tonight for Moscow to join other G-7
leaders for the summit on nuclear safety, which will also be

LONDON, April 18 (AFP) - Pre-race favourite Dionisio Ceron of
Mexico will be bidding for an unprecedented hat-trick of wins in
the 1996 London Marathon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the diminutive ace of the long distance will be under
pressure from one of the most competitive fields in the 16-year
history of the race.
</P>
<P>
Only eight runners have run under 2 hrs 8 mins in 88 years and
Belgian Vincent Rousseau has done it twice.
</P>
<P>
Rousseau, who is the second fastest European ever to run the

</P>
<P>
The Belgian is looking to break the eight-year mark of 2hrs
6mins 50secs belonging to Ethiopia's Belayneh Dinsamo.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say how fast we will run because there are a
lot of things to consider, but a very fast time is possible,"
said Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
Ceron finished 24 seconds ahead of Ethiopia's Abebe Mekkonen in
the 1994 marathon and last year out ran Australian Steve
Moneghetti to achieve his personal best time of 2 hours 8 minutes
30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But amongst the record field of 27,000, Ceron will face strong
opposition from Rousseau and some of the world's top runners who
are competing for places at the Olympic games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
A 100,000 pounds prize (about 150,000 dollars) is on offer for
a world best, with 25,000 pounds for anyone beating the course
record of 2:8:16 set by Welshman Steve Jones in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Rousseau, who will not compete in Atlanta because it will be
too hot and humid, will be happy with the weather forecast for
Sunday which is expected to be around 17 degrees centigrade at
mid-day.
</P>
<P>
Rousseau is the joint favourite for Sunday's race with Ceron
but the pair are not likely to have things all their own way.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's German Silva, who has won the New York marathon for
the last two years, returns to London with the aim of improving
on his third place in 1994.

<HEADLINE> China's Electrical and Machinery Exports Boosted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Digital technology has helped
boost exports of electrical goods and machinery from China.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter of this year saw a 3.4 percent growth in
overseas sales of China-made machinery and electrical products
compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During an on-going "shop window" Commodity Export Fair in
Guangzhou, booming capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
more than 90 percent of machinery and electrical products on
display are digital controlled.
</P>
<P>
Hi-technology and quality control have helped upgrade the
products, improving their competitiveness on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
China now handles increasing exports of complete machinery and
electrical products.
</P>
<P>
The country is now exporting more than 70 kinds of household
appliances, earning more than 100 million US dollars in export
value a year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the high cost of household appliances produced by
developed countries, and limits on the application of technologies
for developing countries, China is tapping its potential for
export of its home-produced household appliances.
</P>
<P>
The appliances have reached international standards, said Shi
Guangsheng, Chinese vice-minister of Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade.

<HEADLINE> Forum Spreads Fertilizer Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Scholars, experts and officials
attending an international symposium in Beijing agreed that China
needs a scientifically balanced variety of fertilizers to allow
agriculture to develop not only stably but sustainably, the "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"China is extremely short of farm land, with only seven percent
of the world's cultivated land to feed 22 percent of the world's
population," said Vice-Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo at the
three-day symposium on rational use of potash fertilizers, which
ended on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one-third of China's grain output at
present results from the use of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Potash fertilizer is one of the most effective fertilizers, but
it is underused in China, according to the scholars and experts at
the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Failure to use enough potash fertilizer has caused an imbalance
in the overall use of fertilizers, and is causing a worsening
nutrient deficiency in cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
All China's cultivated land is considered nitrogen-deficient to
some degree, and since the late 1970s almost all of the country's
south has been deficient of potash, a trend that has been
exacerbated since the 1980s, with bad results for crop yields.
</P>
<P>
The symposium participants agreed that the country should raise
the ratio of potash fertilizer to keep a rational balance of
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium was attended by some 100 experts from
China, Germany, France and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Klinsmann May Miss European Championships Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Juergen Klinsmann could be
suspended from Germany's opening match of the European soccer
championships against the Czech Republic on June 9 following a
meeting of UEFA's executive committee here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old German skipper, currently the reigning
English Footballer of the Year following his season with
Tottenham in 1994-95, picked up two yellow cards in the
qualifying competition.
</P>
<P>
And despite a vigorous campaign by the German Football
Association (DFB) to discount for the finals bookings incurred in
the qualifiers, UEFA are expected to announce that they will be
carried over, which mean that Klinsmann, now with Bayern Munich
will miss his country's opener.
</P>
<P>
The Germans thought it was unfair that hosts England would be
going into the tournament with all their players eligible because
they did not have to play in the qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Germany would also be without Steffen Freund in their first
match.
</P>
<P>
Five other players would also miss their country's
opening games, Daniel Prodan of Romania, Yuri Nikiforov of
Russia, Marc Hottiger of Switzerland, Danny Blind of the
Netherlands and Miguel Nadal of Spain, who is banned for two
matches.

<HEADLINE> Russian Experts to Work on China's Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Three Gorges
Development Corporation (YRTGDC) is to engage two Russian
hydro-electric power consultants, a company official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
YRTGDC, the major undertaker of the Three Gorges Project, has
expanded exchanges with Russian institutes and businesses over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia will find more common ground in the Three
Gorges Project, said Xu Keda, director of the international
co-operation department of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
After China approved the project in 1992, Russian experts and
officials have paid more than 100 visits to the company, Xu said,
adding, "Russian government officials, researchers, designers, and
manufacturers have all shown interest in the project."
</P>
<P>
The YRTGDC will soon invite bids for the purchase of
turbogenerators, in which a Russian power machinery imports and
exports company is lining up on the starting line, waiting for the
bidding, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu said China should absorb Russian's rich experience in the
manufacturing of large hydro-electrical turbogenerators.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, YRTGDC has sent several groups to
Russia's design and research institutes and power stations for
study purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1950s, China began co-operation with former
Soviet Union on a feasibility study of the Three Gorges
Project. In July of 1955, a group of Soviet experts toured the
Three Gorges area, exploring the possible siting of the project,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China broke ground today when work
started on the building of the Jingbian Natural Gas Purifying
Plant.
</P>
<P>
It marks the beginning of the development of the country's
largest complete-set gas field.
</P>
<P>
The gas purifying plant, the largest of its kind in the
country, will have an annual processing capacity of 1.5 billion
cubic metres by 1997.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, located in the central Shanganning Basin in
northwest China, has proven reserves totalling 230 billion cu m,
accounting for one tenth of the country's prospective natural gas
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Gas pumped from the field will be transported through pipelines
to Beijing, Xi'an, Yinchuan and other cities.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage of the development, China expects the gas
field to double its annual production capacity to three billion cu
m. Total investment in the project is estimated at 10 billion yuan
(about 1.2 billion US dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has imposed uniform
standards for charging credit card fees.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, 1997, the fees will be raised from the current
level of no more than 0.7 percent, to less than two percent of the
transaction in the retail sector dominated by state-own department
stores.
</P>
<P>
The standards stipulate that from now on, foreign-funded retail
stores, including licensed shops, restaurants and hotels, beauty
parlors, photographic studios for wedding pictures, and shops
selling art and crafts, the fees will be not less than three
percent of the sales.
</P>
<P>
Gold shops, catering and places of recreation, railways and
civil aviation, ordinary photo studios and barbershops will also
levy somewhat higher fees on credit card users.
</P>
<P>
"The news standards are aimed at cracking down on unfair
competition and promoting the healthy development of credit card
business," explained an official with the local branch of the

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav FM: Ties With Belgium Face Good Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is on the way to fully
normalize relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic said today following
talks with his Belgian counterpart, Eric Derycke.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic told reporters that the talks had been "very good"
and presented an opportunity for a wide exchange of views about
all major issues of common interest between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed the speedy promotion of bilateral relations,
the implementation of the peace process in the territory of the
former Yugoslavia and the application of the basic agreement on
the Srem-Baranja region" which is in the northeastern part of
Croatia, he added. Belgium has sent troops to Srem-Baranja, or
Eastern Slavonia, to enforce peace in this mainly Serb populated
area.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister said his country hoped that
Belgium would support Yugoslavia in its efforts to reintegrate
itself into the international community and its institutions.
</P>
<P>
"We specially exchanged views on relations between Yugoslavia
and the European Union and expressed the hope that Belgium would
support the revival of Yugoslavia's previous relations and
cooperation with the European Union," he added.
</P>
<P>
Derycke, who arrived here Wednesday for a two-day official
visit to Yugoslavia, told the press today that his visit to
Belgrade was "very important" and his country was interested in
improving relations with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He praised the improved relations between Yugoslavia and
Croatia and explained that Belgium continued to believe that it
was necessary to be objective and treat all sides equally in
solving the former Yugoslavia crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav
Prime Minister Radoje Kontic held separate talks with Derycke
today.
</P>
<P>
The meetings had focused on the issues concerning the upgrading
of the Yugoslav-Belgian relations and the political situation in
the region, Tanjug said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb commander
said today the three armies in Bosnia complied with the military
aspect of the Dayton agreement and the D-120 deadline was met.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the first Krajina Corps of the Serb Army Gen.
Momir Talic made the announcement following a meeting between
military representatives of the three parties -- Serbs, Croats and
Muslims -- and the commander of the IFOR (Implementation Force)
Sector Southwest, British General Mike Jackson, in Kupres in
southwestern Bosnia, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
"The army has complied with all provisions of the accord and
did not create any problems," Talic said in a statement to the
press, adding that all sides must now turn to peace and continue
implementing the accord.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the compliance with the military provisions of
the Dayton accord expires at midnight today, 120 days after the
peace implementation started in Bosnia. Under the peace accords,
the troops of both Bosnian entities -- the Muslim-Croat federation
and Republika Srpska -- must return to barracks and their weapons
be put under IFOR control before the deadline expires.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, which focused on an analysis of activities in
the four months of implementation of the Dayton accord, was also
attended by Muslim army commanders Generals Sakub Mahmuljin and
Atif Dudakovic, and by commanders of the Croat Defense Council
Brigadier Drago Dragicevic and General Zeljko Glasnovic, Tanjug

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
condemned an explosion reportedly linked to the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) in London earlier in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The blast ripped through an empty apartment in a fashionable
neighborhood in the British capital. No injuries were reported in
the explosion. The Scotland Yard said that the IRA issued a coded
warning just minutes before the bomb went off in the Kinsington
area of West London.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, who traveling with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Russia, said in a statement that "those
who seek to derail the search for peace must not be allowed to
succeed."
</P>
<P>
"There can be no excuse for violence, endangering lives and
destroying property," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth blast linked to the IRA since it resumed
its terror campaign in February to end British rule in Northern
Ireland.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Perry: US to Launch Destructive Attacks Against Enemy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry today warned that the United States would launch devastating
destructive attacks against any nation that would use weapons of
mass destruction to strike the United States or its allies.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief issued warning one day after Libyan leader
Moammer Gadhafi denied Wednesday that his nation was building the
world's largest underground chemical weapons plant beneath a
mountain at Tarhunah, some 40 miles southeast of Tripoli, as
alleged by the U.S. intelligence and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader said that the U.S. allegations were a lie
which Libya is "ready to prove."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting at the Georgetown University in
Washington, Perry said that attacks with chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons would bring a severe response from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who considers using a weapon of mass destruction
against the United States or its allies must first consider the
consequences," the Pentagon chief said. "We would not specify in
advance what our response would be, but it would be both
overwhelming and devastating."
</P>
<P>
Perry reiterated that he believed Libya was building an
underground chemical plant, "and therefor we are prepared to take
preventive measures to keep Libya from posing a threat to peace
and stability" in the region.

<P>
NICOSIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides today expressed "shock" over the cold-blooded murder of
Greek tourists by suspected militants in a hotel in the Egyptian
capital city of Cairo this morning .
</P>
<P>
In a message to Greek Premier Costas Simitis, President
Clerides said the people and government of Cyprus were shocked to
hear of the murderous attack.
</P>
<P>
"We feel as if we have lost our own people," he added,
referring to today's massacre of 18 tourists, mostly Greeks, near
the Pyramids in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Twelve other members of the Greek group and an Egyptian were
injured during the attack by four gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president expressed "deep sorrow and sympathy" to
Simitis, the government and the people of Greece and especially to
the relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Today's massacre in Cairo was the most serious incident of
violence in Egypt in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Violence has plagued Egypt since 1992 when the country's
Islamic militants launched a campaign trying to unseat the
incumbent secular government and replace it with more strict
Islamic rule. More than 900 people have been killed in the
violence, mostly police and militants.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Yugoslavia Returning to International Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- With more and more countries
granting Yugoslavia diplomatic recognition these days, Belgrade is
striding to the international community which has shunned it over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Germany resumed full diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia Wednesday
by agreeing to promote its charge d'affaires in Belgrade to the
rank of ambassador. "With recognition by Germany and other
European Union countries, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
come a step nearer to the international community," German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic has recently announced his
country was "on the way to a complete return into the
international community and its institutions" as its sovereignty
and state-legal continuity of the former Yugoslavia "are no longer
disputable."
</P>
<P>
"Announcements on normalization of relations with Yugoslavia
are coming every day from the European Union and countries from
other continents," the president said proudly in an interview with
local pressmen early this week. There are already 17 ambassadors
in Belgrade and more are expected to come in the near future, he
added.
</P>
<P>
France sent its ambassador to Belgrade in February, becoming
the first Western country to recognize rump Yugoslavia. On April
8, Yugoslavia made a diplomatic breakthrough by making mutual
recognition with Macedonia, an ex-Yugoslav republic which gained
independence in 1991. Establishment of relations between the two
Balkan states was a precondition for Yugoslavia to be recognized
by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Since then, several EU countries announced normalization of
relations with Yugoslavia one after another, which include
Britain, Austria, Sweden and Norway.
</P>
<P>
"This is proof that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with
its determined seeking of peace, cooperation and dialogue, has
been fully affirmed as the key factor of peace and stability in
the Balkans," a local analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Many Western countries have already recognized the four former
Yugoslav republics that declared independence when the federation
disintegrated in 1991. But they failed to recognize the rump
Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and Montenegro, as a continuation
of the former Yugoslav federation of six republics.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was further shunned by the international community
in May 1992 when a comprehensive U.N. sanction was imposed against
Belgrade for its alleged involvement in the civil war in
neighboring Bosnia, plunging it into a deep isolation.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade did not break its seclusion until late last year when
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic struck a peace agreement with
his former enemies -- leaders of Croatia and the Bosnian Muslim
government -- on ending the bloody war in Bosnia. The
international sanctions were suspended one day after the Dayton
accords were reached on November 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, not only political officials
but also businessmen from all over the world have started coming
into Yugoslavia, wishing to restore relations and do business with
this Balkan state which badly needs investment and export to
revive its economy devastated by the three and half year
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of ambassadors in Belgrade, it should be
expected that some steps by certain members of the international
community, which reflect the policy of "double standards," will
become a thing of the past, Yugoslav officials have said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still some distance before Yugoslavia can be
fully reintegrated into the international community. Many key
international bodies, including the United Nations, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are yet to admit
Yugoslavia as their official member.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Yugoslav government and the IMF reached
nowhere early this month although Belgrade, as Deputy Prime
Minister Svetozar Krstic said recently, "wanted to urgently
reestablish relations with the IMF in order to get the money
desperately needed for our economy's insolvency." A new round of
talks will start soon, announced government officials.
</P>
<P>
Another effort Belgrade has to make is to realize normalization
of relations with the rest three ex-Yugoslav republics -- Croatia,
Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia has already expressed its readiness to establish
diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia. The relationship with Croatia has
also improved after Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic
made a working visit to Zagreb last month and signed a number of
agreements with his Croatian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
But mutual recognition by the two countries was impossible
unless the disputed Prevlaka Peninsula on the Yugoslav-Croatian
border was solved, as stressed repeatedly by Belgrade officials.
</P>
<P>
"Full normalization of relations with former Yugoslav republics
is an essential precondition for consolidating the peace process"
in the region, said Yugoslav President Lilic this week.
</P>
<P>
Although there are some difficulties on the way, there is no
doubt, however, that the return of Yugoslavia to the United
Nations and its bodies will soon be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Belgrade's role in the regional peace process is getting more
and more important, so the trend of reintegration into the world
is irreversible," Yugoslav officials said.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Borrowing Exceeds Forecast by 3 Bln Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's government borrowing in
the financial year that just finished overshot Treasury
projections by well over 3 billion pounds (4.6 billion U.S.
dollars), BBC TV reported today.
</P>
<P>
The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) for the year to
March came to 32.2 billion pounds (47 billion dollars), which
compares with the government's own official forecast of 29 billion
pounds (44 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Borrowing rose steeply in March, as was expected, taking the
PSBR for the month to 9.6 million pounds (14.6 million dollars),
after 2.9 million pounds (4.4 million dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
The 3.2 billion pound overshoot of the Treasury's 1995-1996
PSBR forecast is bound to limit the scope for pre-election tax
cuts, economists say.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the PSBR is unlikely to fall noticeably in
the coming financial year, limiting the scope for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury is forecasting a deficit of 22.5 billion pounds
(34.2 billion dollars) in 1996-1997, implying a 10 billion pound
(15.2 billion dollar) improvement.
</P>
<P>
But economists say that under normal circumstances, this will
severely limit ability to cut taxes.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Official Holds Talks with EU Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Assistant Foreign Minister
Adnan Omran held talks here today with a European Union (EU)
delegation led by Italian Foreign Undersecretary Lodvikory Kamrana.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman, the talks
between the two sides focussed on the peace process and the
European Union's role in supporting the current efforts for the
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and
425.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the grave developments in south
Lebanon as a result of the incessant Israeli aggression against
Lebanese villages and towns, and the strengthening of cooperation
between Syria and the EU in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian spokesman said that the talks were constructive.
Syria had expressed its views on the establishment of a
comprehensive and just peace, the immediate termination of
repeated Israeli aggressions against Lebanese people, and the
provision of assistance for the Lebanese government in order to
cope with the consequences of the Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
Omran and the EU delegation also discussed acts and measures
undertaken by Israel with a view to obstructing the peace process
and to evading the execution of international legitimacy
resolutions, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian assistant foreign minister stressed the importance
of the European Union in the peace process and in future
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized that the EU member states should
intensify their efforts to put an end to the Israeli aggressions
as soon as possible, and to actively help in implementing
international legitimacy resolutions and in the success of the
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the EU delegation expressed its
profound appreciation for Syria's constructive role in seeking a
ceasefire in Lebanon and for Syria's serious approach to the
resumption of the peace process.

JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The re-allocation of
various reconstruction and development program (RDP) projects to
various ministries and state departments in South Africa has been
finalized by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Mbeki's adviser Frank

basic services, such as clinics, housing and water, which were
already performed by particular ministries, the South African

</P>
<P>
Nor would they disrupt the relocated program and projects as
''we have been very careful to ensure no destabilization''.
</P>
<P>
Chikane reiterated that President Nelson Mandela's closure of
the RDP office in a major cabinet reshuffle on March 28 was not
the end of the government's flagship RDP.
</P>
<P>
To this end, RDP staff would duly be transferred along with
the particular program or projects to the relevant departments.

WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
condemned an explosion reportedly linked to the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) in London earlier in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The blast ripped through an empty apartment in a fashionable
neighborhood in the British capital. No injuries were reported in
the explosion. The Scotland Yard said that the IRA issued a coded
warning just minutes before the bomb went off in the Kinsington
area of West London.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, who traveling with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Russia, said in a statement that "those
who seek to derail the search for peace must not be allowed to
succeed."
</P>
<P>
"There can be no excuse for violence, endangering lives and
destroying property," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth blast linked to the IRA since it resumed
its terror campaign in February to end British rule in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The British government has stated that Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, would not be allowed to participate in the
all-party political talks aimed at a peaceful settlement of the
Northern Ireland problem unless the IRA declared an ending to
its terror actions.

<HEADLINE> Arab States Press UN to Condemn Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Diplomats from Arab states
have pressed the United Nations Security Council to adopt a
resolution to condemn Israeli attacks against Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution put forward by Algeria, Egypt, Kuwait,
Lebanon and 16 other states, which is available here today,
strongly condemns the Israeli aggression against Lebanon which has
brought about high tolls of civilian casualties and led to the
displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians and a massive
destruction of Lebanon's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution to be discussed by the Security Council
today also condemns the bombardment of the archaeological and
cultural sites and monuments in the city of Tyre which is
internationally protected.
</P>
<P>
It calls on Israel immediately to cease its military action
against the Lebanese territorial integrity and withdraw forthwith
its forces from all Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for respect for the territorial integrity,
sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its
internationally recognized boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces invaded south Lebanon in March 1978 in an
attempt to drive out Palestinian guerrillas and have occupied the
area since. Israel has launched a new round of retaliatory attacks
against the Hizbollah (the Party of God) guerrillas from April 11.
The shellings from Israeli forces have resulted in hundreds of
civilian casualties, including deaths of children in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, a certain big country, presumably the United States,
is opposed to adopting the draft resolution prepared by the Arab
states, according to diplomats here.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Arrives in Iraq to Assess Iraqi Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission on Disarming Iraq (UNSCOM), arrived here today
on a short visit for talks with Iraqi officials on Baghdad's
weapon programs.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi official media said that Ekeus is expected to discuss
relations between Iraq and the U.N. with Iraqi Minister of Oil
Amir Mohammed Rashid, also ex-chairman of Iraq's Military Industry
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus' visit, the first since the beginning of this year,
follows a bi-annual report he submitted earlier this year to the
U.N. Security Council, in which he said there are still "serious
gaps" in the information Iraq has provided on its past missile,
chemical and biological weapon programs.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Ekeus' visit is important because it
coincides with the ongoing talks held in New York between Iraq and
U.N. on an oil-for-food deal under U.N. resolution 986 adopted
last April, which offered to allow Iraq to sell 1 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every 90 days to buy food and medicine
for its people, who have been suffering under the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus' assessment of Iraq's weapon programs is crucial for the
U.N. to decide whether to ease or lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. resolution 687, Iraq must meet the conditions
provided by the resolution to dismantle all its weapons of mass
destruction before the sanctions can be lifted.

Lebanon, U.S. officials said here today.
</P>

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that U.S. Special Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross is
expected to leave for Mideast nations shortly for talks with
leaders of the governments concerned in the region.
</P>

The officials said that the latest attacks by Israeli warplanes
earlier in the day on a U.N. base had greatly altered the dynamics
of the crisis and were forcing them to consider new peace
initiatives for the settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli shells slammed into a base of the Fijian contingent of
the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon which was crowded with refugees
near the southern village of Qana.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said in Beirut earlier
that some 68 people were killed and 120 others wounded in the

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty among local and
foreign investors about the stability of the South African labor
market was the major cause for the weakening of the local
currency Rand.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the National Party (NP) said today a fear of
the change of government policy after the recent cabinet
reshuffle, speculation about the abolition of exchange control
and political instability were among other contributing factors.

"There is rising uncertainty about South Africa's political
stability if the latest development in the constitution-making
processes is taken into consideration," said an NP statement.

Rand, which had been on the decline since mid-February, hit an

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government expressed
"grave concern" today over an Israeli shelling which killed 100
people taking shelter in a U.N. base in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said the shelling
showed there was an urgent need for an end to the violence in the
region, according to a British Foreign Office statement.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign secretary said he was gravely concerned by reports
of Israeli attacks on the headquarters of the Fijian Battalion of
United Nations peacekeeping troops in south Lebanon," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The latest incident demonstrated the urgent need for violence
in the region to be brought to an end," the statement quoted
Rifkind as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the base was holding some 500 Lebanese
refugees who had fled their homes in south Lebanon after Israel
started a huge air and artillery attack last week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament earlier today, British Deputy Prime
Minister Michael Heseltine described the shelling attack as an
"appalling tragedy."
</P>
<P>
"It indicates just how fragile peace processes are and how
innocent the victims can often be," Heseltine said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that "the British government will do all that
it possibly can to play any part in accelerating the processes of
peace and restoration of a cease-fire."

</P>
<P>
Davies said the military equipment was ordered by Pakistan
prior to the U.S. imposition of the Pressler amendment, which
sanctioned Pakistan from receiving U.S. military aid and weaponry
until it pledged to halt nuclear weapons development programs.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the deal would include three P-3C Orion naval
patrol aircraft designed for anti-submarine warfare, Harpoon
missiles, howitzers, rockets and rocket launchers, as well as
various spare parts to service the equipment.
</P>
<P>
But the release would not include 28 F-16 Fighting Falcon
fighter jets. Pakistan paid 650 million dollars for the aircraft
in late 1980s but never received them due to the imposition of the
Pressler amendment.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been urging the U.S. government to deliver the jet
fighters.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the release "involves only equipment that Pakistan
purchased prior to Oct. 1, 1990. It does not include any new
sales."
</P>
<P>
"This release does not constitute the resumption of any kind of
a U.S. military supply relationship with Pakistan," the spokesman
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today criticized the United States for
spreading allegations that Pyongyang poses a "missile threat".
</P>
<P>
The Rodong Sinmun, mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party of
Korea, said in a signed article that it was natural for the DPRK
to strengthen national defense in the face of the large numbers of
missiles and nuclear weapons that the U.S. had deployed along the
South Korean border.
</P>
<P>
It was the U.S., not the DPRK, which posed a missile threat,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
It said that recently, the U.S. and South Korea have repeatedly
highlighted developments in missile research in the DPRK, and
South Korean President Kim Young-sam had asked the U.S. to help
limit the manufacture and sale of missiles by the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the DPRK will not allow the U.S. to play
the role of "international judge" or "global policeman".
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the DPRK and the U.S. are expected
to hold missile talks on April 19-20 in Berlin, Germany.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier on Education, Chain-stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- More support should be given to
vocational education as well as chain-stores designed for workers,
said Vice Premier Li Lanqing during an inspection tour in central
China's Henan and east China's Anhui provinces.
</P>
<P>
Li said that developing vocational education is an effective
way to improve the overall quality for people, and to train them
with practical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
China encourages vocational education while popularizing
nine-year compulsory education and developing higher education,
commented Li.
</P>
<P>
The main task of most colleges and universities across the
country should be training four-year students or professionals
that are badly needed. While only a minority of them can devote
their efforts to both scientific research and teaching, most of
them should do some research in application of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Li was speaking at a meeting with heads of 16 colleges and
universities based in Hefei, capital city of Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier praised trade unions in Henan Province for
opening chain-stores selling daily necessities at preferential
prices to workers, especially those in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Li encouraged trade unions to perfect the system combining
modern commercial chain-store management with providing aid to
workers.
</P>
<P>
He said that China would have more chain-stores which provide
convenience to people, and limit the construction of large
top-grade department stores.

<HEADLINE> Seven COMESA Countries Reduce Tariff Remarkably </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 18 (Xinhua)-- Secretary General of the Common
Market for Eastern and Soutehrn Africa (COMESA) Bingu Mutharika
revealed today that seven COMESA member states have reduced
tariff by 60 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA chief made the revelation at the opening of the
COMESA Second Meeting of the Council of Ministers in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Mutharika said he was satisfied with the response of the
member states to reduce tariff barriers in the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged the member states to strengthen COMESA to make it a
dynamic institution for regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was the duty of African countries to solve their economic
problems because most of them were made by themselves, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he described the call to split COMESA into two as
uncalled for and malicious.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some southern African countries have
suggested that COMESA, too large for its size, should be split
into northern and soutern groups.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, grouping 23 states in the region, was born out of the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) in
1994. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Tories' Popularity Slipping: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The popularity of Britain's ruling
Conservatives is falling further, according to an ICM poll for the
Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poll shows that the opposition Labour's rating
has leapt to its highest level in nearly one year.
</P>
<P>
In the latest Guardian/ICM monthly adjusted survey, Labour is
on 50 percent (up 5 points compared with March), with the
Conservatives 29 percent (down 2 points), and Liberal Democrats 17
percent (down 3). Labour's lead over the Conservatives has
increased by 7 points in a month, from 14 percent in March to 21
percent now.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows a particularly sharp swing from the
Conservatives to Labour among women voters, 7.5 percent, as
compared with 2.5 percent swing among men.
</P>
<P>
The poll finds that the swing also reflects a bad month for the
Tory government, dominated by the mad cow crisis.
</P>
<P>
ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,200 adults aged 18 and
over by telephone across Britain over April 12-13.

<HEADLINE> China Urges End to Confrontation on Human Rights Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China today called for an end to
political confrontation and for dialogue and cooperation on an
equal footing, so as to promote human rights.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianmin made the appeal at the 52nd
session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which
began here on March 18 and will end on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Wu voiced concern about the South-North confrontation in the
commission that replaced the East-West confrontation after the
Cold War, saying it could only lead the work of the commission to
a dead end.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some countries for persisting in double-standard,
selectivity and political confrontation in the work of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
It could be seen from the political confrontation in the
commission, Wu said, adding that the South was made victim to the
confrontation that was imposed by the North.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, we do not favor country resolutions," said Wu,
who meanwhile called for caution and a spirit of consensus on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, he said, under the item of country resolutions, 67
countries have been put in the dock, almost all of them developing
countries, while the superpower and other developed countries
played the judges.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "This tendency has developed to such an extent that
it can no longer be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
All peoples have the right to choose their own social system or
development code, which is in accordance with the two Covenants on
human rights, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental principle of human rights is equality and
mutual respect while the core of democracy is the tolerance of
different views, the ambassador pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Labor Official Outlines New Social Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to establish a social
security system which can meet the needs of socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The system will be adaptable to workers in various economic
sectors in the country by the end of the century, a senior Chinese
official disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianlun, vice-minister of Labor, made the remark at a
national working conference on a social security system in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995) period funds had been set up to cover the basic
pension insurance of a total of 87 million employees, and 22
million retired workers.
</P>
<P>
Reform items in China's social security system have extended
from pension and unemployment to medicare, industrial injury and
child-bearing during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister pointed out, "The establishment of a social
security system, as one of the major tasks in China's reform of
economic structure, has a great impact on the country's overall
economic development."
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that by the end of the century the coverage of
basic pension insurance in China will be extended to retirees of
various enterprises in townships, and gradually to private
enterprise owners and self-employed workers, and the cost will be
jointly shouldered by the state, the individual and the
collectives individuals work for.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle of easing the burden on
enterprises and economizing medical resources, a medicare
insurance system, which combines mutual assistance funds with
individual accounts, will basically come into being by the year of
2000.

ISLAMABAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Robin Raphel held talks
here today with Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar on
drugs control and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Raphel praised Pakistan's efforts against terrorism, poppy
cultivation and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
She lauded Pakistan's cooperation in efforts against
trans-national crimes, particularly in extradition and exchange of
information.
</P>
<P>
Babar said Pakistan was going all out to eliminate the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said some districts in North West Frontier Province, the
main poppy growing area in Pakistan, had been totally cleared of
poppy cultivation and heroin manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
However, he indicated that because of a "porous border," opium
was coming in from Afghanistan and precursor chemicals of heroin
were smuggled from other countries, which has compounded the
difficulties to fight against narcotics.
</P>

Raphel arrived here Wednesday on a five-day visit to Pakistan.
She held talks with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Russian Official Criticizes Regional Chief Over Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Panov today denounced the leader of the Russian Maritime
territory for his opposition to the demarcation of the
Russian-Chinese border.
</P>
<P>
Panov said at a news conference that the attempt by the
regional leader was aimed at disrupting the Russian relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
"It is very dangerous," said the foreign ministry official, who
believed that the bilateral relationship would be broken if the
1991 Soviet-Chinese border agreement was renounced.
</P>
<P>
Panov said that the foreign ministry is prepared to cooperate
with other government departments to implement President Boris
Yeltsin's instruction to step up the demarcation work.
</P>
<P>
On April 11, the Russian president denied a statement by his
Maritime territory governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko about a possible
suspension of demarcation over a disputed section of the
Russian-Chinese border.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin signed a decree instead that day to speed up the
demarcation work.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China share a 4,300-kilometer-long border. An
agreement on the western section of the border took effect in 1995
while another agreement on the eastern section has been in effect
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
But demarcation is still in progress over a 61-kilometer-long
boundary river.
</P>
<P>
Late in February, Yeltsin ordered Russian officials to finish
the demarcation in strict conformity with the 1991 agreement
between the then Soviet Union and China on border issues.

JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Namibian
capital Windhoek are warned of a possible water shortage by the
end of the year, the South African Press Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Namibian assistant water services engineer Hannes Buckle told
reporters in Windhoek today that the city is facing a water
shortage rather than a crisis.

The Von Bach, Omatako and Swakoppoort dams serving central
Namibia are 14 percent full compared with 28 percent a year ago.

The situation was also worsened by the population growth in
the capital and severe droughts since independence in 1990.

<P>
Meanwhile, the city council said in a statement that the
municipality is to sink 10 boreholes and upgrade the Goreangab
Water Recycling Plant as a short-term measure.

<HEADLINE> PNC to Discuss Amending Palestinian Covenant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said today that the Palestinian
National Council (PNC) will convene in Gaza next week to discuss
amending the Palestinian Covenant which calls for the destruction
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, speaking to reporters after a meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres at the Erez Crossing between Israel
and the Gaza Strip, said that the Palestinians are committed to
the peace agreements signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to what have been agreed upon and what have
been signed," said Arafat, adding that the Palestinians are
determined to fulfill their commitment to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said he had outlined to Peres at their meeting the
continued efforts taken by the PNA to crack down on terrorist
groups operating inside the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres said after the meeting that Israel is
convinced that the PNA is making "genuine efforts" against
terrorists. The Palestinian police had stopped several attempts
to carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli targets, he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Peres said Israel will also fulfill its
commitment to the peace process, and confirmed that the talks on
final status of the West Bank will begin as scheduled on May 4, in
accordance with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between Peres and Arafat since the
wave of suicide bombing attacks in February and March, which
killed at least 60 people and wounded more than 150 others.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the suicide bombing attacks conducted by the
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Israel halted all
negotiations with the PNA, and has imposed a total closure on the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
However, no announcement was made following today's meeting on
easing the closure, which has barred tens of thousands of
Palestinian workers from returning to their jobs inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Another Key issue, whether Israel will redeploy from the West
Bank town of Hebron before the Knesset (Israel's parliament)
elections on May 29, was not mentioned either by the two leaders
at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel has postponed its withdrawal from Hebron, which was
scheduled to be completed on March 28, in accordance to the Oslo
accords, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Peres said that Israel would not pull back
from Hebron until the PNC changes the Palestinian Covenant, and
all heads of terrorist groups are caught.

UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today condemned "in the strongest possible
terms" Israeli shelling of the United Nations Interim Force in

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein today
condemned a terrorist act by suspected militants against foreign
tourists this morning in a hotel in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
In his phone call today to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
the king condemned such terrorist acts which "neither serve the
noble course nor secure human objectives."
</P>
<P>
The king underscored the need to coordinate efforts in the face
of all forms of terrorism and extremism which would harm relations
and values and threaten human security and stability.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, suspected extremists this morning attacked the Europa
hotel near the pyramids in Cairo with automatic rifles, killing 18
persons and wounding 13 others, most of them Greek tourists.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been fighting insurgency by militants since 1992 when
the country's Islamic militants launched a campaign trying to
unseat the incumbent secular government and replace it with more
strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, attacks have been largely confined to
southern Egypt. More than 900 people have been killed in the
violence, mostly policemen and militants.

<HEADLINE> Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Greek official said
here today the Greek government believes that an Israeli-Turkish
military agreement does not affect Cyprus' joint defense policy
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Georgios Romeos, who arrived here
for a three-day official visit, said upon his arrival that the
agreement is an issue which preoccupies both Greece and Cyprus
and will be discussed during his visit here.
</P>
<P>
However, the official noted that "according to our preliminary
assessments, this agreement (between Israel and Turkey) does not
affect the joint defense dogma" between Greece and Cyprus, which
was agreed on by the two governments in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Greek deputy minister said the two governments will tackle
any aspects of the Israeli-Turkish agreement which may affect the
two countries, after studying it in detail.
</P>
<P>
Romeos added that Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis had
a meeting Wednesday with the Israeli ambassador in Athens, with
whom he agreed that the Israeli-Turkish agreement does not affect
the dogma.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his visit here, Romeos said it is within the
framework of "the continuous and substantial cooperation between
the two governments."
</P>
<P>
He said his talks in Nicosia will focus on Cyprus' efforts to
join the European Union and the Greek government's help and
support in the pre-accession process.
</P>
<P>
Romeos said he will meet President Glafcos Clerides and
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides Friday to inform them on the
recent visit to the U.S. by Greek Premier Costas Simitis.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Warns Israel against Using Its Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides warned Israel today that his country will not allow the
use of its air space by Israeli military aircraft heading for
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the friendly relations between Cyprus and
Israel, upgraded in the past few years, would suffer a blow if
Cyprus' air space were to be used without authorization.
</P>
<P>
However, the president confirmed that Israeli military aircraft
did not violate Cyprus' air space in their recent flights to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides made these remarks in an interview with
Cyprus television tonight following press reports that Israeli
military aircraft had violated Cyprus flight information region
(FIR) a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
"We will not grant permission to any Israeli military aircraft
to fly from Cyprus to Turkey using Cyprus' air space," the
president said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he intends to address a letter to Israeli
Premier Shimon Peres outlining his views on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Israeli-Turkish military agreement is a cause for
concern, the president said that "it is a cause for concern, but
we will take preventive measures."
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to worry because the permission requested by
Israel was not granted and I am warning Israel that unauthorized
passage through our air space would cause a crisis in our
relations", the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides confirmed press reports that 14 Israeli military
fighters passed through Nicosia FIR and met with Turkish aircraft
outside Cyprus' air space. Seven of them returned to base, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president dismissed press reports that these aircraft hit
Lebanese targets during the recent air raids in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth in this report judging by the information
available to us. We believe these aircraft landed in Turkey," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said Cyprus did not know ahead of time that Israel was
going to strike a military deal with Turkey, adding that this is
natural because states do not usually inform about their intention
to form a military agreement with another country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cyprus' Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides and
Defense Minister Costas Eliades briefed today the House Defense
Committee on the recent flights by Israeli aircraft which have
dominated the headlines here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides explained that Cyprus has the responsibility for
air traffic control within Nicosia FIR, which does not belong to
the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Our sovereign air space has not been violated in the past few
days by Israeli aircraft," he said, but he added "air traffic
regulations of Nicosia FIR were infringed by an Israeli fighter
and we have made appropriate representations."
</P>
<P>
The Defense Minister said Israeli aircraft have been using
Cyprus' sovereign air space as well as Nicosia FIR after
permission.
</P>
<P>
"Things are somewhat different now because of the military
agreement between Israel and Turkey. We are preparing a
questionnaire for the Israeli government to establish if and how
this agreement affects Cyprus' defenses," the minister said.

LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A flotilla of British trawlers

protesting the European Common Fisheries policy.
</P>
<P>
The angry fishermen held up "Save British Fish" placards and
brandished plastic fish.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders claimed that the EU policy allowed boats from
other EU member states too much access to British waters and has
plunged Britain's fishing industry into crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen demanded that the EU's Common Fisheries policy
either be radically reformed or be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission warned today that fish stock within
the 15-state club can only be managed if there is Europe-wide
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The EC in a statement said The Common Fisheries policy should
be strengthened further.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has claimed 56 lives in
the Barclay Training Center (BTC), the largest barracks in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Thomas Doeway, spokesman for the armed forces of
Liberia, was quoted as saying, "150,000 people, including many
foreigners, are now 'refugees' in the camp, where they are
victims of bombardment by the factions of Charles Taylor and
Alhaji Kromah."
</P>
<P>
"The main problem to settle is that of the BTC," a western
diplomat said, announcing Wednesday's arrival of a delegation
from the ECOWAS, which first sent troops to Liberia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, residents of embattled Monrovia have
place hope in the negotiators to prevent further factional
fighting around the barracks.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in Monrovia on April 6 when Liberian police
tried to arrest Roovevelt Johnson, one of the faction leaders in
Liberia, on murder charges, on the orders of the Collective
Presidency formed under a peace accord aimed at ending the
conflict.

<HEADLINE> US Captures 20 Pct of Total UN Market, UNA Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- In 1994 the U.N. system
procured goods and services worth approximately 4 billion U.S.
dollars, making it one of the largest purchasing entities in the
world, said a procurement guidebook by the U.N. Association of the
United States of America (UNA) today.
</P>
<P>
Apparently to persuade the U.S. Congress to support the world
organization, the guidebook by the name of "How to Do Business
with the United Nations" pointed out that in 1994, U.S. companies
sold 750 million U.S. dollars worth of goods and services to the
United Nations, capturing 20 percent of the total U.N. market.
</P>
<P>
The UNA is one of the most outspoken voices in favor of the
United Nations. Recently it has launched various programs to seek
national support for the financially beleaguered United Nations,
which is owed 2.9 billion U.S. dollars by the member states. The
United States alone owes 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-dominated U.S. Congress has been withholding the
appropriations for the world organization, citing mismanagement,
overstaffing and low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
It also argued that the United States had been paying too much
and that it can pay no more than 20 percent of the U.N. regular
budget, which is now 25 percent.

JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Trade
Minister Yves Galland said here today that there would be "no
problem" for the free trade agreement between South Africa and
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Galland said difficulties rising from the proposed free trade
agreement talks were largely as "a result of misunderstanding",
saying "about 95 percent" of the contents had been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
But he gave no indication as to whether the EU planned to
soften its stance on import duties imposed on South African
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The French minister, accompanied by a delegation of about 30
French industrial representatives, arrived in South Africa on
Wednesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the European Research
Office, the EU had proposed that South Africa eliminate duties on
about 35 percent of EU imports while the EU eliminate duties on
four and seven percent of South African imports.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of the EU duties would be in four phases over
10 years and cover only about 50 percent of all imports from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was urged to eliminate its duties in two phases
over 10 years on 95 percent of its agricultural imports from the
EU.

<HEADLINE> US House of Representatives Approves Anti-Terrorism Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today voted 293-133 to approve the long-awaited
anti-terrorism bill, sending it to the White House for President
Bill Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
The vote ends a full year of congressional debates on the
bill's many provisions.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the compromise bill by an overwhelming
majority Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had called for a comprehensive anti-terrorism bill in
the wake of the terrorist bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City last April 19, that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
The bill withstood many changes in the House Judiciary
Committee and during initial debate on the House floor, until
members of the House and Senate managed a conference report.
</P>
<P>
The original House bill, passed last month, had dropped many of
the Senate's anti-terrorism provisions because of lawmakers'
concerns about expanding federal law enforcement powers. Some of
those provisions were restored in the compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
The legislation provides new limits on federal appeals by death
row inmates and other prisoners. It also provides additional
federal death penalties in certain international terrorism cases
and for killing a federal employee or former employee because of
that person's work.
</P>
<P>
The bill "has some very effective tools that we can use in our
efforts to combat terrorism," Attorney General Janet Reno said
today
</P>
<P>
The compromise bill, however, lacks many provisions that the
White House had sought.
</P>
<P>
The bill, officially known as the Effective Death Penalty and
Public Safety Act of 1996, allocates 1 billion dollars over four
years for federal anti-terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
It also outlines procedures to expedite the deportation of
foreign terrorists; outlaws fund-raising by groups identified as
terrorist organizations; increases penalties for terrorist acts;
and requires mandatory victim restitution.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is considered likely to sign the bill, but White House
aides said today that a signing ceremony will not be scheduled
until the president returns from his trip overseas.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Bombardment Kills 94 Civilians in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 94 Lebanese civilians
were killed and 95 others wounded in an Israeli bombardment in
south Lebanon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warships fired artillery at a military center of the
multi-national peacekeeping forces' Fiji contingent near Kana,
where hundreds of Lebanese civilians, who had been forced to leave
their homes by the Israeli aggressions, were seeking
refuge. Besides the Lebanese civilians, two Fijian soldiers died
and 10 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri ordered all hospitals
to be prepared to give treatment to the wounded. He appealed to
hold an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss today's
Israeli bombardment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he would send
a senior U.N. official to Lebanon to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Command of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon appealed
to all rescue agents and ambulances to rush to the scene
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Today is the eighth successive day of the Israeli raids on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched its Operation Grapes of Wrath against Shiite
Moslem group Hezbollah guerrillas on April 11, designed to
retaliate against Hezbollah's stepped up Katyusha rocket attacks
on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have vowed to carry on the resistance as long as
Israelis continue to occupy Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
On the highway between Sidon to Sour, Xinhua correspondents saw
a convoy of seven ambulances rushing from south to north, carrying
the wounded. Few vehicles were going southward.
</P>
<P>
At the town of Mazraat Akbiye, some 10 kilometers south of
Sidon, only one shop was open this afternoon. Mahmoud Mukeeir, 52,
the shop-owner, told Xinhua that most of the residents in this
small town have been evacuated. But his six-member family decided
to remain in the small town.
</P>
<P>
"I stay because this is my homeland. All my property is here,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tension shrouded the city of Sour, some 60 kilometers south of
Beirut, as a result of Israeli bombardment. So far, more than
80.000 of the town's 100,000 residents have left their homes. It
became a deserted city this afternoon, and only patrolling soldiers
and few people could be seen on the street.
</P>
<P>
At Bachour Hospital in southern Sour, Anthoine Halaj, a doctor,
told Xinhua that eight victims of this afternoon's Israeli
bombardment had been rushed to this hospital. But as this hospital
lacks adequate equipment, they were later transferred to hospitals
in Sidon, he said.
</P>
<P>
At Jadel Ameh Hospital in Sour's town center, Ahmad Murwann,
the hospital director, told Xinhua that his hospital received 49
patients wounded in this afternoon's Israeli
bombardment. Some 60 dead persons were also sent to this hospital.
</P>
<P>
He added that 18 of the wounded had been transferred to
hospitals in Sidon and Beirut as his hospital had not enough beds.
</P>
<P>
Ali Haider, a two-year-old boy, was the youngest of the victims
hospitalized in Jadel Ameh Hospital. He became blind after the
Israeli bombardment. The little boy was the only survivor of his
10-member family, with nine others all killed by the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The town of Sour is now in complete darkness, with electricity
having been cut off.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Syria, Lebanon Intensify Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Lebanon have
intensified their contacts over the past few days to bring about
a ceasefire in Lebanon as soon as possible, while Israel is
escalating its attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri is having a series
of contacts with the Syrian leadership which began this morning
with a meeting with Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and
several top Syrian officials with the object of effecting a
ceasefire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It is learned from diplomatic sources in Damascus that Hariri
briefed the Syrian officials on the outcome of his visits and
talks in London, Saudi Arabia, Paris, Rabat and Cairo, and the
Syrian side informed him about Syria's contacts with the
U.S. Administration and other European and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources point out that the two sides have focussed their
discussion on the American and French proposals on ceasefire in
Lebanon. While Syria and Lebanon have reservations on the American
proposal, they do support the French approach which is based on
the July 1993 declaration of understanding.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the French initiative refers to U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, whereas, the American initiative supports Israel
in reaping the fruits of its current aggressions and disregards
the U.N. Security Council resolution on Israel's withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the American initiative is exercising pressure on
Hezbollah (Party of God) by way of proposing a freeze of
Hezbollah's military activities and its disarming, and,
ultimately, placing the whole region under international
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the U.S. proposal does not subscribe to a
simultaneous ceasefire by the two sides, calling for an end to
Hezbollah attacks first. Both the U.S. Administration and Israel
are demanding guarantees from Syria on the grounds that it is a
party to the current events, and are exercising every possible
pressure on the Islamic resistance.
</P>
<P>
Syria, on the other hand, supports adherence to the July 1993
understanding, and opposes any privileges to Israel as a result of
its ongoing military attacks against south Lebanon and Beirut's
southern suburbs, leaving some 150 Lebanese people, most of them
civilians, killed and about half a million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
On its part, France is seeking a sort of balance by its
proposal. Thus, Israel maintains reservations on the French
initiative and demands coordination between France and the United
States, regardless of the great differences between the two
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Not only that the U.S. initiative is seeking to persuade the
Arab parties to observe unilateral truce and end resistance to the
Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, but also makes no reference
to Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese border strip.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the Arab side expressed reservations about the
U.S. initiative and showed support for the balanced French
initiative which upholds the interests of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that a compromise between the
U.S. and French initiatives, acceptable to all parties, might be
reached. The Arab side, the observers say, is keen that Israel
does not make political gains out of its recent aggression which
enjoys unqualified American support, politically and militarily,
while the U.N. Security Council is folded hands.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President To Visit Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano today arrived at Mbabane and began his 24-hour private
tour to neighboring Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
A report from Mozambique Information Agency (AIM) said
Chissano is to attend the birthday party of Swaziland's
28-year-old King Mswati III.
</P>
<P>
Observers are of the view that the two leaders are expected to
discuss the recent political and economic crisis in Swaziland
where a number of strikes and political demonstrations occurred
during the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders in the land-locked southern African
state have been demanding a change to a multi-party political
system which was abolished by former King Sobhusa II, father of
King Mswati III.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the change in political system was met with
strong opposition from the royal family.
