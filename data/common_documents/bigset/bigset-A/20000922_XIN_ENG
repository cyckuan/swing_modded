<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Coast Guards(PCG)
recovered 14 maunds of charas (cannabis resin) on Thursday near
Pasni at Mekran Coast in the southwestern part of the country, the
Associated Press of Pakistan reported from Karachi.
</P>
<P>
It was a follow-up operation after PCG troops seized 11 maunds
of charas in the same place on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Commandant of the Pasni Battalion of Coast Guards got
a tip about a gang of narcotics smugglers operating at
international level planning to smuggle out a huge quantity of
drugs from Mekran Coast through Shadi Kaur area near Pasni.
</P>
<P>
Consequently the Coast Guards alerted its radar unit/posts on
coastline to guard the suspected loading sites.
</P>
<P>
However, sensing the presence of Coast Guards in the area,the
smugglers abandoned the plan and disappeared. PCG troops then
combed the area and recovered 11 maunds of fine-quality charas
buried in sand dunes close to the reported loading site and
another 14 maunds from a nearby area.
</P>
<P>
PCG said there were reports about increased activities of
traffickers on Mekran Coast and the area is being used as a
transit for drugs for subsequent shipment to the international
drug market. The Coast Guards are endeavoring hard to break the
racket.

<HEADLINE> Criteria Relating to Territory Discussed During Cyprus Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said in New York Friday that some criteria
relating to territory were discussed during the ongoing U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus, which started last week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, Papapetrou said
things are likely to become more concrete in the next weeks or
months, when proposals are expected to be put forward on a map.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou was commenting on press reports that some 40
villages, now under Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus, will
be part of the Greek Cypriot administered area of a bizonal,
bicommunal federation, to emerge from the U.N.-sponsored talks.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no reference to any village at the talks and no
maps produced. We did discuss certain criteria," Papapetrou added.
</P>
<P>
He warned against any speculation on the content of the talks,
on which the U.N. has imposed a blackout, noting that there
would be concrete things in the next weeks or months, when
proposals on paper are expected to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been
held, with an aim to prepare the ground for substantive talks which
may lead to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of the talks, which is underway in New York,
continued Friday with separate meetings of U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Adviser for Cyprus Alvaro de Soto with President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Reports said there will be another meeting on Monday morning
between Clerides and de Soto and on Tuesday, when this round of
talks will wrap up, Clerides will meet with the U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Attend Regional Meeting on Sudanese Issue in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will take part in a
regional meeting in Uganda to discuss the Sudanese civil war,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that he will fly to Kampala on Tuesday for a two-day
visit, during which he will meet with his counterparts of Uganda,
Sudan and Libya to try to seek solutions to the 17-year civil war
in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the major rebel group
in southern Sudan, began armed insurgency in 1983 for greater
autonomy for the mostly animist and Christian south from the Arab-
Islamic government in Khartoum. Northern opposition political
parties joined the rebels in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A new round of peace talks between the Sudanese government and
the SPLA began Thursday in western Kenya under the auspices of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, grouping Eastern
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala meeting will offer an opportunity for the parties to
help realize national reconciliation in Sudan in a fresh effort,
Moussa was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Egypt's determination to carry on with an
initiative proposed jointly with Libya aimed at pushing forward the
peace process in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya launched the initiative in 1999, calling for
permanent ceasefire in Sudan and holding a peace conference
including representatives of the Sudanese government, northern
opposition groups and the SPLA to halt the civil war.

</P>
<P>
"Officials have confirmed that the fever has not reached the
UAE, but each department concerned will be launching a program to
make people aware and prevent the disease from spreading," said
Jassim Darwish, head of the UAE General Secretariat of
Municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The deadly fever, which has broken out in parts of Saudi Arabia,
has prompted the UAE Public Health Department to take action to
prevent the disease from reaching the country.
</P>
<P>
Darwish said that the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries will
be intensifying checks on live animals in quarantine, while the UAE
municipalities will ensure that slaughtered animals are safe for
human consumption."
</P>
<P>
"There will also be vaccination if it is found necessary for
public health," he added.
</P>
<P>
The disease has reportedly killed 16 people and hospitalized
others in Jizan province in southern Saudi Arabia, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the disease appear in the form of very high
fever, extensive blood diarrhoea and dysfunction of kidneys.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Concerned Over Indian Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government
Friday expressed concern over India's decision to withdraw its
troops from the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission (UNAMSIL) in the west
African country, reports reaching here from Freetown said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius
Spencer as saying that the withdrawal might bring negative impact
upon the country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
India's 3,000 strong contingent is the second largest unit in
the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, behind Nigeria's.
</P>
<P>
Indian authorities explained on Thursday that its soldiers need
a rotation, following nearly two years of service as military
observers and peacekeepers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government also noted that the decision had nothing
to do with the straining relations between the UNAMSIL's Indian
commander, Major General Vijay Jetley and the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has been openly criticizing the Indian
general of making mistakes due to unfamiliarity with the situation
and terrain in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Observers here described the proposed withdrawal as an ill
timed one, for the U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan has been
desperately looking for countries willing to contribute soldiers
and expand the troop to a size of 20,500 men.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also indicated earlier, according to another report,
that it did not want its troops to remain in Sierra Leone unless
at least one NATO country joined the force.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Trade Unions Call for End to Abused Casualization of Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions Friday called on the government to put an end to the
practice of casualization by some employers in a bid to protect
the rights of labors.
</P>
<P>
Japhet Moonde, acting president of the labor organization, said
in a statement published here that casualization system was abused
by a lot of employers who had been taking advantage of the high
unemployment rate and abject poverty situation in the country to
exploit the helpless workers mercilessly, said Moonde.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to take control of the situation and
kick off legislation against the inhumane practice.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government promised early this month to act soon
against employers, especially foreign ones, who casualized their
workers to avoid honoring certain working benefits.

<HEADLINE> Canada Calls for Early Entry Into Force of CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Treaty prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any
other nuclear explosion anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Four years after being opened for signature on September 24,
1996, the CTBT is still 14 ratifications short of the 44 required
for entry into force," said Axworthy in a release issued here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There was strong reaffirmation of the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) achieved at the NPT Review
Conference last spring. We must now move forward with enhanced
vigor on CTBT entry into force," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
To come into force, the CTBT must be ratified by 44 named
states possessing nuclear technology. To date, 160 countries have
signed the Treaty and 63 have ratified.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy announced that Canada is intensifying its diplomatic
efforts to persuade the 14 of the named states that have yet to
sign and or ratify the CTBT to do so. This initiative is being
taken in order to underline the importance of the treaty and urge
that the necessary steps be taken to achieve entry into force.
</P>
<P>
Canada has also proposed that planning begin for a second CTBT
Entry into Force Conference of ratified states and signatories.
Such a conference would consider measures to accelerate
ratification and facilitate early entry into force in accordance
with Article XIV of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The first such conference was held in Vienna in October 1999,
and Canada has urged that the second be convened in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Little Progress in Peace Process in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his report issued here Friday, Annan said, "I regret to
inform the Security Council that there has been little progress,
if any, in the implementation of the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement."
</P>
<P>
He said "the cease-fire has been consistently violated in the
intensified fighting between government and rebels" in the
northern Equateur province.
</P>
<P>
"The hostilities have not only imperiled the peace process, but
have also spilled over into the Republic of the Congo and the
Central African Republic," he said. "The two countries are
extremely worried about the negative impact of the conflict on
security, economic and humanitarian conditions and called for
international support to improve the situation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan said, "civilians continued to pay an
unacceptably high price for the conflict," he noted. "It is
extremely worrisome that intensive military confrontations have
hindered access by humanitarian agencies to many areas, including
the eastern part of the Republic of the Congo, leaving vulnerable
populations without much-needed assistance."
</P>
<P>
Also in the report, Annan recommended that the Security Council
consider extending the mandate of the U.N. mission in DRC, called
MONUC, for a period of two months.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.N. official, who asked not to be identified, told a
press conference here Friday that the situation is not ripe for
the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in the central African country,
formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council approved the deployment of 500 military
observers and 5,000 troops to protect them in February, but their
deployment has been delayed due to ongoing cease-fire violations
and the Kinshasa government's reported refusal to grant the U.N.
full freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
The DRC war pits the government troops against Tutsi-led rebels
backed by Rwanda and Uganda. The DRC government, headed by
President Laurent Kabila, is in turn supported by Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
All parties signed the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement last year,
but cease-fire violations have continued on all sides.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the efforts of the United Nations to assist
the parties in implementing the Lusaka Agreement have been
frustrated by persistent restrictions on the mission's freedom of
movement, lack of compliance with the provisions of the status-of-
forces agreement and opposition, until recently, to the deployment
of United Nations troops," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Depreciation of Euro Impairing Turkish Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- As euro, the common currency of
the European Union (EU), has lost one-third of its value against
the
U.S. dollar since its issue last year, Turkish economists worried
that the plunge will impair the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that a nominal exchange rate anchor, introduced by
the Turkish Central Bank this year, has worsened the impact of the
euro's free-fall on Turkey's trade, Turkish Daily News reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which has accepted Turkey's candidacy, is the country's
major trading partner and buys more than half of its total exports.
</P>
<P>
The experts argued that the composition of the foreign currency
basket which Turkey has pegged to its currency Turkish Lira is
crippling the country's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"The euro's weight in the foreign currency basket is less than
that of the dollar, which increases the negative impact," said
Faruk Selcuk, professor of economics at Ankara-based Bilkent
University.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to support the government's anti-inflation program, the
Turkish Central Bank targets a 20 percent Lira depreciation against
a foreign currency basket of one dollar and 0.77 euros this year.
</P>
<P>
Under a three-year loan package approved by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Turkey pledged to reduce its chronic inflation
and budget deficits, undertake a comprehensive privatization
program and reform agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce inflation to 20 percent in 2000,
10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002. The annual inflation
rate stood at 68.9 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The professor said, "It does not matter in which currency the
contracts are denominated. What matters is price differences
resulting from exchange rates between Turkey and the country that
buys its exports that are getting relatively more expensive due to
the euro's fall."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the value of Turkey's exports is going down along
with that of the euro, which widens the foreign trade deficit and
worsening the external accounts.
</P>
<P>
Professor Esfender Korkmaz of Istanbul University said, "The
drop of the exchange rate is limited to 20 percent, but inflation
is expected to reach 35 percent by the end of this year, distorting
Turkey's international trade. The euro's plunge is further hurting
Turkey's competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank plans to deviate from the pre-announced
exchange rate path by mid-2001 and then allow the Lira to
depreciate within a gradually widening band.
</P>
<P>
"Until then the risk of a crisis in the Turkish economy will
remain. The biggest financial crisis in Turkish history back in
1994 was caused by an over-appreciation of the Lira in 1993. The
same thing befell Mexico in 1995. The Southeast Asia crisis was
sparked by Thailand, which adopted a fixed exchange rate policy in
1997," Korkmaz said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that meddling with exchange and interest rates will
always bring the risk of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
It seems, however, that Turkish exporters have developed the
means to fight competitiveness losses arising from the euro's fall.
</P>
<P>
"Labor productivity has increased significantly in the first
half of this year, partly offsetting the competitiveness loss due
to Lira over-valuation," Selcuk said.
</P>
<P>
Korkmaz argued that Turkey could have offset the competitiveness
loss if it was not for the nominal anchor on exchange rates. "The
Central Bank could have intervened to stop the euro's fall in the
domestic market through a realistic exchange rate policy. But now
its hands are tied," he said.
</P>
<P>
Selcuk said, "Still, it is a mistake to allow the dollar to
have more weight in the currency basket. The Central Bank may be
considering the composition of Turkey's external debt when allowing
it, but foreign trade balances should matter more."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Cleric Underlines Need for Public Military Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A leading Iranian cleric here
on Friday stressed the need for public military training as a way
to guarantee the national defense capacity.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for public participation in military training,
as in the Islamic state all the people are duty bound to defend the
independence, territorial integrity of the country, said Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, substitute leader of the Tehran Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of worshippers, the former judiciary chief
also called on the government to provide the public with military
training chances, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi referred to the "Sacred Defense Week", which started
Thursday to mark the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1980-
1988 war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important objective followed in this week was
making the people acquainted with the fact that they should be
vigilant and alert against conspiracies of Iran's enemies.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the Islamic republic must be independent,
instead of depending on the United States, European countries or
other big powers.
</P>
<P>
The warning is clearly directed at the countries' reformers, who
have so far controlled the executive and legislative branches of
the government through general elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservative establishment has accused reformers of
violating Islamic principles and advocate "pro-American" reforms,
thus stepping up their efforts to crack down on the reformist
campaign, fostered by President Mohammad Khatami sine he took
office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Notable measures taken by the conservatives include the closure
in recent months of over 20 reformist newspapers and the
imprisonment
of a number of reformist activists.
</P>
<P>
The dominant power of the conservative lies in their control of
the judiciary and the military as well as strong backing from
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's largest bank, Is Bank, will start selling

reported Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
THY announced Thursday that every Visa and MasterCard user will

<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government plans to increase the value-
added tax (VAT) on autos with engine over 1,601 cc capacity to 40
percent from 25 percent, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at restraining demand for luxury cars as part
of the government's International Monetary Fund (IMF)-sponsored
disinflation program.
</P>
<P>
According to a Finance Ministry report, cars with over 1,600 cc
account for 17 percent of total car sales in Turkey. Of that, 3 to
5 percent comprises engines of 1,601-2,000 cc capacity.
</P>
<P>
The tax on cars with engines over 2,000 cc capacity will remain
at 40 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- As blackouts have sharply increased due to energy
shortage in Turkey in the last two years, Escort Energy company has
unveiled a new product to run electrical appliances in power
outages, reported Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new product called So-Watt enables TVs, computers and
cassette decks to work for one-and-a half hours after the power
goes out, said Escort Energy General Manager Birol Ozcelik at a
press conference in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
He believed that So-Watt will spread to all of Turkey's
metropolitan centers in a short time. "Football match and film
enjoyment won't be interrupted with So-Watt," he said.

RABAT -- French Ministry of Finance and Economy said it would
offer the French-owned and the jointly-owned enterprises for sale
in a tender in order to transfer 10 million U.S. dollars of its
debts owed by Morocco into investments in the north African
country.
</P>
<P>
The tender will be launched on September 25 in Paris and is the
first part of a French-Moroccan program worth 109 million U.S.
dollars, local press quoted the ministry on Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of the debts owed by Morocco to France and
valued at 3.5 billion U.S. dollars. The debts are categorized by
the Paris Club as bilateral debts that are allowed by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be transferred into local
investments within the ceiling of 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> 60 Former SLA Members Return to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- About 60 former Israel's ally
South Lebanon Army (SLA) members Friday returned to Lebanon from
Israel, Lebanon's National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeepers transported these people from their temporary
habitation in north Israel to the border gate of Naqoura in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Maronite bishop Houri Jerjes welcomed the returning and urged
those Lebanese refugees in Israel to come back.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is their mother and freedom. A person can not live
without freedom and Lebanese should not be refugees in other
countries," the bishop said.
</P>
<P>
Before Israel's withdrawal form south Lebanon on May 24, about
6,000 SLA members and their relatives crossed the border into
Israel as a result of fear of revenge from resistance groups.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 600 people have come back to Lebanon and were
facing the charge of "cooperation with enemy". Most SLA members
were punished with 1 or 2 years in prison except those who killed
resistance and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has called those seeking
asylum in Israel to come back and Lebanon will treat them justly.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that about 4,500 SLA refugees want to
return because of the harsh living standard in the Israeli villages
and little possibility of revenge.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Declares Ceasefire in the South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government
declared a two-week cease fire in the southern battlefields as from
Thursday midnight, Minister of Information and Culture Ghazi
Salaheddin el-Atabani said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Out of its belief in the peace efforts and the necessity of
creating a conducive environment for the current peace talks in
Nairobi, the Sudanese government declared a two-week cease fire in
the southern battlefields as from 12,00 p.m. September 21, except
for cases of self-defense," el-Atabani said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire cover the ground and air operations against the
Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Garang told Qatar's Al-Jazirah T.V. Channel
that he was ready to meet Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir on the
ways of establishing peace in the country. "The people are
suffering greatly due to the ongoing civil war and I'm ready to
meet el-Bashir," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old war between the Sudanese government and the SPLA
rebels costs the government some one million U.S. dollars a day and
inflicts heavy human losses on both sides. It broke out in 1983 due
to the dispute between the two sides over autonomy of south Sudan
and separation between religion and State.

<HEADLINE> French Plane in Iraq on Humanitarian Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A French plane made a direct
flight from Paris and arrived in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on
Friday afternoon on a humanitarian mission to the sanctions-hit
country.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first direct flight between the two
cities since the United Nations embargo was imposed on Iraq in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Jihad Fahkhali, head of the French delegation,
slammed the air embargo imposed on Iraq by the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely unfair to let (Iraqi) people struggle under the
embargo," he said, adding that a direct flight to Iraq can help
improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that for example, within the framework of U.N.
resolutions, a direct flight can deliver some foreign medicine
manufactured in the morning to arrive in Iraq in the afternoon, and
get used to treat patients in the evening.
</P>
<P>
But now humanitarian goods, including medicine and food, have a
delay or two or three days as they must go through the 1,000-
kilometer road to Baghdad from Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Xinhua whether the flight got approval from the U.
N. Sanctions Committee, he said, "Personally I do not have to
notify anybody except my government. I notified my government and
the French government is responsible for notifying the U.N.
Sanctions Committee and I guess they did."
</P>
<P>
As to the 75-member French delegation, Fahkhali said that it
comprises medical staff, artists and a group of athletes. During
the four-day stay in Iraq, the delegation is expected to work side-
by-side with Iraqi doctors, take part in surgical operations and
attend the Babylon International Festival, which starts on Friday
and will last for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The athletes are hoping to take part in friendly football and
tennis matches in Iraq, Fahkhali said.
</P>
<P>
It took the Boeing 737 plane four hours to make the direct
flight from Paris.
</P>
<P>
France, one of the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, has been calling for lifting the decade-old embargo on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has held that there are no U.N. resolutions
banning passenger flights to Iraq as long as they are not part of
business transactions.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. and Britain argue that all flights to Iraq must
receive permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.

Heinbecker recalled that there is a mechanism set up by the UN
and his task is to continue the work started by the original panel
and present a provisional report to the UN on October 18, before a
final report is submitted by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the goal of the provisional report is to
verify whether the countries and the people listed on the "Fowler
Report" are respecting the sanctions or violating them. The former
head of the sanction committee, Robert fowler, drafted a report in
early this March on the situation in the war-torn Angola, pointing
out that some countries and foreign personalities, including
statesmen, have violated the UN Security Council's sanctions
against Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit starting from Thursday, Heinbecker
will meet with high-ranking Angolan officials including Defense
Minister Kundi Paihama, Petroleum Minister Botelho de Vasconcelos
and army chief of staff Joao de Matos.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Calls for Resignation of Ministers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition party
the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Friday called on some
ministers and the police commissioner to resign immediately to
account for their roles in spreading disinformation against the
party and misleading the country.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo, Minister of State for
Information and Publicity Jonathan Moyo and Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri are on the MDC's list for resignation.
</P>
<P>
MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai told a press conference that
the party now had evidence on the involvement of "the highest
offices of the government in a conspiracy to destabilize the MDC."
</P>
<P>
He said the Police Protection Unit had infiltrated the MDC's
youth wing in a bid to destroy the party.
</P>
<P>
He told the press conference that the firearms found at some
MDC offices this week was the work of these infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai also accused Home Affairs Minister Nkomo of having
misinformed Parliament over the blast incident of last week in the
MDC's headquarters, adding that the police also played a role in
the accident.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo had told the parliament that bombing of the MDC
Headquarters in Harare last week was an "inside job".
</P>
<P>
The government action was testimony of its desperation to hold
onto power in spite of the shifting national sentiment, said the
opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
He said the MDC had no intention to challenge the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
"As an effective opposition, we have a role to hold the
government accountable for its actions in the best interests of
Zimbabwe," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Send Military Observers to Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will soon send
military observers to Ethiopia and Eritrea in response to calls by
the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Sylvester Rioba, spokesman for the Tanzania People's Defense
Forces (TPDF), said here on Friday that 10 soldiers will leave the
country at any time from now to join other foreign military
observers in Eritrea and Ethiopia and five of them will be
stationed in each of the two warring neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement on cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia
and Eritrea signed on June 18 this year in Algiers, the U.N.
should deploy a peacekeeping mission and an observer group under
the auspices of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also committed themselves not to moving their
respective troops beyond certain positions specified in the
agreement while the OAU and the U.N. promised to guarantee the
respect for their commitments until the common border is defined
through some specific measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman also disclosed that 12 Tanzanian
soldiers, who are part of the foreign military observer group in
Sierra Leone, are expected back home soon.
</P>
<P>
All the 12 TPDF soldiers, who have completed their six-month
mission in Sierra Leone, are safe and will be back at "any time
from now," he said.
</P>
<P>
They will be replaced by another batch of soldiers who are
scheduled to leave for Sierra Leone shortly.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sees Poverty as Greatest Concern in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- With 300 million
people living on less than one U.S. dollar a day, poverty remains
the greatest concern in Africa, Tanzania said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Hassan Kibelloh, minister of foreign
affairs and international cooperation of Tanzania, said this
number represents more than 40 percent of Africa's total
population.
</P>
<P>
Indications are that the number of poor people in the continent
is likely to increase as Africa's output continues to drop, he
said, and there is therefore a dire need for a comprehensive
strategy for Africa to address poverty eradication in all its
aspects.
</P>
<P>
The strategy should include a compendium of measures aimed at
capacity building in the development process, and the
implementation of such a far-reaching strategy for poverty
eradication would very much depend on the availability of
resources, the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"In 2001, the United Nations will convene an international
conference on financing for development. It is our hope that the
issue of mobilizing resources for development of Africa will be
thoroughly addressed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official development assistance continues to be particularly
critical in supporting the development efforts in Africa and the
least developed countries, the said.
</P>
<P>
"My delegation therefore wishes to appeal to our development
partners to reverse the trend of declining resources and increase
the level of the official development assistance," the foreign
minister continued.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the various debt relief initiatives pursued
by the international community have been helpful but not
sufficient in providing meaningful solution to the debt problem of
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"And in this regard, we welcome the Heavily Indebted Countries
Initiative to support some of the poor countries in their efforts
to resolve the external debt problem," the foreign minister added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Warns Afghan Conflict Risks Spreading into Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Recent incursions by
Islamic militants in Afghanistan into other parts of Central Asia
highlight the danger that the Afghan conflict could spread, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan underscored the need
for a comprehensive rather than piecemeal solution to that country
's crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since early August, militant Uzbek dissidents have infiltrated
into Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, apparently through Tajikistan,
clashing with the security forces of these countries, Annan said
in the report.
</P>
<P>
"The governments of these Central Asian republics and the
Russian Federation have charged that the insurgents emanate from
Taliban-controlled areas in Afghanistan, where they have allegedly
received shelter, training and logistical support for their
operations," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed his disappointment that there has been no
significant shift as yet in the well-known positions of those
countries that have interests in and influence on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that these countries must find a common approach to
the Afghan conflict, which cries for a comprehensive political
solution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan said, Afghanistan's humanitarian situation is
deteriorating, and the country is currently experiencing its worst
drought in 30 years, causing devastating repercussions on the
population, especially in rural areas where people are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
"The question is how much longer the Afghan people will be able
to withstand the accumulated effects of drought and warfare, let
alone cope with any possible further economic blows," the U.N.
chief added.

<HEADLINE> Euronext Launched as Europe's Largest Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Today is a new day for the consolidation of European markets,"
Euronext Chairman Jean-Francois Theodore said at the launch
ceremony in Amsterdam. "It will not be the last and Euronext will
play a role," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Euronext alliance, through the bourses of Brussels, Paris
and Amsterdam, will include a market with 2.42 trillion U.S.
dollars in capitalization, making it the world's fifth largest
stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Theodore said the Euronext will be Europe's largest stock
market based on turnover volume.
</P>
<P>
"By creating the largest exchange in Europe based on trading
volumes, Euronext will not just attract domestic companies...but
also foreign companies, including from the U.S.," Theodore said.
</P>
<P>
But the chairman declined to comment in detail about the news
that Euronext would launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange LSE.
CAZN in competition with Sweden's OM Gruppen.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching the situation," he said, adding that he was
reluctant to go into detail for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
"I can only say Euronext is an open venture...we have been
designed to be an open venture," Theofore said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Euronext would play a role in the continued growth
of European financial markets, noting that they still have
considerable room to expand compared with the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a video broadcast from New York, Richard Grasso, chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), described the launch of
Euronext as a "great step forward for investors" in Europe, as
well as for markets around world.
</P>
<P>
"The launch of Euronext coincides with the resurgence of the
European economy," he said. "Your work has positioned Euronext to
capitalize on that growth."
</P>
<P>
Grasso also said that Euronext is "a standard for others around
Europe and around world to follow" and that the NYSE and Euronext
are continuing to work towards the creation of a global equity
market.

<HEADLINE> Russian Economic Situation Favorable: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The country's industrial output grew 10 percent in the first
eight months of 2000. In the first half of the year, gross
domestic product (GDP) rose seven percent against the same period
of last year, agricultural production increased by five percent
and permanent assets investments -- 17 percent, Kasyanov told the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, delivering a report on
governmental work.
</P>
<P>
Russia will have an overall budget surplus of more than two
percent of GDP, and a primary surplus equivalent to over five
percent of GDP before debt payment this year, Kasyanov predicted.
</P>
<P>
The budget originally targeted a deficit of more than one
percent of GDP, so budget implementation has been much better than
expected, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The state of the Russian economy has had a positive impact on
the federal budget this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 budget planned foreign borrowing of 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars to refinance old debt, but "we will need to borrow no more
than 400 million due to the good situation," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ruble has regained eight percent of its value since
the beginning of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The gold and foreign exchange reserves have totaled 24.4
billion dollars. "This is the best record in latest 10 years,"
Kasyanov told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Customs Committee and State Statistics
Committee, Russia had a foreign trade surplus of 38.2 billion
dollars in the first seven months, with unofficial shuttle trade
not taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The trade turnover grew 36.4 percent year-on-year to 75.6
billion dollars in the seven months. Trade with countries outside
the CIS increased 35.3 percent to 61.4 billion dollars, and trade
with CIS members -- up 41.1 percent to 14.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports jumped 49.9 percent to 56.9 billion dollars, of which
the selling to the CIS rose 41.5 percent to 7.9 billion dollars
and that with other countries -- 51.4 percent to 49 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports were up seven percent to 18.7 billion dollars. The
purchase from the CIS surged 40.7 percent to 6.3 billion dollars,
but that from the rest of the world fell 4.7 percent to 12.4
billion percent.
</P>
<P>
The favorable economic situation provided possibility to
improve the people's life, Kasyanov noted. During the January-
August period, year-on-year pensions have climbed 70 percent,
average wages rose 25 percent and the population's real income --
nine percent, while the unemployment went down 18 percent.

<HEADLINE> ECB Launches Joint Intervention to Support Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank and
central banks of the United States, Japan, and the Britain Friday
jointly intervened in the exchange markets to support the dropping
euro.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt released a short
statement announcing the first joint action since the launch of
the single European currency in January 1999:
</P>
<P>
"On the initiative of the European Central Bank, the monetary
authorities of the United States and Japan joined with the
European Central Bank in concerted intervention in exchange
markets because of their shared concern about the potential
implications of recent movements in the euro exchange rate for the
world economy."
</P>
<P>
The ECB and other three central banks, namely the U.S. Fed,
the Japanese Bank and the Bank of England, are buying the euro in
world's exchange markets to stabilize its exchange rate. But the
ECB failed to point out the monetary volume in their operation.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the euro reached 0.8524 dollar on
Thursday, devaluing by some 27 percent against the U.S. dollar in
about 19 months after the birth of euro.
</P>
<P>
German analysts said the intervention was "on right time" and
it reflected the deep concern about the euros weakness.
</P>
<P>
"It is a right action for the world's monetary stability and
economic development," said Axel Siedenberg, chief economist of
the Deutsche Bank, "even the Americans have known the negative
impact of the weak euro on their economy."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously 0.85 dollar is a psychological line of the ECB,
which cannot let the euro drop continuously till under that line,"
Siedenberg told the Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA).
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a too-strong dollar against the weak euro means
increasing deficit in trade with the eurolands and thus hurts the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is a positive sign that the U.S. Fed has taken part in
this operation. It is out of our expect," said Petra Koehler, an
ECB expert of Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the recent exchange rate of the euro cannot
reflect the basic economic situation in the eurolands," she added.
</P>
<P>
The joint intervention propped the euro up to nearly 0.9
dollar, but it slid back later. The ECB set its reference rate at
0.8890 dollar Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Death Toll Rises to 95 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of Abu Sayyaf
members killed jumped to 95 from Thursday's last count of 60 as
military operations continued in the southern island of Jolo to
crush the terrorist group, the Philippine government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines(AFP), said Friday afternoon at a press conference that
of the new number, the military recovered the dead bodies of 35,
while the rest were tallied from intelligence reports.
</P>
<P>
The government also recovered 45 firearms, most of them high-
powered, since the offensive started last Saturday, AFP spokesman
Generoso Senga said at the same press conference in the southern
Zamboanga city.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said two soldiers were killed while six were wounded in
the operations taking place in various parts of the Jolo island,
with 19 engagements accounted so far. Eighteen of the engagements
were initiated by the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Reyes also reported that 25 suspected members of the bandit
group were nabbed.
</P>
<P>
However, Reyes admitted that the mission has fallen behind
schedule. The government had said that the operation would be
finished in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
Reyes also said that the number of families who have evacuated
have reached 4,823, coming from the towns of Talipao, Patikul,
Indanan and Parang.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up 30 evacuation centers, but only 11 of
them are occupied by evacuees, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police have also been tasked to investigate various reports
of civilians being killed as a result of the operation. Reyes sad
only two civilians have been confirmed to have been killed in the
course of the offensive.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff said soldiers have conducted house to house
searches in some parts of Jolo to confiscate illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
Two hostages have been rescued since the start of the operation.
However, the Abu Sayyaf is still holding 17 hostages, including
American hostage Jeffrey Schilling.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Finance Minister Calls for Free Movement of Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister
Shah A.M.S. Kibria Friday urged developed countries to allow free
movement of labor from poor countries to help reduce poverty in
these countries.
</P>
<P>
"If goods can move globally then why the labor can not have
the same mobility," Kibria said while launching the World Bank's
world development report with the WB Country Director Fredrick
Temple present.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the free move of commodities and labor is secured, the
global poverty reduction efforts will not see success," Kibria
noted.
</P>
<P>
The 300-page annual report for 2000-2001 with focus on
different development aspects from the World Bank's point of view
was put on WB's official web site on September 12. An overview of
the report was formally released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, which leads the 48 least-developed countries in
the World Trade Organization (WTO), raised the issue first in the
global trade body's Seattle meeting last year, where attempts to
launch a new round of trade liberalization talks failed in the
face of agitations.
</P>
<P>
Kibria praised the role of some major non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in poverty alleviation and their positive
programs in rural areas, but he did not share the notion that NGOs
can solve all problems.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in government-NGO partnership in poverty reduction,
but exaggeration of importance on the NGOs is painful," the
finance minister said.

<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that the number of overseas Filipino workers (OFW) deployed
in key destinations increased by 0.12 percent during the first six
months of 2000.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement Sri Lanka will set aside the 5.
4 million dollars that it would have spent if it had needed to
purchase the wheat and use the money to fund a variety of projects
to alleviate poverty, insure food security and improve
agricultural development in the island country.
</P>
<P>
The donation is in addition to the 40,000 tons of wheat the
United States gave last month under a 5 million dollars
concessionary loan to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The United States is Sri Lanka's major source of conventional
wheat sales, said the statement, adding that the United States has
given nearly 1 billion dollars worth of wheat to Sri Lanka since
1950 under concessionary terms.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Members to Stem Noncommunicable Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO said Friday that strong and committed political leadership is
needed for its development members to stem the rising tide of
noncommunicable diseases (NCD).
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Omi, WHO's Regional Director for Western Pacific, told
the 51st Regional Committee that the major burden of the NCD has
been fallen on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, non-communicable diseases were regarded as
diseases of affluence, limited to developed countries. We can no
longer take this view," Omi said.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting of the Regional Committee, WHO's governing
body in the Western Pacific Region, was held from September 18 to
22 in Manila.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting attended by over 150 representatives from 37
countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region, including 14
ministers of health, the committee reviewed WHO's work in the last
year in the region, including the status of controlling the NCD.
</P>
<P>
Omi said urbanization, industrialization and globalization are
increasing the exposures of many people to unhealthy lifestyles
and behavior, leading to the rise of the NCD.
</P>
<P>
These diseases, especially cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
and diabetes, are major public health issues in almost all
countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the CVD kill three million people each
year, while there are about 3.5 million new cancer cases in the
Region every year.
</P>
<P>
The current number of people with diabetes is at least 30
million and this is projected to double by 2025. Of these 30
million people with diabetes in the region, 75 percent are from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Omi said that "limited resources, the low priority assigned to
the NCD and low awareness of risk factors, have meant that many
developing countries have been unable to respond effectively to
the global NCD epidemic."
</P>
<P>
To tackle the rising tide of the NCD, Omi urges member states
to plan and implement integrated approaches, which are more
effective and efficient than single disease programs.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks' Bad Loan Ratio Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines said Friday that the bad loans of the country's 49
commercial banks rose to 15.26 percent in July from 14.65 percent
in June.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in a statement that the higher non-
performing loan (NPL) ratio in July was attributed to a stricter
regulation imposed by the central bank in June.
</P>
<P>
"Under the new guidelines, banks can no longer conceal non-
performing loans through restructuring to make them appear to be
current, " said the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans refer to accounts whose principal or
interest is unpaid for more than 30 days after due date.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the volume of the NPL surged by 5.6
percent in July to 232.8 billion pesos (5.17 billion U.S. dollars)
from 220.4 billion pesos (4.9 billion dollars) the month before.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank said the Philippines' latest NPL
ratio is still much lower than Thailand and Indonesia which posted
35.6 percent and 69 percent, respectively.

Internet technology. The safety, stability and functions of the
networks will also be greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
More than 170 universities around the world are conducting
research on the latest Internet Two technology. Compared with
countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan and Singapore
that have made great efforts on the technology of Internet Two,
China has only taken elementary steps in this field, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Internet Growth to Create New Opportunities: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite strong market
skepticism, underlying Internet growth in Asia is expected to
create new market opportunities in the coming five years, Internet
analysts here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The recent downturn in Internet stocks has been precipitous as
sharp as the exuberant rise during late 1999 and early 2000, but a
look at the sector fundamentals reveals a very different story,
the analysis with Salomon Smith Barney (SSB) said in their latest
report.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that by the end of this year, Internet users in
Asia Pacific will jump up by 67 percent annually to 62 million,
the annual business-to-customer transactions will rise by 218
percent to 620 million U.S. dollars, and the annual online
advertising revenues will increase by 264 percent to 175 million U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These figures were forecast to grow at an exponential rate over
the next five years, and with such strong growth on all measures,
the Asian Internet market is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also noted that despite poor market sentiment, the
growth and development of the Asia Pacific Internet market
continues unabated, particularly, the increasing importance of
China and India as contributors to further Internet adoption in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Believing that investor sentiment toward the Internet has
reached an irrational new low, they pointed to the fact that
Internet economy in Asia is still in "build-out" mode in a sector
that barely existed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
At this early stage of the game, traditional valuation
methodologies are difficult to apply, they said, adding that
market opportunities will continue to grow along with Internet
penetration and access and infrastructure need to be built long
before e-commerce transactions can take off.
</P>
<P>
"The new economy will reach full potential if there is enough
investment in access and infrastructure for all markets in the
Asia Pacific region," said Pratik Gupta, the SSB's head for
regional Internet and media.
</P>
<P>
Gupta believed that the Internet market needs further
development in higher Internet penetration for both consumer and
corporate markets, closer back-end integration among systems and
applications, and greater application penetration among existing
users.
</P>
<P>
To boost the Asian Internet economy, the SSB's Asian Internet
team stressed that there is a need for integrated business models
in Asia and companies need to diversify revenue sources to reduce
overall risk, since the internet market in Asia Pacific is much
smaller than in other region and hard to achieve economies of
scale in such fragmented markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa on Friday paid a
tribute to local film makers for their outstanding achievements.
</P>
<P>
Officiating special premiere at the Hong Kong Cultural Center
to congratulate the film "In the Mood for Love" in winning two
awards in the 53rd Cannes International Film Festival, Tung said
the film not only won reputation for Hong Kong film makers, but
also indicated that the standard of Hong Kong-made films has won
worldwide recognition.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong cinema has played an important role in the
international film arena." Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong cinema had attracted a lot of international attention
as early as in 1970s when the late director King Hu carved a niche
at the Cannes International Film Festival with his masterpiece "A
Touch of Zen."
</P>
<P>
A number of local films have since won much-coveted awards at
major international film festivals, Tung recalled. International
awards granted to Hong Kong films and actors and actresses
demonstrate that Hong Kong is capable of making world-class films,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong films not only provide a feast of entertainment to
film buffs but also help to project Hong Kong's image as a vibrant
and dazzling cosmopolitan city, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Working hand in hand with the local film industry, the
government is dedicated to providing an environment conducive to
the development of the industry, Tung said.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Help Philippines vs. Terrorism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that France has offered to help the Philippines institute a
program to fight the growing "menace of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a statement that he
received a telephone call from French Defense Minister Alan
Richard that France "is interested in instituting a program in
countering terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine government has agreed in principle to
the offer of France.
</P>
<P>
According to Mercado, French President Jacques Chirac had told
Philippine President Joseph Estrada about the project after the
escape of the two French journalists -- Jean-Jacques Legarrec and
Roland Madura earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists are now in Paris. They were earlier
presented to President Estrada in the presidential palace before
flying home. They had been held hostage by the Abu Sayyaf for more
than two months.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said that representatives from the Philippines and
France will meet next week to discuss in details the specific anti-
terrorist program the French government will offer.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the president last night and he said he welcomes
this cooperation," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The United States had earlier told the Philippine government
that it is ready and willing to help the country in fighting
terrorism which is a global problem.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the government welcomes the offer from the United
States and France to help the Philippines contain terrorism, which
is a transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen other hostages, including American Jeffrey Schilling,
are still being held by the Abu Sayyaf, as the military operation
against this extremist group entered its seventh day on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The military said nearly 100 Abu Sayyaf members have been
killed since the military assault started last Saturday. Only four
soldiers and four civilians were wounded so far, the military said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Future Lies in Gas, Not Oil: Obasanjo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's future economic
prosperity lies in the development and exploitation of its massive
gas resources, far larger than its considerable oil reserves,
local media Friday quoted President Olusegun Obasanjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commissioning of the Nigerian Liquefied Natural
Gas (NLNG) plant in Bonny, Rivers States on Thursday, Obasanjo
stressed that Nigeria was counting on its growing gas sector to
build a stronger economy and a more social and equitable country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest oil-producing country in Africa and the
world sixth largest oil exporter, has an estimated proven gas
reserves of some 120 trillion standard cubic feet, the 10th
largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The NLNG, which was incorporated in 1989 and began operation
last year, is the largest single energy project on African
continent with a total investment of 3.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company is owned 49 percent by the state-run Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), 25.6 percent by Anglo-Dutch
group Royal Dutch/Shell, 15 percent by Elf of France and 10.4
percent by Eni/Agip of Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- American Online and Time
Warner made formal concessions to the European Union on Thursday
to save its planned merger.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, confirmed on Thursday that the American companies had
submitted their formal concessions.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, we received undertakings from the companies," said
commission spokesperson Amelia Torres.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesperson declined to disclose or comment upon the
content of the concessions. "We will have to wait for the final
decision which must made before October 24," she added.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the European Union's competition watchdog,
wanted to be satisfied with the merger plans before it approved
the 183-billion-U.S. dollar multimedia industry joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The commission is also expected to rule on a merger plan
between EMI and Warner Music, worth 20 billion dollars. A
decision should be made by October 18.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, EMI and Warner Music offered concessions on
issues such as record label sales, publishing companies and
divesting distribution facilities.
</P>
<P>
The commission is conducting market tests on the concessions
and is expected to consult with the 15 EU member states before
making a final decision.

revenue will increase 3 percent to 5 percent from the second
period; analysts had expected a 9 percent to 12 percent rise.
Intel's stock slid 20 percent in after-hours trading, slicing

</P>
<P>
Construction of the plant will begin in December. The first
phase of the project is expected to be completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The sewage plant will treat water discharged from the Beijing
Economic and Technology Development Zone, which is a home to over
700 companies. These companies invest some 2.5 billion US dollars
in the Zone. Over 90 percent of the hi-tech companies are Sino-
overseas joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, pollution treatment works were built with funds
from the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Continue Without Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli negotiator Gilad
Sher and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat held a session of
talks again Friday for reaching a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Though no details were disclosed, both sides have expressed
growing disappointment at the lack of progress in the peace
process, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The meetings between Sher and Erekat, which have become the
major channel between the two sides for reviving peace talks in the
past few weeks, were only resumed after a mini-crisis earlier this
week,in which Israel announced to halt the talks indefinitely and
later backtracked under the pressure of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's top aide Nabil Abu Rudaineh
reportedly said Friday that talks were proving easier with the
United States than with Israel because the Israeli side was just
wasting time.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by Israel's Jerusalem Post daily on
Friday, Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin also said "which is a
little bit frustrating is that you see a situation whereby an
understanding reached during the night is conducive to a
misunderstanding the next morning, and since there are no
systematic minutes taken, there are some difficulties here."
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been in deadlock since July when the Camp
David summit between Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
U.S. President Bill Clinton ended without any agreement.
</P>
<P>
The major thorny issues are the fate of Jerusalem, especially
the sovereignty on the Temple Mount in the stone-walled Old City
which hosts various Jewish and Muslim holy sites, and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the two negotiators will continue
their talks until the United States presented them a package of
bridging proposals, which are currently prepared by American
officials.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said
Thursday, after meeting with Barak, that he was not sure that the
Americans could deliver such a bridging package.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are reportedly scheduled to reach the negotiating
table by the end of the week or the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
One possible solution for the Tempe Mount issue is an idea
raised by the U.S. and Egypt and backed by France, in which the
sovereignty on the mount will be transferred to permanent members
of the United Nations' Security Council. Israel is reportedly
inclined to accept the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey Determined to Streamline Customs Formalities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian and Turkish customs
authorities have decided to streamline border formalities to
facilitate the travel of vehicles and people between the two
countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Heads of customs from both countries have held discussions,
during which they reviewed the current bottlenecks that impede
routine services at the border customs and stressed the need to
solve problems, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also underlined the need for cooperation in
combating drug trafficking across the border.
</P>
<P>
In the 1982-1986 period, an average of 2,000 trucks passed
through the customs each day and the number can reach up to 300.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Tuesday accused Turkey of denying entry of trucks
carrying Iranian goods, hindering Iranian non-oil exports to the
European market.
</P>
<P>
Turkish customs officers and border guards are creating problems
for trucks carrying Iranian goods, an official in the border
province of West Azarbaijan said, adding that if the issue was not
solved, Iranian on-oil exports would face severe problems.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of trailers and trucks from Iran were reportedly
waiting in long queues to receive permission to cross Turkey en
route to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India Giving "Final Push" to Polio Eradication By Zhou Xiaozheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first round of polio immunization will start this weekend
on September 24 in the capital Delhi and three northern states,
namely Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, which are believed to
have the highest risk of poliovirus transmission, officials said
at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The coverage of the second immunization campaign due on
November 5 will be expanded to 11 states which had polio cases
this year, the officials noted, adding that two rounds of National
Immunization Days (NIDs) covering every corner of the country
would be conducted on December 5 this year and January 21 next
year.
</P>
<P>
"India is really on the brink to eradicate this disease (polio).
..A final push is just what we need," said Hemant Ahuja, co-
chairman of India's National Polio Plus Committee of Rotary
International, at the press conference which was dubbed "The Final
Push: Pulse Polio Immunization 2000-2001."
</P>
<P>
With most of its victims being children under three years of
age, poliovirus can invade the nervous system and cause total
paralysis in a matter of hours. Though it cannot be cured, polio
can be prevented and eventually eradicated with an inexpensive yet
effective vaccine, as poliovirus cannot survive outside the human
body.
</P>
<P>
Launching its anti-polio initiatives in 1995 with assistance
from international organizations like the United Nations Children'
s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), India has
made tremendous progress in polio eradication, with the number of
reported polio cases dropping from over 30,000 a year before 1995
to a mere 121 by September this year and the national average
coverage of polio immunization reaching an impressive 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, compared to the rest of the world and even its south
Asian neighbors, India still lags a bit behind: according to a WHO
report, India's new polio cases this year account for a "
significant" proportion of the world's total, and in the entire
south Asian region the total number of polio cases reported so far
this year is only 124.
</P>
<P>
A high birth rate, low routine immunization coverage, heavy
migration and crowded urban slums are all factors hindering India'
s efforts to immunize every child and eradicate polio, said the
experts.
</P>
<P>
There are also some other social and cultural factors affecting
the country's polio immunization drive, such as influence of caste
discrimination and people's fear of family planning, added K.
Suresh, a project officer of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that although India immunized some 135 to 150
million children against polio in each of the four National
Immunization Days (NIDs) last year, which UNICEF called "a record-
setting achievement globally," there are still some 3 percent of
Indian children under age 5, or some 10 million of them, who have
been missed by all past polio immunization efforts.
</P>
<P>
Determined to seize the final opportunity to achieve zero
poliovirus transmission before the end of this year, the Indian
government has decided to adopt a "mixed strategy" in the coming
immunization campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Under this strategy, health workers, apart from feeding
vaccines to children at various fixed polio booths on National
Immunization Days (NIDs), will carry out extensive house-to-house
immunization activities for 2 to 5 days after the NIDs, especially
in those "unreached communities."
</P>
<P>
Health workers and volunteers will also conduct so-called "
mopping-up operations" in areas where the poliovirus has been
detected to make sure no single child in those areas is missed,
Indian officials noted, adding that eight such operations had been
carried out between April and September this year, reaching over
12 million children.
</P>
<P>
No one could deny that fighting and eradicating an infectious
disease is a very costly thing, no matter how cheap the vaccines
could be. The overall cost of India's four forthcoming
immunization campaigns is estimated at around 100 million U.S.
dollars, 80 percent of which will be spent on the purchase of
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
But India is not fighting alone: according to Deputy Director
of UNICEF Programs Dr. Erma Manoncourt, India's polio immunization
program has received contributions from a host of international
donors, which include the U.N. Foundation, European Commission,
governments of Japan and Italy and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, UNICEF also signed an agreement with India's
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to assure the supply of Oral
Polio Vaccine from September 24 this year to January 21 next year.
Most of the vaccines, according to the agreement, will be supplied
by India's domestic manufacturers, who have obtained WHO special
approval.
</P>
<P>
"No child in the world is safe (from the threat of polio) until
all children are safe," said Gary Hlady, medical officer of India'
s National Polio Surveillance Project, a joint initiative between
WHO and the government of India.

LUANDA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 24 people were killed
and many others injured after the Angolan rebels ambushed 24
civilian trucks in central Angola, the official news agency Angop
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trucks, traveling from Angola's south central province of
Huila to the central coast Benguela province, were burnt up by the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) on
Wednesday, a government official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, four cars belonging to the Angolan National
Petroleum Company were also reportedly burnt up at the same place.
</P>
<P>
Although the UNITA rebels have been repelled out of the major
cities in Angola's central highland, a lot of small groups of
guerrillas are still staying there and launching ambushes now and
then, targeting civilian vehicles and small villages.

He said intensive surveillance of the critical 10km zone around

The first test results from a large pig farm next to the source
farm came back negative but this was not conclusive and the
animals would have to be re-tested before they could receive a

</P>
<P>
There is a ban on the movement of animals in the 10km
quarantine zone and all vehicles leaving the area are first
disinfected. There is also an embargo on the movement of cloven-

</P>
<P>
Movement of non-agricultural products, like strawberries, and

<HEADLINE> Angola, Zambia to Reinforce Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the Angolan
army Joao de Matos has said the just-ended visit of his Zambian
counterpart Gerc Mussengule would allow "opening of a new door to
stimulate military cooperation between the two countries' armed
forces", the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mussengule started a two-day visit to Angola from Wednesday
aimed to strength military cooperation between the two countries.
During the visit, "matters of cooperation and defense of
territorial integrity have been discussed", Matos said.
</P>
<P>
As to the border issue between the two countries, Matos said "
the frontier is very long and its management should be discussed
in an appropriate forum."
</P>
<P>
The military situation along the border of Angola and Zambia
has been a cause of tension between the two countries. The most
recent incident occurred late August, when the Zambian government
accused the Angolan forces of bombarding Zambian territory, a
charge denied outright by the Luanda authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has also for many times accused Lusaka
of giving logistic support to the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> Widespread Famine Averted in Ethiopia: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia, suffered from
years of drought, has averted a widespread famine due to generous
donation from the world community, according to the United Nations
' special envoy to the Horn of Africa Catherine Bertini.
</P>
<P>
Bertini, also executive director of the World Food Program,
made the remarks while visiting Gode, a town in eastern Ethiopia
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"When we came in April, this place was so much different. The
therapeutic feeding centers were overloaded with children, "
Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
"Now we see a very different situation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Gode, about 600 kilometers southeast of Addis Ababa, is
believed to be one of the most affected areas in Ethiopia which
reportedly has suffered a lot from successive years of drought
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
In response to the repeated pleading of Ethiopia and the United
Nations to help save millions of famine victims in the country,
international donors have pledged some 1 million tons of relief
food since early this year, two thirds of which has already been
delivered.
</P>
<P>
Despite that the drought-stricken situation in Gode and many
other areas in Ethiopia have improved, the U.N. officials noted
that more than 10 million people in the country still need relief
aid until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gode region remains fragile because
pastoralists in the region have reportedly lost almost 80 percent
of their cattle after successive years of drought, leaving many
destitute people dependent on food aid to survive, the officials
said.

was considering a possible ban on South Africa's agricultural
imports after last week's outbreak of foot and mouth disease on a
pig farm in the eastern part of the country, the Citizen newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU technical committee on South Africa, beginning from
Wednesday, met in Brussels to discuss the matter, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Having been informed of the outbreak on Monday by South Africa,
the EU requested further information, including a detailed map of
the 10 kilometers quarantine zone implemented around the affected
farm, as well as details on the 100 farms falling within this zone.
</P>
<P>
The highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease is an
internationally trade sensitive epidemic. Singapore and Mauritius
have already joined the list of countries which warded off South
African livestock.

TOKYO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori met with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen Friday
to exchange views on bilateral ties and regional issues of common

Local authorities of Okinawa are demanding that a 15-year limit

constructed in another part of Okinawa to host the helicopter
facilities, but Washington is opposed to the idea.

Mori also promised efforts to seek parliament approval of a new
five-year accord on Japan's host-nation financial support for U.S.
military facilities, which was signed by the foreign ministers of
the two countries earlier this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Maurice
Greene advanced into the semifinals of the men's 100 meters at the
Olympic Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who holds the world record of 10.79 seconds, clocked 10.
10 seconds to top the first of the five heats. His training
partner Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Dobago, also entered the
semifinals after winning the second heat in 10.11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But defending champions Donovan Bailey was knocked out of the
semifinals after finishing bottom in heat three with a time of 11.
36 seconds. He slowed down halfway into the competition and
apparently gave up the race.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not putting a lot of pressure on myself. I just want to
put on a good show and hopefully that'll mean I come home with the
gold," Greene said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Bailey's elimination, Greene said: "He is a tough
competitor, we're going to miss him."
</P>
<P>
Boldon, who was coached by John Smith with Greene, said: "I'm
very happy. I have a lot left in my time, a lot more than last
Olympics. I really don't care about the time, the swirling winds
will turn the times off, but as it's just not my lane. I'm
starting better than anyone else. The 50 to 70 is what I have to
work on."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Tommorrow is a different day, anything can happen.
If I get in the lead I control the race. I'm too calm -- the race
has already been won. I'm confident."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Subway's IPO May Depress by Poor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming initial
public offering (IPO) of Hong Kong subway MTRC may set its low end
of the expected price range of 8-9.38 H.K. dollars (1.02-1.20 U.S.
dollars) due to the poor market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Pricing for the issue will be fixed on October 1. Market-
expected book running price standing at 8.88 H.K. dollars (1.14 U.
S. dollars) a share may sink if the Hang Seng Index continue to
fall, source said today.
</P>
<P>
The 8.88 H.K. dollars figure represents a 44 percent discount
to the net asset value of 15.55 per share, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said individual applications benefit most from
concessions including an initial 5.25 percent discount, loyalty
bonus and brokers' rebate on commission. This would translate to
more than a 50 percent discount.

They expected some shareholders of the former Cable &AMP; Wireless

<HEADLINE> Interview: SSB Forecasts 8.1 Percent Growth for China's GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Salomon Smith Barney (
SSB) said Friday that they have recently raised their forecast for
China's GDP growth to 8.1 percent in light of the strong growth of
the year, reversing a seven-year trend of declining growth rates.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the year 2000, the first year to show an up-tick in
the GDP growth rate since 1992, could herald a new era of
accelerating GDP growth of the country," said Yiping Huang, vice-
president for SSB's Asia Pacific economic and market analysis.
</P>
<P>
Huang said extraordinary export expansion and continued fiscal
spending over this period were the keys to growth, with exports
gaining 38 percent and imports rising 35 percent on a year-on-year
basis.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP growth reached 8.2 percent in the second quarter
following a strong 8.1 percent figure in the first quarter, and
industrial production rose 12.2 percent in June and 11 percent in
the first half of the year as a whole, the strongest performance
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Huang also attributed the high growth rates to responses to the
government's value-added tax (VAT) rebates for exports,
strengthening in other Asian currencies and comparisons from a low
base.
</P>
<P>
The economist explained that among China's exporting industries,
textiles was singled out as one of the key contributors to the
export growth in the first half of the year, reaching 23.8 billion
U.S. dollars compared with 16.8 billion dollars in the same period
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"While the export sector will remain strong during the second
half of the year, we expect the growth rate to moderate,
especially if the U.S. economy gradually slows and other Asian
economies follow suit," Huang said.

<HEADLINE> HK Stocks Continue to Fall Amid Oil Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks continued
to fall sharply in the morning session, dragged down by the oil
price hike and the downward of high tech shares.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index plunged 339.98 points, or 2.24 percent, to
stand at 14,824.47 at 10:21 a.m., compared to 14,966.77 at the
opening.
</P>
<P>
Dong Tao, director and senior regional economist, attributed
the fall to the outflow of foreign funds and the reliance on the
oil in the region, pointing out that Hong Kong stocks and high
tech shares are most heavily hit victims.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the oil price may rise to over 40 U.S.
dollars per barrel, while the Hang Seng Index has room for further
decline until a support in the medium term.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A detailed reception plan has
been dished out at the world's largest ancient imperial palace,
the Forbidden City in Beijing, for the National Day holidays, in
order to safeguard security of worldwide tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum administrators managing the Forbidden City
called on Beijing residents not to visit the World Heritage site
and make room for outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Deputy curator of the museum Pei Huanlu led a coordination team
overseeing preparations for the incoming visitors during the
holidays from October 1 and 7.
</P>
<P>
The coordination team has arranged 50 armed police to be
located at the Wumen Square and near the two most important
imperial halls, to ensure visitors' safety.
</P>
<P>
Fierce tides of tourists during the Labor Day holidays caused
minor damage to scenic and heritage sites nationwide.
</P>
<P>
On May 2, the Palace Museum received 120,000 visitors, setting
a record.
</P>
<P>
However, relics experts said that maximum daily reception
capacity of the museum is only 80,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The museum is scheduled to open one hour earlier than the
normal time of 8:30 and will add more outlets for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the management body of the museum vowed to maintain
the regular price at 30 yuan (about 3.61 U.S. dollars) per visitor,
and offer half price for students.
</P>
<P>
The coordination team also urged cafes and restaurants near the
museum to provide sufficient and clean food for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Preserving more than 930,000 treasures, the museum attracts
roughly six million global visitors annually.

<HEADLINE> Rule of Law -- A Must for Developing Western China: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has urged to enforce the rule of law in developing the country's
western region, so as to accelerate its economic growth and social
development, guard national unity, and ensure social stability.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed to learn useful experience from other
countries in boosting regional development with legal means.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), made the remarks at today's lecture on law. In recent
years, such lectures have been held frequently for top officials
to learn about laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang presided over the lecture, which was attended by other
Party and state leaders including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan,
Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
Xia Yong, a researcher from the Institute of Law Science at the
Chinese Academy of Social Science, lectured on a number of major
issues concerning the rule of law in developing the western areas.
</P>
<P>
The president made a speech at the end of the lecture. He noted
that the development of central and western areas is a major
strategic work for implementing Deng Xiaoping's thinking on China'
s development to realize the country's century-crossing goals.
</P>
<P>
The whole Party and all the Chinese people should have a
complete understanding of the strategy's profound significance and
push forward the development of the western region by following
the requirements of the central leadership, uniting as one,
working hard, and making substantial progress, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged to continue deepening the reforms and search for new
ways of thinking, new mechanisms and new methods for bolstering
the development of the west. Market and objective laws must be
followed, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China should sum up its experience from the 20-plus-year-old
reform and opening-up drive and make laws based on the experience
to guide and regularize the development of the western areas, he
noted.

AMMAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government is
working on laws to regularize and prop up burgeoning information
technology (IT) market in the country, Telecommunications Minister
Fawwaz Zobi has said.
</P>
<P>
New legislation and amendments to old laws to meet the emerging
IT market will be worked out in the next few months by the
government and then submitted to the parliament for approval, Zobi
said Thursday at a national conference on IT development.

The laws will include specific legislation on e-commerce and
other IT-related activities on the Jordanian and Arab markets, Zobi

</P>
<P>
The conference attended by King Abdullah Bin Hussein crowned a
10-week discussion by experts and businessmen in the IT sector on
how to facilitate country's IT industry.
</P>
<P>
The participants have made proposals and recommendations on
encouraging investments and reducing capital requirements to the
government and to the Economic Consultative Council set up by King
Abdullah to invigorate the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
They also called for less telephone line charges and even toll-
free numbers to make access to the internet easier and more
competitive, the Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with royal encouragement from King Abdullah, is trying
to attract 150 million U.S. dollars in foreign investments by 2004,
create 30,000 jobs and provide cash-strapped Jordan with 550
million dollars from IT-related exports.

<HEADLINE> Manila Raises Incentive for Olympic Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- With the recent approval on
second reading of a House bill granting incentive to the athletes,
the total cash bonanza for any Filipino gold medalist in the
ongoing Olympic Games in Sydney now reached 14 million pesos (350,
000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the bill of the House of Representatives, a Filipino
Olympic champion shall receive five million pesos (125,000 U.S.
dollars), silver medalist with 2.5 million pesos (62,500 U.S.
dollars) and bronze medalist with one million pesos (25,000 U.S.
dollars) as rewards.
</P>
<P>
Before the Sydney Olympics, President Joseph Estrada had
announced awarding five million pesos for gold, 2.5 million pesos
for silver and one million pesos for bronze medal winners.
</P>
<P>
The president increased the awards after learning the news that
lone boxing survivor Arlan Lerio scored a sensational RSCH (
referee stop contest-head blow) in the second round over Uganda's
Jackson Asiku.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Sports Commission (PC) chairman Carlos Tuason also
promised one million pesos while South Korean corporate sponsor
Samsung offered one million pesos for the gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) president Celso Dayrit said
the House bill "is a big boost to sports," but most importantly,
this would inspire the remaining Filipino medal hopefuls in Sydney
to end a 76-year-long draught of the country for an Olympic gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
With the heartbreaking 17-15 defeat of Danilo Lerio to Spaniard
Rafael Lozano Friday, the boxing team's quest would now depend on
lone survivor Arlan Lerio. Two other boxers -- Larry Semillano
and Romeo Brin were ousted in earlier fights.
</P>
<P>
Aside from boxing, Philippine sports officials in Sydney are
also pinning hopes to the taekwondo jins Roberto Cruz, Ronald
Geisler, Eva Marie Ditan and Jasmin Strachan.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino jins will start their gold medal campaign on
September 27.
</P>
<P>
Other Filipino athletes who are still in medal hunt in Sydney
include: divers Zardo Domenios and Sheila Mae Perez, equestriane
Toni Leviste and steeplechaser Eduardo Buenavista.

As the track and field competitions raised its curtains on
Friday, the first gold medal resulted in controversy when world
record-holder Bernardo Segura of Mexico was disqualified moments
after crossing the finish line first in the men's 20km walk in 1:
18:58, and Robert Korzeniowski of Poland was promoted to the top
of the podium, who finished one second behind Segura in a tight
race.
</P>
<P>
Finnish champion Arsi Harju, 26, justified his status of
champion with a huge second-round throw at 21.29 meters, beating
hot favorites the United States to second and third.
</P>
<P>
Both Adam Nelson and John Godina fouled on their final throws
in futile efforts to catch Harju, as Nelson scored his best effort
at 21.21, never close to his personal best of 22.12 in the six
rounds of the finals, as Godina, a two-time world champion, was
only a late replacement of C.J. Hunter.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Donovan Bailey was eliminated in the men's
100m second round by finishing bottom in the third of the five
heats. Baily, who reportely suffered a flu symptoms early this
week, slowed his pace halfway ahead of the finish line, jogging to
the end and clocking 11.36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In a satiric tone, Bulgarian 48kg gold medalist Izabela
Dragneva, the first women weightlifting champion in Olympic
history, and men's 56kg bronze medalist Sevdalin Minchev, were
robbed of their medals for positive doping tests of banned
diuretics after their compititions earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
And Bulgaria's weightlifting team has been expelled from the
Olympics after three of its lifters failed drugs tests, and its
lifters are suspended from international competitions for a year,
the International Weightlifting Federation said.
</P>
<P>
By piling its gold medals through strongwoman Ding Meiyuan and
strongman Zhan Xugang, judoka Yuan Hua, sharpshooter Yang Lin,
paddlers Wang Nan/Li Ju, and shuttler Gong Zhicao, China enlarged
its gold tally to 14, beating hosts Australia to second.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Egypt, Israel in Agreement to Ease Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel has reached an in-
principle agreement with its Arab neighbors Jordan and Egypt to
ease air traffic jam over the Red Sea Gulf of Aqaba and off the
coasts of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic Al-Rai newspaper reported Friday that an air traffic
control center to monitor congestion over the area will be set up
according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Among the four Arab states that border Israel, Egypt and Jordan
have signed a peace treaty with it while Lebanon to its north and
Syria to its northeast have territorial disputes with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace treaty, Jordan and Israel have civilian airports
in Aqaba and Eilat respectively while Egypt has one at Sharm el-
Sheikh in the Sinai peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The three airports receive mostly charter planes bringing
tourists to these popular diving destinations.
</P>
<P>
Israel opposes using its airspace by foreign airlines when
flying in and out of Jordan to its east, arguing that this posed a
threat to Israeli military flights.
</P>
<P>
Israel suggested moving an air corridor between Israel, Jordan
and Egypt south of its port city Eilat at the Gulf of Aqaba, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Libya Denies Secret Accord With France on Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Seif al-Islam, the son of
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Friday denied the existence of a
secret Franco-Libyan agreement on the release of French hostages
in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly magazine Figaro, al-Islam said
that although a French Foreign Ministry envoy visited Tripoli on
July 18 on the hostage crisis in the Philippines, no secret deal
was struck.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the American hostage held by the Philippine
Muslim group of Abu Sayyaf, Jeffrey Schilling, is an arms
trafficker who sold weapons to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"This is the information which no one else knows and which I
reveal for the first time. He (Schilling) went several times to
the camp of the rebels. He could have converted to Islam but he is
above all an arms trafficker. Libya is not concerned about the
fate of the American hostage at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
All the five French hostages have been released after
negotiations with the rebels and a military operation by the
Philippine army against the rebel base in the southern island of
Jolo.
</P>
<P>
But the situation around the release of two French journalists
this week remains unclear. France has proposed to aid the
Philippines in its fight against terrorism from Muslim rebels
after the release of the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Cities Participate in European Car-Free Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nine Swiss towns and cities
are taking part in Friday's Europe-wide car-free day to raise
public awareness about alternative forms of transport.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time that the event, a brainchild of French
Environment Minister Dominique Voynet, has been staged.
</P>
<P>
Already nearly 800 towns and cities throughout Europe are
participating in the event, which coincides with a fuel crisis
sweeping Europe.
</P>
<P>
A recent study conducted by the Swiss Transport Ministry found
that petrol-driven cars would still be the dominant means of
transport in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
Geneva is one of the nine Swiss towns and cities taking part in
the event, entitled "In Town Without My Car." The others are
Lausanne, Zurich, Basel, Morges, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle,
Murten and Neuchatel.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 50 percent of all car trips made in Europe
are less than two kilometers. The aim of the car-free day is to
show that there are many alternatives to the private car in cities.

"When I was in fourth place after the snatch, I just thought I
must try my best to the end and win the gold back for my country."
He added. "I should win this gold which is the only one our men's
lifters got in those Olympics. It's a hornor to me and to our team.
"
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely happy. He is a very experienced athlete,"

SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Two weightlifters from Qatar
withdrew from the men's 77kg category at the Sydney Olympic Games
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar Weightlifting Association president Yousef Al-mana
reported to the International Weightlifting Federation that
current world champion Saelem Badr Nayef and Nader Abbas ate
dinner outside the Olympic Village on Thursday and are suffering
badly from diarrhoea.

<P>
Al-mana has accepted the blame for allowing his athletes to
leave the village and has reported that both competitors are
inconsolable at their withdrawal from competition.
</P>
<P>
Formerly from Bulgaria, Nayef and Abbas were two of the eight
weightlifters Qatar paid one million U.S. dollars for to the
Bulgarian Weightlifting Association.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Bulgarian weightlifter Plamen Zhelyazkov was
also withdrawn from the day's competition because the entire

<HEADLINE> Austrian Tornado Sailors Guaranteed Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Tornado catamaran
sailors Roman Hagara and Hans-Peter Steinacher have been
guaranteed the first sailing gold medal of the Sydney Olympic
Games sailing regatta.
</P>
<P>
Sailing competition manager Glenn Bourke late Friday confirmed
them as the provisonal winners of Olympic sailing's only multihull
class, although two races remain to be sailed, one Saturday and
one Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrans have sailed an extraordinarily consistent series,
placing 3-1-2-1-1-4-1-1-2.
</P>
<P>
After their second win of the day, in a light north easterly
seabreeze, the only way they could lose was to place ninth or
worse in each of the final three races with their nearest rivals,
Darren Bundock and John Forbes of Australia, winning all three
races.
</P>
<P>
But the Austrians placed fourth in the ninth race and the
Australians fifth, securing Austria its first gold medal in the
Tornado class since it was introduced in Olympics at the Montreal
Games in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Hagara and Steinacher came into the Olympic Games with a series
of significant regatta results, including a win in the 1999
Australian championship, followed by a second in the 2000 world
championship sailed in Sydney last January.
</P>
<P>
Friday's racing also provisionally decided the three medal
winners in the Mistral women's sailboard class, but who wins the
gold will not be decided until Sunday. Alessandra Sensini of Italy
has 14 points, one more than Amelie Lux of Germany, while veteran
New Zealander Barbara Kendall of New Zealand is on 16 points.
</P>
<P>
With just one race to sail, only three points separate the
three women.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive Lux finished Friday with two seconds with her
drop races an extraordinary third and fourth; Sensini had a win
and a 12th; the veteran Kendall had a fifth and a win.
</P>
<P>
These two classes, plus the Mistral men, the 49er open hight
performance dinghy and the men and women's 470 events raced Friday,
with race starts again delayed for almost an hour by insufficient
wind.
</P>
<P>
However, a six to eight knot north-easterly seabreeze filled in,
later freshening to 10 knots, giving all fleets a good, albeit
light weather, sailing day on a sparkling, sun0drenched Sydney
Harbour.
</P>
<P>
The only major change in overall fleet positions Friday came
inthe Mistral men's sailboard event, where the Argentinean sailor
Carlos Espinola moved into top place overall, despite a rather
inauspicious 27th and a sixth. Discarding the 27th, he is on 40
points with two races to sail on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Christoph Sieber slipped from first to second overall,
on 50 points, after a 24th and a fourth, while Aaron McIntosh of
New Zealand is third on 53 points after a fifth and 12th. The
second discard after race 10, scheduled for Saturday, could be
vital in the medal count. At this stage, it favours the Austrian.

<HEADLINE> China Determined to Curb Desertification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China will allocate a huge
amount of money in the next decade to curb the country's
desertification, with over six billion yuan (approximately 720
million U.S. dollars) going to the national capital, Beijing, and
its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Yang Weixi, an official in charge of desertification affairs
with the State Forestry Administration, said this is a joint
effort with four other partners: the Ministry of Agriculture, the
Ministry of Water Resources, the State Development Planning
Commission, and the State environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
The program consists of nine projects: The surrounding area of
the Taklimakan Desert, the Gurbantunggut Desert, the Badain Jaran
Desert, the Tengger Desert area, Beijing and its neighboring areas,
the desert areas in Horqin and Hulun Buir, the desertified areas
in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the Qaidam Basin, and
the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River.
</P>
<P>
Yang said "among these, Beijing and its neighboring areas will
be the main focus," which involve Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi and Hebei.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, deputy director of the Development Research
Center with the State Council, said Beijing was hit by 12 sand
storms this Spring, a warning that desert is extending towards the
country's capital.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the sand storm on April 6 alone resulted in
delays of over 80 flights in the Beijing Capital International
Airport. It also brought damages and economic losses to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangting, a Chinese expert in desertification research,
emphasized that it is high time to deal with "man-made" deserts
rather than those caused by natural factors.

<P>
"The technology we now have and the natural environment in the
areas will guarantee the return of ecological balance in such
areas," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
So far, three measures have been adopted in deserts around
Beijing: renting grassland to herdsmen to encourage natural use;
building fences to develop rotation grazing; and setting up hay
manufacturing bases to ensure abundant fodder for livestock during
the winter.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang said, "we should always bear in mind Beijing and
its surrounding areas are only a small part of the efforts. Only
by starting the efforts in the vast desert areas in the western
part, can we eradicate the sand storm threat to the country's
capital at last."
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration requires local departments to
build sandproof wood belts around deserts, plant trees and bushes
in desertified areas and return low-yield farmland to pastures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the administration put desertified areas at 1.
689 million sq. km., or 16 percent of the country's land. Desert
is expanding at a pace of 2,460 km. annually
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth progress of the program, the
administration has printed out an atlas of the desert locations in
30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, marking
nearly 400,000 patches in over 7,500 townships.

JAKARTA -- As a major oil consumer in the region, China is to
import 40 million tons of crude and refined products this year,
Senior Vice President of the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) Wang
Tao said here Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Participate in Coffee Retention Plan in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Association
of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), Sergio Amaral said here
Friday that Indonesia is expected to participate in the Coffee
Retention Plan in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Amaral said that ACPC would also urge its members to
participate in the plan in a bid to halt the continuing fall of
the coffee price in international market.
</P>
<P>
"We have met the local coffee exporters association here, AEKI,
and they said that they are prepared to participate in the plan as
soon as possible," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian coffee producers earlier said they were faced with
difficulties in implementing the plan due to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
But Amaral said, "The Indonesian government and local coffee
producers have a strong commitment to implement the plan. The AEKI
is prepared to share the cost with the government."
</P>
<P>
Coffee prices have fallen to a seven-year low, thus erasing
profitability margins for producers and jeopardizing the
sustainability of their activity.
</P>
<P>
The ACPC members reached an agreement early this year to
withhold 20 percent of the world coffee exports in order to halt
the continuing drop in price in the world market.
</P>
<P>
According to a local coffee exporter, the price of Robusta
species reaches 800 U.S. dollars/ton, while the price of Arabic
species is still above one U.S. dollar/kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's coffee production reached 430,000 tons last year.
The country is the world's fourth largest coffee producer.
</P>
<P>
The ACPC started its Coffee Retention Plan on June 1, 2000, and
the plan has also been implemented by non-members, such as
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Vietnam, but a few
members of ACPC such as Indonesia and India are still working on
how to implement the plan.
</P>
<P>
Amaral said that ACPC is not considering any possible sanctions
or penalties against the members that fail to implement the
retention plan.

<HEADLINE> All Hostages in Southern Russia Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- All the hostages taken by
terrorists in a Russian Black Sea resort were released and the
kidnappers surrendered to the authorities Friday, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, taking five people in captivity Thursday in a
hotel in a southern Russian town, Lazarevskoye, set free a second
hostage on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The first hostage was released earlier in the day through
negotiations between Russian law enforcement agencies and the
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The second freed hostage, a woman, is suspected of
collaborating with the terrorists, Russian First Deputy Interior
Minister Vladimir Kozlov said. The terrorists had dropped their
demand for 30 million U.S. dollars in cash, but stuck to their
demands that they receive weapons and a helicopter be immediately
made available to them, Kozlov said.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, one hostage escaped by jumping out a second
floor window, breaking his legs.
</P>
<P>
Masked gunmen took the hostages Thursday in the hotel,
demanding 30 million dollars in ransom and the release of all
ethnic Chechens in Russian prisons.
</P>
<P>
Special police forces occupied the first floor of the building
in Lazarevskoye, a town 60 kilometers from Sochi in the Krasnodar
Territory and exchanged fire with the kidnappers Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Interfax cited the police as saying that the gunmen were
Chechen extremists.
</P>
<P>
The Krasnodar Territory is located west of Russia's breakaway
republic of Chechnya, where federal troops launched a campaign a
year ago to root out rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices Friday tumbled in
Tokyo on fears of a Wall Street plunge on what players called "
Intel shock", with the benchmark Nikkei index closing at a seven-
week low.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange nose-dived 492.80 points, or 3.
02 percent, from Thursday's close to end at 15,818.25, its lowest
finish since August 4.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, declined 46.78 points or 3.09 percent to 1,
466.93.
</P>
<P>
Fearing a plummet in the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index
later in the day following Intel's downward revision late Thursday
of its July-September earnings forecast, players sold index
futures for hedge purposes, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Fierce selling by foreign players at the outset of the day
contributed to a retreat by Japanese institutional investors, who
helped the Nikkei recoup earlier in the week when it briefly
dipped below 16,000, they said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 535.12 million
shares from Thursday's 693.18 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
High-tech issues especially took a beating, while the
communications sector faced the largest decline, losing 7.24
percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers overwhelmed
gainers 1,113 to 212, with 99 issues closing unchanged.

with a total of 365 kilograms in last year's world championships
after a one-year injury on his back.
</P>
<P>
"When I was in fourth place after the snatch, I just thought I
must try my best to the end and win the gold back for my country."
He added. "I should win this gold which is the only one our men's
lifters got in those Olympics. It's a hornor to me and to our team.
"

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Boosts Ties with Foreign Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua)-- With Houston of the United
States as its first sister city in 1986, Shenzhen, a coastal city
in South China, has so far established friendship city ties with
counterparts of 8 countries.
</P>
<P>
As a small fishing village two decades ago, Shenzhen, the
first Special Economic Zone of China, has grown into a prosperous
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has made rapid progress in bilateral exchanges and
cooperation with its friendship cities in the economic and
cultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Houston delegation came to Shenzhen to attend the
China First International High-tech Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has benefited from close bilateral economic and
cultural relations since it joined hands in 1991 with another
counterpart, Brescia province of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce of Brescia has twice organized
training courses on enterprise management for various Shenzhen
managers.
</P>
<P>
The Youth Team of Shenzhen Peace Football Club went to Brescia
in 1998, where they undertook ten months of training.
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, Li Decheng, vice-mayor of Shenzhen, signed an
agreement establishing friendship ties with Lome, the capital of
Togo, in response to the proposal made by Togolese President
Gnassingbe Eyadema in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the two sides carried out wide-range exchanges
relating to economy and culture. In November 1997, the Shenzhen
trade delegation held the ''97 China (Shenzhen) Products
Exhibition Fair in Lome.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's friendship cities also include Brisbane in
Australia, Poznan in Poland, Vienne Province in France and
Nuremberg in German.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has expanded exchanges and cooperation with its
counterparts to include culture, economy, education, public health,
sports, the press, environmental protection, urban administration
and public servants training.

<HEADLINE> Project Launched to Improve Adolescent Reproductive Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China started a five-year
Sino-American project today to provide information and service
about reproductive health to the country's young people aging from
10 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The young population targeted by the project accounts for one-
sixth of the country's total and two-thirds of the 100 million
transient population, said Liu Hanbin, vice president of the China
Family Planning Association (CFPA) at the project-launching
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said that adolescents and young people who should be
regarded as the most healthy group in China, are under threat from
sexually transmitted diseases (STD), HIV/AIDS and unwanted
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
There is currently no systematic work in providing information
and service about reproductive health to adolescents and unmarried
young people in China, Liu said, adding that a nationwide project
is needed to promote such work.
</P>
<P>
The Adolescent Reproductive Health Project is jointly sponsored
by the CFPA and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (
PATH), a U.S.-based international non-government organization with
the theme of improving women and children's health.
</P>
<P>
The project will also help evoke more concern over the
reproductive health of adolescents from both the government and
society, and will create a better environment in society,
neighborhood communities and schools for young people to receive
relevant education and services.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out in urban areas of 12 provinces,
municipalities and cities which include Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai,
Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Chongqing,
Shaanxi, Qingdao and Shenzhen. Pilot projects will also be
launched in some rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister's Labor Party Central Committee voted
Thursday to adopt a civil reform document formulated by Justice and
Acting Religious Affairs Minister Yossi Beilin.
</P>
<P>
The document was supported after an acrimonious committee
session, from which many members were absent.
</P>
<P>
The document refers to a constitution, a uniform curriculum for
all schools, an examination of the civil service option for those
not doing military service, non-Orthodox marriage alternatives, the
elimination of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, and allowing
public transportation and El Al flights on Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is pushing an initiative to hand sovereignty on the
Temple Mount to permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, in
the latest effort for a final status agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The idea of international sovereignty over the Temple Mount was
first raised by U.S. President Bill Clinton during the latter part
of the Camp David Summit in July as one of several possible options
to solve the question of Jerusalem. Egypt later presented an
updated version of the idea, placing control in the hands of the
Security Council's five permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Israel now believes bringing the Temple Mount under the aegis of
the international community could be the best way to safeguard the
rights and interests of both faiths, while retaining the status quo
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Opening a shopping mall in Herzliya on Saturdays and Jewish
holidays is illegal, according to a letter sent Thursday by Israeli
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein to Herzliya Mayor Yael German.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein explains in his letter that according to the Herzliya
municipal by-law, no business may be opened on official rest days,
except for purposes of cultural and educational activities.
According to Rubinstein, as long as the Herzliya municipality has
not changed the law, it cannot simply act as if it does not exist.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein stresses, however, that even if the municipality
changes the by-law to allow for the opening of businesses on
Sabbath and holidays, Jews will still be forbidden from operating
shops in the mall.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A serial rapist is thought to be responsible for at least
three rapes and a sexual assault at the Israel Defense Forces'
Tzrifin base in the center of the country.
</P>
<P>
The army has suspected for some time that a serial rapist was
targeting the base, but did not warn women soldiers serving there
to take any precautions until Thursday, when the story was broken
by Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Military police believe the same man is responsible for four
attacks carried out at the base since May 1999.

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- In a rare move, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, who has been in power since 1979, talked
about the issue of his successor during a ruling party meeting held
late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
as saying that whoever succeeds his job should not consider it "an
achievement" but "an additional responsibility to serve his
comrades in accordance with relevant principles."
</P>
<P>
His successor should look at the essence instead of the surface
of things, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the integrity of the ruling Arab Baath
Socialist Party and urges party members to do more reading in order
to learn more about the lessons of the Islamic revolution history,
the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Izzat Ibrahim, deputy
secretary-general of the Baath party.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been rumors about his health, the 63-year-
old Iraqi president appears in good shape and even has a good sense
of humor.
</P>
<P>
"You can not say I never give you a cigar," he was shown
recently joking with his Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz by Iraqi
television.

<P>
MANILA, September 22 -- Share prices in the Philippine Stock
Exchange ended lower Friday as the Philippine peso continued to be
weak against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, fell 2.08
points to close at 1,420.61. But the broader all-shares index
marginally rose 15 of a point to 678.72.

Dealers exchanged 465.2 million shares worth some 10.4 million
U.S.dollars on Friday against Thursday's 412.6 million shares
worth some 15.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the peso which had already breached the 46 pesos
to one dollar psychological level in early trade dissuaded
investors to participate in the market.
</P>
<P>
"It's generally the weakness of the peso which kept the market
locked in the downward trend," said Joey Roxas, president at Eagle
Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 46.065 against the U.S. dollar early Friday,
weaker compared to the previous close of 45.99 pesos.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Investment in Poultry to Reach 6 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 4 million U.S. dollars
have been channeled into Zambia's poultry industry in the last two
years, and another 2 million dollars are expected in the next two
years, said chairman of the Poultry Association of Zambia Paul
Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
There is great opportunity for expansion in the industry which
has been underpinned by the positive attitude in the economy, he
was quoted by Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that Zambia's poultry industry is relatively young
compared with that in Zimbabwe and South Africa in terms of
volumes and has not yet reached a stage to compete with markets in
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"But expansion is on the way because there is so much
investment earmarked for the sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is need for the industry to attain international product
standards certification in order to be able to penetrate outside
markets, Cartwright stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that Zambia risks importing contagious poultry
diseases from some neighboring countries if stringent measures to
control the flow of poultry products are not put in place.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Four Gold Medals in Women's Weightlifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ding Meiyuan became the
strongest woman in the world on Friday when she registered a world
record of 300 kilograms in the two-lift total to win the Olympic
gold medal in the over-75kg category.
</P>
<P>
Ding also set two other world records of 135kgs in the snatch
and 165kgs in the jerk en route towards her victory, beating her
arch-rival Agata Wrobel of Poland to second with 295kgs.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth weightlifting gold medal for China, who
swept all the events they competed in the women's weightlifting
which made its Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
"I was very nervous, but I am very pleased to win the gold,"
said Ding, winner of the World Championships last year. "I want to
thank all the people in China for their support to my career. And
my parents will be very happy for my achievement."
</P>
<P>
Ding, 23, was in danger of losing the title when Wrobel asked
170 kilograms for her third attempt after Ding set the new 165
mark. But the weight was too heavy for the 19-year-old Polish to
succeed, and she failed to become the woman to lift the most heavy
weight in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good start for me in the Olympic competition. This
is a pay-off for all of my training and hard work," said Wrobel,
who also took the silver in last year's World Championships after
Ding.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Haworth of the United States won the bronze in 270
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about my performance, about what I did. I feel
confident," said Wrobel after competition.
</P>
<P>
All seven gold medals have been decided when the women's
weightlifting competition concluded this afternoon as China takes
the most four golds, with the other three split by the United
States, Mexico and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
And it was also the first for Colombia in any event in the
Olympic Games.

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted a strategy
of developing its vast western areas, making it a key task in the
national economy this year and in the years to come. Following are
major events on western development this week:
</P>
<P>
Population Control Will Help Develop China's West: State
Councilor
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the population control policy should be
strengthened so as to promote the current "developing the west"
drive, said Wang Zhongyu, state councilor and secretary-general of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Due to slow economic growth, the lack of financial resources
and other reasons, the population in China's west has remained a
strong increasing trend, Wang said at a recent meeting about
population and family planning.
</P>
<P>
He urged related departments and officials to greatly improve
their family planning work, especially at the grass-roots level,
in the coming three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Talents Encouraged To Go West
</P>
<P>
China will invite more foreign experts to the country's vast
western regions next year, according to Wan Xueyuan, head of the
State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The move is to meet the need of the current "develop the west"
strategy made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China.
</P>
<P>
Experts majoring in agriculture, management and bio-sciences
are especially needed, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Participates in Developing Western China
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest economic and commercial center, has
taken the lead in seeking business opportunities in China's vast
western region.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five months, Huang Ju, member of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, led
investigative tours of China's western region and made development
plans with leaders in Henan, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia,
Xinjiang, Gansu and Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 cooperation projects, valued at 29.86 billion
yuan (about 3.6 billion US dollars) in infrastructure construction,
ecological protection, resources exploration, tourism, science and
education, were signed during the tours.

Deyang, a city located in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
aims to become the largest "clothing industrial center" in western
China, according to Deyang Mayor Wu Mianjian.
</P>
<P>
He told the opening ceremony of the Clothing Exposition of
Southwest China that Deyang has listed the garment industry as its
new pillar economic sector and has set a goal to double the
clothing output in five years.
</P>
<P>
Deyang produced 40 million suits last year, accounting for 60

<P>
Increased Productive Forces Leave Room for Agricultural
Restructuring in China
</P>
<P>
Four consecutive years of good grain harvest has allowed China
to reduce grain acreage to restructure the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
About three million hectares of farmland will be turned into
forest and pasture to protect environment in western China.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government recalled the policy of purchasing
agricultural products of low quality at protective prices.
</P>
<P>
More attention should be paid to improving agricultural
restructuring and rural economy structure and to developing
quality and high-efficient agriculture, at a time when there is
enough grain storage, experts suggest.
</P>
<P>
Protection of Cultural Heritage in West China Urged
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council recently issued a
circular demanding the country's western areas to give priority to
the protection of cultural heritage while developing the economy
in the vast region.
</P>
<P>
The western region is a major source of Chinese civilization,
as different local ethnic groups have jointly created a splendid
ancient culture, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The protection of cultural heritage should be combined with
current efforts to improve the local environment by returning
farmland to forests and grassland, it said.
</P>
<P>
China to Breed More Better Grass in Space
</P>
<P>
China is expected to breed improved varieties of grass inside a
special satellite which will be launched into space in three years
' time.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yusheng, a researcher with the China Aerospace Science and
Technology Corporation, revealed the plan recently at the annual
meeting of the China Association of Sciences and Technology in Xi'
an, capital of Shaanxi Province, west China.
</P>
<P>
China, the first country in the world to have bred crop seeds
in space, plans to use improved varieties of grass, shrubs, and
trees and breed them in space to benefit the country and make it
more green.
</P>
<P>
Seeds sent into space in recoverable space vehicles or high-
altitude balloons would mutate under that conditions featured by
micro-gravity and strong cosmic radiation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Central Bank Urged to Support Rupee Against Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- As Nepali rupee started to
tumble again after a stability of over one-and-half months,
commercial banks have urged the central bank for intervention to
prop up the sliding currency, The Kathmandu Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Exchange Dealers Association -- a club of 11
commercial banks dealing with foreign currency transactions --
formally requested Nepal Rastra Bank Thursday to float one million
U.S. dollars, said the English daily.
</P>
<P>
Nepali rupee depreciated by 0.2 rupee for one dollar Tuesday
and further tumbled by 0.4 rupee Wednesday to be exchanged at a
record low of 73.60 rupees for a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Nepali economists fear that continuous devaluation of the
currency will have an adverse impact on Nepal's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The fresh round of depreciation of Nepali rupee against the
dollar is a direct impact of sliding Indian currency fueled by
soaring international petroleum prices. The Nepali rupee is pegged
to the Indian rupee at 1.6:1.

<HEADLINE> Global Semiconductor Orders Reach Record High in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Global semiconductor
equipment makers saw their average monthly orders top 3 billion U.
S. dollars in August, the highest monthly level, a market research
group in Silicon Valley said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Schumann, director of industry research and
statistics for the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials
International (SEMI), noted that the fact orders topped 3 billion
dollars during August is especially significant, because August is
a traditionally weak month for the semiconductor equipment
industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, semiconductor equipment shipments during August
reached 2.4 billion dollars, giving the industry a book-to-bill
ratio of 1.24, according to SEMI statistics.
</P>
<P>
A book-to-bill ratio of 1.24 essentially means that microchip
equipment makers received about 24 percent more orders for
products than were shipped out, and industry officials say it is
an indicator of generally good health in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the worldwide orders figure was up 93 percent from
August 1999 when bookings were about 1.6 billion dollars, and
shipments were up 69 percent from the same month one year ago when
equipment makers shipped 1.4 billion dollars worth of product,
SEMI said.
</P>
<P>
Most industry analysts expect the order growth trend may last
at least another 12 to 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Korzeniowski Wins men's 20km Walk with Segura Being Disqualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Robert Korzeniowski of Poland
Friday became the lucky person to win the first athletics event of
the Sydney Olympic Games when the initial first place finisher in
the men's 20km walk Bernardo Segura of Mexico was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
Segura crossed the line one second ahead of Korzeniowski and
completed a lap of honour before learning from Mexican television
crews that he had received the third warning for an improper
walking style and was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Korzeniowski - whose winning time was 1:18:59 -
added a second Olympic gold after the 1996 50km title to his
collection, which also includes a 1997 50km world title.
</P>
<P>
Noe Hernandez restored at least some pride for the keen walking
nation Mexico with a silver medal in 1:19.03 and Vladimir Andreyev
of Russia was promoted from fourth place to the bronze with 1:19.
27.
</P>
<P>
"Just a second ago I had the silver, now I am the gold
medallist,"said the stunned Korzeniowski. "I can't express my
feelings. I cried when I found out that I won."
</P>
<P>
Segura, by contrast, shed tears of frustration and simply asked:
"Am I really disqualified?"
</P>
<P>
The other truly surprised man was Andreyev: "Fourth is nothing
special, but when the Mexican was disqualified and I was third
that was really something. The Olympics are special and nothing
compares to it when you win a medal."

<HEADLINE> Korean Archers Win Men's Team Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean archers continued
their dominance at the Sydney Olympics with a 255-247 victory over
France in the final of the men's archey team competitions here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States - gold medallists at Atlanta in 1996 - won
the bronze medal with a sudden death victory over Russia.
</P>
<P>
The top seeded Korean trio of Jang Yong-Ho, Oh Kyo-Moon and Kim
Chung-Tae, who broke the Olympic record in their quarter-final
victory over Sweden, peppered the bullseye with their first nine
arrows.
</P>
<P>
Oh shot three successive tens as the runners-up four years ago
opened an 87-84 lead.
</P>
<P>
After failing to win a medal of any colour in Wednesday's men's
individual event the Korean team had a point to prove - especially
as their female counterparts added the women's team event on
Thursday to go with their clean sweep in the indidvidual
competition.
</P>
<P>
But Italy - the Atlanta bronze medallists - refused to buckle
and led by world number one Michele Frangilli they hauled
themselves right back into the match after 18 arrows with the
scores level on 167.
</P>
<P>
The sparkling form of Oh - who hit five ten-pointers from his
first six arrows - was needed by the Koreans to compensate for the
strangely off-colour world number four Jang.
</P>
<P>
But another trio of maximums - this time from Kim - put Korea
227-220 ahead with three arrows remaining and Oh kept his nerve to
seal gold.
</P>
<P>
In the bronze medal play-off the United States and Russia were
locked in at 239-all after the regulation 27 arrows.
</P>
<P>
The United States led by six points with two arrows remaining
but only managed sevens while the Russians shot two maximums to
pull level.
</P>
<P>
In the three arrow sudden death shoot out - one from each team
member - maximums from Victor Wunderle and Butch Johnson saw the
Americans home.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Weightlifting Team Expelled from Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's weightlifting team
has been expelled from the Olympics after three of its lifters
failed drugs tests, the International Weightlifting Federation
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian lifters are also suspended from international
competitions for a year.
</P>
<P>
The IWF said in a statement Bulgaria's weightlifters would be
suspended from all competition for 12 months after three members
of their team tested positive for banned diuretics at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian Weightlifting Federation is suspended forthwith
for a period of not less than 12 months pending an investigation,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"All remaining lifters as well as officers from the Bulgarian
Weightlifting Federation will not be able to take part in the
Olympic Games," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released following an extraordinary executive
committee meeting of the IWF.
</P>
<P>
The decision to boot out the Bulgarians comes after women's 48
kg gold medallist Izabela Dragneva of Bulgaria and compatriot
Sevdalin Minchev, the men's 62kg bronze medallist failed dope
tests.
</P>
<P>
Their double test came after men's 56kg category silver
medallist Ivan Ivanov was banned for testing positive for the same
drug.
</P>
<P>
Both tested positive to banned diuretics in tests taken after
their competitions earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Diuretics help to eliminate fluid from the body and are used by
competitors to lose weight quickly in sports with weight
categories.
</P>
<P>
They can also increase the rate at which urine is produced and
eliminated to make it more difficult to detect banned substances.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- American David O'Connor
knocked down one rail but stayed in the lead to win the equestrian
three-day event gold medal with a biting finish on Friday at the
27th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Australia's triple gold medalist Andrew Hoy cliched the silver
while legendary New Zealand rider Mark Todd, in his last Games,
took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The tension was always to be going to high with just 15 points
separating the top seven riders overnight. Riding his mount Custom
Made in reverse order of placing O'Connor went last with a two-
jump margin but knocked down the first element of the treble
halfway through the course, putting the crowds hearts into their
mouths.
</P>
<P>
Another downed rail would spell disaster but he held on to
complete the course with no further errors and take top spot.
</P>
<P>
The biggest upset of the day was Greek rider Heidi Antikatzidis,
second overnight, who had two rails down and several time faults
to put her out of the running.

<HEADLINE> Baumann's Appeal Turned Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- German runner Dieter Baumann's
appeal against a two-year ban was turned down by the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) Friday, thus making it impossible for
Baumann to take part in the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The ban, imposed by the International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IAAF), ensures Baumann, the 1992 5000m champion in
Barcelona, will not compete in the same event in the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The German Athletics Federation (DLV) had exonerated Baumann,
who denies knowingly taking nandrolone - the substance for which
he twice tested positive in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) removed 35-year-old
Baumann's accreditation for the Games on Wednesday two days after
the IAAF enforced the ban.
</P>
<P>
Baumann took the matter to arbitration and the CAS rubber-
stamped the decision with Friday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly it (CAS) found the IOC was correct in relying on
the IAAF decision when removing the accreditation," said the CAS
via a communique.

<HEADLINE> Chung Ying Street to Revive with Growth of SEZ (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In those days, about thousands of Chinese people poured into
the street to do shopping and at festival, the number of visitors
reached more than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the street is being overshadowed by the booming
economy in China's inland areas as well as in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
With the development of China's economic reforms and opening up,
especially with the rapid growth of China's first special economic
zone, the street has lost its advantages as "shopping paradise."
</P>
<P>
"Almost every commodity at Chung Ying Street is available on
inland markets. Shenzhen itself has become an advanced metropolis
with tourist attractions and shopping centers to entertain tens of
thousands of Hong Kong residents a day," said Zhuo Zhixiong,
assistant manager of Ware House Club Co. Ltd. at the Chung Ying
Street.
</P>
<P>
"Visitors here have been on the decline in the past decade and
the number of visitors to the street dropped drastically in the
past few years," said Liao Weiqiang, director of Shenzhen's
administrative office at Chung Ying Street.
</P>
<P>
The Yantian District Government of Shenzhen is designing a new
role for the street to promote tourism. Last year, a grand history
museum was established at the end of the street, having added to
its appeal.
</P>
<P>
"Chung Ying Street has become an important part of new tourist
area in east Shenzhen including Yantian Port, Minsk Craft-carrier
and Meisha Holiday Resorts," Liao said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the street will revive in the new century by
transferring from a shopping center to a tourist attraction," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Virtual University Park: Shenzhen's High-Tech Industrial Incubator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of 31
Chinese universities of higher learning gathered together
Wednesday in the Virtual University Park of Shenzhen to inaugurate
their own research establishments there.
</P>
<P>
The park, set up one year ago, has trained more than 800
qualified personnel in a dozen specialties ranging from computers,
telecommunications engineering, integration of machine building
and electronics, financial management, to business management.
</P>
<P>
It has also introduced over 60 high-tech research achievements
used in industry, injecting vitality to high-tech industrial
development in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yingli, deputy secretary-general of the Shenzhen City
People's Government, said the virtual university park is not
simply a place for on-line education, but an educational base for
multi-level training courses and a center where universities,
enterprises, and venture capital groups may come together,
creating opportunities for industrialization of scientific
achievements.
</P>
<P>
So far, 34 Chinese universities have become members of the park.
Another 17 foreign colleges of higher learning, including Bauman
Moscow State Technical University, the Russian Academy of Science
Far Eastern Branch, the National Technical University of Ukraine
and Tunghai University, have joined the Park on-line.
</P>
<P>
A main building for the virtual university park, with a
combined floor space of 17,000 sq m, is under construction in
Shenzhen's high-tech industrial zone and should be completed by
the end of the year. It will include rooms for lectures, reading
and meetings, along with service systems, telecommunications
network systems, as well as scientific and technological workshops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administrative center of the park has also
signed agreements with three local banks to provide financial
support to its members in using academic achievements in industry.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was the first of China's five special economic zones
and celebrated its 20th anniversary late last month. In the past
two decades, Shenzhen has created an economic miracle and
experienced an annual growth rate of over 30 percent.

<P>
SHENZHEN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Early every morning, groups
of Chinese tourists gather at the entrance gate at Shatoujiao to
visit a small but unique street on the boundary line between China
's special economic zone of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, China's
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Chung Ying Street (Chung Ying means China and Britain), use to
be a "shopping paradise," but now it has become China's only
street with "two systems." Hong Kong police officers in gray
uniforms casually watch pedestrians and talk on their walkie-
talkies in Cantonese while the armed police of the Chinese
mainland stand at attention, guarding the Hong Kong entrance.
</P>
<P>
With curiosity, tourists from China's inland provinces wander
the street flanked on each side with stores that sell items made
of gold, and supermarkets, watch and clock shops and garment
stalls, crossing eight boundary areas to enter one store or
another. They seem to have no interest in shopping, but are,
instead, attracted by the street itself.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xigang, who works at the Chengnan Machinery and Electric
Company in Nanjing of east China's Jiangsu Province, said that he
had long cherished a wish to visit the street.
</P>
<P>
"Visiting Chung Ying Street is my first choice in my travel
plans in Shenzhen, for it has a long history and great changes,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Having gone through ups and downs, the street, 250 meters long
and 4 meters wide, has been closely linked to the development of
Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
It grew in the late 19th century when the government of the
Qing Dynasty was forced to sign the Convention Regarding an
Extension of the Hong Kong Territory.
</P>
<P>
Until the 1980s, Chung Ying Street has enjoyed the advantage of
having a full range and superb collection of commodities, although
commodity shortages have prevailed in the inner areas of China.

<HEADLINE> (RECAST) Over 40 Million Relieved of Poverty in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- During the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000) more than 40 million impoverished Chinese
people will be relieved of poverty and the Chinese government's
poverty relief plan will be realized, according to a spokesman for
the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of this year, China will be able to
basically solve the problem of providing enough food and clothing
for its entire impoverished population.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that during the five years, China
implemented the governemnt's poverty-relief plan, adhered to the
principle of relieving poverty through development, increased
input in impoverished areas through various channels and found an
effective way to develop poor areas.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, special money allocated for poverty
relief, put in by the central government, is expected to exceed 94
billion yuan(about 12 billion US dollars). The central government
also gave powerful support to impoverished areas in large and
medium-sized infrastructure projects, resource development and
biological environmental protection projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
With concerted efforts by the whole society, the infrastructure,
production and living conditions in impoverished areas have been
largely improved, and science and technology, culture, health and
other social affairs have made new progress in poor areas as well.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1999, the number of poor
people dropped from 70 million in 1995 to 34 million, and this
year about 10 million more are expected to get out of poverty. The
per capita income of farmers in 592 counties under the State's
poverty line had been raised from 824 yuan in 1995 to 1,347 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some key impoverished areas have successfully got rid of
poverty as a whole, such as the Yimeng mountainous areas, Jinggang
mountainous areas, Dabie mountainous areas and the southwest part
of Fujian Province. In Yimeng mountainous areas, farmers' per
capita net income has reached 2,035 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that in impoverished areas, over 97 percent
of the townships have access to roads and highways and a steady
power supply. The dropout rates at schools have lowered to 6.9
percent, and 98 percent of the townships have hospitals. The labor
quality and education in impoverished areas has also improved.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Cooperate with Thai Company in Oil Palm Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quoting Myanmar Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation Major-
General Nyunt Tin, the report said though the Myanma Perennial
Crops Enterprise (MPCE), a state-run organization under the
ministry, is distributing hybrid oil palm seeds, as it cannot
fulfill the domestic requirement and has to depend largely on
import.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar will introduce oil palm cultivation technique from the
Univanich Oil Palm Co Ltd of Thailand since the company has
established many oil palm farms in that country and is producing
quality seeds and rendering services, disclosed Nyunt Tin at a
seminar here on Thursday, jointly sponsored by the MPCE and the
Thai company.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Myanmar is planning to put 202,500
hectares under oil palm in the country's southern Tanintharyi
division where climate and soil condition are suitable for the
undertaking as part of its efforts to ensure domestic sufficiency
in edible oil.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar produces 200,000 tons
of edible oil annually while importing 100,000 tons of such oil to
help fulfill its domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
In addition to cultivation of major oil crops such as groundnut,
sesame, sunflower and mustard, cultivation of soy bean and oil
palm is also being extended for extracting edible oil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to gradually reduce the import of edible oil,
Myanmar has leased out large plots of vacant and virgin lands to
private entrepreneurs and provided the oil crop growers with
agricultural loans and advance payment for the purchase of the
crops.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ministry Suspicious of U.S. Marines at Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military has
questioned the presence of 600 United States marines on the border
area between Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province (West Timor)
and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"Why should they deploy 600 marines and three warships on the
pretext of dropping off humanitarian aid and giving assistance to
development in East Timor?" Antara news agency Friday quoted the
military chief of security in West Timor and Bali Major General
Kiki Syahnakri as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in Mataram, capital of West Nusa
Tenggara, Thursday, Syahnakri said the presence of the U.S.
marines on the border was rather questionable.
</P>
<P>
He said helicopters, carrying U.S. troops to drop humanitarian
assistance at border areas, had trespassed into Indonesian
territory. Local Indonesian authorities have lodged protests
against the territorial intrusion and the commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in East Timor has apologized.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the U.S. marines to East Timor came days
after three U.N. aid workers were slain in West Timor, where their
local office was attacked by pro-Jakarta East Timorese militias on
September 6 in the town of Atambua, East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military spokesman Air Vice Marshal Graito Usodo
said here Thursday that a four-day operation would be launched
Friday to seize firearms and other weapons from East Timorese
militias, who were blamed for the murder of the three U.N. workers
in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is true that there will be a disarmament between
September 22 and 26 so that the international community can see
that we are serious," said Usodo.
</P>
<P>
Latest U.N. estimates say between 90,000 and 120,000 refugees
who fled last year's violence in East Timor are still living in
camps in west Timor, where they live side by side with and are
intimidated by the militias.

Arrivals dropped sharply in April as fighting intensified
between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels in the northern
Jaffna peninsula. July's figures were bolstered by arrivals from
Europe, which rose 9.3 percent from a year earlier, the board said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a record number of 436,440 tourist arrivals was
recorded in Sri Lanka. The Tourist Board has expected that
arrivals would rise to 500,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, industry officials believe arrivals will remain flat
this year due to a host of domestic concerns, including the ethnic
civil war, political uncertainty, and suicide attacks in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a suicide bomb attack near a government hospital
in downtown Colombo killed the bomber and six others. The attack
was blamed to the Tamil Tiger rebels who are fighting a 17-year-
old war for independence in Sri Lanka's north and east.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China and Brazil agreed
Thursday in Brasilia to further promote bilateral scientific and
technological cooperation, which constitutes an important content
in their strategic bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
At a signing ceremony of a new Sino-Brazilian space technology
accord, visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said that
such cooperation has far-reaching significance, as it is conducted
between the world's two biggest countries, and is a new type of
south-south cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China and Brazil have common needs, and also
solid bases to widen cooperation in the high-technology area,
which is counted with a brilliant prospect.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that within the framework of the world's multi-
polarization and globalization, countries in way of development
must be united to promote cooperation. In this aspect, China and
Brazil must take the first step to make their contributions.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Brazil's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luiz Felipe
Lampreia, said signing of the accord represents the excellent
political relationship between China and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
He said that thanks to the 26-year-long diplomatic relations,
Brazil and China have nowadays more frankness and growing
consensus in dialogues, which has impelled both countries to
progress and association.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that this accord, the Satellite Sino-Brazilian
Project of Land Resources, will help both countries to better
understand natural and environmental phenomena and bring benefits
to farming and fishing fields.
</P>
<P>
Through the accord, China and Brazil will build two more
satellites in forthcoming years. The first satellite was launched
successfully in December 1999 in China, and the second launching
is programmed for before October 2001.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Sentences NATO Leaders to 20 Years for War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A local court in Yugoslavia
on Thursday sentenced 14 NATO leaders, including U.S. President
Bill Clinton and his NATO allies, to 20 years each in prison for
crimes against humanity and international laws.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade District Court accused the leaders of staging an
invasion against Yugoslavia, infringing its territorial
sovereignty, attempting to murder the president of the country,
war crimes against civilians, and use of banned weapons, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The court verdict said that a total of 504 Yugoslav civilians,
240 servicemen, and 147 policemen were killed during the March 24 -
June 10 NATO air strikes last year.
</P>
<P>
It said that during the air raids, NATO carried out 25,119
combat aircraft sorties, while launching 600 cruise missiles in
attacks on military and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The 14 western leaders were tried in absentia on Monday.
Besides Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French
President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
were involved.
</P>
<P>
Others on trial were U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
U.S. Defense Chief William Cohen, and their counterparts from

<HEADLINE> Poland January-June GDP Up 5.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Poland's economy grew a
vigorous 5.6 percent in the first six months of this year, thanks
to a 9.8 percent rise in industry output and a 3.1 percent
increase in consumer spending, the National Statistics Bureau said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure
of total economic activity, was less than the 6.6 percent for the
fourth quarter in 1999, which brought the 1999 overall rise to 4.1
percent, down from 4.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicted a weaker performance for the second half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, industry output increased 9.8
percent and consumer spending -- the key fuel for economic growth -
- increased 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the central European economy, one of the most
successful in the past decade, registered a trade deficit of 9.97
billion dollars in the first seven months this year. Its exports
and imports both jumped 14.4 percent and 8.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Poland imported more than it exported with each of its trading
partners, according to the bureau. As a front-runner candidate for
membership in the European Union, Poland accumulated nearly half
of its total deficit from trading with the bloc.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country's trade deficit hit 14.2 billion dollars,
up from 13.7 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With 2.5 million of its active population out of work, the
unemployment rate also jumped to 13.8 percent in August, up from
11.9 percent at the same period last year.

WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Cuba
on Thursday began two days of talks in New York on migration, the
first official contact of the kind since last December, the State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss in those talks a wide range of subjects
concerning the agreement to provide a safe and orderly method for
Cubans to emigrate to the United States," State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said the delegations, led by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State William Brownfields and Cuba's National Assembly
President Ricardo Alarcon, had started meetings in New York.
</P>
<P>
Boucher also said that the talks were not affected by the U.S.
decision to bring eight Cubans to U.S. soil after their plane
crashed in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The eight Cubans were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard on
Tuesday and arrived in the United States on Wednesday night. Six
were granted legal entry and the others were expected to be
permitted to stay.
</P>
<P>
"The plane that went down was not a subject of discussion for
these talks. ...it was not something we were going to raise. We
saw no reason for it to be discussed up there," Boucher said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarians to Pay Fine to Stay at Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Weightlifting
Federation will pay a 50,000 U.S. Dollars fine to stay in the
Olympics after three of its medalists failed dope tests,
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch told a news conference the money would be used to
fight doping in Bulgaria and the funds would be controlled by the
International Weightlifting Federation (IWF).
</P>
<P>
A country which has three positive tests involving its athletes
within 12 months is suspended from competition for one year under
a "three strikes and out" IWF rule.
</P>
<P>
The alternative is to pay a 50,000 U.S. Dollars fine, as
Romania did earlier this week in Sydney to stay in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch told a news conference: "We reached an agreement with
the national federation that this 50,000 must go back to the
country. They must use the 50,000 for the fight against doping."
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian gold medalist Izabela Dragneva, the first women's
weightlifting champion in Olympic history, and men's bronze
medalist Sevdalin Minchev lost their medals after positive doping
tests, the IOC said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in 12 years that Bulgarian weightlifters
have been ejected from an Olympics for using diuretics, and the
positive tests cast uncertainty upon the very future of the sport
as an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
They were the second and third Bulgarian lifters found with the
banned weight-losing drug furosemide in their systems at these
games. Both were ordered to return their medals and leave the
Olympic Village. The gold medal at 48 kilograms now goes to Tara
Nott of the United States.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Bulgarian lifter Ivan Ivanov was stripped of his
silver medal in the 56-kilograms class after testing positive for
furosemide. Ivanov, a former Olympic and world champion, was the
first athlete to fail an in-competition test during the games.
</P>
<P>
Diuretics are used to lose weight but also can be used to mask
the presence of other performance-enhancing drugs, such as
steroids. The most commonly used diuretic is caffeine, which also
is on the banned list.
</P>
<P>
Two Romanian weightlifters, Traian Ciharean and Adrian Mateas,
were suspended and expelled from the Olympic Village after failing
out-of-competition tests.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has conducted 760 doping tests at competition sites so
far, in addition to 227 off-site blood tests and 323 off-site
urine tests.

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone subscribers in
China can enjoy another month of free Internet access service via
their cellular phones before they will be charged a discounted
rate, according to sources with China Mobile, the major domestic
provider of wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the China Mobile
Communications Corporation began offering wireless Internet
service on a trial basis in March and announced that wireless
application protocol(WAP)-enabled cellphone users would not be
charged for using the service until the end of May.
</P>
<P>
It then postponed the date to September 20.
</P>
<P>
WAP is a format that provides easy, secure access to relevant
Internet/intranet information and other services through mobile
devices in a cost-effective manner.
</P>
<P>
The WAP-based service is a potentially valuable one, however,
since the users of WAP phones are few at present, and since there
is currently a dearth of information available on WAP-oriented
websites, China Mobile has decided to offer free service for
another 30 days, said a company employee on condition of anonymity.

relief, put in by the central government, is expected to exceed 94
billion yuan(about 1.2 billion US dollars). The central government
also gave powerful support to impoverished areas in large and
medium-sized infrastructure projects, resource development and
biological environmental protection projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
With concerted efforts by the whole society, the infrastructure,
production and living conditions in impoverished areas have been
largely improved, and science and technology, culture, health and
other social affairs have made new progress in poor areas as well.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1999, the number of poor
people dropped from 70 million in 1995 to 34 million, and this
year about 10 million more are expected to get out of poverty. The
per capita income of farmers in 592 counties under the State's
poverty line had been raised from 824 yuan in 1995 to 1,347 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some key impoverished areas have successfully got rid of
poverty as a whole, such as the Yimeng mountainous areas, Jinggang
mountainous areas, Dabie mountainous areas and the southwest part
of Fujian Province. In Yimeng mountainous areas, farmers' per
capita net income has reached 2,035 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that in impoverished areas, over 97 percent
of the townships have access to roads and highways and a steady
power supply. The dropout rates at schools have lowered to 6.9
percent, and 98 percent of the townships have hospitals. The labor
quality and education in impoverished areas has also improved.

<HEADLINE> China's Research Institutes to Operate for Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move aims to accelerate the process of turning these
institutes' new technological findings into marketable products
and to recall the previous close-door academic research system
that existed under the planned economy, said Vice-Minister of
Science and Technology (MST) Xu Guanhua, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Xu made the speech at a conference on the reform of the science
and technology system, which opened Thursday in Hangzhou of east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 4,000 research institutes are engaged in
applied technology development and the rest are involved in
theoretical research.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,000 technology-application-oriented institutes are
to become technology firms, merge with big enterprises or function
as intermediate technology agencies by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 2,000 theoretical research institutes are
expected to follow suit next year, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Calling on regional governments and scientific administrations
to increase financial support within the next two years to help
these institutes achieve a smooth transition, Xu said that
institutes will be able to try share-holding or other ownership
systems, as long as they can maintain efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Sources from MST said that pushing regional government-
subsidized research institutes into businesses is the second step
of reform in the field following the reform on the 242 ministry-
affiliated research institutes, which began last year.
</P>
<P>
Attached to ten bureaux under the State Economic and Trade
Commission, these 242 research institutes began to operate in line
with the market economy in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
So far, these institutes have either become technological firms,
intermediate technology agencies or merged with big enterprises,
according to the ministry's Department for Policy, Regulation and
System Reform.
</P>
<P>
Two of these institutes have been listed on domestic stock
exchanges and another ten are applying to be listed, sources from
the department said.
</P>
<P>
In China, academic research institutes were isolated from
technology development and application under the planned economy,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, research findings were simply put aside after
being evaluated by the State and enterprises could not obtain new
technology.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Elements Implicated in U.N. Worker Murder: Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman disclosed that elements of the Indonesian
Military (TNI) have been implicated in two incidents in the border
town of Atambua, East Nusa Tenggara province, earlier this month,
which resulted in the death of three U.N. relief workers and a
militia leader.
</P>
<P>
He said elements of the military were among the 13 people
arrested and questioned by police in Atambua for their alleged
involvement in the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
However, he stopped short of identifying these elements and
which incident they were allegedly involved in.
</P>
<P>
"The identification of the suspects has been made and they are
in the process of being summoned and interrogated. They include
elements of the military," Darusman was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the suspects were rogue elements of the military
and were acting outside the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TNI spokesman Air Vice Marshal Usodo Graito said he
had heard some local military unit members may be among those
arrested as suspects, but declined to give more details.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue is that the rule of law has to be upheld
because we are under the scrutiny of the international community,"
Graito said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the military will always support efforts to solve
the Atambua case and will not hinder the legal process.
</P>
<P>
Graito said that the government will launch a four-day
operation on Friday as the first phase of its disarming of the pro-
Jakarta militias in East Nusa Tenggara (West Timor).
</P>
<P>
Separately, TNI Commander Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto said the
government has formulated a mechanism to disarm East Timorese
militia in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
If after the familiarization effort the militias still refused
to surrender their weapons, Widodo said, the TNI and Police would
conduct raids on locations where armed civilians were believed to
be hiding.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been facing possible international sanction due
to "its disappointing response" to the bloody incident in Atambua,
in which three U.N. staff members were killed by East Timorese
militias.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. passed a resolution urging the Indonesian government
to disarm and disband all militia elements.

PANAMA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Panamanian firms have been
found by United States and Panamanian drug authorities to be
involved in a 10-million dollar money-laundering scheme for an
international network, the local press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speed Jewelers and Live Silver, both at the Colon Free Zone,

gold trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, which began in April 1999 by the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Panama's Attorney-General's
drug office, have disclosed that "Speed Jewelers" was involved in
false invoicing, delivery of large amounts of cash and checks to
third parties, bank dispensed checks and electronic transfers, to
conceal and whitewash drug-trafficking activities.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns EU's Interference in its Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry on Thursday issued a statement strongly condemning a
European Union message to the Serbian people as gross interference
in Yugoslavia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The FM statement claimed the 15-nation EU message was designed
to influence the will of the Yugoslav people in the September 24
presidential and parliamentary elections, the country's state news
agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
In the message to the Serbian people, EU foreign ministers
urged the Serbians to vote against their elected President
Slobodan Milosevic, even if conditions for voting were not fair: "
To reject clearly and peacefully Milosevic's policies."
</P>
<P>
The message charged that Milosevic has practiced "political
manipulation" and led the people to poverty.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Yugoslav voters faced a "crucial political choice"
at the presidential and parliamentary elections, it instigated the
Serbian people to capture the chance to achieve democratic
transition.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers promised to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia
if the opposition wins crucial elections. The EU imposed an array
of sanctions on Belgrade last year, including an oil embargo,
financial sanctions, and a visa ban on people seen as helping
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
EU ministers also promised reconstruction aid and help to get
Yugoslavia out of isolation and into the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry denounced the message from
Brussels claiming that it constitutes a violation of fundamental
democratic principles. It reflects a flagrant ignorance of the
cultural, political and national identity of the Yugoslavs, and
underestimates their steadfastness in defending their freedom,
dignity and independence.
</P>
<P>
It is an expression of the impotence and incapacity of the EU
leaders to admit the truth and evaluate their own accountability
for the erroneous policy they have been pursuing towards the
Serbian people for a decade.
</P>
<P>
The ministry emphasized that the policy has never had, nor will
ever have, a fertile soil among the Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Gov't Denies Report Linking Former General to CIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government has
denied cautiously the explosive news from Washington, linking
Chile's former secret police chief Gen. Manuel Contreras to the U.
S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), local press reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Chilean Interior minister Jose Miguel
Insulza Wednesday mitigated the importance of the information.
</P>
<P>
A special report, prepared recently for the U.S. Congress by
the CIA, said that Contreras not only supplied the U.S.
intelligence community with information about Chile's armed
services from 1974 to 1977, but also hoped to be paid for his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, CIA officials finally decided not to
bring Contreras onto the payroll because of his hard-line policies,
but the agency did give him a single, undisclosed monetary payment
for his collaboration.
</P>
<P>
"The collaboration between our intelligence body and the CIA
has been pointed out many times. As for the current notion that
they have paid Contreras once or twice, this is a matter that
anyone wanted to investigate and could have been investigated,"
said Insulza.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chilean government would take no action in
response to the news and would leave the matter to the scrutiny of
the courts.
</P>
<P>
Still, Undersecretary of Interior Ministry Jorge Burgos
described the information as "very serious." Speaking on Radio
Chilena, Burgos said that if the allegations against Contreras are
true, criminal actions would be taken against the former general.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a situation that needs to be investigated in the
United States, it is the question of why and how the agency could
have had contact with Contreras," Burgos said. He added that the
information proves that during the 1970s the CIA "was not above (
committing) human rights violations throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Contreras is serving a prison sentence for his involvement in
the 1976 car bomb assassination of Orlando Letelier, foreign
minister of the government of former President Salvador Allende.
Allende was overthrown by a military coup led by General Augusto
Pinochet in September 1973.

<HEADLINE> British Superbike Star Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- British superbike star Carl
Fogarty announced his retirement on Thursday, largely due to a
serious shoulder injury suffered five months ago.
</P>
<P>
With a career featured with fourth world championship titles,
Fogarty said in a joint statement with his team Ducati that he had
decided to retire because he could no longer be competitive.
</P>
<P>
"The time has now come to have the strength to leave racing. I
knew that it would come sooner or later. I want to do it now and
leave everyone with the memory of a victorious Foggy with number 1
on my Ducati," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old took the decision after testing his physical
condition aboard a Ducati 996 at the Mugello circuit in Italy at
the start of the week, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
He felt considerably difficult to maintain a correct racing
position on the bike and was no longer able to ride in a natural
way. "I would no longer have the chance of going for victory," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have had a fantastic career and I can be very satisfied with
what I have done for motorcycling. I don't think I have to
demonstrate anything else."
</P>
<P>
Fogarty won his first world title in 1994 and also took the
championship in 1995, 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Doctors ruled out any chance for Fogarty to return to the track.
His left shoulder was operated on in April after the accident in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The injury has left him with "permanent weakness and loss of
movement", a doctor said. He has undergone an extensive
rehabilitation programme but is not at the present capable of
returning to motorcycle racing," he added.

<HEADLINE> I'm a Humen Being Anyway, Says Schumacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher said on
Thursday he was surprised by worldwide media reaction to his
emotional breakdown and tears at Monza after the Italian Grand
Prix 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"What surprised me was that people said it proved I was human
after all," he said. "For me, it was a surprise because I thought
I was a human being before that happened. That surprised me the
most."
</P>
<P>
The German, two points behind Finn Mika Hakkinen in the world
drivers' championship with three races remaining, was speaking
during a news conference in Indianpolis ahead of Sunday's United
States Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher said his tears were a result of his inability to
cope with the combined effect of realising all that he had done in
winning the race for Ferrari and all that had happened.
</P>
<P>
"It was very strange for me because on the one hand I was so
happy and to have equalled the record of Ayrton Senna was
something special (41 victories), but on the other I had other
thoughts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking of Ayrton, a driver I really admired, and I had
those memories of Imola in 1994 and it was all too much for me."
</P>
<P>
Schumacher said he had a good relationship with title rival
Hakkinen, who drives for McLaren. "It is pretty good, I would say,
" he said. "We are rivals for the championship, but we have a
natural relationship and we have a lot of respect for each other."

<HEADLINE> IAAF Doping Chief Accuses U.S. of Cover-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua)) -- The doping chief of the
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) on Thursday
accused the U.S. of covering up drugs cases among their own
athletes, saying 10 or 12 had tested positive over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with British television's Channel 4 News, Arne
Ljungqvist said: "There are laboratory reports that have gone to
the (American athletics governing body) USATF which we have never
heard of and which they have dealt with and decided to exonerate
without us knowing."
</P>
<P>
The IAAF official, speaking to Channel 4 at the Olympic Games
in Sydney, said there had been "10 or 12 over the last one or two
years".
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 said the drugs had been detected at a laboratory in
Indianapolis. Scientists there had passed their findings on to
USATF but the results had gone no further.
</P>
<P>
"We want to know what is going on," Ljungqvist said.
</P>
<P>
But USATF executive officer Craig Masback denied the accusation,
saying the Americans had given the IAAF details of every case
going back five or six years.
</P>
<P>
He said they had been given a full report on "every case of any
sort". "I can't imagine why they are confused," Masback told
Channel 4 News.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's New Tariffs to Reduce Drug Prices by 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Health and Child
Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps Friday said the implementation of
its new tariffs would help reduce medicine price by at least 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said the Medicines Control Authority would create a
database on medicine price to ensure that manufacturers and
retailers sold drugs at appropriate prices in line with the new
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"All the above was done and will be implemented to ensure that
general Zimbabweans have access to essential drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would soon establish the National
Medical Supplies Company to compete with other pharmacies with the
aim to create competition and reduce prices of medicines.
</P>
<P>
"This new company will exploit this development and purchase
drugs from the international market duty free and pass them on to
the poor people directly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new tariffs, which cover various commodities, were
introduced early this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A visiting high-ranking U.
N. official Friday spoke highly of the relief work by the
Ethiopian government against this year's severe drought.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Bertini, U.N. special envoy to the Horn of Africa,

<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
ordered immediate removal of the barricade on a road leading to
the U.S. Embassy in the capital Abuja, reports reaching here said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a statement issued by the foreign ministry
as saying that Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dubem Onyia
had summoned the U.S. charge d'affairs to complain about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Onyia told the U.S. diplomat that no embassy, anywhere around
the world, was allowed to do so in a foreign and sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government had received several complaints
from Nigerians, including a former head of state who resided in
the area, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official replied by saying that the embassy got an
approval of the former military government, when it built up the
structure for security purposes, according to the reports.

<HEADLINE> France Defends Flight to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- France said on Friday
that a flight ban imposed on Iraq did not apply to noncommercial
flights.
</P>
<P>
A French plane landed today at Baghdad's newly reopened
international airport carrying doctors, young artists and other
activists from France, defying a request from the United States
and Britain, members of the United Nations Security Council's
sanctions committee, that Paris delay the aircraft while they
sought more information.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, French ambassador to the
United Nations Jean-David Levitte said they had no right to do
this, and there was no flight ban on passenger planes providing
its cargo was inspected.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Security Council resolutions demand only
notification of a plane, which "cannot not be equated with a
request for authorization."
</P>
<P>
"There is no such air embargo on Iraq, as the Security Council
imposed on Libya," Levitte said.
</P>
<P>
The embargo applied to cargo and prohibited goods going to Iraq,
not to passenger planes, he added.
</P>
<P>
At issue are the resolutions after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990, which imposed stringent sanctions against Iraq. The
resolutions do not explicitly talk about passenger aircraft but
they exclude all commercial and financial transactions, which the
United States and Britain say include aircraft. The 15-member
Security Council is expected to discuss the controversy sometime
next week.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent a similar flight to Iraq last Sunday and plans
another one on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Assembly Closes General Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A declaration adopted at the 55th session of the General
Assembly, dubbed as the Millennium Assembly, committed governments
to halve in 15 years the proportion of people with income under
one U.S. dollar a day and of those suffering hunger and lack of
safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
They should also ensure equal access to all levels of education
for girls and boys and primary schooling for all children
everywhere during the same time-frame.
</P>
<P>
Countries should begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS,
malaria and other major diseases by 2015.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, they promise, they will achieve a significant
improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the debate, the assembly held a three-day summit
involving nearly 150 heads of state or government, the first of
its kind in the U.N. history.
</P>
<P>
The participants put forward candid ideas and proposals on
peacekeeping, strengthening the U.N., and making globalization
equally beneficial to all at four roundtables.
</P>
<P>
The challenge facing the international community now is to put
into action the commitments "with a sense of urgency, not with
business as usual," said President of the General Assembly Harri
Holkeri in his closing remarks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police captured
Friday the National Liberation Army (ELN) leaders who planned and
carried out the kidnapping of more than 50 people in the country
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, members of the "Omayra Montoya" front of the
guerrillas, were detained in 15 crackdowns of the authorities near
Cali and Jamundi in the Valle del Cauca department.
</P>
<P>
Ruben Dario Gomez Posada, the head of that front, who,
according to the police, led the Sunday kidnapping in two
restaurants and a house, was among the captured rebels. The
authorities revealed that Gomez decided which hostages would be
freed and which would not.
</P>
<P>
So far the rebel group has released 37 persons and still keeps
25. Also captured were Gerardo "Pacho" Benitez, fourth in the
front command that made the kidnapping, and guerrilla member
Martha Rengifo.
</P>
<P>
The authorities seized arms, cellular telephones and computers,
in which letters were found in which the insurgents demanded
ransoms from the relatives of the kidnapped civilians.
</P>
<P>
The police said that it is the same group of insurgents who
kidnapped 180 persons in March of last year in the church "La
Maria" of Cali in the same region of the country.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Peace Process Suffers Blow in By-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's peace
process suffered another blow Friday when Protestant hardliners
won a parliamentary by-election, two days after a rocket attack in
London blamed on dissident extremists.
</P>
<P>
William McCrea, a Protestant pastor and gospel singer, seized
the seat of Antrim South for the hardline Democratic Unionist
Party (DUP) in the parliamentary by-election. McCrea, a bitter
opponent of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, received 11,601 votes
to give him a 822 majority.
</P>
<P>
The result of the Thursday poll was announced early on Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The DUP by-election victory cast a new shadow over the peace
process, as the DUP has campaigned consistently against the April
1998 Good Friday peace accords and the Northern Irish power-
sharing government.
</P>
<P>
The by-election, after the death of a sitting Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP) member, was also seen as an indicator of Protestant
feeling in the first real electoral test since the power-sharing
government was re-established earlier this year.

MANAGUA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food

VICTORIA, CANADA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese navy
task group of missile destroyer "Qingdao" and supporting vessel "
Tai Cang" ended their four-day good-will visit Friday to Canada's
Pacific military base at Esquimalt, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Saying farewell at the dockyard, Canadian Rear-Admiral R.D.
Buck and his Chinese counterpart Lu Fangqiu hugged each other to
express warm relationship between the two navies.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Canadian military officers and men were among well-
wishers seeing off the first visiting Chinese navy ships.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is successful. We have enhanced friendship, widened
our vision, enriched Chinese sailors and officers' experience and
stood a test to our equipment," said Chinese Real Admiral Lu
Fangqiu before departure.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Rear-Admiral Buck termed the Chinese ships and morale
as "impressive". "They demonstrate truly the capability of a
growing navy. And this is of course evidence by their visit to us
from across the Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate there will be continued good-will exchanges such
as this visit," he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Release of Oil From Emergency Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson announced Friday the Clinton administration will
release a limited amount of oil from its Strategic Petroleum
Reserve (SPR) to ease the tight oil supplies and drive down the
prices.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hastily convened news conference after an all-day
meeting of administration officials, Richardson said the U.S.
government will release 30 million barrels of oil over a 30-day
period from its 571-million-barrel reserve.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the drawdown is "not to influence prices
" but to address growing concern about low oil inventories and
inadequate stockpiles of heating oil, especially in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said inventories nationwide are 19 percent lower
than a year ago. In New England, he said, the figure is closer to
65 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Richardson, the first major tapping of the
SPR since the 1991 Gulf War, follows an intense and unusually
public debate by Clinton administration officials in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The debate intensified after Democratic presidential candidate
Vice President Al Gore urged President Bill Clinton Thursday to
release oil in 5-million-barrel test bursts from the reserve
created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo that choked off world
growth.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Gore reiterated his call Friday
for use of the oil reserve to ease tight oil supplies and reduce
prices.
</P>
<P>
Gore's proposal brought sharp criticism from his Republican
rival, George W. Bush, a former Texas oil man, who said that the
reserve is designed to address critical supply interruptions and
not to manipulate the market.
</P>
<P>
Bush, campaigning Friday in Florida, condemned the Clinton
administration's decision to tap the reserve. "The Strategic
Petroleum Reserve should not be used a short-term political fix
for somebody whose administration has been asleep at the switch,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson denied that the decision to tap into the strategic
reserve starting Monday is a political decision to help Vice
President Al Gore.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed After Intel's Profit Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Friday with blue chips rising while tech shares falling
after a profit warning from the world largest semiconductor maker
Intel.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 81.85 at 10,847.37
points, extending its gain of 77.60 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 25.11 at 3,803.76 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 0.33 at 1,448.72.
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower today after Intel announced late
Thursday that its earnings would miss expectations. The latest
warnings added to worries about corporate earnings as the U.S.
economy is slowing after six hikes in interest rates in the past
15 months.
</P>
<P>
Intel, both a component of the Dow index and the Nasdaq
composite, suffered heavy losses from the profit warning. About
308 million shares of the company changed hands throughout the
session, knocking off about 95 billion U.S. dollars in its market
value.
</P>
<P>
But the Dow index recovered in the trading and closed higher as
investors bought stocks of old-line companies such as financial
giant J.P. Morgan and drugmaker Merck. The index fell as much as
144 points early in the trading.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite made a dramatic rebound late in the
session and recovered most of the 214-point loss as investors
rushed in the market to hunt for bargains before the closing.
Among the tech companies hit heavily were Dell Computer, Cisco
Systems and International Business Machines Corp.
</P>
<P>
Intel's warning also hit the Asian stock markets. High-tech
shares in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong were lower.
</P>
<P>
But European stock market recovered later from an early selloff
mainly because major industrialized nations jolted the currency
market with a joint intervention to halt the fall of the euro, the
common European currency.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE volume rose 5.11 at 659.34 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.19 at 929.94. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 4.47 at 518.82.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,511 down, 1,363 up and 484
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.16 billion shares from 1.08 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Private Faculties to Face Significant Decline in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of places
offered by the state and open extramural higher education system
in Romania is higher for the first time this year than the number
of baccalaureate graduates, which has led to lesser interest in
private faculties.
</P>
<P>
The Cotidianul daily on Friday quoted President of the National
Council for Academic Evaluation Ion Mihailescu as saying that the
private higher education system will face significant decline in
the next few years and some of its faculties might have to close.
</P>
<P>
Some state faculties, such as the physics, chemistry and
mathematics faculties of the Bucharest University, will also
reduce their academic places.

<HEADLINE> Greece Announces Measures to Save Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 10-measures, presented by Greek Development Minister Nikos
Christodoulakis, included an information campaign for citizens, a
more efficient use of energy in public buildings ahead of the
winter, investment of 25 billion drachmas (about 64 million U.S.
dollars) in the next six months to promote projects for saving and
co-producing energy, and incentives to promote the creation of
Energy Saving Companies.
</P>
<P>
The measures also envisaged subsidizing the use of non-fossil
fuels in electricity and changes in the pricing policy of Greece's
state-own Public Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
While not ruling out the possibility of imposing a ceiling on
fuel prices, the Greek minister warned that any increase in
consumer product prices, resulting from a combination of high oil
and U.S. dollar prices, would harm both the companies themselves
and the Greek economy.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Greece has decided to cut its fuel tax for the
country's farmers and the government has signed a gentlemen's
agreement with the representatives of refineries, oil distribution
companies and petrol stations in order to implement a six-day
freeze on the country's fuel retail prices.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Welcomes U.S. Using Crude Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The use by the United States
of part of its strategic oil reserves to stop fuel price hikes
will be positive for Venezuela, said Hector Ciavaldini, chairman
of the Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This initiative, recommended by U.S. Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore to Bill Clinton will benefit Venezuela because
it will help stabilize oil price, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ciavaldini said that his company will not sell its oil assets
in the United States, meaning that the Venezuelan refineries in
that country will reinforce their positions and will continue
being a property of the Venezuelan state oil company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States decided on Friday to release oil
from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to damp decade-high energy
prices, the first time the stockpile has been tapped for a
national emergency since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the U.S. government would
release 30 million barrels of oil over a 30-day period from its
571-million-barrel reserve created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo
that choked off world growth.
