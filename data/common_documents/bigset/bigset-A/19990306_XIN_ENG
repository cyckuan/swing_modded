<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Growth Slows Down, Eurostat Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The 11-nation euro zone economic
growth slowed down in the final quarter of 1998, due to falls in
exports and gross fixed capital formation from July to December,
European Union (EU) satistical office Eurostat said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat said euro zone gross domestic growth (GDP) rose by
2 percent in the fourth quarter last year, showing the whole
economy gradually slowed down compared to previous quarter's 0.7
percent GDP growth and one year earlier's 2.4 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
In the 15-nation EU as a whole, GDP growth in real terms slowed
to 0.2 percent in the final quarter last year from 0.6 percent in
the second and third quarters, sending the annual growth down to
2.3 percent from 2.8 percent, Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the euro zone countries include Belgium, Germany,
Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Austria, Portugal and Finland. Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece
are still outside the European Monetary Union team.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Likely to Exchange Civilian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India Friday moved
ahead in talks aimed at finalizing agreement between the two
countries on exchange of civilian prisoners, reported a local news
agency.
</P>
<P>
"The first round of the talks was constructive and we hope for
a positive outcome," said a member of the Pakistani delegation to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the two-day talks was held here Friday while
a joint statement will be issued on Saturday after the concluding
session, according a report of the News Network International.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani official said that details about the prisoners
were exchanged and proposals for timely release of the prisoners
discussed.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have agreed to release prisoners after completion
of their term rather than to keep them in jails beyond their
sentence," said the official, adding that a mechanism in this
regard will be worked out on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Pakistani non-governmental
organization SPARK, there are some 2,500 prisoners of Pakistan and
India in each other's jails.
</P>
<P>
Some of the prisoners were arrested for minor offenses like
crossing over to waters of the other country and overstay.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation was led by Joint Secretary of the Home
Ministry Gurcharam Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Ahmed Jawad
was leading the opposite side.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Won't Export Ideas to Neighbors: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's dominant Taliban
militia Friday told visiting Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart
Tokaev that the Islamic militia will not export their ideas to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want interference in affairs of other countries and
desire friendly ties to the whole world, especially the
neighboring states," Maulvi Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, advisor to
Taliban supreme leader Mulla Omar, said during his meeting with
Tokaev here.
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level contact between the Taliban and
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official flew to Islamabad on Thursday for talks
with the Kazakh foreign minister "at the request of the Kazakh
delegation," according Taliban sources.
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan's neighboring countries, mainly Central Asian
republics were highly concerned over Taliban's victories but now
they are interested to establish ties with them," a Pakistani
official said.
</P>
<P>
Tokaev in his arrival statement described the Taliban as one of
the most influential and powerful forces in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed the U.N.-proposed talks between the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance scheduled for March 10 in Ashgabad,
capital of Turkmenistan, saying that his country fully supports
the U.N. mission for peace and security in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan is anxiously looking forward to the restoration of
peace and security in Afghanistan that is not only vital for
Afghans but also very important for the regional development and
prosperity," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Rises to 4.4 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate rose
slightly to 4.4 percent in February as the manufacturing lost more
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said Friday that even with the slight 0.1
percentage point uptick in the jobless rate, overall employment
remained strong last month with the number of payroll jobs rising
by 275,000, as compared with a 217,000 gain in January.
</P>
<P>
The inflation-sensitive bond market posted strong gains in
early morning trading with investors focusing on the department's
report that average hourly earnings compared to a year ago were up
just 3.6 percent, indicating wage pressures are remaining
contained despite tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing employment fell by 50,000 last month, the biggest
setback since last November, with layoffs especially high at
apparel and aircraft factories.
</P>
<P>
Most economists had been expecting unemployment to edge up
slightly this year as the sizzling U.S. economy slows to a more
moderate growth rate, reflecting a rising trade deficit that has
hit manufacturing and farming especially hard.
</P>
<P>
The big loss of 50,000 jobs in manufacturing meant that since
last March, factory jobs have declined by 337,000 as various
industries have been forced to cut back production to compenstate
for a big loss in overseas markets and an increase in imports
flooding into the United States.
</P>
<P>
The biggest job cutbacks in February were in apparel
manufacturing, which lost 15,000 jobs, more than twice the monthly
job loss of the past year. The manufacturing industry has lost
nearly one-third of its workforce, a total of 306,000 jobs, since
its last peak in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft manufacturing employment fell by 6,000 last month
while job loss in industrial machinery was down 7,000 and
electrical equipmemt makers shed 2,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, employment in service industries increased 263,000
last month led by a gain of 123,000 jobs in retail trade, the
biggest one-month jump in this industry since February 1988.
Department stores, restaurants and furniture stores all posted big
gains.
</P>
<P>
Employment in construction was up 72,000 in February,
reflecting in large part mild weather across much of the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, D'Alema Likely to Discuss Pilot's Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is meeting with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema to discuss a
range of issues, and the acquittal on Thursday by U.S. military
jury of a Marine pilot in last year's gondola disaster in Italy
would surely come out on their table.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton and D'Alema
were to discuss a range of issues including the situation in
Kosovo, the upcoming NATO summit, and some "international
financial architectural issues,"
</P>
<P>
The gondola disaster is not among them, but "if the Italian
prime minister wants to bring this up, this subject will also be
on the agenda." Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
It is most likely for D'Alema to raise the issue in his talks
with Clinton as he was "baffled" on Thursday that the military
jury in Camp Lejeune, N.C. cleared Capt. Richard Ashby of 20
involuntary manslaughter charges in the disaster on February 3
1998.
</P>
<P>
"With that kind of a massacre, with so many casualties, I
think it is a duty to ensure ... that justice is done, and that
is what we are asking for," D'Alema said. "Certainly this is not
an Italian problem, nor does it concern Italy and U.S. relations
alone."
</P>
<P>
Last May, Clinton told D'Alema's predecessor, Romano Prodi,
in a meeting that his "regret is profound" for the disaster. And
he promised the United States would "behave in a completely
honorable way" in responding to the case.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Canada, MetroNet To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Canada Corp. and MetroNet
Communications Corp. are melding their alternative long-distance
and local telephone businesses in a 4.9 billion-Canadian dollars
(3.2 billion U.S. dollars) merger, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The merged company, which will keep the AT&AMP;T Canada name, will
give MetroNet access to the powerful AT&AMP;T brand name in the
business local phone market and garner AT&AMP;T Canada a long-coveted
public listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Players in Canada's telecommunications sector, who are already
pressured by a dizzying restructuring and unprecedented number of
mergers, will also feel more competitive heat from the merger
announced Thursday, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"This deal fulfills our dream in Canada to be a full-service
telecommunications provider for Canadian businesses," said Daniel
Somers, senior vice-president and chief financial officer of AT&AMP;T
Corp.of New York.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the deal will see metroNet shareholders own
69 percent of the merged AT&AMP;T Canada and the remaining 31 percent
held by AT&AMP;T Corp.--well within the one-third foreign ownership
limit on Canadian phone companies.
</P>
<P>
The deal opens another chapter in AT&AMP;T's century-long presence
in Canada. It helped create Canada's monopoly of local phone
market, which it left when it sold a minority stake in phone giant
Bell Canada in 1975. AT&AMP;T entered Canada's long-distance market in
1972, taking a one-third stake in Unitel Communications Inc. The
Halifax-based company was renamed AT&AMP;T Canada in January.
</P>
<P>
By merging with Calagary-based MetroNet, AT&AMP;T Canada will also
be the leading alternative local phone company.
</P>
<P>
Combined, the merged company holds an 11-percent share of
Canada's telephone market of 16 billion Canadian dollars (10.6
billion U.S. dollars) a year which is based on an estimated 1999
revenue of 1.4 billion Canadian dollars (924 million U.S.
dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian spiker Lyudmila Tserenkova
has become the first foreign player in China women's volleyball
league and will play her first match for a Chinese club on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Russian, who stands 1.85 meters, will play as a
member of Tianjin women's volleyball team in the country's
volleyball league from the seventh round, the Tianjin club
official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tserenkova, who has capped twenty times for Russia's national
team and played up to 300 games with her Seashore club in Russia,
flied to Tianjin Tuesday after signing a contract with Tianjin
team, which placed seventh in the eight-team league this season.
</P>
<P>
Gao Shenyang, a deputy director of the Chinese Volleyball
Managemen Center, predicted that the Russian's coming would lift
the curtain of signing imports on a bigger scale.
</P>
<P>
"Other teams will follow Tianjin to buy foreign players to
increase their strength in the near future," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Tserenkova serves as a chief attacker for Tianjin and is
expected to make Tianjin much strong.
</P>
<P>
"Some traditional favorites are likely to be upset," Gao added.

LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has asked the Angolan government to send its own investigators to
probe the allegations that Zambia is providing military support to
Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said here at the State House Friday when he addressed
the Movement for Multi-Party (MMD) officials that he was prepared
to discuss the stand off between the two countries with Angolan
President Jose Edwardo Dos Santos in a spirit of good
neighborliness and reconciliation.

He said Zambia will continue to support the government of
Angola while maintaining tight sanctions on the rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>

Chiluba said he had spoken to Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, who is the chairman of the peace and security committee
for the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), and South
African President Nelson Mandela to enter in the matter.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to President Mugabe as chairman on peace and security
to send Zimbabweans to come and look at our borders to see if the
allegations were true," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Dos Santos to invite a country of his own choice
to carry out independent investigations regarding the alleged
gun-running.

Commerce, Trade and Industry Norman Chibamba has called on the
Zambia Investment Center and the Export Board of Zambia to
organize mini exhibitions from time to time for small-scale
producers to promote and market their products.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba said this here Friday when he officiated at the

He said all the countries in the neighboring states hold mini
exhibitions, making their products superior over Zambian products
which are only shown at annual events like the International Trade
Fairs and the Agricultural Shows.
</P>
<P>
He further called upon women to assist each other by forming
cooperatives and pooling resources together as it was easy to be
heard as a group than an individual.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly advise you to join hands together and form
associations in order to develop yourselves and share each other's
skills as this will increase your capacities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba also said the government acknowledged the important
role women continued to play in national development be it in
social or economic sectors.
</P>

He said it was encouraging to see what the Zambian women in the
 industrial sector were able to do even with minimum assistance

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A study conducted by the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) said Friday
Ethiopia's livestock population accounts for about one-fifth of
the total livestock within COMESA.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, Ethiopia's livestock population in 1997
was estimated at 30 million head of cattle, 22 million head of
sheep and 17 million goats.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia's livestock population will increase during the next
millennium at a much higher rate", it said, adding that "with the
introduction of commercial agriculture, better animal husbandry
and extension services, the rate of increase will be much higher."
</P>
<P>
The study further said Ethiopia's hides and skin export is
expected to increase to 15.6 million yearly in the coming few
years.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the 9th largest cattle population in the world and
is listed number one in Africa. Leather export accounts for 15
percent of the nation's export revenue second only to coffee.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers Remain Divided over Spending Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) agricultural
ministers, at the end of two days of consultations in Brussels,
Friday remained divided over spending cuts demanded by the EU
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The consulations were also marred by the looming danger of a
renewed confrontation between Germany and France over the way
European Union farm spending should be reformed, according to a
report of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The split has threatened to block progress at the March 23-25
Berlin EU summit called to discuss the Agenda 2000 blueprint on
reforming the EU's finances, farm and regional policies.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Karl-Heinz Funke of Germany, which
currently holds the rotating EU presidency, however, said he was
confident that a compromise can be reached during the next round
of talks slated in Brussels for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
French Farm Minister Jean Glavany said he was puzzled by recent
German remarks on the co-financing - Germany's preferred method of
reform - under which EU spending would be cut by shifting part of
the farm-spending burden to member states.
</P>
<P>
He said during talks with Funke on Thursday he had gained the
impression that the issue had been shelved. "I heard positive
remarks," Glavany told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Paris fiercely opposes co-financing which Germany favors
because it would reduce its net payments into EU coffers.
</P>
<P>
Bonn government spokeswoman Charima Reinhardt said, however,
the issue of co-financing was still on. "Co-financing is still on
the agenda," Reinhardt told reporters in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Bodo Hombach, the minister who acts as chief of
staff for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, said that although
co- financing remained Bonn's preference it "had hardly any
chances", indicating that the scheme was no longer under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, EU members Friday presented special requests which
the European Commission reckoned will break the targeted farm
budget of about 332 billion dollars for the period between 2000
and 2006. The Commission said the requests increased the expected
costs by more than 27 billion dollars, the report of DPA said.
</P>
<P>
France, which has advocated an austerity farm reform, had
raised comprehensive demands, conference sources said.
</P>
<P>
Glavany denied the charges as unfounded, adding the Commission
calculations were exaggerated. "This is a disaster scenario," he
said, adding that French demands would result in additional costs
of only 5.41 billion dollars, not 12.97 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Differences were also likely at the next meeting on a reform of
the EU milk regime. "On milk, the differences have hardened,"
Austrian Agriculture Minister Wilhelm Molterer said.
</P>
<P>
While Germany and France see no need for any reform, other
countries, including Britain and Italy, want to scrap production-
limiting quotas.
</P>
<P>
Following consultations with the Commission, Funke has proposed
cuts in guaranteed prices of 25 percent for beef, of 20 percent
for cereals and of 15 percent for milk in a bid to make EU farm
products more competitive on world markets. In return for income
losses, farms may in part receive direct aid.

<HEADLINE> Some Parties Stall Peace in DRC: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe accused "some parties" Friday of stalling peace process in
the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He did not name the parties, but warned that the DRC government
and its allies, including Zimbabwe, were keeping their military
options open in the conflict with DRC rebels, backed by Uganda and
Rwanda, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made these remarks after meeting his South African and
Namibian counterparts, Nelson Mandela and Sam Nujoma, in Pretoria
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the chief regional mediator, Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba, had been unable to move the process forward,
because "some parties" were stalling it.
</P>
<P>
Those in the DRC camp - Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad -
remained ready to sign a ceasefire agreement should the right
stage arrive, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, we will not let go in terms of the
positions that we hold militarily. If the option is that we would
move ahead and fight in order for the situation to improve, we
will do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, Nujoma and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos,
met DRC President Laurent Kabila in Kinshasa earlier in the week
to discuss the military situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Nujoma briefed Mandela Friday on the outcome of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the Kinshasa meeting agreed that Chiluba should be
allowed to complete his consultations with leaders of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) in a bid to end the DRC war.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the three leaders also discussed the Angolan
conflict and the way to implement an SADC decision last year to
support the Angolan government.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
warned against unnecessary travel to Brcko, the Serb republic of
Bosnia, as danger was increasing there because of a decision to
make the disputed town a self-governing neutral district under
international supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Given the controversial and emotional nature of the Brcko
issue and the continuing political instability in the Bosnian
Serb republic, the potential exists for threats to the safety of
U.S. citizens and interests," the State Department said in a
travel warning.
</P>
<P>
"Americans who must travel or remain in these areas during
this sensitive period should avoid crowds and demonstrations,
keep a low profile, stay alert for changes in the security
situation and be prepared to leave on very short notice," the
State Department said.
</P>
<P>
An international arbitration tribunal announced on Friday
that Brcko would become a self-governing neutral district under
international supervision.
</P>
<P>
The panel chose that option instead of awarding the northern
town on the border with Croatia to either of Bosnia's two
autonomous entities: the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb
republic. Both had claimed Brcko.

<HEADLINE> New Efforts on Cyprus Expected April: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said on Friday that there would be new efforts to push
for a settlement to the Cyprus issue after Turkey's elections in
April.
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that there will be attempts after the
Turkish elections," the president told the press.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on remarks by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
that talks on Cyprus are in a deadlock as a result of the Abdullah
Ocalan affair, Clerides said "one must not bother with statements
Mr. Rauf Denktash makes."
</P>
<P>
Denktash had said he would not return to the negotiating table
as a result of the Ocalan affair.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party and accused by
Turkey of being responsible for the 14-year Kurdish independence
fightings in Turkey which claimed at least 37,000 lives, was
arrested by Turkish commandos last month in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has stepped up its criticism of both Greece and Cyprus
following Ocalan's arrest for their support to the Kurdish
independence campaign.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side accused Cyprus of providing
passports to Ocalan and his three women aides, which was denied by
Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Berlin Consulate Guard Shoots at Kurdish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli security guard shot
"immediately and deliberately" into a crowd of Kurdish
demonstrators during recent protests at the Berlin Israeli
consulate at which three Kurds were killed and a fourth later died
from wounds, it was claimed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The claim came from lawyers representing the demonstrators,
whose version of the events on 17 February were made public for
the first time as a memorial service was due to go ahead for the
fourth victim in Berlin's Kreuzberg district, which has a large
Turkish population.
</P>
<P>
A lawyers' statement issued on behalf of the Kurdish
demonstrators said one Israeli security man "shot immediately and
deliberately into the crowd" as demonstrators tried to storm the
consulate. Israeli spokesmen have insisted the shots were fired in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was one of many at European locations in
protest at Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan
being seized by Turkish agents in Nairobi - amid a PKK suspicion
of Israeli help.
</P>
<P>
A German Foreign Ministry statement issued two days after the
demonstration said the Israeli security guards could not be
accused of any wrongdoing and, in any case, held diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no evidence that Israeli security forces
acted in any culpable manner," Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin
Erdmann said, but added that the conclusion was preliminary,
pending further investigation by Berlin police.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In the Romanian economic
landscape, women are an active presence in business, with the
status of both associate and manager of the commercial companies.
</P>
<P>
According to data of the National Trade Register at end of
1998, 36.4 percent of the commercial companies registed in Romania
have women as associate, while 30.6 percent are run just by
manageresses.
</P>
<P>
The number of women at the head of firms in Romania increased
in comparison with 1997, when only 22 percent of the firms were
managed by women, Trade Register data showed.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian women active in business also have their own
association. Set up in 1991, the Association of Woman Managers of
Romania (AFMR) now has 345 members, grouped in six autonomous
branches, with offices in 17 counties.
</P>
<P>
The AFMR enjoys support and is regarded with interest also
abroad, as a full-member of the Confederation des Femmes Chefs
d'Entreprises Mondiale (FCEM), which groups together similar
organizations the world over.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a delegation of woman managers of Romania will
participate in the 46th FCEM World Congress, to be held in

<HEADLINE> UNITA Continues Shelling N. Angolan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Five civilians were killed and 12
others injured Friday during the continued shelling on the
northern Angolan city, Malanje, by the opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), according to Angola
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the city was still under the control
of government army and the national police despite UNITA's
constant attacks by using long-range cannons in the past half
month.
</P>
<P>
Sources from local hospitals said, a total of 605 innocent
civilians have been killed while 700 others injured since the
UNITA forces started its offensives to the city in early January.
In addition, nearly 200 houses have been destroyed by hundreds of
shells dumped on the city proper.
</P>
<P>
On January 4, the rebel UNITA movement launched a large-scale
offensive at Malanje, making the city the third war zone since the
civil war renewed last November, after Huamba and Kuito cities in
central Angola.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the fierce resistance on the part of government army,
the main strength of UNITA backed off after two weeks. But
observers here said UNITA has always attached much importance to
the strategic position of Malanje. Ever since the government army
recovered Mbanza-Congo, capital city of the northern Zaire
Province on February 12, UNITA has reinforced in the area.
</P>
<P>
In another development, UNITA soldiers ambushed Wednesday a
Toyota car in the border station near Nashuri in Lunda-Norte
Province, northern Angola,

killing a foreigner and an Angolan, and wounding at least four
others.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Botswana have
agreed on the voluntary repatriation of more than 2,400 Namibian
secessionists.
</P>
<P>
After a marathon meeting between top government officials of
the two countries, Namibia assured that no reprisals would be
taken against them and that they should return to the Caprivi in
northwest Namibia and resume their normal lives and
responsibilities,The Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The refugees had fled to Botswana since October last year,
fearing government persecution in the wake of a secessionist plot.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the two
countries agreed that the political environment in Namibia and the
Caprivi region was conducive to the return of the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
The paper failed to say when the meeting was held.
</P>
<P>
"The message conveyed to the Namibian nationals was that those
opting for voluntary repatriation would be accorded a safe and
dignified return to their country of origin," said the statement
issued by Namibian Home Affairs Minister Jerry Ekandjo and his
Botswana counterpart, Bahiti Temane.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana also undertook to facilitate the
repatriation process and pledged not to allow the issue of asylum
seekers to damage relations which existed between the two
countries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,450 Namibians from the Caprivi are said to have
crossed into Botswana, including school children and scores of
government employees, after a secession plot of the province was
unearthed last year.
</P>
<P>
Former opposition leader Mishake Muyongo who led the
secessionist plot, and 14 others have been granted political
asylum in Botswana. Now they are waiting for resettlement since
Botswana would not allow them to stay for fear of damage to
relations with Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Ex-Oil Minister Charged With Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Lebanese Oil Minister Shahe
Barsoumian was indicted Friday on charges of misappropriating
state funds during his tenure in the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Six others, including senior civil servants and businessmen,
were also sued on the same charges by public financial prosecutor
Khaled Hammoud.
</P>
<P>
The corruption charges carry a sentence of 3-to-15 years in
prison with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
Barsoumian, who was oil minister from 1995 through most of
1998, has become the first ex-cabinet minister to be charged in
Lebanon's modern history.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of abusing office, falsifying documents to
cover up illegal oil transactions, and bribery.
</P>
<P>
During interrogation, Barsoumian pleaded not guilty on all
accounts, claiming the prosecution was a politically motivated
drive by the new regime to discredit the era under former
President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Barsoumian has been widely considered a protege of Hrawi who
held the presidency from 1989 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Former Director-General of the Oil Ministry Nicolas Nasr, Chief
of the ministry's Commercial Cooperation Department Widad Saadeh,
and Chief of the ministry's Financial and Economic Department
Badawi Semaan are also on the suspects list.
</P>
<P>
Sarkis Qyomodjian, a driver of the ministry, and two
businessmen: Khalil Qambriss, head of Zahrani oil refinery and
Naji Azar, owner of the Eurogulf Company, are also being indicted.
</P>
<P>
Saadeh has become the first female civil servant to be jailed
in Lebanon, a country which has long been beset with corruption
since the 1943 independence from France's mandate.

JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will leave South Africa next Wednesday for a round
of state visits to the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, Norway and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The tour was intended for Mandela to bid farewell to monarchs,
presidents and the people in the northern European countries, the
Foreign Ministry was quoted by Friday's Business Day paper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Much of the visit would be ceremonial, and Mandela's thanks for
the broad popular support in Nordic countries and the Netherlands
for the anti-apartheid struggle would dominate his speeches to
their parliaments, foreign affairs sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's negotiations with the European Union (EU) over a
key trade agreement were likely to be discussed in bilateral
meetings, but little "hard lobbying" was expected, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
During the visits, discussions would also be held to try to
give new content and momentum to bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France Say Troops Must be Part of Kosovo Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain said on Friday
that forces must be invited to Kosovo to ensure a peace agreement
in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued in London and Paris by the British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his French counterpart, Herbert
Vedrine, the two leaders urged the rivalry parties in Kosovo to
make peace agreement as required and "invite" "international
forces" to that region.
</P>
<P>
Cook and Vedrine, who co-chaired the peace talks in Paris last
month, said they "expect the parties to come to the follow-up
conference ready to finalize the interim agreement, including the
agreements for an international military force."
</P>
<P>
They must be prepared to complete a peace deal in the next
round of talks, starting on March 15, including an international
military force in the province, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The co-Chairmen emphasized that an invited international
military force is an integral part of the package. The presence of
such a force is in the interest of the parties," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also warned that "Those who put obstacles in the
way of the successful realization of the Rambouillet Accord will
be held responsible."
</P>
<P>
An initial round of peace talks last month in Rambouillet,
outside Paris, ended in a partial agreement which called on both
sides to return to the bargaining table after consultations at
home.
</P>
<P>
The talks dissolved when Kosovo Albanians refused to give up
the goal of independence and Serbian authorities rejected the
presence of foreign troops on Yugoslav territory.

<HEADLINE> Year 1999 Designated for Blindness Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lions Clubs
International, one of world's largest charitable service club
organizations, has decided to designate the year 1999 as Lions
China Sightfirst Year, calling on its 1.4 million members
worldwide to give more support to blindness prevention and
treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Qin Huasun Friday at a ceremony to mark "Lions Day
with the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Qin, who voiced his thanks to the organization for the decision,
said, "China, on its part, will take corresponding steps and mark
'Sightfirst' the theme of May 16, 1999, China's National Day of
Helping Disabled People designated by state law which falls on the
third Sunday of May each year."
</P>
<P>
"On the day, various activities in this connection will be
carried out" throughout China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the Lions Club International is playing
an active role in promoting social development and social
welfare, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The organization "has had markedly developing relations and
cooperation with China and rendered China very useful assistance
and support in its efforts to improve medical service, aid the
poor, help disaster-stricken areas," he said, citing a good
example of such assistance and support of the "Sightfirst China
Action."
</P>
<P>
The "Sightfirst China Action" is a project aimed at resorting
sight to the visually impaired in China. It is a blindness
prevention and treatment project, the largest of its kind in the
world, being developed with the combined efforts of China and the
Lions Club International.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the Lions Club International, the project is jointly
organized and implemented by the China Disabled Person's
Foundation and the Chinese Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
"It is an extensive project, covering epidemic research,
medical services, education on prevention of related disease,
blindness treatment, statistics compiling and management," Qin
said.

<HEADLINE> Swazis' Deficit to Take 3.8% of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's budget deficit
for the next fiscal year would be 3.8 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), Finance Minister John Carmichael has said.
</P>
<P>
The expected revenues for next fiscal year was 2.55 billion
Emalangeni (425 U.S. Dollars), against an expenditure of 2.83
billion Emalangeni (471. 7 million Dollars), South African media
Friday quoted Carmichael as saying in his budget speech to
parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This would leave a deficit of 276.2 million Emalangeni (46
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The economy of the tiny mountain kingdom expanded by 3.5
percent in 1997, slightly faster than the population grew,
Carmichael said.
</P>
<P>
But estimates for last year indicated that the level of
economic activity had slowed down, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asia's crisis and higher interest rates in neighboring South
Africa were the main reasons for the slowdown, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the regional economic heavyweight and many of
Swaziland's exports go to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Carmichael also expressed concern about the growth of non
performing loans in the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, a landlocked nation of 915,000 people, has a per
capita GDP of about 1,100 U. S. Dollars. Its economy is heavily
dependent on sugar, pulp and timber, and half of government
revenues are derived from a customs union with South Africa.

organizations (NGOs) operating in Ethiopia signed a Code of
Conduct document at Africa Hall here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the Code of Conduct,
the first of its kind in Ethiopia, will provide a comprehensive
framework for voluntary self-governance of the NGO sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony of the document, Chairman of

Ahmed said the Code of Conduct will improve the quality of
services provided by NGOs and enhance partnership among NGOs, the
government, development partners and the private sector.

He said the Ethiopian government expects responsible and
law-abiding NGOs to fully exercise the Code of Conduct and provide
an enabling environment for their operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Christian Relief and Development Director Kebede Asrat said on
the occasion that the Code of Conduct creates the common ground
for NGO self-regulation and practices.
</P>
<P>
He urged the signatories to ensure the sensitization of their
staff, other pertinent bodies and the general public about the
essential of the Code of Conduct and actively contribute toward
its observance.

<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cypriot government and an Israeli joint venture
have signed a contract for the construction of a desalinization
plant.
</P>
<P>
The new desalinization plant, at an estimated cost of nearly 20
million Cyprus pounds (40 million U.S. dollars), will supply
Nicosia and Larnaca districts with 13.14 million cubic meters of
water annually.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli joint venture, made up of the companies IDE and
OCEANA, will assume all the cost for the provision and
installation of electronic and mechanical equipment, and all
necessary construction to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
The contract stipulates that the Israeli venture will run the
plant at its own expense for 10 years and sell the desalinized
water to Cyprus at 42.2 Cyprus cents (84.4 cents) per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
The plant will automatically become the property of the
Cypriot government after 10 years, but the contract also provides
for the possibility to buy the plant before the 10-year period is
over.
</P>
<P>
This unit is the second such plant on the island and is part
of Cyprus' government plan to ease the water problem.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The value of the Arab exports to the United States
declined from 17.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 to 14.5 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the 19 percent decline is the slump of oil
prices," Al-Hayat daily quoted a report by U.S. Department of
Trade as saying.
</P>
<P>
The slump of oil prices also reflected negatively on the value
of the U.S. exports to the Arab world that rose from 20.2 billion
dollars in 1997 to 21.1 billion dollars in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- An advisor to the U.S. Department of State said the
U.S. was willing to develop its trade relations with Qatar, adding
that he discussed here the possibility of singing a pact with
Qatar on joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Jean Caleski, who is here on a visit, held talks on Wednesday
with Qatari Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade Youssef Hussein
Kamal on cooperation in the areas of economy and trade as well as
investment promotion, Al-Hayat reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks were part of the arrangements for the next
Gulf-U.S. economic meeting due to be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
on Tuesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Jordan's former Minister of Industry and Trade
Mohammad Saleh Hourani said the value of his country's exports
to Iraq under the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food deal hit 380 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Before concluding his tour of Yemen leading a Jordanian trade
delegation, he said the volume of Jordan's oil and oil-by imports
from Iraq amounted to 4.8 million tonnes, valued at 340 million
dollars under the current prices.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Dow Jones industrial average
shot at the record high in the noon session Friday as investors
believed that the Federal Reserve would have no reason to raise
interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The Blue chip index climbed 201.03 at 9,668.43 at midday,
surpassing its record closing high of 9,643.32 and intraday high
of 9,647.97 on January 8. The Dow gained 191 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher at midday. The
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 37.90 at 2,330.79
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 22.11 at 1,268.75.
</P>
<P>
The stocks rallied after the Labor Department reported that
the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.4 percent in February
and the number of payroll jobs increased by a
better-than-expected 275,000 last month. The report led
investors to believe that the U.S. economy will continue to
expand without any inflationary threats and therefore, the
Federal would have no reason to raise interest rates in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy Speaks Highly of "Sightfirst China Act" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Qin Huasun, Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, on Friday sang
in high praise of "Sightfirst China Act," a project aimed at
restoring sight to the visually impaired in China.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech to the ceremony marking "Lions Day with the
United Nations" here, Qin said the "Sightfirst China Act" is a
blindness prevention and treatment project, the largest of its
kind in the world, being developed with the combined efforts of
China and the Lions Club International.
</P>
<P>
The Lions Clubs International, one of world's largest
charitable service club organizations, has decided to designate
the year 1999 as Lions China Sightfirst Year, calling on its 1.4
million members worldwide to give more support to blindness
prevention and treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the Lions Club International, the project is jointly
organized and implemented by the China Disabled Persons'
Foundation and the Chinese Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
"It is an extensive project, covering epidemic research,
medical services, education on the prevention of related
disease, blindness treatment, statistics compiling and
management," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project is being carried out in two phases, the first phase
from year 1997 to 2001 and the second phase from 2002 to 2006, Qin
said.
</P>
<P>
"China is a developing country with a huge population," he
said, "The population of the blind in China is also the largest
in the world."
</P>
<P>
The population of the visually impaired has reached 9 million
in China, out of which 4 million are blind because of cataract.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government had paid much attention to the
treatment of cataract patients. However, due to the present
economic conditions and technological levels, especially with the
growth of the sheer size, and the aging, of the population, we are
having 400,000 new cataract patients every year, adding severe
difficulties to our already daunting rehabilitation work," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Lions Club International decided to earmark 15
million U.S. dollars to China for executing the "Sightfirst
China Act."
</P>
<P>
The fund is designed to help China, in the five years of its
first phase, conduct 1.75 million cataract sightrestoring
surgeries, train 11,000 medical stall specializing in
ophthalmology, set up ophthalmic divisions in 100 county-level
hospitals and disseminate basic knowledge on blindness prevention
and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, "great achievement has been made thanks to
the unfailing support and assistance of the Lions Club
International and the concerted efforts of the vast number of
people working in the medical circle and the many different
departments and institutions in the society," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1997 and 1998, 711,000 cataract sight-restoring
surgeries were conducted, 98 percent of those patients had
improved eyesight after the surgery, and 90 percent of those
patients regained their eyesight, said the Chinese ambassador,
adding that 1,260 ophthalmologists and 1,526 paramedics in the
country-level hospitals were trained.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 58 medical teams have been dispatched to 488
counties scattered throughout the 30 provinces in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, one of the medical teams conducted 1,000
free-of-charge cataract-related operations and implantation within
30 days in Tibet, a part of China with an average altitude of
12,000 feet above sea level, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The strong ultraviolet rays there have led to a high
proportion of cataract patients among the Tibetans," he said,
"Taking this as a special case that warrants extra attention, the
Chinese Government has made Tibet a priority area in the
implementation of the 'Sightfirst China Action'," he added.

<HEADLINE> New Conference on Kosovo to Be Held in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The new conference on Kosovo will be
held from March 15 in Paris, the French Foreign Ministry announced
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It is planned that the conference, called from March 15 in the
wake of the meeting of Rambouillet and whose objective was lately
recalled by the French-British co-presidency, will be held in
Paris at the center of International Conference," said the foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
No deadline is given this time for the Serbian government and
Kosovo Albanians to reach an agreement, but French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine and his British counterpart Robin Cook,
who are co-chairmen of the Rambouillet conference, said that the
two sides are expected to finalize a political agreement at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
While summoning on Friday the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians to
attend the new conference, the two foreign ministers said that the
purpose of the conference is to make the two conflicting sides of
Kosovo sign an agreement which is aimed at granting Kosovo
substantial autonomy to be guaranteed by an international military
presence.
</P>
<P>
They said that a military presence in Kosovo is "indissociable"
with a political agreement and conforms with the interests of both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who obstructs a finalization of a political agreement
will be held responsible for the failure of the talks, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the situation in Kosovo is deteriorating and
said that those who resort to force go against the expectation of
the international community and their action will be taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain will intensify contacts with both the
Serbian government and Kosovo Albanians in preparation for the
conference, said the two foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have accepted the principle of the political wing of
a peace plan presented by the six-nation Contact Group, but refuse
to allow the deployment of a NATO-led international force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Albanians have also accepted the peace plan, but
fall short of giving up their call for the holding of a
self-determination referendum after a three-year interim period.

ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The outlawed Turkish Workers and

bomb blast earlier Friday against Cankiri Governor Ayhan Cevik.

responsible for this terrorist incident and bring them to justice.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "We think that the terrorists followed the
daily route of Cevik and they set off the bomb by remote control
just as the governors' car was passing by."

<HEADLINE> Annan Lauds Lions Club's Efforts in Sightfirst Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday set a high value on the world-renowned "Sightfirst
Program" sponsored by the Lions Club International, one of world's
largest charitable service club organization, in its effort to rid
the world of preventable and reversible blindness.
</P>
<P>
"With your commitment, and most importantly through good deeds
and good works, you are bringing positive changes into people's
daily lives," Annan said. "You are giving tangible meaning to the
idea of a caring, responsive international community."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks in his speech to the 21st
annual "Lions Day with the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Annan gave several reasons for the United Nations to applaud
the "Sightfirst Program." They are:
</P>
<P>
"First, Sightfirst is being carried out at a time when official
aid to developing countries has reached new low. You are setting a
good example for Governments, particularly Governments with a
capacity to contribute," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, Sightfirst represents a long-term commitment. One of
the major challenges the United Nations faces is to convince
governments to think about issues in a long-term way rather than
from year-to-year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And third, you are focusing on prevention. The old saying
about 'an ounce of prevention' is true, whether we are talking
about personal health or peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations also shares the Lions' concern for the
care and well-being of the world's older persons," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations and the Lions have many things in common:
the food aid we bring to people hit by natural disasters such as
Hurrican Mitch (in Latin America); the education we do about
environmental degradation; the programs we have for people with
disabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we still face a range of threats. Some are
ancient, such as hunger, war and bigotry. Others are new, such as
global warming," he said. "There are also insidious threats, such
as corruption, the lack of good governance and the proliferation
of arms."
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of a new millennium offers us a compelling,
symbolic opportunities to join together to consider new ways of
coping with these and other challenges," he said.

AMMAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh, a loyalist
to late King Hussein's policy and a supporter of peace with
Israel, has been sworn in as prime minister with the new Jordanian
cabinet Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, a 60-year-old moderate politician who has been
parliament member in the last 10 years and has held several
ministerial posts, is a staunch defender of Jordan's 1994 peace
pact with Israel and a campaigner of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
His appointment marked the first major executive move of King
Abdullah Bin Hussein since taking power in February.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's approval of the 23-member cabinet of technocrats and
liberal politicians reaffirms his commitment to carry on Hussein's
policy of gradual liberalization and peace-making in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Sacking many of the former ministers loyal to his uncle, former
Crown Prince Hassan, who narrowly lost the throne, Abdullah urged
the new cabinet to consolidate ties with the United States, Israel
and the Middle East Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet groups 15 new ministers, six of whom have held
previous ministerial posts, including Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
Eight major ministers were retained from the previous cabinet,
including Foreign Minister Abdul al-Khatib, Interior Minister
Nayef al-Qadi and Finance Minister Mishail Marto.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the new cabinet will carry on the economic
and political portfolios of the former government headed by Fayez
Tarawneh, whose six-month mandate since August 1998 was mostly
under Hassan who acted as regent when King Hussein was receiving
cancer treatment in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
All of the Hassan loyalists in the Tarawneh cabinet were purged
from the new government, including Tarawneh himself and the
ministers of planning, water and irrigation, trade and industry,
and industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning Rima Khalaf, who had held the same post in
early 1990s, is the only female member in the Rawabdeh government.
</P>
<P>
The new government is faced with a batch of sticking problems,
including the 6.1-billion-U.S.-dollar foreign debt, an
unemployment rate hovering at 15 percent and a 30-percent poverty
rate in the 3.8 million population of the kingdom short of natural
resources.

<HEADLINE> Albright Supports Brcko Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday praised the decision to make the
disputed Bosnian town of Brcko a self-governing neutral district
and urged Balkan leaders to support it.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the decision is the right one, at the right time.
Looking back over the past year, I do not see how any other
decision could have been made or any reason for its delay," she
said in a written statement released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Albright also warned Bosnia's two autonomous entities -- the
Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic -- to "take
seriously an international arbitrator's warning that if one of
them should obstruct implementation... the arbitration tribunal
can award Brcko to the other."
</P>
<P>
An international arbitration tribunal announced earlier Friday
the disputed Bosnian town would become a self-governing neutral
district under international supervision.
</P>
<P>
The panel opted for the district alternative instead of
awarding the northern town on the border with Croatia to either of
Bosnia's two autonomous entities: the Muslim-Croat federation and
the Serb republic. Both had claimed Brcko.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted that the 1995 Dayton peace agreement gave
arbitrator Roberts Owens, an American lawyer, "absolute authority"
to resolve the Brcko dispute.
</P>
<P>
She said Bosnian leaders, as well as Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman,
personally committed themselves to implement the decision when
made. "I call upon them to fulfill that commitment," she said.

<HEADLINE> Measures Urged to Fight Rising Crime, Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin on Friday called for strengthened efforts to crack down
on the country's rampant crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Crime is attempting to penetrate into power structures and it
must be stopped," Stepashin told a plenary session of the State
Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The activities of criminals become increasingly professional
and their aspirations to come into power are growing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Acting Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, who also spoke at the
session, said large-scale corruption among officials has become a
destructive force in Russia.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years prosecutors have exposed 56,000 crimes
against government services, among them 17,000 bribery cases. Over
6,000 bribe-takers and bribe-givers have been tried.
</P>
<P>
Describing crime in Russia, he said that almost 2.6 million
crimes were registered last year, or almost 8 percent more than in
1997.
</P>
<P>
There was a particularly high growth in the number of felonies
such as murders and armed robberies that resulted in the 5,000
deaths last year.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of premeditated murders in Russia is five times
higher than in France, and about seven times higher than in
Germany and Finland," Chaika said.
</P>
<P>
According to Vyacheslav Lebedev, chairman of the Supreme Court,
over 1.38 million people were sentenced in Russia last year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Joint Fight Against Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 (xinhua) --Tanzania Friday urged both
governmental and private sectors to work together to deal with
the approaching year 2000 millennium bug (Y2K) problem.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma told a day-long workshop for
ministers and permanent secretaries here that Y2K problem was not
only a catastrophe to the government but also to all sectors.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ministries to set up special teams, in
collaboration with the national Y2K authority, saying all
ministers should put maximum efforts

in fighting the Y2K bug and be kept fully informed of the
progress.
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine the scenario when the entire telecommunication
system of the country switches itself off, airport communication
network, banking, hospital and electronic equipment operation
halt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma also urged private sector to join forces in countering the
issue by

playing a pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
"All companies which deal with information technology and
electronics should support both financially and technically this
initiative to counter the millennium bug problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also called for international support for
implementing the Y2K projects, adding that Tanzania cannot afford
to live in isolation.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized by the National Y2K Advisory Team,
with the support from the World Bank and the British government,
to draw awareness of participants on the scope and magnitude of
the potential implication of the Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Accuses Greece of Supporting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem Friday accused Greece again of supporting terrorist attacks
against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Cem, who was in Kayseri
province of central Turkey, as accusing Greece as a terrorist
country.
</P>
<P>
Cem reiterated Turkey's call on Greece to cut all its links
with the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and its related
organizations, despite Greece's denial of links with the PKK.
</P>
<P>
"We want the support that is provided for terrorism on Greek
soil to be cut and the close relations between Greece and the PKK
to come to an end," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who had been hidden by Greek
diplomats in Nairobi, Keyna was captured by Turkish special agents
in mid-February and brought back to a jail on Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for
Kurdish independence in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's arrest had triggered Kurdish demonstrations and
protests around Europe and the Middle East, some of which turned
violent and bloody.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Soar on US Jobs Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON March 5 (Xinhua) - Europe's stock markets received a big
boost Friday after eagerly awaited US employment figures calmed
fears that US interest rates were heading higher.
</P>
<P>
"The figures show that inflation on the other side of the
Atlantic is under control and so worries the Fed will have to
raise rates seem to have dissipated somewhat," said Richard Batty,
global equity strategist at HSBC.
</P>
<P>
By the close, the blue chip index had climbed 104.1 points or
1.7 percent to 6205.5, just 102 points below its record close of
6307.6 set on February 24.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index closed higher on the day, boosted
late in the session by hefty gains on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The electronically-traded Xetra closed 2.5 percent higher at
4840.81 points. The Floor Dax gained 3.43 percent to 4839.09.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks also ended 2.4 percent higher on Friday, also
boosted by the US employment figures.

The Cac 40 index closed up 101.57 points at 4189.56. The index

<HEADLINE> Germany's Greens Open Congress With Attack on EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The German Greens Party opened a
three-day congress Friday evening with the promise of some lively
debates to come about party structure and policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
Co-leader Gunda Roestel started the ball rolling by launching
an attack on the European Union (EU). The EU should not be
concentrating exclusively on economic issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
That was "no longer enough. Europe must take more seriously its
political responsibilities as one of the largest, most powerful
and richest regions on this earth," she said.
</P>
<P>
She described the war in Kosovo as an "abysmal example of
political impotence" which showed that Europe was still a long way
removed from common policies. She also called for a strengthening
of the European Parliament and of citizens rights.
</P>
<P>
Although the green's party is in coalition with the Social
Democrats (SPD) in the federal government, its popularity has been
falling and it has descended into a renewed factional struggle
between the pragmatic "realos" and the fundamentalist "fundis" in
a battle which was thought to have been a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
Part of the fundamentalist wing oppose the security policies of
the government and are thus by definition also opposed to German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a co-leader of the Greens.
</P>
<P>
The issue of security is scheduled to be debated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The party's share of the vote has been falling consistently,
with the party's electoral backbone, young people, apparently
turning away from it.
</P>
<P>
In the election in the state of Hesse in February, the party
polled 7.2 percent, down from 11.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the "realo" wing believe that the party needs
to concentrate more strongly on education and jobs rather than the
environment and on vague exhortations such as "fighting U.S.
imperialism."
</P>
<P>
The congress is due to discuss the European Parliament
elections in June and decide on candidates.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Scots to Shun Separatism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday issued a strong warning against independence in Scotland
and urged the local people to avoid separatism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Labor conference in Glasgow, the second largest
city in Scotland, he said Scotland had two choices -- "a future of
divorce from the rest of Britain, or a future that you can trust,
where we welcome and recognize the diversity and the difference
that Scotland can make within the UK."
</P>
<P>
"Our creed is solidarity not separatism and always will be," he
said while campaigning for the Scottish parliament.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the May 6 election would be a "momentous date in
Scotland's history" and "a battle between social justice, and
separatism."
</P>
<P>
"That is a battle everyone of us came into politics to fight,"
he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Blair also promised that if Scotland returned a
Labor administration in May, by 2003 every classroom in Scotland
would have at least four modern computers -- but he inadvertently
announced a reduction in the target number of computers in
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a minimum of four computers in every primary and
every secondary classroom," Blair said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, D'Alema Discuss Pilot's Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton met with
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema on Friday seeking to smooth
over relations between the two countries after shock and outrage
over the acquittal by the U.S. military jury of a Marine pilot in
a cable car accident that killed 20 skiers in Italy a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Before Clinton met the Italian prime minister in the Oval
Office, the two leaders posed stiffly for photographers and did
not comment. The meeting had been set up long ago, but it came
just a day after the "not guilty" verdict.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is a testament to the strength of our
relationship that we've been able to work through these very
difficult and tragic circumstances in an open and honest and
straightforward way," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly understand their strong feelings," he said. But
he said he was limited in commenting further because of issues
still to be litigated.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said on Thursday right after the verdict that he was
"really baffled" that the military jury in Camp Lejeune, N,C,
cleared Capt. Richard Ashby of 20 involuntary manslaughter charges
in the accident on Feb. 3, 1998. He also said the situation had
strained U.S. relations with Italy, a NATO ally.
</P>
<P>
"With that kind of a massacre, with so many casualties, I think
it is a duty to ensure... that justice is done, and that is what
we are asking for," D'Alema said. "Certainly this is not an
Italian problem, nor does it concern Italy and U.S. relations
alone."
</P>
<P>
Last May, Clinton told D'Alema's predecessor, Romano Prodi, in
a meeting that his "regret is profound" for the disaster. And he
promised the United States would "behave in a completely honorable
way" in responding to the case.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Demonstrators Condemn Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chanting "we want peace", thousands
of Zambians marched to the State House here Friday and held a
rally there to condemn the spate of bombings which rocked the
capital city of Lusaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Frederick Chiluba said at the rally that violence
must be opposed, and violence must be condemned.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists must be considered as "wild animals" as they
targeted the very important and critical installations like
electricity and water supply facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said there is no single political reason for anybody to
resort to violence.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the rally also condemned the bombings, which
left one Angolan security officer dead and another Angolan
national wounded and the embassy building wrecked badly.
</P>
<P>
The explosions also caused water shortages for three or four
days in most parts of the city, sending many people to fetch water
from afar.
</P>
<P>
On Angola's recent repeated accusation that Zambia is supplying
arms to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) rebels, Chiluba once again strongly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zambia want to be friend with Angola and does not
want to be involved in the war of the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
He said as Zambia does not even have money to improve its
educational system and hospitals, how can it find money to buy
arms to go to fight.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he is ready to meet "brother" Dos Santos, the
Angolan president on the matter and receive any country Santos
trusts and let it send people to come to watch what is happening
on the border areas between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia has nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his country supports the Angolan government led by
Santos and condemns UNITA for renewing the civil war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he asked Thursday Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, Chairman of the Defense and Security Commission of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), to come to check.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes to Italy for Cable Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Friday that Americans were "profoundly regretful and apologetic"
about the cable car accident that killed 20 skiers in Italy last
year.
</P>
<P>
The president was indicating his effort to defuse tensions
with Italy over the acquittal of a Marine pilot who was
responsible for the accident.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say to the people of Italy on behalf of the American
people, we are profoundly regretful and apologetic for what has
occurred to the families and all of the people of Italy," Clinton
said at a joint news conference with Italy Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema at the White House.
</P>
<P>
He said Defense Secretary William Cohen would meet with his
Italian counterpart to review operation changes designed to avert
similar accidents.
</P>
<P>
While showing no intention to comment in detail on a pending
case, Clinton said the United States remained determined to assess
responsibility for the accident.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema thanked Clinton for "the sorrow he decided to express,"
but said he expected someone to be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is responsible for this terrible tragedy,"
the prime minister said. He added he was "personally shocked and
so is the Italian public's opinion."
</P>
<P>
Clinton responded that "the United States is not trying to duck
its responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"We are horrified and heartbroken by what happened and we will
do our best to make sure something like that doesn't happen
again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders noted there was further judicial action pending
and they gauged their comments so as not to influence it.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that at the end of the process it is made clear who
was responsible for this accident and that these people are
punished for it," D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said Thursday that he was "really baffled" that the
military jury in Camp Lejeune, N.C., cleared Capt. Richard Ashby
of 20 involuntary manslaughter charges in the accident on Feb. 3,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force to Establish 10 Expeditionary Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force announced
Friday it would set up 10 "expeditionary" groups that would rotate
responsibility for deployments to trouble spots like Bosnia and
the skies over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the new structure, Air Force crews would know well in
advance when they might be sent overseas, and for how long they'd
have to stay.
</P>
<P>
Those in each group would be on call for deployments during one
90-day period every 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization was an effort to ease the strain of
increasing overseas missions and to improve morale in the face of
a growing exodus of pilots for higher-paying jobs with airlines.
</P>
<P>
The new groups are intended to deploy around the globe within
48 hours for military missions. Another five groups were set up to
perform humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
Each "air expeditionary force" will total about 250 planes,
including fighter jets and heavy bombers as well as
reconnaissance, electronic warfare, refueling and transport
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Every force would be about half the size of the 2,000-troop
units that went to battle during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization, to be put in place by next January, is the
first major overhaul of the service's structure since the end of
the Cold War.

organizations in other countries, Hu said.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Xinhua Reports on NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) entered its second day today,
with the deputies including some senior officials gathering in
groups to examine the government work report delivered by Premier
Zhu Rongji on Friday. Highlights of Xinhua reports on the second
day of the annual NPC session are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Reports on Development Plans, Budgets
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, delivered a report on the Implementation of
the 1998 Plan for National Economic and Social Development and on
a Draft 1999 Plan for National Economic and Social Development.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng delivered a report on the
implementation of the Central and Local Budgets for 1998 and on
the Draft Central and Local Budgets for 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- Engineering Project Quality
</P>
<P>
The issue of engineering project quality became a glaring one
on the day, with a number of deputies including Premier Zhu Rongji
spelling out their views.
</P>
<P>
In his discussion with the delegation from Hunan Province, in
south China, Zhu stressed the importance of guaranteeing the
quality of engineering projects while the country is increasing
investment in infrastructure construction in a bid to boost
domestic demand and promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who uses the hard-earned money of the people to build
shoddy construction projects 'as fragile as the bean curd' will
become an unforgivable sinner against the people," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from panel discussions of other provincial delegations
held the similar view on the issue. Ye Rutang, a vice minister of
construction, also focused on the engineering project quality in
his speech, while Chen Xiaolin, chief engineer of the Gezhouba Dam
Group, a main contractor of the mammoth Three Gorges Dam Project
on the Yangtze River, disclosed that the company has recently
issued a "quality control declaration" to assure the project's
owner.
</P>
<P>
-- Anti-Corruption Bill
</P>
<P>
A group of 31 deputies from Shanghai placed a 1,600-word motion
for enacting a law against corruption. The bill was handed over
upon their arrival in the capital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is so widespread that it has even eroded the
judicial organs, posing a grave threat to the people's interests
and social stability," said Zhang Zhongli, 78, a senior advisor of
the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences who initiated the motion.
</P>
<P>
The existing laws, including the Criminal Law, have only
covered a small number of misconduct, and the punishment rendered
to the corrupt people are very limited and cannot serve as
deterrent to corruption, according to the deputies from the
country's largest metropolis, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that a special court be established to timely
handle corruption cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia Saturday protested against
the dismissal of Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen by
international peace coordinator Carlos Westendorp and demanded an
immediate international investigation.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp's decision Friday "cannot be regarded as a routine
act by the Head Representative which is within the extensive power
vested in him by the Council for the Enforcement of the Peace
Agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina," the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Poplasen became president through "an election that had been
unambiguously recognized by the international community as lawful
and democratic" and that had the approval of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"An emergency situation has arisen which requires extremely
careful consideration and analysis," the Interfax news agency
quoted the statement as saying.

"This year's flood season will come in just two or three months,
and we must take precautions against possible serious flooding,"
the premier said, adding it wasn't rare in history that serious
floods hit the country's major rivers for two consecutive years or
even several consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to highlight the significance of increasing the
farmers' income and maintaining social stability in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
"A major task for the rural work is to increase the farmers'
income," said the premier. "If the farmers' income doesn't go up
or increases too slowly, the implementation of the central
decision to boost domestic demand and the sound development of
both urban and rural economies will be affected directly," he said.
</P>
<P>
While praising Hunan for its successful maintaining of
stability in the rural areas, Zhu also noted a lot of
destabilizing factors still exist in some areas of the Chinese
countryside.
</P>
<P>
"We must pay close attention to these factors and try to
dissolve them by positive and appropriate means," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized some grass-roots officials in the rural
areas for their over-simplified work methods, crude work style and
sometimes abuse of power for private benefits.
</P>
<P>
"Four points must be guaranteed in order to maintain social
stability in the rural areas, which, in simple words, are 'no
changes to the land contract system, no heavy burden on the
farmers, no cut in grain price and no fierce look to people,'" he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged leading officials at all levels to strengthen
their sense of self-discipline, handle affairs with justice and
strictly in accordance with the law, always consult the general
public before making any major decisions, and improve their skills
of persuasion and explanation, so as to "nip all destabilizing
factors in the bud.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Visit Bahrain to Extend Condolences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
is expected to lead a high-ranking government delegation to Manama
on Sunday to extend condolences for the death of Bahraini Emir
Sheikh Isa Bin Sulman Al-Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the prime minister's office said Lebanese government
will issue an official statement later to express the country's
sorrow over the death of the emir, who died of heart attack early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The emir's funeral was reportedly planned for later Saturday.
The Manama trip will be Hoss' second one in less than a month to
pay condolences to deceased Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
On February 10, Hoss went to Amman to offer his sympathy with
the Jordanian people over the death of King Hussein Bin Talal. He
and President Emile Lahoud did not attend Hussein's funeral on
February 8.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese leadership was under fire by the public for
failing to be present at the funeral, which brought most of Arab
countries' rulers and world leaders together.
</P>
<P>
This time the government's quick reaction to the death of the
emir was believed that it feared a late response would draw
criticism again from the public.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Uses New Mosquito Nets to Curb Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is launching new
insecticide treated mosquito nets to curb malaria which claims at
least 100,000 lives nationwide annually.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health, Dr.
Gabriel Upunda, told a ceremony in Dar es Salaam Friday that
Tanzania records some 16 million malaria-related cases each year.
</P>
<P>
"Between 30 to 60 percent of children's deaths caused by
malaria could be reduced if Tanzanians are ready to use the
nets," Upunda was quoted by Saturday's newspaper The Guardian as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Deo Mtasiwa, said
that research has proved that the new kind of mosquito nets
developed with the fund of the British government are effective.
</P>
<P>
He said that the normal efforts to combat the disease are
difficult because of Tanzania's insufficient technology, funds
and medicines, but the new nets will work well.
</P>
<P>
During the launching ceremony, 20 mothers were given free
mosquito nets which sell at 2,500 Tanzanian shillings (about 3.6
U.S. dollars) each.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Lee Hsien Loong on Environment of Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong has stressed the importance of fostering an
environment of innovation in his country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Woodlands Plant of the
U.S. 3M Company, Lee said Singapore must promote a culture of
innovation in its own way and tackle the twin challenges of
encouraging an innovation mindset in the people and of building a
national environment that supports such a culture.
</P>
<P>
Referring to fostering an environment of innovation, Lee said
the government's strongest influence will be in the area of
"supportive conditions" for factor inputs.
</P>
<P>
He said the government must build a national R&AMP;D
infrastructure, protect intellectual property rights, improve the
quality of the information infrastructure, create a trusted and
conducive environment for electronic commerce and channel
financing to promote innovation.
</P>
<P>
Besides providing supportive conditions, Lee said, the
government's main contributions are to remove as many regulatory
barriers as possible and to ensure that its policies help the
market to work efficiently and effectively.
</P>
<P>
On the existing innovation environment in his country, Lee said
there are some 20 research and tertiary institutes covering a
broad range of high technology areas like data storage, wireless
communications, microelectronics and manufacturing technology.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said half of Singaporean homes now have personal
computers and half of them have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the environment for risk-capital is improving, the
venture capital industry is growing, and cumulative funds under
management exceed 7 billion Singapore dollars (4.1 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government should improve the environment to encourage
entrepreneurship, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
But the best environment is not a spoon-fed one, where the
government meets all the needs of would-be entrepreneurs and risk
takers, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is one where firms compete fiercely against each other for
capital, and face rigorous discipline of the market, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The 3M is one of premier manufacturing companies in the U.S.,
having more than 73,000 employees all over the world and
operations in more than 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
The 3M Woodlands Plant, located at Woodlands Avenue 7 in
northern Singapore and covering an area of 550,000 square feet, is
a facility that incorporates state-of-the-art manufacturing
technology for the fabrication of flexible circuits.
</P>
<P>
The plant was built at a cost of 400 million Singapore dollars
(240 million U.S. dollars), the largest built by 3M at one time
outside the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Increased Cooperation Helps Hong Kong Recovery, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that increasing economic cooperation between the
mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is
beneficial to the latter's economic recovery and future growth.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, director of the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua
News Agency, made the remarks while he joined Hong Kong deputies
to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) in examining the
government work report delivered by premier Zhu Rongji at the NPC'
s 2nd Session which opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the sustained and fast economic growth in the
mainland will help Hong Kong maintain its economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, China's gross foreign trade volume hit
324 billion U.S. dollars, or on a par with the previous year,
which played a big role in preventing Hong Kong's export from a
possible nose-dive slide. Hong Kong was affected by the Asian
economic turmoil in the past year or so.
</P>
<P>
Last year trade volume between mainland and Hong Kong stood at
134.7 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 38 percent of Hong Kong'
s total; Hong Kong's entrepot trade relating to the mainland took
up 60 percent of Hong Kong's total such trade.
</P>
<P>
Upon the request from the Hong Kong SAR government, mainland
departments organized more tourists to Hong Kong, with the number
increasing by 13 percent over the previous year to about 2.6
million, representing 27 percent of the total tourists Hong Kong
received in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The economic strategy for 1999 presented in the government
work report calls for a pro-spending financial policy to expand
domestic demand. This will create favorable conditions for Hong
Kong's economic recovery," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said as the mainland will continue the reform and opening-up
efforts, Hong Kong will have better chances to develop the
regional economy and consolidate its status as an international
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Over the past dozen years, the mainland has been the main
destination for Hong Kong's overseas investment while Hong Kong's
financial market has been the mainland's main channel for
international fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, Hong Kong investors pumped money into 7,830
projects in the mainland, with realized investment totaling 20.6
billion U.S. dollars, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Hong Kong investors to increase investment in the
mainland amid the general economic slowdown in the region, saying
they can explore more opportunities in such sectors like
agriculture, hi-tech industry, basic industries and infrastructure
or in regions along the Yangtze River and the central and western
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua Hong Kong Brach chief urged people from all social
sectors in Hong Kong to make concerted efforts to maintain Hong
Kong's economic prosperity and social stability in front of the
lingering impact of Asian financial crisis.

WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Air Force jets on Saturday
bombed five Iraqi anti-aircraft sites after being fired on during
a patrol over the northern no-fly zone, U.S. military officials
said.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. 'Strike Eagles' released GBU-12 laser-guided bombs on
five Iraqi artillery sites south of Saddam Lake," said a spokesman
at U.S. Incirlik airbase in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the strikes began after U.S. and British
planes observed Iraqi anti-aircraft positions firing at them.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq were enforced by
the United States and Britain right after the Gulf War in 1991.
Iraq has said it no longer recognized the no-fly zones and would
challenge any Western planes invading its air space.

BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) today called on the CPPCC members to choose
some of the country's long-existing and universal problems for
investigation and study this year and then, on the basis of this,
put forward their proposals and suggestions to the central
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to make greater efforts in coordinating
relations, defusing contradictions, enhancing unity, and mobilize
all the positive factors and join their efforts to fulfill the
tasks set forth in a government work report.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made
the remarks at a group discussion attended by CPPCC members of non-
Cpmmunist parties to the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee which opened here on March 3.
</P>
<P>
"As a key organizational form for multi-party cooperation and
political consultation under the CPC leadership, the CPPCC has a
galaxy of talents and wide connections," the CPPCC chairman
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We should therefore mobilize all the people to make concerted
efforts to attain the goals put forward in the government work
report" delivered by Premier Zhu to the ongoing Second Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his complete support for the report, Li said: "We
have achieved great success during the past year, but we also face
a lot of problems. We can not neglect problems because of the
achievements, nor should we deny that the current situation is
generally favorable because of the existing problems."

<P>
CPPCC National Committee members from the China Zhi Gong Party
and Taiwan Democratic Self-government League took part in the
group discussion today, which focused on such topics as employment,

<P>
PYONGYANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on Saturday strongly denounced an annual human
rights report issued by the U.S. State Department, claiming the U.
S. held the absurd and vain hope of trying to change the political
systems of other countries by claiming they have "human rights
problems."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry told the Korean
Central News Agency that the "U.S. human rights standards" were
applicable to no country. He strongly criticized Washington for
making willful and improper comments on the human rights situation
in DPRK as well as other states.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that each nation had its own human rights standards
based on its traditions, national characteristics, cultural and
social development, adding that belittling other nations according
to the "human rights standards" of one particular country would
complicate and damage international relations.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has its own standards of human rights which were in
the best interests of the Korean people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Stresses Engineering Project Quality (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
stressed the importance of guaranteeing the quality of engineering
projects while the country is increasing investment in
infrastructure construction in a bid to boost domestic demand and
promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who uses the hard-earned money of the people to build
shoddy construction projects 'as fragile as the bean curd' will
become an unforgivable sinner against the people," Zhu, also a
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark when
hearing deputies from central China's Hunan province who are here
attending the Second Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), China's legislature, deliberating the government
work report he delivered to the session Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the capacity of an NPC deputy representing Hunan, Zhu
expressed his view on the province's economic development,
especially the construction of infrastructure projects and the
rural work.
</P>
<P>
"Last year the central government made a resolute decision to
boost domestic demand and correspondingly adopted a pro-active
financial policy, thus achieving marked results," the premier said,
adding that "We will continue to follow the policy this year."
</P>
<P>
However, the key to the success of this major decision lies in
making good use of the construction funds and ensuring the quality
of all engineering projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that at present there are a large number of
construction projects being built or to be undertaken in Hunan,
which is making great efforts to rebuild areas devastated by last
year's summer flooding, improve the local ecological environment
and upgrade urban infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Local officials must show a high sense of responsibility for
the people and history, carry out comprehensive quality monitoring
and management throughout the construction process of all projects,
and make sure that nothing goes wrong with these projects," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
At present, top priority should be given to the construction of
various water conservation projects, especially to reinforcing
dams and dykes along the Yangtze River and harnessing the Dongting
Lake.

<HEADLINE> New Guidelines on Hypertension Management Unveiled in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 Guidelines for the
Management of Hypertension published by the World Health
Organization and the International Society of Hypertension were
unveiled in Hong Kong Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A major change in the new Guidelines is the introduction of
more rigorous target blood pressure levels, namely below 130 mm Hg
Systolic and below 85 mm Hg diastolic pressure, as compared to
below 140 mm Hg and below 90 mm Hg in the 1993 version of the
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
This was based on evidence largely from recent trials that
intensive reduction of high blood pressure markedly lowers
cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.
</P>
<P>
Other changes include the classification of hypertension by
using the terms of grades 1, 2 and 3 instead of the terms of
stages 1, 2 and 3, and choice of drugs among six major classes to
start treatment, and emphasis on the need for two or more drugs in
combination to achieve blood pressure goals.
</P>
<P>
The six commonly used classes of antihypertensive drugs are
diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists,
angiotensin II antagonists and alpha blockers.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines also underline the need to tackle other
cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, smoking,
overweight and lack of physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lars H. Lindholm, a member of the new Guidelines
Committee, said at a press conference that with tremendous
collaborative effort by medical experts around the world, the
Guidelines intend to guide specialist physicians in countries
across the world to better manage patients with mild hypertension
before they develop serious complications like diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chun-ho Cheng, president of Hong Kong College of
Cardiology, said the release of the new guidelines will not only
sound the alarm against hypertension in Hong Kong but also give
doctors an optimal goal to work towards in the management of
hypertension.

Kasymzhomart Tokaev said Saturday that a meeting between Kazakh
President NurSultan Nazarbayev and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif will soon be held to further cement relations between the
two countries.

Tokaev did not disclose the exact date of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Kazakh people attached great importance to relations
with "their Pakistani brothers."
</P>
<P>
"This is reflective from the fact that Pakistan was one of the
few countries that the Kazakh President visited in 1992 soon after
Kazakhstan became independent," Tokaev said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expresses Willingness to Talk if Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel said on Saturday that it
is ready to talk with Lebanon if Beirut is serious on its
intention to offer Israel security guarantees after it withdraws
from south Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Office issued a statement
in response to the remarks made by Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss on Beirut's intention to secure the Israeli-Lebanese border
after Israeli withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' office said in a statement Saturday that Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon will restore stability and security
to the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hoss told BBC in an interview on Friday that he will
stop guerrillas from launching cross-border attacks on Israel if
Israel pulls back its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said he would renew an armistice agreement signed with
Israel in 1949, which banned both sides from staging military
actions across the border.
</P>
<P>
Observers termed the remarks a significant change which would
open up new chances to end the Israeli military presence in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, senior Israeli officials said that Israel would prefer
actions than words, such as agreeing to deploy Lebanese army in
south Lebanon after Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
The move came at a time when Israel is renewing a fierce public
debate over the necessity of Israel's maintenance of a
15-kilometer deep border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a declared aim of protecting its northern
areas.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's government has been seeking an Israeli withdrawal
with security guarantees from Beirut but without first entering
negotiations with Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have rejected the Israeli offer of a troop
pullback conditioned on security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Damascus wants to use the issue of south Lebanon to press
Israel into concession over Syria's Golan Heights seized by Israel
in 1967.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Education in Sub-Saharan Africa
has improved with 60 percent school-aged children enrolled, United
Nations Children's Fund said in its newly-released report entitled
The State of the World Children 1999.
</P>
<P>
From only 25 percent in 1960, the regional primary enrolment
rate now stands at nearly 60 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among countries achieving primary enrolment rates of 90 percent
or more are Botswana, Cape Verde, Malawi, Mauritius, South Africa
and Zimbabwe, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, almost twice as many boys as girls in the region
attended primary schools. The gap has narrowed considerably, with
girls' primary attendance rate now 57 percent and boys' 61
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that armed conflicts and economies
burdened with debts have taken a severe toll on education.
</P>
<P>
The region includes over 30 heavily-indebted countries, and
governments spend as much on debt repayment as on health and basic
education combined --
</P>
<P>
about 12 billion U.S. dollars annually, which results in poor
teacher education, crumbling school buildings and lack of learning
materials in many countries.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Three Gorges Project in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen ninety-nine will be a
peak year for the construction of the Three Gorges Hydropower
Project on the Yangtze, according to the chief engineer of one of
the project's main contractors.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaolin, chief engineer of the Gezhouba Dam Group, is now
in Beijing attending the ongoing session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) as a deputy to China's top legislature. The Gezhou
Dam Group is among the chief contractors of the Three Gorges
Project.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, a bill to build the project was passed at the Fifth
Session of the Seventh NPC. Upon its completion, the project, with
a total cost of more than 200 billion yuan and a power generating
capacity of 17.68 million kw, is expected to play a major role in
preventing flooding in the middle reaches of the Yangtze and
increasing the country's power supply.
</P>
<P>
"As an NPC deputy as well as one of the project's chief
engineers, I feel a strong sense of responsibility," Chen said. He
said he agreed with Premier Zhu Rongji, who gave top priority to
ensuring the quality of construction projects, saying the Three
Gorges Project is very important to the country and "the
responsibility of people involved in the project is greater than
Mount Taishan."
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 when construction of the project was started, more
than 36 billion yuan has been spent on the project; in 1997, the
river was successfully dammed according to schedule; and last year
the project site survived severe floods that devastated parts of
the Yangtze valley downstream. The second phase of the project's
construction has been going on smoothly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the first peak of the project's construction, 11.3
billion yuan will be spent, pouring 4.47 million cubic meters of
concrete, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project owner -- the Yangtze Three Gorges Development Corp.
-- and contractors are all paying great attention to ensuring
engineering quality for the project, he said. The Gezhouba Dam
Group has recently issued a "quality control declaration" and the
project's owner has tightened supervision over engineering quality,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Swissair Crash Costs Canada 62 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The investigation into Swissair
Flight 111 and the recovery effort have cost the Canada's federal
government 62.8 million Canadian dollars (41.4 million U.S.
dollars), the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There will be additional expenditures as investigators continue
the task of trying to piece together the twisted wreckage of the
plane that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near Peggy's Cove on
September 2 last year, killing all 229 people on board.
</P>
<P>
About 88 percent of the aircraft has been recovered as well as
the remains of all 229 passengers and crew, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), which spent
about 10.62 million Canadian dollars (seven million U.S. dollars)
on investigating the crash, has an international protocol that
states it will not seek to recover the costs of a probe in
Canadian territory from a foreign country or airline, TSB
spokesman David Austin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other Canadian agencies involved in recovering and identifying
the shattered remains have not indicated if they will take legal
action against Swissair or anyone else to recover costs.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the federal government costs were incurred by the
Department of National Defense, which spent about 33.7 million
Canadian dollars (22.2 million U.S. dollars) to send several
vessels and hundreds of personnel to St. Margaret's Bay to recover
bodies and wreckage.
</P>
<P>
TSB spokesman David Austin said about 25.97 million Canadian
Dollars (17.1 million U.S. dollars) of the federal government
costs represent what would have been spent to run the various
departments and agencies anyway. But the recovery effort added
about 36.8 million Canadian dollars (25.4 million U.S. dollars) to
cover such things as leasing a huge barge to haul pieces of
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
The estimates do not include the expenditures of several
provincial and civilian agencies involved in the aftermath of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
"The cost could have been much higher if it had not been for
the fishermen who went out in their boats and volunteers who
searched the shoreline for debris," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> UNDP, Tehran University Work on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's prestigious Tehran
University Saturday signed a project document with the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) on human rights research and
training.
</P>
<P>
The document, "Strengthening Capacities for Human Rights
Research and Training," was signed by Dean of the Faculty of Law
and Political Science Mohammad Reza Takhshid and UNDP resident
representative Michael von der Schulenburg in the presence of the
visiting UNDP Assistant Administrator Nay Htun.
</P>
<P>
The project aims at promoting human rights as laid down by
international standards and by Islamic law and jurisprudence, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The project includes introducing a human rights master degree
program (two years) and a doctoral degree (five years), the first
ever degree courses on human rights in Iranian universities.
</P>
<P>
The document also envisages implementation of six research
projects in two phases, including seminars, workshops, interviews
and field studies, each lasting two years.
</P>
<P>
Schulenburg said that it was the most important project
document he had signed in the seven years he had worked in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. welcomes the spirit of cooperation the Iranian
authorities have shown and we hope the project will bring Iran
increasingly into the global discussion of human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the West's sharp criticism of its human rights
record, Tehran said it observes human rights according to the
country's constitution and Islamic rules.
</P>
<P>
Iran set up an Islamic Human Rights Commission in 1995 to
counter Western allegations.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan delivered
a speech in Tehran University on World Human Rights Day and the
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson also
visited Iran for a regional human rights workshop in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Aid Worker Killed in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Somali aid worker serving the
United States aid agency, CARE-International, was killed and two
others were seriously wounded by gunmen in Somalia's capital on
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, unidentified gunmen have opened fire
at a land cruiser hired by CARE-International in which several men
were traveling.
</P>
<P>
The deceased, a security guard for the aid agency, died
instantly during the shooting spree, while two others sustained
gunshot wounds, one of whom in very critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack on the CARE-International station's
wagon truck is not known. However, people in the area said the
gunmen looked like armed bandits. The land cruiser had escaped
from the gunmen as the driver who was also wounded sped away.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses also said the gunmen had been hanging around
in the area for some time for probably attacking any valuable
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
There's no word as yet from the CARE-International staff in
Mogadishu over the incident, but the attack has increased people's
worries about the security situation in the city.
</P>
<P>
The attack against the aid workers has taken place at a time
when high- level foreign diplomats including the EU Commission
counselor and the Italian ambassador to Somali are paying separate
visits to Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that the Somalis are in bad need of
humanitarian assistance, the Somali faction leaders have requested
the foreign diplomats to supply food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Condemns U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday strongly
criticized an annual human rights report issued by the U.S. State
Department, saying it is "replete with conjecture, factual
inaccuracy and exaggeration."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Office stated said the
Country Report on Human Rights Pakistan for 1998 issued by the
U.S. "is based on unsubstantiated and incorrect information as
evident from the fact."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that most of the sensational claims are preceded
by such words as "it is widely believed."
</P>
<P>
The report has been compiled mostly from tabloids, hearsay and
so-called "off the record" conversations, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He provided an example to defend his arguments: the U.S. report
discounts the authenticity of the International Labor Organization
survey which recently gave a positive assessment on Pakistan's
efforts to curb child labors, and instead cites "exaggerated and
statistically inaccurate figures" of child labors in Pakistan
spread by an externally financed non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman admitted that Pakistan confronts some
difficulties in the field of human rights mainly due to poverty,
underdevelopment and illiteracy. But he added: "Developed
countries, like the United States, should support the 'Right to
Development' in Pakistan and other developing countries."
</P>
<P>
"This basic right cannot be advanced by the approach of censure
and sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties created by poverty and external
intervention, the spokesman said, Pakistan remains a functional
and vibrant democracy.
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan has taken a number of steps to
further promote and protect human rights including the
establishment of a Commission on the Status of Women, crisis
management centers for women and additional women's police
stations, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We remain responsible to sincere and constructive criticism,"
he said. "But those who sit in judgment must not ignore ground
realities and inherent difficulties particularly in the developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that the U.S. too has many human
rights problems.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the context of this year's Commission on Human
Rights, the U.S. has been named by Amnesty International as one of
the six countries of "principal concern," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Emir Dies of Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Emir of Bahrain died of a
sudden heart attack on Saturday morning, the official Bahraini
Gulf News Agency quoted a statement issued by the general office
of Bahraini emir as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Sheikh Isa Bin Sulman Al-Khalifa died of a sudden heart
attack in the morning," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The emir's son, Crown Prince and Commander-in-Chief Sheikh
Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa assumed the throne quickly after his
father's death.
</P>
<P>
"I am assuming the rule of Bahrain, relying on God, exerting
all the efforts possible to serve our country and our people,"
Sheik Hamad said in a statement carried by the news agency. He
said he would continue his father's policies.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khalifa died shortly after being sent to hospital. He
collapsed shortly after his meeting with visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
A speeding motorcade had accompanied the ambulance that rushed
the emir, 65, to a hospital in the Bahraini capital of Manama.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain state television interrupted its programs to broadcast
recitations from the Koran, the Islamic holy book, a traditional
sign of the death of a senior official in the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khalifa, the tenth emir of the State of Bahrain, was born on
July 3, 1933 in Manama. He became ruler of Bahrain on December 16,
1961.

<HEADLINE> Rural Market Eyed as Engine for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- With an annual income of tens of
thousands of yuan, Zhou Xingren, a farmer from central China's
Hubei province, said he was deeply troubled about where to spend
the money.
</P>
<P>
"I had wanted to buy a color TV, but power is on and off in my
village, and we can hardly have clear images on the TV screen
thanks to poor signal transmission," grumbled Zhou, a deputy to
the National People's Congress, who is here attending the annual
session of the NPC, China's top lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the supply of everyday goods is far from sufficient
on the market near my village," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's experiences mirror a paradox in the nation: while
consumer demand has remained weak despite the government's
stimulatory measures, less than 20 percent of rural households own
common consumer electronics and electrical appliances such as
televisions, washing machines and fridges. In other words, the
potential of the rural market is far from being exploited.
</P>
<P>
That's why NPC deputies attending the NPC session here agree
that developing the rural market is an "inevitable choice" in the
search for ways to expand domestic demand to drive up economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Developing the rural market is of strategic importance for
increasing domestic demand and stimulating economy, according to
Li Peiran, an NPC deputy and a university professor from Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
"While consumer spending in cities has 'plateaued,' that in
rural areas has remained at a low level," he said. "There is vast
room there for demand increase."
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the rural market has been largely neglected by
the country's business community, which has the misunderstanding
that cities provide most business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
But official statistics present a different picture: the rural
population, 900 million strong, is greater than that of whole
Europe; during the 1996-2000 period, one-tenth of all rural
households are expected to renovate their houses, at a cost of 72
billion yuan; an increasing number of farmers now have the
financial capability to buy consumer electronics and home
appliances, and if their buy power is translated actually into
purchases, the country's electronics and appliances industries can
hardly meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
The government has been aware of this and Premier Zhu Rongji
has called for "fully tapping the domestic market, the rural
market in particular" in his government work report to drive up
economic growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Data from the NPC session also indicate that local governments
are already taking steps to stimulate the rural market.
Agricultural provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi and
Henan have vowed to launch infrastructure projects in rural areas
that will improve power supply, water supply and transportation
conditions there.
</P>
<P>
Hubei plans to inject nine billion yuan into renovating its
power grid in rural areas in three years, and the first phrase of
the project has been kicked off with an investment of 2.5 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
This year, Guangxi will build more than 20,000 kilometers of
rural highways, spend 440 million yuan improving power supply to
rural areas, and increase agricultural input to six billion yuan
from last year's five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some industrial enterprises have begun manufacturing goods that
cater to farmers. Konka, a TV producer, has developed color TVs
for rural households and plans to expand its sales network
throughout rural China. Dongfeng Automotive Group is expanding the
production of farm-use vehicles.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies expressed belief that an activated rural market
will contribute to China's economic growth in years to come.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Better Education in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
called on the people to invigorate the development of Tibet
Autonomous Region by advancing local science and education.
</P>
<P>
"We should precede from a point of view of modern science and
technology to formulate development strategy for Tibet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC), made the remark when attending a panel discussion of a Tibet
delegation attending the Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tibet has unique advantages of resources, he called
on the people to improve education of the Tibetans and use modern
science and technology to help them out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"We must concentrate on fostering a group of scientific and
technological talents in Tibet while developing a contingent of
ethnic Tibetan officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urges other provinces in the country to make greater efforts
to help Tibet advance science and technology.
</P>
<P>
After hearing speeches by Tibetan NPC deputies, Li said that
Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and the Party Central
Committee and the State Council have been paying great attention
to the construction there and the life of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan people have overcome various difficulties and
scored great achievements in economic development and social
progress under the leadership of the Party committees and
governments at all levels, Li said, adding that "these are hard-
won successes."
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts should be made to handle well the
relations among reforms, construction and stability. "Tibet can
achieve greater development only when it maintains stability," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 1 Mystery Organ Donor Helps out 6 Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The organ donation by a Lebanese
woman has helped six people, including a young soldier with a
critical heart condition, the Voice of the People radio reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the 60-year-old donor was not disclosed, but
the radio said it was the first time in Lebanon that so many
organs had been donated from a single person.
</P>
<P>
The woman died Friday and her heart, kidneys, liver and
corneas were taken to the country's American University and Rizk
hospitals, where the transplant operations were performed.
</P>
<P>
The heart went to a 23-year-old soldier who was close to death
and the other organs to five separate patients, according to
medical sources.
</P>
<P>
The donation came only five days after Lebanon's first
National Association for Organ Donation was established. The
birth of the organization raised hopes that huge recipient
waiting lists will shrink with the availability of more body
parts.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly desperate patients are ignoring doctors' warnings
and traveling to Iraq or India where they can buy organs and
undergo surgery for about 10,000 U.S. dollars instead of the
14,000 dollars charged in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only around 10 percent of transplant
patients in the country receive organs from cadavers, as opposed
to 90 percent in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Rebels Integration Into Govt Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is eyeing
integration of the rebel New People's Army (NPA) guerrillas into
the country's armed forces and the conversion of areas inhabited
by the rebels into model farm communities.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio-TV program on Saturday, Philippine National
Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said should the peace talks
with the NPA resume and a final settlement is reached, the rebels
can be integrated in the army.
</P>
<P>
Howard Dee, chairman of the government peace panel negotiating
with the rebels, said in the program that there is a possibility
that the government can give out titles to former rebels for the
lands they had formerly occupied.
</P>
<P>
These lands, in turn, will be grouped into agrarian reform
communities with full funding support from the government, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he is
willing to grant whatever reforms allowed by the constitutions
that the NPA may ask for once the suspended peace talks with the
group resume.
</P>
<P>
"We will give them the reforms they want as long as they do not
violate the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada suspended formal peace negotiations with the rebels
following their abduction of two military officers and a police
inspector last month.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government will return to the negotiating
table only if the NPA releases the three officers unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Set to Privatize Mass Media Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
concluded plans to privatize the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), New
Nigerian newspaper and Daily Times, Nigerian Minister of
Information and Culture John Nwodo has said.
</P>
<P>
Nwodo said the decision to privatize the three media
organizations was made at the first Federal Executive Council
meeting of the present administration, press reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting the Chairman of Bureau of
Public Enterprises, Hamza Zayyad, in Nigerian capital of Abuja on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the Nigeria Television Authority
(NTA), the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), and the
Voice of Nigeria (VON) have been slated for commercialization.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has appointed privatization consultants to assess
the three organizations, he said, adding most staff of the media
houses have flowed to emerging private broadcasting stations.
</P>
<P>
Zayyad told the minister that arrangements are being made for
the privatization of parastatals under the Ministry of Information
and Culture.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Scholars Air Views on Growth Goal for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- "The government-set growth rate of
seven percent for the national economy in the new fiscal year is
realistic and can be realized through hard work," said Professor
Xiao Zhuoji, a well-known economist from Peking University and a
member of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
He listed a number of favorable conditions to support his
opinion, such as last year's good agricultural harvest, sufficient
supplies of capital goods, a relatively comfortable financing
environment, and an improving international financial and economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Xiao's view was shared by other CPPCC national committee
members from academic circles during discussions on the government
work report delivered Friday by Premier Zhu Rongji at the ongoing
annual session of the National People's Congress. They agreed that
the new economic growth target could be reached if enough efforts
are made.
</P>
<P>
The scholars spoke highly of the central government's timely
decision last year to expand domestic demand and promote economic
growth with a proactive financial policy.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Haikuan, honorary president of the Financial Institute
under the People's Bank of China, said that this year's growth
objectives are made on the basis of a fairly rapid economic
development in 1998. "If we can maintain the high growth rate seen
in the second half of last year, this year's growth for the
national economy can be higher than last year's," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xiao warned of some negative factors that represent
road blocks on the way to achieving the country's growth objective.
He listed them as follows: that it is increasingly difficult to
stimulate investment with financial means; that the situation of
insufficient market demand has yet to change; and that the number
of workers laid off by state-owned enterprises is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies pointed out the need to develop the rural market,
the car market and the housing market as a way to drive up
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Li Wuwei, an economist from the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the urban market is becoming saturated and
needs to be restructured, while the rural market has a great
potential and offer good prospects for industrial manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
While holding a supportive view on the new growth objectives,
the scholars cautioned against making rash decisions.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the government to pay attention to
establishing a proper relationship between speed and economic
efficiency," Professor Xiao said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy in Tehran for Talks on Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's
Special Envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi arrived here Saturday
in an effort to restore peace to the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Brahimi told reporters that during his
five-day visit to Iran, he will hold talks with Iranian officials
on further pushing forward the efforts to solve the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. has called on Afghan belligerent parties to
practice restraints and solve the issue through patience, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said that a delegation from the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) would also join the talks for restoring a
lasting peace to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the killing of Iranian diplomats by the Afghan
Taliban militia in Afghanistan last year, the U.N. envoy said that
the Taliban has expressed optimism for the settlement of the
issue and the U.N. is also following up the case.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and a
reporter in Afghanistan last August after they took control on
Mazari Sharif, a stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance
headed by President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific
Affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh said that bringing those involved in the
murder to justice is among other issues being pursued by Iran
during Brahimi's stay in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said Brahimi's talks in Iran would focus on following up
U.N. resolutions and approvals of the meetings of regional
countries on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the "6 plus 2" group formed by Afghanistan's six
neighbors plus Russia and the U.S. last year condemned the murder
and called for an end to massacres in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Aminzadeh said that peace and security in Afghanistan
would not be realized in the absence of all Afghan groups in a
broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi's talks on Afghanistan would be comprehensive, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Albright in London to Discuss Kosovo, Lockerbie, Bananas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, on the home-bound leg of her Asia visit, stopped in
London on Saturday for briefings on the Kosovo Albanians'
intentions towards a Contact Group peace plan and for talks with
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, which are expected to
include Lockerbie and the U.S.-EU trade row.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Senate majority leader Bob Dole met Kosovo Albanian
representatives in Macedonia on Friday and was scheduled to report
to Albright in London on Saturday morning, the Reuters news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
"Dole will be in a better position to assess their intentions
on signing up to the accord," spokesman James Rubin was quoted as
telling reporters on Albright's plane, "We want not only a
favorable outcome, but the sooner the better."
</P>
<P>
General Wesley Clark, the U.S. Army general who commands North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces in Europe, was expected
to brief Albright along with Kosovo mediator Christopher Hill and
Jim O'Brien, a State Department official helping with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, Albright will see British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook to discuss Kosovo issue, the latest
developments in the Lockerbie dispute with Libya and the
escalating trans-Atlantic banana trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
Cook on Friday called the meeting with Albright as a chance to
discuss how to smooth British-American relations which have been
strained by the trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to telephone U.S.
President Bill Clinton again later on Saturday to discuss the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
But both American and British officials stressed that Albright
was primarily in London for briefings on the intentions of Kosovo
Albanians towards the peace plan proposed by the six-nation
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
A British official on Saturday said the hastily arranged
meeting between Cook and Albright should not be billed as "crisis
talks" for bananas. "This is one of (Albright's) refueling stops.
Naturally they will discuss the banana dispute and world trade,
but there are other issues for them to discuss," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American diplomatic sources confirmed that Albright
was not putting the trade dispute high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Bananas are not going to be a prominent part of their
discussion," said a U.S. official traveling with Albright.
</P>
<P>
The two will meet at Cook's official residence at Chevening in
southeast England on Saturday afternoon, when Cook will brief his
American counterpart on his visit to Russia while she will report
on her visit to Asia, the British official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, their discussion is expected to cover the conflict
in Sierra Leone and the recent murder of British and American
tourists in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> One Dead, 23 Injured in Bomb Explosion in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- One person died and 23 others were
injured when a homemade bomb exploded and gunfires rang in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The man died after a bullet hit him in the hip and went through
his stomach, while the injured sustained gunshot wounds in the
hands and legs, Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses were quoted as saying that the incident
occurred at 3 a.m. local time near the Trikora monument in Ambon
after some people spotted a Kijang van roaming the area
suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that its passengers would kidnap people, witnesses
said, the people asked the van's driver to roll down the car
window so they could check.
</P>
<P>
When the driver refused, one of the people smashed the car
window, exposing men carrying guns, leading the people to suspect
that they were plainclothes security officers.
</P>
<P>
The firing began at that point, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
People in the city have been highly suspicious of one another
following the bloody riots and waves of abductions, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed more than 200 people
this year and forced thousands to flee the territory.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said more than 400 others were injured since
religious clashes erupted in the province in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
The violence was initially sparked by a dispute between a
Muslim migrant and a local Christian driver of a public minibus on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
It then quickly degenerated into full-scale rioting pitting
members of the two communities against one another.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Leaves for Iran on Confidence-Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Prime Minister Crown
Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah left here Saturday for
Iran on a visit which Tehran said will help build confidence
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Saad, heading a high-ranking delegation, will hold talks with
Iranian leaders on regional issues and means of boosting bilateral
ties, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saad's trip to Tehran is part of his four-leg tour, which will
also take him to Syria, Egypt and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-Iranian ties have been developing since the 1991
Gulf War, which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq from 1980-1988,
firmly supported Kuwait during the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Kuwait have in recent years increased exchange of
visits, through which bilateral ties have been greatly boosted.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials and the press have expressed welcome to the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami described the visit
as one of confidence building efforts between peoples of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The basis of good relations among peoples and countries is
building confidence. And since this common ground exists in
Kuwait and Iran because of religious, neighboring and historic
ties, developing ties is a positive matter," said Khatami last
month while meeting with visiting Kuwaiti Information Minister
Yusef Al-Sumait.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and African Affairs
Mohammad Sadr expressed welcome to Saad's visit and hoped that his
visit would further enhance bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani also expressed belief that "Saad's trip to Tehran will
be a new step towards expanding political, economic and cultural
ties."

<HEADLINE> Overseas Filipino Workers Number 755,684 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of Overseas Filipino
Workers (OFWs) deployed last year inched up by 1.1 percent to
755,684 from 746,696 in 1997, the Philippines News Agency said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration was quoted as
saying that the number of the deployed land-based workers expanded
by 0.6 percent to 562,384 last year while the number of the
sea-based workers grew significantly by 2.5 percent to 193,300.
</P>
<P>
Although the country continued to rely on overseas
opportunities to provide employment for its labor force, the
growth in the number of OFWs considerably slowed down from their
double-digit levels in 1991 and 1992, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The number of OFWs contracted by 9.1 percent in 1995 and grew
only slightly by 0.9 percent to 660,122 in 1996, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
This could be attributed to the decline in the land-based OFWs
by 13.6 percent to 565,226 in 1995 and by 0.8 percent to 484,653
in 1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the sea-based employment of OFWs continued to
expand by 7.1 percent to 165,401 and 175,469 respectively in 1995
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, deployment of newly-hired OFWs increased
from 221,241 in 1997 to 223,242 last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of skills category, there was a shift away from more
stable and protected high-paying jobs, including professional and
managerial positions, to the less stable service and production
jobs, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Media Acclaim Premier Zhu's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) - Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's work
report delivered to the Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) Friday was lauded by local newspapers
Saturday as "frank and practical."
</P>
<P>
An editorial titled "A New Approach" by the South China Morning
Post said the report "represents a frank assessment of the
problems China faces in this most difficult of years."
</P>
<P>
The work report "may have been shorter than in previous years
and there were none of the previously obligatory pauses for
delegates to offer their ritual applause," the English-language
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Self-confidence, insight, practical manner and senses" were
clearly reflected by Premier Zhu's report and the goal of
achieving a growth rate of 7 percent this year can be given
confidence, a commentary of the Hong Kong Commercial Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Economic Journal said in a commentary that the
first work report of Premier Zhu contained no hollow words or big
talk, and spoke right to the topic. It added that the report was
practical and did not evade the problems China is faced with.
</P>
<P>
The Ming Pao Daily News said Zhu's report was "strong and full
of confidence" and "characterized by stability." It added that to
ease the pressure of employment and to ensure social stability
have become the premier's top priority of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Ta Kung Pao noted that the work report once again displayed
the Central Government's support to the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
It said that the "one country, two systems" practice is being
developed steadily and improved continuously with the joint
efforts of both the Central and the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Daily said that Premier Zhu called for the
strengthening of cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Hong
Kong and this is welcomed by the Hong Kong people.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Puts Mozambique Rescue Move on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's rescue mission
to flood- ravaged Mozambique was put on hold over the weekend
pending an assessment of rescue requirements, the South African
Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government is assessing the results of a reconnaissance
flight sent to Mozambique Thursday, and would decide on Monday on
what kind of aid should be provided, a ministry spokesman was
quoted by South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 people have reportedly died since torrential rains
swept through the eastern and northern provinces of Mozambique
this week, washing away vital road links and bridges.
</P>
<P>
Some towns were running short of food and other supplies while
people were stranded, unable to move anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
South African air force rescue craft and helicopters are on
standby to fly supplies, engineers and rescue workers to Vilanculo
airport near Maputo, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An army spokeswoman said Friday they were prepared to leave
Friday night when they received word to stand down until Monday.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Free Trade Zone Seeks to Attract Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Free Trade Zone
(KFTZ) is seeking to attract foreign investors by expanding
its operations into the Iranian and central Asian markets in the
next few years, a KFTZ official said.
</P>
<P>
The KFTZ, which began its operations on March 1, will invest
150 million U.S. dollars over the next four years in the
expansion of the existing KFTZ area into a 3 million square
meters business park and industrial village, KFTZ marketing
director Mufeed Abdul told the local daily Arab Times published
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the current year, Abdul said, 7 million Kuwaiti dinars
(23.1 million dollars) will be put into upgrading existing
facilities such as warehouses and office space in the KFTZ, which
is located close to Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
Local interest is currently dominating the first wave of
business of the KFTZ as the free trade zone has signed contracts
with 60 local companies, Abdul said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, while the KFTZ is very eager to attract
foreign investors, the zone has very specific plans for foreign
participation in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts are targeting Iran now," the official said. He
stressed that the KFTZ is optimistic that Iranian participation
will gradually increase.
</P>
<P>
KFTZ director general Juhail Al-Juhail said recently that the
establishment of the zone was aimed at promoting trade with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The KFTZ, which is to be managed by Kuwait's National Real
Estate Company, will offer tax-free investment opportunities to
re-export and light industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
It will issue import-export licenses to related companies
within hours and offer health insurance and legal consultations
to any project in the zone.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges NATO, EU to Tackle PKK Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit has urged member states of the NATO and the EU to curb
terrorist attacks by the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
In a letter to members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), Ecevit said that
he strongly urged them to take firm and prompt legal actions
against any PKK presence on their territories under any guise.
</P>
<P>
The letter, which was published in Turkey's Milliyet newspaper
on Saturday, also called on these countries to ban the PKK
activities and all its facilities and to prohibit PKK spokesmen,
propagandists and instigators from operating in their countries.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to take effective measures to closely
monitor all PKK related persons and their activities.
</P>
<P>
"This call is based on the fact that PKK terrorists still
continue to provoke and instigate terrorist acts against Turkey
from western Europe," said Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
He added that the provocations and incitement to violence and
murder coming from Europe pose a clear danger to the safety and
security of the Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested by Turkish commandos in
Kenya in mid-February and kept in a jail on the Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's arrest had triggered Kurdish demonstrations and
protests around Europe and the Middle East, some of which turned
violent and bloody.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for
independence in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over
37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Desires Quick Restoration of Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Foreign Minister of
Kazakhstan Kasymzhomart Tokaev Saturday said his country desires
immediate restoration of lasting peace in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of a quick restoration of peace in Afghanistan
through the setting up of a government of national
reconciliation," Tokaev said at the Islamabad air force airbase
before leaving for Lahore to continue his two-day visit in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He backed the peace mission of U.N. special envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi and hoped the coming talks between the
Taliban and their rivals in Ashgabad next week would be
successful.
</P>
<P>
"Meetings between parties in Afghan conflict are very
important. We hope that the Ashgabad meeting would prove to be
successful and a step forward for the restoration of peace," said
Tokaev.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the solution to the crisis in
Afghanistan will take a lot of time because of the complicated
historical and political factors behind it.
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with Pakistani and Taliban leaders on
Afghanistan as constructive and successful, Tokaev said, "We are
now in a better position to understand the situation in
Afghanistan and Taliban."
</P>
<P>
Compared with two or one year ago, Kazakhstan and Pakistan have
closer stands regarding the situation in Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tokaev revealed that he discussed the issue of recognizing the
Taliban in meeting with Taliban leader Maulvi Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakil. "I think recognizing Taliban or not recognizing them is
not the most important issue nowadays," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing, I think, is that we have direct
talks with Taliban that is one of the most powerful and
influential military forces in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tokaev held the first ever high level meeting between
Kazakhstan and Taliban Friday with Mutawakil, a close aide to
Taliban's supreme leader Mulla Muhammad Omar.
</P>
<P>
Tokaev arrived here Friday and held talks respectively with his
Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz and Mutawakil. He also called on
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Friday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Food Industry Urged to Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Economy,
Trade and Industry Nasser Saidi has urged the country's foodstuff
manufacturers to open new markets abroad, the Daily Star reported
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The creation of joint-venture projects in Lebanon will enable
local companies to acquire advanced technology and expertise,"
Saidi told a news conference on Friday on the holding of the Arab
Food Industries Fair due on June 15-19.
</P>
<P>
Food industry is one of Lebanon's most important sectors with
more than 5,000 companies engaged in food production, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon imports more than 400 million U.S. dollars worth of
food while exports stand at just 50 million dollars every year.

Arab nations import about 18 billion dollars worth of food
every year while exports are less than 4 billion dollars,
statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President to Visit Mideast, European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
will visit several Middle East and European countries in the near
future as part of his efforts to establish new relations with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"After his visit to Rome, Mr. Khatami will go to Damascus and
then to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia," local daily Tehran Times on
Saturday quoted an Iranian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These visits by Mr. Khatami are important," the official told
the daily on condition of anonymity. Oil prices, security of
the region and mutual cooperation in economic and commercial
areas will be on the agenda of Khatami's visits.
</P>
<P>
The report did not elaborate the exact dates of Khatami's
visits but said that the president will arrive in Rome next week
and will meet with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Meanwhile,
some reports said that he will also visit France on April 12.
</P>
<P>
It will be Khatami's first multi-nation tour to the Middle
East and Europe since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Wednesday called on
the west to end their isolation on Iran and show clear support for
Khatami. "We must make Khatami himself and members of his
government welcome in the west," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami initiated a foreign policy of detente and
tension-easing after he was sworn in to office and opened a new
chapter in Iran's relations with other countries, particularly
the Gulf states and the European countries.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Khatami's policy, senior Italian and French government
officials visited Iran last year.
</P>
<P>
Britain also reached an agreement with Iran to promote their
diplomatic relations to ambassadorial level by putting aside the
issue of Salmon Rushdie, who was sentenced to death for his novel
"the Satanic Verses" by the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Political observers hold that Khatami's visits to regional
and European countries will help him break the isolation on Iran
imposed by the west led by the U.S. since the Islamic revolution
in 1979.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Liberalize Investment by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to liberalize
intra-investment by 2003, Thai News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Abhisit Vejjajiva, minister to the Prime
Minister's Office, as saying that the agreement to fully
liberalize intra-investment by establishing the so-called "ASEAN
Investment Area" (AIA) in the next four years was reached at the
first AIA meeting, held in Phuket, southern Thailand, Friday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting also agreed that every ASEAN member should
submit its sensitive investment list identifying certain areas of
businesses to be reserved to local investors by April 7, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tentative Exclusive lists would, however, be reviewed from
January 1, 2003 on so that it could be later terminated under the
AIA framework, requiring that "national treatment" be applied to
all ASEAN investors in any member country, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for a proposed plan to open up the region for outside
investors, he said that the meeting agreed to set up an AIA task
force to study the plan and report to the next AIA meeting in
Singapore in late September.
</P>
<P>
"The first meeting of ASEAN Investment Area Council not only
helps stimulate greater investment in the region, but also
encourages closer cooperation between the grouping's private
sector in terms of trade and investment. It also sends a clear
signal to investors worldwide that ASEAN is still committed to
opening up regional businesses to investors eyeing the region as
their expanded manufacturing bases in the medium and long term,"
said Abhisit, who represented Thailand at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached at the last ASEAN summit held
in Vietnam late last year, outside investors would be allowed to
be exempted from corporate tax and import tariffs on machinery at
least over the next three years, as well as permitted to pay less
investment tax by 30 percent while waiting for full-fledged
privileges under the AIA.
</P>
<P>
The AIA, established in compliance with the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA), is aimed to allow 100 percent foreign ownership for
most members by 2003, while those outside ASEAN are to be given
access by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The AIA forum is followed by a meeting of ASEAN economic
ministers, to be also held in Phuket Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Wins Beijing International Road Relay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China won the 14th Beijing women's
marathon relay race on Saturday despite the absence of legendary
coach Ma Junren and his protegees.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, including Sun Yinjie, Dong Chaoxia, Sun
Wenqin and Ai Dongmei, Zhao Yanyan and Liangyin, clocked two hours
17 minutes and 52 seconds for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Japan finished second in 2:18:07 and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea third in 2:19:13.
</P>
<P>
The relay, which was inaugurated in 1986, was run on a new
route this year, which started from the Tian'anmen Square and
wound its way westward in the downdown, turning to the north near
the Diaoyutai Guesthouse before ending in the Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Luo Weixin, coach of the Chinese team, was not satisfied with
the winning results.
</P>
<P>
"We are not familiar with the new route," Luo said. "And it's
too cold to run a good time."
</P>
<P>
The annual relay was also an event in which Ma Juren and his Ma'
s Family Army jumped to fame. In the 1993 edition, Ma led his
deciples including Wang Junxia, Qu Yunxia and Liu Dong -- who all
became world champions later that year -- to the champion with a
race record of 2:14:16.
</P>
<P>
Last year, coach Ma guided his new "Army Women" -- including
world women's 5,000 meters record holder Jiang Bo, to set a new
race record of 2:11:35 over a distance of 42.195 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies List Factors Leading to Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the current seesion of
China's highest lawmaking body and government advisors expounded
today the factors favorable to maintaining social stability in the
country, an issue once again stressed in a report about the work
of the Chinese government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The deputies are now here attending the 2nd Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened Friday, and
the advisors or the members of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) are
also convening their annual session of the Ninth CPPCC National;
Committee.
</P>
<P>
They are all deliberating the government work report delivered
at the NPC session by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji Friday in group
discussions or plenary meetings.
</P>
<P>
They all cited factors in favor of maintaining social stability
in China.
</P>
<P>
Qu Shijing, a CPPCC National Committee member and research
fellow with the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said
stability can be maintained as long as "we uphold the Party's
leadership and rely on the people."
</P>
<P>
The growth of the country's economy is of primary importance in
maintaining social stability, said a NPC deputy from north China's
port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Progress in state enterprise reform, the elimination of a
bubble economy, a rational external debt structure and steady
inflow of overseas investment are beneficial to social stability,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The measures the central government has taken to prevent and
defuse the lingering impact of the Asian financial crisis will

<HEADLINE> Continued Heavy Capital Spending Vital for Growth: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Continued heavy capital spending
is necessary if the Chinese economy is to grow at a fairly rapid
pace in the new year, according to Dong Fureng, a well-known
economist who is here attending the annual session of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) as a committee member.
</P>
<P>
"China's economic performance shows that increasing capital
spending has had a positive effect on the economy, but it is still
too early to say that the national economy has been stimulated to
a desired extent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to continue increasing capital spending this year
under the
circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China has been facing deflation since early
last year, he said the government has made a correct decision to
stimulate economic growth by increasing investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The effect of increased capital spending is yet to be fully
felt since most of the money for capital spending has gone into
infrastructure projects, which usually take a long time to
complete, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it will take some time for the money to filter
through to the consumption sector.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we need to continue investing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that growth of capital spending by the state sector was
five percentage points bigger than that by the society as a whole
last year, Dong called for kick-starting investment by non-state
sectors, especially the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the government would adopt
preferential policies to encourage investment by non-state sectors.
</P>
<P>
"If we do a good job of encouraging and boosting capital
spending, paying attention to the selection and quality of
projects, the economy will pick up faster and both people's
personal incomes and consumer spending will increasing to usher in
a period of high economic growth," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Use New Vaccine to Save Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan and British researchers
have developed a vaccine which will effectively control east coast
fever which kills hundreds of thousands of cattle in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The ECFiM vaccine was developed by experts from Kenya's
National Veterinary Research Center and doctors in 15 years under
the support of the two governments, Kenyan leading newspaper Daily
Nation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A single dose of the vaccine is sold for 1,000 Kenyan shillings
(about 16 U.S. dollars) while the treatment of an infected cow
costs 3,000 shillings (about 48 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, however, will not be sold over the counter
because it requires careful administration.
</P>
<P>
The Coopers Kenya Limited and the Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute are in charge of offering training services to
veterinary doctors before they are allowed to prescribe the
vaccine. The company has signed an agreement with the Kenyan
government to transfer the technology of producing ECFiM.
</P>
<P>
The company's research coordinator Eric Mwangi said that some
veterinary doctors in Coast Province in east Kenya have been
trained and focus will soon shift to other cattle keeping areas in
the country.
</P>
<P>
East coast fever kills about 150,000 cattle in Kenya every
year. The most affected animals are dairy cows. Treatment for
sick cows costs about five billion shillings annually.
</P>
<P>
The fever is a parasitic disease transmitted by ticks. Symptoms
include loss of appetite, high fever, drop in milk yield and
enlarged lymph nodes.

<P>
TOKYO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Namibian sprinter Frankie Fredericks
defeated other rivals to win the men's 200-meter title at the
world indoor athletics championships in Maebashi, Japan on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Olympic pole vault champion Jean Galfione of France won the
gold but was the target of a protest by American Jeff Hartwig
after touching the bar during one jump.
</P>
<P>
31-year-old Fredericks led from start to finish to claim
victory in 20.10 seconds. Obadele Thompson of Barbados finished
second in 20.26 and defending champion Kevin Little of the United
States came third in 20.48.

Romania captured two gold medals when Ionela Tirlea won the
women's 200 meters with a time of 22.39 seconds while Gabriela

<P>
France got its first title of the championships through
Galfione but he had to wait for a jury verdict before claiming his
gold.
</P>
<P>
Galfione touched the bar as he cleared 5.95m. The jury reviewed
a video and said it was an accident sparking protests from the
American camp.

American took the silver with 5.95m. Danny Ecker of Germany was
third with 5.85m.

<P>
The army deputies also noted that in the past year, both the
PLA and the armed police forces have made other contributions to
China's economic development, with army servicemen participating
in the construction of nearly 1,000 state and local key projects
for more than 20 million days.
</P>
<P>
They went on to say that in 1998, Party, government officials
at all levels and the general public across China also showed
their deep love and support for the army.
</P>
<P>
While ensuring that the army can recruit good soldiers, the
local governments and people also provided all-out support for
army's drill, transportation, tele-communication and food, water
and power supply, they added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increasing employment pressure, Party committees
and governments at all levels last year managed to offer jobs and
appropriate posts to 49,000 discharged army officers and over 600,
000 demobilized soldiers, as well as to 16,000 family dependents
of the armymen, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important guarantee for the cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics that the army and the
people fight natural disasters shoulder to shoulder and work with
one heart and one mind to promote reform and development and
safeguard social stability and ethnic unity," an army deputy
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Indicate Release of Abducted Officers: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Saturday that he has received "feelers" on the release of two
army officers and one police inspector abducted by the New
People's Army (NPA) last month.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program, Estrada said the feelers
indicate that "the NPA wants to release the three officers,
although they still don't know to whom they should turn over the
hostages."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the NPA relayed the feelers to him through a few
government officials, including Vice President Gloria Arroyo and
Agrarian Reform Secretary Horacio Morales Jr.
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier suspended formal peace talks with the NPA
following the abduction of the three officers.
</P>
<P>
He said the formal peace talks with the rebels will only be
resumed if they release the three abducted officers unharmed.

BELGRADE -- The Yugoslavian government strongly condemned
Friday's decision by peace envoy to Bosnia Carlos Westendorp to
dismiss Bosnian Serb republic President Nikola Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, the
Yugoslavia government described Westendorp's decision as an
illegitimate and "unprecedented tyrannic" action. The decision is
a most serious violation of the 1995 Dayton accord, the Bosnian
Constitution and the Bosnian Serb republic constitution and a
heavy blow to the Bosnian peace process, the statement said.
Poplasen said he would only step down in the "same democratic way
as he was elected" and that there should be a referendum to decide
on the issue. (Yugoslavia-Bosnia-Reaction)

In a statement released after a telephone call from U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen, Scognamiglio said that the
verdict from the court martial trying U.S. marine pilot Ashby
should not be allowed to damage bilateral relations. The military
court in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, ruled Thursday that Ashby
was not guilty of causing the 20 deaths when his jet severed
cables of a ski-lift on mount Cermis in the Italian Dolomites last
year. (Italy-US-Relations)

March 15, the Tanjug news agency reported. Kosovo Albanian
negotiators balked at signing a deal when peace talks broke up
last month in Rambouillet. The deal proposed by the six-nation
Contact Group offers Kosovo a broad autonomy within Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, rather than independence ethnic
Albanians seek. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo)

NEW DELHI -- An Air France cargo jet crashed late Friday night
at the airport of Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu, 2,095 km south
of New Delhi, after catching fire while landing, Press Trust of
India (PTI) said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Six member crew on board the jet, however, had a miraculous
escape. One of the crew received some injuries while five persons
were rescued by the airport fire services personnel using
turntable ladders attached to the fire tenders, PTI quoted a top
Airport Authority of India (AAI) official as saying. The French
cargo jet crash-landed and caught fire at the airport of Chennai
at 1:00 a.m. Saturday morning after its nosewheel failed to open
while landing. The crashed plane on the runway of the airport
paralyzed the flight operations, said the report. (India-France-

<HEADLINE> Senior Leaders Take Part in NPC Discussions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior leaders from China's Party,
legislature and government joined deputies to the National People'
s Congress in discussing Premier Zhu Rongji's government work
report delivered yesterday at the NPC's annual session.
</P>
<P>
 Tian Jiyun, a vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
called for more support to the private sector at a group
discussion attended by NPC deputies from Henan province.
</P>
<P>
"The non-state sector is a major driving force for national
economic and social development," he said. "This sector plays an
important role in the development of a socialist market economy,
maintaining social prosperity and stability, increasing state
revenue, and enriching the life of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo talked about the current economic
situation with deputies from southeast China's Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy for China to achieve great successes last year
against an increasing impact of the Asian financial crisis and
catastrophic summer flooding," he said, pointing out that measures
taken by the government largely contributed to the country's good
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
He warned about unfavorable factors still confronting the
country, however.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we still face a grim situation," he said. "The
impact of Asian financial crisis on China could be greater, the
export sector is likely to face more difficulties, and pressures
from unemployment could become more serious."
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that China's economic development goals
will be attained as long as the Chinese people push ahead with
reforms and make concerted efforts to overcome difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Party Secretary of Shandong Province Wu Guanzheng described the
Government Work Report as "realistic and inspiring" in a group
discussion. "This year Shandong will focus on economic
restructuring, attaching greater attention to education, science
and technology, and exerting greater efforts to solve social
problems to ensure stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Luo Gan joined deputies from Fujian in a group
discussion. He underlined three points in his speech, saying "
reform of state enterprises, agriculture and the science and
technology sector should be deepened this year; the government
should maintain the current healthy momentum of economic
development through expanding domestic demand and increasing
consumer demand; and great efforts should be made to maintain
social stability."
</P>
<P>
Vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Jiang Chunyun
emphasized strict adherence to the rule of law. "People's
Congresses and their standing committees at all levels should
strengthen supervision over government work in accordance with law,
and such supervision should combine with supervision by the media
and supervision by the people to increase their effectiveness," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen talked about unemployment and the
building of a social security network in a group discussion
attended by deputies from Ningxia.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-Chairman on Tibet Democratic Reform(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an article published in the latest issue of "China's Tibet"
to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the democratic reform in
Tibet, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigmei, former senior official of the local
government of Tibet, said that the reform started with
suppression of the armed rebellion launched by reactionaries in
the upper social strata in Tibet to stop the reform and split the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that as early as July 1957, there were people who
held grand rituals in the Potala Palace to accept a report
delivered by the reactionary "four rivers and six mountain ranges"
movements which demanded the 14th Dalai Lama exercise rule over
all Tibetan areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Right after that, ringleaders of the movement gathered in
Zhegutang, Shannan, organizing rebel troops called the "religion
protection army", which staged harassing activities in areas
outside Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
In August 1958, Ngapoi said, the rebel army seized all weapons
and munitions in Namling and in December plotted to move the 14th
Dalai Lama to a new area and challenge the PLA troops stationed in
Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
On March 10, 1959, taking advantage of the 14th Dalai Lama's
plan to watch a theatrical performance at the PLA Tibet Military
Area command compound, the rebels spread rumors.
</P>
<P>
In the early morning, Lhasa was in chaos. Many cried: "The Hans
are kidnapping the Dalai Lama. Let's go to Norbu Lingka (summer
palace) to protect him."
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of this the rebels besieged the Norbu Lingka,
touching off the March 10 armed rebellion.

<P>
Speaking at a group discussion attended by deputies from China'
s largest metropolis Shanghai, Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai and a
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, aired his
views on efforts to achieve a healthy development of the national
economy and on economic development in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Huang said: "I believe the growth targets for the national
economy, proposed on the basis of an overall analysis of favorable
and unfavorable factors at home and internationally, can be
realized."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will maintain a moderately high and healthy economic
development by correctly handling the relationship "among speed,
quality and efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao joined NPC deputies from Gansu Province,
northwest China, in discussing Premier Zhu Rongji's government
work report.
</P>
<P>
Drought is the top enemy for farmers in the dry northwest, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He called for developing and using water-saving techniques such
as spray irrigation, drip irrigation and micro irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"Developing water-saving irrigation is a fundamental way out
for water shortages confronting China's agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
He call on industries to develop related products, adding this
is a big potential market.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, an ethnic Mongolian and a vice-chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee, talked about township enterprises when he
joined NPC deputies from Inner Mongolia in a group discussion.
</P>
<P>
"Greater efforts should be made to step up the guiding role of
government policies so as to maintain a sustained, fast and
healthy development of rural industries," he said. Rural
enterprises should speed up reform, adopt the modern enterprise
system and strengthen democratic management, and they should play
a bigger role in the processing, storing, transportation and
trading of farm produce, he said.

Sangpo Cewang Renzin (Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the PLA
Tibet Military Area, a Galoon official of the local government of
Tibet and Commander-in-Chief of the Tibetan Army) was moving
toward the Norbu Lingka at this point of time. Caught in a hail of
stones, he was wounded and rushed to the clinic of the Indian
consulate nearby.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, Kamqoin Soinam Gyamco, elder brother of Pagbalha
Geleg Namgyai, was killed by the rebels in front of the Norbu
Lingka, and his body was tied behind a horse and paraded through
the streets. "It was obvious that the 14th Dalai Lama could not go
to the PLA Tibet Military Area headquarters to watch the
theatrical performance now and we could not go to the Norbu Lingka.
As a result, I went to the headquarters myself," Ngapoi Ngawang
Jigmei said.
</P>
<P>
"When the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet
Autonomous Region was established in 1956, Vice-Premier Chen Yi
came to Lhasa for the celebrations." recalled he.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that preparatory efforts should be made for
conducting the Democratic Reform. However, the decision issued by
the Central Government at the end of that year said that the
Democratic Reform would not be carried out in the following six
years. It was up to the Tibetan leaders and people then to decide
whether to conduct the reform.
</P>
<P>
From December 1956 to early 1957, when the 14th Dalai Lama and
the 10th Panchen Erdeni were attending the 2,500th anniversary of
the Sakyamuni's nirvana in India, Premier Zhou Enlai handed them a
letter form Chairman Mao Zedong, informing them the decision of
the Central Government.

<P>
"I was a member of the 14th Dalai Lama's party. We discussed
the Chairman's letter and Premier Zhou's explanation and came to
the conclusion that the 17-Article Agreement for the peaceful
liberation of Tibet had been implemented to the letter. We had no
objection in this regard. But we raised some objections to
practices conducted in the Democratic Reform in the Tibetan areas
in Gansu, Qinghai and some other provinces and wished the Central
Government would make some correction." Ngapoi added.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that some people on the upper ruling class feared
the Democratic Reform would threaten their interests gained from
the enforcement of feudal serfdom. And that is why they demanded
for "Tibetan independence" despite the fact that Tibet has, ever
since the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), been a part of China.
</P>
<P>
It was clearly stipulated in the 17-Article Agreement that the
Central Government would refrain from forcing Tibet to conduct the
Democratic Reform. When the Tibetan people had the desire for
reform, the Central government would consult the Tibetan leaders
and discuss a way out.
</P>
<P>
In the eight years from the signing of the agreement to the
March 10 Event, people stationed by the Central Government in
Tibet had never raised any suggestions concerning reform, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these efforts, armed rebellion still occurred.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "when it was suppressed, the Democratic Reform was
enforced to abolish feudal serfdom and allow former serfs and
slaves to become masters of the society." said Ngapoi.

<HEADLINE> Vice Minister of Construction on Engineering Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese vice minister of
construction said here today that the problem of poor construction
quality plaguing China's construction sector has resulted from lax
management, poor enforcement of relevant laws, decreasing quality
of the civil engineering personnel and serious corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Poor construction quality is by no means a technical problem,
but a reflection of various maladies accumulated for many years,"
said Ye Rutang, a deputy to the current session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, which
opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Government Work Report delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji at
the opening meeting of the NPC session Friday morning highlighted
the importance of improving the quality of construction projects.
</P>
<P>
"As I know, it is the first time that so much attention has
been paid to the issue of the quality of construction projects in
a government work report," commented Ye, who has worked in the
Ministry of Construction for more than a decade and was a deputy
to the Seventh NPC.
</P>
<P>
Last January, a poorly-built bridge collapsed in southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality, killing 40 people and injuring a
dozen others. This incident aroused nationwide concerns on the
quality of engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
At present, Ye said, China spends more than one trillion yuan
on civil engineering and housing construction projects each year
and the building industry has become a major factor to drive the
growth of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
To curb poor construction projects, he said, his ministry has
to date established construction trade markets in over 260 cities
across the country, where all engineering projects are contracted
through open bidding.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Premier Zhu's report, the ministry this year
will intensify its effort to improve engineering quality
monitoring and strengthen law enforcement and management, as well
as promote an early enactment of a law on engineering projects
bidding, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as long as various parties involved in the
construction sector can abide by laws and regulations and meet
relevant state standards, it is absolutely possible to completely
eliminate poor construction projects," the vice minister concluded.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Woldetensae on Friday reaffirmed the acceptance of the
Organization of African Unity's (OAU) plan to end the country's
border dispute with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Woldetensae made the policy statement at the Eritrean capital
of Asmara a week after his government expressed willingness to
accept the OAU framework agreement through a letter to the United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted by a news release from the Eritrean
Embassy in Beijing on Saturday as telling an OAU delegation that
Eritrea is committed to a cease-fire and is preparing for the
implementation of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The OAU delegation, according to the release, expressed its
satisfaction with the clarification by Woldetensae.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has also accepted the OAU peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia are locked in a dispute over Badme, a
barren, rocky and largely uninhabited region of 150 square
kilometers. The common border has never been clearly demarcated
since Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting broke out on February 6, ending an
eight-month stalemate after a fierce war killed 1,000 people in
May through June last year. Badme region was under Ethiopia's
administrative control before May last year.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- People's Liberation Army (PLA)
deputies attending the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, have
stressed the importance of maintaining unity between the army,
government and the people.
</P>
<P>
Strong unity with the government and the people is the source
of power for the armed forces to achieve victory against any
enemies or difficulties, said the army deputies while discussing a
Government Work Report delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji at the
opening meeting of the current NPC session Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
They recalled the army's participation in the country's fierce
battle last summer against the worst flooding in decades.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 PLA and armed police soldiers and officers,
headed by some 110 generals, joined in the flood-fighting across
the country, safeguarding and reinforcing over 12,000 kilometers
of river dams and dykes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the armed forces made more than 2,200 emergency
flights and used 12,500 vehicles and over 1,170 boats to rescue
some 4.23 million people from the flood-hit areas and move them to
safe places.
</P>
<P>
"The great spirit of fighting the flood will serve to encourage
the entire Party, army and people across the country to strive for
new successes in the reforms, opening-up and socialist
modernization drive," a PLA deputy said.

<HEADLINE> Women's Role in Vietnam's Scientific Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese women are strengthening
their position in scientific research in the country, Vietnam News
Agency (VNA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Women make up 37 percent of the total number of university and
higher degree holders in the country. There are 28 female
professors (3.5 percent of the country's professors), 209 female
associate professors (5.86 percent), 1,026 female associate
doctors (12.6 percent) and 28 female doctors (5.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
Many research projects conducted by female scientists have high
practical value, including a project on making blood-filtering
membrane by Associate Prof. Le Viet Kim Ba (Hanoi National
University), another on producing various high-quality paints by
Prof. Nguyen Thi Hoe (Ho Chi Minh City Polytechnics), and one on
producing the Japanese hepatitis vaccine by Prof. Huynh Thi Phuong
Lien and her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese women also contribute greatly to scientific research
in the field of social sciences and humanities.
</P>
<P>
However, VNA said, female scientists still have to shoulder the
burden of household chores and to contribute to the family's
income, while earnings from research work are very low.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many people in Vietnam still tend to think that
men are more capable than women, and this attitude is causing a
great obstacle to women in their career.
</P>
<P>
In order to build a strong contingent of female scientists both
in quantity and quality, VNA said, uniform measures should be
taken, including improving social awareness of the role and
ability of women and developing a long-term strategy for training
female scientists.

<HEADLINE> Deputies Table Anti-Corruption Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the ongoing Second
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) have
submitted a motion, calling for the enactment of a law against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The 1,600-word motion was handed over to the current session,
which opened on Friday, by 31 deputies from China's largest
metropolis, Shanghai, upon their arrival in the capital on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is so widespread that it has even eroded the
judicial organs, posing a grave threat to the people's interests
and social stability," said Zhang Zhongli, 78, a senior advisor of
the Shanghai Academy of Social Science who initiated the motion.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian countries like Singapore, India and Sri Lanka have
promulgated laws to prevent and fight corruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
In western countries, there are similar laws to curb and punish
corruption, said Zhang who tabled 43 bills to China's top
lawmaking body during his 17 years as a NPC deputy, and seven was
listed as the N0. 1 bill of respective sessions.
</P>
<P>
China lacks a sound legal framework to curb corruption. The
Criminal Law, for example, has some provisions on the punishment
of corruption such as graft, embezzlement and dereliction of
duties, but fails to cover other misconduct including power abuse,
squander or waste of public fund, extortion, sale of official
posts, explained Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The most common punishment rendered to the corrupt people are
limited to degrading of official ranks, removal from office and
discharge from public employment, which is irrelevant to the
criminal punishment, therefore cannot serve as deterrent to
corruption.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Angola Asks Belgium to Aid in Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Angola hopes that Belgium could
provide technical cooperation to assist it in its mining industry,
 Angolan Minister of Geology and Mines Manuel Bunge said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bunge expressed his hope when meeting with the Belgian
Ambassador to Angola, Leon Doyan here, briefing him on Angola's
1998/2000 development plan on mineral industry.
</P>
<P>
Bunge said Angola needs advanced foreign technology to overcome
the difficulties in the industry and that Belgium should, like it
does with some other African countries, offer help to Angola,
which abounds in mineral resources,

especially diamond.
</P>
<P>
Doyan said Belgian mineral companies are very interested in
cooperating with Angolan firms in this field, adding that Belgium
has great investment in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
controlling development in diamond, copper and gold industries in
the country.
</P>
<P>
On diamond smuggling by the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Belgian ambassador said that
his government is taking measures to curb possible diamond
smuggling by UNITA through Belgian firms.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has for several times accused some
European companies of buying diamond from UNITA, thus providing
the rebel group with money for waging the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Angola is an important diamond producer in Africa. It produced
about two million carat of diamond, worth 450 million U.S.
Dollars, by the government-controled mines alone in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Ruling to Continue in Malaysia: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Saturday pledged that Malaysia will continue to
be ruled by a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling government will comprise component parties
representing all races in the country, Mahathir said in Kota
Kinabalu, Sabah, East Malaysia, where the state polls will be held
on March 12-13.
</P>
<P>
"I'm giving an assurance that UMNO (United Malays National
Organization, the largest political party in Malaysia) will not
form a government on its own despite having enough seats to form
one," he was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
as saying at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport at the end of
his three-day visit to Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He said UMNO preferred to administer the country collectively
with the Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) component parties
to preserve the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect for one
another established since independence.
</P>
<P>
The ruling BN coalition at the federal level comprises 14
political parties while the ruling BN in the state of Sabah has 9
component parties.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is BN chairman, said this was the uniqueness of
the BN government which gave importance to the interests of all
races and religion which opposition parties could not guarantee.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation and tolerance shown by the BN components,
Malaysia could maintain political stability and achieve economic
growth without any rioting arising from the people's
dissatisfaction, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He gave an assurance to Sabahans that the BN would develop
Sabah and Sarawak (another state in East Malaysia) on par with
other states in Peninsular Malaysia if it was once again given the
mandate to form the next state government.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An Air France cargo jet crashed
late Friday night at the airport of Chennai, capital of Tamil
Nadu, 2,095 km south of New Delhi, after catching fire while
landing, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Six member crew on board the jet, however, had a miraculous
escape. One of the crew received some injuries while five persons
were rescued by the airport fire services personnel using
turntable ladders attached to the fire tenders, PTI quoted a top
Airport Authority of India (AAI) official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The French cargo jet crash-landed and caught fire at the
airport of Chennai at 1:00 a.m. Saturday morning after its
nosewheel failed to open while landing. The crashed plane on the
runway of the airport paralyzed the flight operations.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the mishap could be due to friction and smoke was
detected from underneath the nose end and the fire service
personnel tried to douse it. Though the smoke appeared to subside,
the blaze suddenly erupted from that area making it uncontrollable
and spread to the wings. Large quantities of aviation turbine fuel
worsened the situation as the fire engulfed the engines causing
loud explosion, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Nordic Nations, Russia Discuss Nuke Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High on the agenda of the meeting was the issue of how to
strengthen safety in nuclear power plants and boost cooperation in
nuclear waste management, a joint declaration released by the
ministers said.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said the littoral Barents
Sea nations could achieve their goal of having such a deal signed
in two years.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland and
Russia pointed out that each country should bear financial
responsibility in case of nuclear accidents in its own territory.
Western nations will provide financial assistance to Russia should
such accidents occur there though, they added.
</P>
<P>
Possible leakage of Russia's nuclear power plants and Russia's
improperly disposed nuclear wastes, which pose environmental
threat to the Barents Sea, have become a major concern for the
Nordic nations of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Barents Euro Arctic Council, a regional
cooperation organization, was established in 1993 to boost
cooperation between Russia and the Nordic nations.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, France and Germany also sent their
delegates as observers to the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Brcko in Bosnia Declared Neutral by International Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 5 (Xinhua) -- An international arbitration panel
declared on Friday that the Serb-held town of Brcko in northern
Bosnia will be a neutral district under international supervision.
</P>
<P>
Head of the arbitration tribunal and American arbitrator
Roberts Owen announced in Sarajevo that Brcko will set up self-
governing bodies like parliament and administration departments
which are to be attended by representatives of the ethnic groups
of the Muslims, the Croats and the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Brcko will also be made a non-military zone, according to
the rule, which was made after a ten-day arbitrary conference
attended by leaders of the disputing parties and representatives
of the international community.
</P>
<P>
 Both Bosnia's two autonomous entities, the Muslim-Croat
federation and the Serb republic, had claimed Brcko, a five-
kilometer corridor linking them up.
</P>
<P>
 Under the rule of the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace agreement
that ended the 1992-95 war, Brcko, a city with 90,000 population,
is a Serb entity, but the Muslim-Croat federation argued for its
control on the city which serves as a key port to the Sava river.
</P>
<P>
 Owen's announcement has drawn applause from the international
community and the Muslim-Croat federation, while Serb leaders had
said they will reject any rule for a neutral district.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Host International Seafood Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The first Dhaka International
Seafood Fair will be held here on June 25-26 this year to boost
the country's seafood exports.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the fair, the first of its kind in
Bangladesh and to be organized by the Export Promotion Bureau
(EPB), is to display the country's quality products to foreign
buyers, The New Nation daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Now we can boldly state that we maintain high quality of our
products, which we could not ensure even a few years back," an EPB
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that every exporter in the country now ensured quality
and hygienic products, and every processing house now had a
laboratory to constantly monitor the quality. "We want to let all
our foreign buyers know that our quality has improved to
international marks," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to expand seafood exports, Bangladesh will send a
19-member delegation to Europe, Canada and the United States from
March to May to explore new export opportunities and to obtain new
technological know-how to improve the quality of seafood.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's frozen food export suffered a serious setback when
the European Commission (EC) imposed a ban of importing seafood
from the country in July 1997 following inspection of some shrimp
processing plants by the EC experts for not fulfilling the quality
management as required.
</P>
<P>
The temporary ban was withdrawn in late December 1997 as the
government leaders and exporters committed to fulfilling the EC's
quality specifications.
</P>
<P>
The frozen seafood contributes about 15 percent to the
country's export earnings, fetching about 13,331.3 million taka
(about 274.87 million U.S. dollars) in the 1997-98 fiscal year and
7,368.9 million taka (about 151.94 million dollars) between July
and December 1998, the first half of the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Ministry to Propose New Stimulus Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of Thailand
will submit a new fiscal stimulus package worth 1.45 billion U.S.
dollars to the cabinet next Tuesday, a source from the ministry
said Saturday.
</P>

The package will be financed by offshore loans consisting of

million from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), and
600 million dollars from the World Bank.
</P>

YANGON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,873 hectares of poppy
plantations in northern part of the country were destroyed in the

<HEADLINE> Thai Steel Millers to Reduce Production Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to survive the economic
crisis, Thailand's cash-strapped steel millers plan to consolidate
operations and even merge to cut production costs, a source from
the Federation of Thai Industries said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the Federation would help prepare a
consolidation plan.
</P>
<P>
Steel makers also plan to seek financial support under Japan's
regional aid program.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's steel output last year totaled 5 million tons, one
quarter of the industry's production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Mineral Resources Department had said that demand for steel
products dropped by 40 percent to 8 million tons as a result of a
slowdown in the construction and electronics industries and a
slump in automobile purchases.
</P>
<P>
Several steel makers had tried to export their way out of
trouble but prices abroad would likely fall by 20 percent this
year from last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Thai steel makers could not compete with producers in Eastern
Europe, South Korea and China who did not need to import raw
materials for production.
</P>
<P>
Currently, local steel prices are between 240 U.S. dollars and
250 dollars a ton, down from 310-320 dollars last year, causing
producers to suffer losses.
</P>
<P>
Major producers are trying to restructure their debts by
seeking new partners to consolidate exports, or increase capital
by offering shares.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Editor Urges Louder Voice from China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Veteran journalist Israel Epstein
called for China's overseas-oriented media service to provide
better services to overseas readers when expanding operations.
</P>
<P>
"We should take into consideration what overseas readers think
and need and slant our service accordingly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is a weak point in China's overseas-
oriented media service because some people in the service "regard
their publications as God and their own names as Gold."
</P>
<P>
"But the fact is that the global readership and the global
media market are our God," he said.
</P>
<P>
Epstein, an 84-year-old native Pole who has lived and worked in
China for the past five decades, is here attending the annual
session of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as a committee member.
He became a Chinese citizen in 1957.
</P>
<P>
"Though I have European blood, I have a Chinese heart. I am a
Chinese citizen," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's overseas-oriented media service has yet to catch up
with rapid changes that have been taking place in China in the
last two decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The number of newspapers and magazines for overseas readers
has been decreasing," he said, noting that the country's English-
and Japanese-language publications have a combined circulation of
only a little more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that the country's Russian- and Portuguese-language
magazines have stopped publication.
</P>
<P>
"When President Jiang Zemin visited Portuguese-speaking Brazil
recently, we didn't even have a single magazine published in
Portuguese in China. This is not compatible with the status of
China as a big country with a population of 1.2 billion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater attention to be paid to resolving this
problem.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing receives more than one million overseas tourists every
year. If just ten percent of them read our publications, we will
have a 100,000-strong readership," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government should not worry about spending too much money
on expanding the overseas-oriented media service," he said, noting
that newspapers and magazines in this sector are thinking of
making money instead of providing a better service for the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious problem," said Epstein, honorary editor-in-
chief of the English magazine China Today.
</P>
<P>
Some overseas readers have no idea about the big changes that
have taken place in China in the past two decades and believe what
foreign media say, which is often negative, he said.
</P>
<P>
Epstein called for making efforts to change this situation,
though he conceded that a big change will not come about in a
single day.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Community of
Nations (CAN) is to promote "open regionalism" so as to achieve a
trade boom, representative of the economic bloc Mario Ocampo said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ocampo said that the CAN would increase its trade relations
with other countries and organizations on the American continent.
</P>
<P>
At a panel -- "Experiences in the formation of the regional
blocs" -- he said CAN's new policy has helped the region to
present a more opening market to Latin America and North America.
</P>
<P>
The CAN's inter-regional exports increased to 2.6 billion U.S.
dollars last year from the 2.2 billion in 1997, up 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since replacing the Andean Pact, created in 1967, two years ago,
he noted, CAN members including Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
and Venezuela have achieved rapid improvement in economy and
politics.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the CAN members are facing problems
caused by financial crisis in the world, such as the strong
devaluation of the Ecuadoran currency, the Samba Effect and the
Asian crisis.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Second Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
held its second plenary meeting in the Great Hall of the People in
downtown Beijing this morning.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the State Council, China's cabinet, Zeng Peiyan,
minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission,
delivered a report on the Implementation of the 1998 Plan for
National Economic and Social Development and on a Draft 1999 Plan
for National Economic and Social Development.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng delivered a report on the
Implementation of the Central and Local Budgets for 1998 and on
Draft Central and Local Budgets for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Top Party and state leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,
Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, were present
at the meeting, which was presided over by Zou Jiahua, a vice-
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and an executive chairman
of the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 was very unusual," said Zeng in his report. "
Faced with the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the central
authorities resolutely made the decision to increase investment
and boost domestic demand in order to step up infrastructure
development and promote economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, people all around the country and the army
struggled together as one to achieve great victory in the fight
against floods last year.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the 1998 plan was implemented satisfactorily and
the macro-control targets were basically attained," he reported.
</P>
<P>
According to his report, China's gross domestic product hit 7.
9553 trillion yuan in 1998, representing an increase of 7.8
percent over 1997 and basically reaching the target set in early
1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the overall retail price level dropped by 2.6
percent over the previous year, and consumer prices fell by 0.8
percent.

"With growing repercussions from the Asian financial crisis and
the serious floods, maintaining this relatively rapid growth rate
in the national economy was not easy," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to list the major tasks for national economic and
social development in 1999 as follows: strengthening capital
construction for agricultural development and adjusting and
optimizing the agricultural structure; striving to create
favorable external conditions for the reform of state-owned
enterprises and strengthening support for small and medium-sized
enterprises; promoting economic restructuring and fostering new
growth areas in the economy; deepening the price reform to rectify
order in the market; continuing to follow the strategy of
developing the country by relying on science and education and
basing economic growth on advances in science and technology and
on improvement in the quality of the labor force; promoting all
social undertakings to further improve people's lives.
</P>
<P>
He also detailed China's plan for continuing to boost domestic
demand and promoting a sustained, rapid and sound development of
the national economy.
</P>

the basis of steady economic growth, the central and local budgets
for 1998 were implemented "fairly satisfactorily".
</P>
<P>
According to the report, total revenue in the central finance
for 1998 came to 548.3 billion yuan, or 103.3 percent of the
budgeted figure, while total expenditures in the central finance
for 1998 amounted to 644.3 billion yuan, or 111.7 percent of the
budgeted figure.
</P>
<P>
"Central expenditures exceeded revenue, leaving a deficit of 96
billion yuan, the same as the readjusted budgetary amount examined
and approved at the Fourth Meeting of the Standing Committee of

Xiang said that total revenue in China's local budgets in 1998
amounted to 829.1 billion yuan, or 103.8 percent of the budgeted
figure, and total expenditures in the local budgets amounted to
824.9 billion yuan, or 103.3 percent of the budgeted figure. Total
local revenue exceeded expenditures, leaving a surplus of 4.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xiang told the legislators that the increase in revenue for
1998 was higher than economic growth, and the ratio of revenue to
GDP rose from 11.6 percent in 1997 to 12.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The gradual rise of the ratio over the past few years is a
gratifying achievement which has been scored by standardizing the
tax system, tightening tax collection and management, handling
financial affairs according to law and plugging up loopholes," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that last year the government concentrated on
optimizing the structure of expenditures from the central budget
and guaranteed spending for projects which affected the overall
interests of reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
In consideration of the overall interests of reform,
development and stability, this year budgetary allocations should
be made for many important tasks which must be accomplished, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that total deficit in the central finance would
reach 150.3 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister noted that in order to have the 1999
budget successfully implemented, it is necessary to deepen reform,
strengthen management, handle financial affairs in accordance with
law and make painstaking efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of the budget for 1999 and fulfillment of all
financial tasks are of vital importance to promoting economic
restructuring, supporting the various reforms, maintaining a
sustained and sound development of the national economy and
bringing about all-round social progress," he stressed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Austria Fully Supports Hungary's Efforts to Join EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Austrian National
Council President Heinz Fischer said here Friday that his country
fully supports Hungary's efforts to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU's eastward expansion is a strategic objective designed
to ensure peace and stability in this region and it is to the
advantage of Austria, Fischer told a briefing after meeting with
Hungarian National Assembly President Ader Janos.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary's entry into the EU will not influence Austria'
s unemployment situation.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Ader Janos said the inflation rate in Hungary has now
dropped below 10 percent. Compared with the levels when Spain and
other nations joined the EU, Hungary is better equipped to join
the EU, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of NATO, he said Hungary's entry into the military
alliance will not affect neighborly friendship between Hungary and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Friday, also held talks with
Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos in the day.
</P>
<P>
The two said their countries share similar views on the
integration process in Europe, regional cooperation and the Kosovo
issue. They expressed hope that the Kosovo crisis could be settled
through negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Active Fiscal Policy Be Expedient Measure: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's finance minister Xiang
Huaicheng said here today that the pro-active fiscal policy is a
special measure the government has taken under specific
circumstances and can only be a short-term policy.
</P>
<P>
"Adopting a pro-active fiscal policy, increasing fiscal
spending and building more infrastructure facilities to stimulate
economy constitute special measures taken in a specific period,"
said Xiang in his report to the ongoing Second Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the nation's highest
lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not continue to adopt these measures, it will be hard
to increase domestic demand and economic restructuring will
hampered," he said, "It will be difficult to maintain steady
growth of the national economy, and the problem of unemployment
will become outstanding. Revenue will drop, and we will be in
financial straits."
</P>
<P>
He then went on to say that accelerated economic development
and increase in revenue could gradually reduce the deficit, making
the state finance more capable of repaying debts.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister then pointed out that the national deficit
and government bond issue are still kept within the limits of the
national economic strength.
</P>
<P>
The deficit and outstanding treasury bonds are estimated to
account for 1.7 percent and ten percent of the Gross Domestic
Product this year, much lower than the internationally recognized
security line of three percent and 60 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The pro-active fiscal policy will not bring about inflation
since the issue of long-term T-bonds will turn the idle bank
savings into investment, raise the efficiency of such funds, and
will not result in over-supply of currency. Besides, the current
price level is comparatively stable and the market has sufficient
supplies of both farming and industrial products, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we are also aware that China has had a big
potential deficit and a large issue of government bonds and there
are still many outstanding debts related to social security and
grain subsidy," the minister pointed out, adding that "We should
be extremely prudent when increasing the deficit and bond issue."
</P>
<P>
The minister then emphasized again that the pro-active fiscal
policy is only an expedient policy, saying that economic growth
should be based on expanding investment and consumption, and
depend on expanding foreign trade and overseas investment as well.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, we must adhere to a principle of maintaining
a basic balance between revenue and expenditure, and follow an
appropriately stringent financial policy," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Reform of Taxes and Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's finance minister Xiang
Huaicheng vowed today to actively advance reform of taxes and
charges and improve fiscal and taxation systems this year.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a report at the second session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), the minister said, "Reform of taxes and
charges is one of the administrative goals of the government as
well as a priority in the reform of the financial and taxation
systems."
</P>
<P>
He continued, "At present, numerous charges and fees (or funds)
are being levied arbitrarily. This puts a heavy financial burden
on all sectors of society, arouses great resentment among the
people, leads to irrational and chaotic distribution, and causes
drain on revenue and results in failure to prohibit unauthorized
departmental coffers."
</P>
<P>
The minister outlined reform measures for the system of
collecting charges and fees. They include eliminating government
charges for public administration and general public services,
converting service fees of a commercial nature into operating
charges and taxes, converting government funds and special charges
aimed at promoting key industries and undertakings into taxes, and
retaining government charges for special services it provides and
for use of state-owned resources.
</P>
<P>
With the reform to be completed between three and five years,
Xiang pledged to make a breakthrough in the reform of levying
charges on transportation and vehicles this year, formulate plans
for the reform of taxes and charges in rural areas, experiment
with the reform to lighten burden on farmers, and start similar
reform in urban construction, social security, environmental
protection and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for losing no time in drafting an
Inheritance Tax Law, Interim Regulations for the Implementation of
the Fuel Oil Tax and Interim Regulations for the Implementation of
the Vehicle Purchase Law and revise the Personal Income Tax Law.

<HEADLINE> UK Asks Lockerbie Victim's States to Lobby Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday asked all 30
nations who lost citizens in the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing
to persuade Libya to handover the two suspects for trial.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the latest statements from
Tripoli, the capital of Libya, indicated that Libya was
increasingly prepared to release the pair. But he said he was
taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
"We have just circulated a note to our embassies in all 30
countries who lost nationals in the bombing," the Reuters quoted
Cook as saying on his plane as he flew back from a visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We have raised the need to lobby Libya. It is in the interests
of all those countries for there to be a trial. It looks hopeful,
but we are not counting any chickens yet. We want to continue to
explore every avenue open to us," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Last month Britain and the United States said Libya had to
decide in 30 days whether to hand over the two men for trial
before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli says it is ready in principle to surrender the two men
but has raised a string of queries on the U.S.-British plan to try
the men in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 270 people were killed when the Pan Am airliner was
bombed up over the town of Lockerbie in southern Scotland. Britain
and the United States accused that two Libyan agents were
responsible for the bombing and had always been seeking to have
the two suspects to face trial.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had sanctioned Libya for years because of
the Lockerbie bombing. Libya has recently demanded U.N. sanctions
be lifted once the two men are handed over, while Britain and the
United States have only promised the measures will be suspended.

Germany supports the long-debated creation of a free trade
accord between Mexico and the European Union (EU) and hopes to see
a deal reached by the end of 1999, said the ambassador.

Reichenbaum said Germany was Mexico's most important trade

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges New Rules For U.S. Bases in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy on Friday urged new rules on
NATO and U.S. military bases in Europe after Thursday's acquittal
of a U.S. marine charged with involuntary manslaughter for slicing
a ski lift cable in Mount Cermis of Italy last year which killed
20 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Undersecretary Umberto Ranieri said Friday that
acquittal points to the need for a revision of the rules under
which U.S. military bases operate in Italy.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on the issue in an interview to the Italian
news agency ANSA in Malta where he is attending a session of the
Euro-Mediterranean Forum.
</P>
<P>
Ranieri said that Italian authorities should be given access to
"complete and transparent" information on military operation plans,
"especially where they affect heavily populated zones frequented
by tourists, or in any case involve risks for civilians."
</P>
<P>
Mount Cermis, where an U.S. EA-6B Prowler military plane
severed the support cables of the mount cable car in February 3
last year, is in a crowded winter and summer resort area in the
Dolomite mountains, which are used by US and NATO pilots to for
training missions.
</P>
<P>
Under NATO rules, the member country from which an accused
serviceman comes has the right to decide whether the trial should
be held by the host country or the country of origin.
</P>
<P>
Ranieri pointed out that the case was handed "trustingly" to
the United States, but said his thoughts are first of all for the
"victims who haven't received justice."
</P>
<P>
The "primary right" of each NATO country to claim jurisdiction
in court proceedings concerning its nationals deployed abroad on
NATO missions is laid down by Article 7 of the London Treaty
signed on June 19, 1951.
</P>
<P>
The article covers anything foreign NATO servicemen do while
abroad, not just what they do during NATO operations or missions.
</P>
<P>
Italy could try the crew of the Prowler plane for the Mount
Cermis disaster only if their alleged crimes were not recognized
as such in the United States or if the U.S. authorities formally
renounced jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also requires the country of origin to give "
sympathetic consideration" to a request for the waiving of the
primary right to jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes Acquittal of U.S. Pilot Not Damage Ties with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Carlo
Scognamiglio said Friday that the acquittal of the U.S. marine
pilot responsible for the Cermis ski lift disaster would not harm
the relations of friendship and alliance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after a telephone call from U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen, Scognamiglio said that the
verdict from the court martial trying U.S. marine pilot Ashby
should not be allowed to damage bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The military court in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, ruled
Thursday that Ashby was not guilty of causing the 20 deaths when
his jet severed cables of a ski-lift on mount Cermis in the
Italian Dolomites last year.
</P>
<P>
Scognamiglio said the affair promoted "reflections on the
clauses in international treaties regulating jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
Washington prevented the pilot being tried in Italy, which Rome
claimed was its right, and gave him a military trial in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen telephoned Scognamiglio earlier
Friday and repeated his government's regret and commiseration over
the Cermis affair.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Ready to Sign Peace Deal: Rugova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo ethnic Albanians are ready
to sign the peace deal agreed at Rambouillet, France, ethnic
leader Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rugova said Kosovo Albanian leaders were studying the matter
and might reach a consensus before peace talks resume in France on
March 15, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanian negotiators balked at signing a deal when peace
talks broke up last month in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
The deal proposed by the six-nation Contact Group offers Kosovo
a broad autonomy within Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, rather than independence ethnic Albanians seek.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, made up of the United States, Russia, France,
Britain, Germany and Italy, has been pressing to bring a permanent
end to nearly one year of fighting between Serbs and Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Rugova voiced the hope that NATO would deploy its troops in
Kosovo, adding that the situation there was "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Liberation Army leaders, who were studying the text of
the peace deal, also backed the ethnic Albanian negotiators,
Tanjug quoted a Kosovo Albanian newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that Kosovo would explode in large-scale war if
agreement is not reached at the coming talks. More than 2,000
people have been killed so far and hundreds of thousands displaced.

<HEADLINE> Zeng on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government will strive
to create favorable external conditions for reform of state-owned
enterprises and strengthen support for small and medium-sized
enterprises, Minister in charge of the State Development Planning
Commission Zeng Peiyan told the second session of the National
People's Congress (NPC) today.
</P>
<P>
He said in a report on national plan that this year will be
crucial for efforts to turn around most loss-making state-owned
large and medium-sized enterprises and for the preliminary
establishment of a modern enterprise system for most key state-
owned large and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Government will further readjust and reduce excessive
production capacity of state-owned enterprises in response to the
problems of redundant capacity and declining performance caused by
years of low-level redundant development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the target for the textile industry is to
eliminate 10 million outdated textile spindles, channel 1.2
million redundant workers into other trades and reduce overall
losses by 6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the coal industry, the Government will carry out follow-up
work after decentralizing administration of coal mines, close down
25,800 small mines and reduce overall output by 250 million tons.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Government will reorganize or close down small-
sized glassworks, cement factories, thermal power plants and steel
plants that are backward in technology, turn out products of low
quality and are wasting resources and causing serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Greater efforts should be made to encourage mergers and
standardize bankruptcy procedures," he said.

"We should improve procedures for using capital reserves to
clear non-performing loans and bad debts in banks, focusing on
supporting the reorganization of key industries and enterprises,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Government will do a good job of downsizing
staff and improving efficiency in state-owned enterprises and of
finding employment for their laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
"We should improve the system of three social security programs
-- the program for ensuring basic living expenses for laid-off
workers, the unemployment insurance program and the minimum
standard of living program for needy urban residents," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked governments at all levels to give priority to
allocating adequate funds to guarantee basic living expenses for
laid-off workers when compiling their budgets. He required them to
continue to make re-employment service centers a success, improve
the labor market, step up re-employment training for laid-off
workers and create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said that further improvement of a unified old-age pension
system will be made at the provincial level. The coverage and
collection of contributions will be increased so as to ensure
prompt and full pension payments.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Government will promote reform of medical
insurance for urban workers. It will also appraise and reorganize
the managerial staff of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We should further ease control of small state-owned
enterprises and invigorate them through a variety of means," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Government will strengthen guidance to and
policy support for the development of small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We should create favorable conditions for the expansion of
small enterprises of various forms of ownership, especially new
and hi-tech enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Government needs to establish effective
mechanisms for the management, supervision and operation of state-
owned assets so as to protect these assets from losses and prevent
the evasion of repayment of bank loans.

<HEADLINE> Edmundo Gets 4 1/2 Years Semi-open Prison for Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soccer star
Edmundo was given a 4 1/2 year semi-open prison sentence on Friday
for his part in a car crash in which three people died, legal
sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, he is unlikely to end up behind bars, at least in the
near future, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old striker, who plays for Italian club Fiorentina,
was sentenced in his absence following the December 1995 crash in
a plush Rio de Janeiro suburb. Edmundo himself suffered only
bruises in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Legal sources said that under the rules of the sentence,
Edmundo, who is currently in Italy, is free to work during the day
but must spend the night in prison.
</P>
<P>
However, his lawyer said he would appeal against the sentence
and the Brazilian government can only begin extradtion procedures
when all possibilities of appeal have been exhausted, legal
sources said. This process can also take several years, they said.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo, full name Edmundo Alves de Souza, is a hugely talented
player whose career has been marred by a variety of unsavoury
incidents on and off the pitch.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. to Continue Human Rights Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5, (Xinhua) - China and the United States may
have another round of talks on human rights later this year and
set up a non-government organizations (NGO) forum to explore ways
to solve the sore issue between the two countries, a Chinese
diplomat said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning, minister-counselor and spokesman for the Chinese
embassy, told a press conference that the human rights report
released by the U.S. State Department recently has "distorted the
real situation in China" where people have enjoyed much more
political, economic, social and cultural rights ever since the
founding of the republic, especially after the introduction of the
reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
The protection and promotion of human rights of a given country
is a domestic issue which no other country or force should meddle
in, and "we are firmly opposed to such a practice on the U.S. side
to interfere in China's internal affairs," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the human rights condition in the United States
is "far from perfect", but the report made no mention of these
deficiencies and instead it chose to offer comments on conditions
in 194 countries. "This is typical double standard, which of
course is not welcomed around the world."
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that it is "particularly regrettable" that
the U.S. State Department report came out shortly after the
resumption of the human rights dialogue between China and the
United States last January, the first dialogue of this kind since
1995.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the U.S. side will give up this wrong approach
and come back to the right track. That is to handle the
differences between the two countries on human rights through
dialogue and consultations on the basis of equality and mutual
respect," Yu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the upcoming annual U.N. conference on human rights
in Geneva, Yu said that China always stands against politicizing
the issue of human rights in the international forum.
</P>
<P>
The United States had led an anti-China campaign at the Geneva
conference for a successive seven years until 1998, but "seven
times they failed", Yu said.
</P>
<P>
"I think if they start again this year, they will fail again,
and that will have negative impact on our dialogue on human rights,
particularly on China-U.S. relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government gave up the crusade in Geneva last year,
paving the way for the re-opening of human rights talks here last
month between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Yu said, both sides have expressed their
willingness to continue the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"As I understand, we're discussing to have another round of
human rights dialogue later this year, and the possibility of
setting up a forum on human rights by NGOs. That's why I asked the
U.S. side to come back to dialogue rather than (make) accusation
and confrontation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns Sacking Bosnian Serb Republic President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslavian government
strongly condemned Friday's decision by peace envoy to Bosnia
Carlos Westendorp to dismiss Bosnian Serb republic President
Nikola Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, the
Yugoslavia government described Westendorp's decision as an
illegitimate and "unprecedented tyrannic" action.
</P>
<P>
The decision is a most serious violation of the 1995 Dayton
accord, the Bosnian Constitution and the Bosnian Serb republic
constitution and a heavy blow to the Bosnian peace process, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
This move shows that the West's top peace envoy detracts and
disregards the sense of sovereignty of the voters in the Serb
republic, it said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Westendorp, who is said to have sweeping powers to
implement the Dayton accord, dismissed Poplasen, accusing him of
endangering the Bosnian peace process.
</P>
<P>
A Bosnian Serb television report quoted Poplasen as saying that
he would not accept the "illegitimate and undemocratic" decision.
</P>
<P>
Poplasen said he would only step down in the "same democratic
way as he was elected" and that there should be a referendum to
decide on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp went into action after Poplasen began proceedings
this week to sack Western-backed Prime Minister Dodik.
</P>
<P>
The envoy accused Poplasen of abusing his powers by refusing to
nominate a prime minister able to win a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accord ended Bosnia's 43-month
ethnic war by establishing a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat
federation within a single state.

<HEADLINE> China's 1998 Budgets Well Implemented (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's central and local budgets
for 1998 had been well implemented, Chinese finance minister Xiang
Huaicheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal revenue growth continued to outpace the economic
growth in 1998, with the fiscal spending more efficiently used and
the fiscal deficit contained within the budgetary amount examined
and approved by the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), said Xiang in his fiscal report to the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth NPC, China's highest lawmaking
body.
</P>
<P>
The central finance raked in a total of 548.3 billion yuan in
1998, or 103.3 percent of the budgeted figure, and total
expenditures in the central finance amounted to 644.3 billion yuan,
or 111.7 percent of the budgeted figure, according to the report,
which is titled "Report on the implementation of the central and
local budgets for 1998 and on the draft central and local budgets
for 1999."
</P>
<P>
The two figures translated into a deficit of 96 billion yuan,
the same as the readjusted budgetary amount examined and approved
at the Fourth Meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee,
according to the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
China issued a total of 389.1 billion yuan in state treasury
bonds in 1998, with 235.1 billion yuan repaying domestic and
foreign debts and 96 billion yuan offsetting the deficit for 1998,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue in the local budgets in 1998 amounted to 829.1
billion yuan, exceeding the total expenditures of 824.9 billion
yuan and resulting in a surplus of 4.2 billion yuan, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, total revenue for the whole country grew 13.9
percent to 985.3 billion yuan, while the expenditures rose 16.7
percent to reach 1.077 trillion yuan, resulting in a deficit of 91.
8 billion yuan, he said.

<P>
In addition, to lighten the burden on enterprises, the MOF
examined government funds and charges involving enterprises and
eliminated some illegal and unjustifiable funds and charges,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, problems still exist in implementing the budgets, said
Xiang, adding that violations of financial, economic laws and
discipline have become common problems and are rather rampant.
</P>
<P>
"These problems have seriously disrupted economic order, given
rise to corruption, impaired the image of the Party and the
government and caused strong resentment among the people," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the ratio of revenue to GDP, rise as it does, is
still low and the growth in fiscal revenue is checked since a
large sum of fiscal funds are not placed under budgetary
management and thereby lacks standardized administration and
supervision, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the structure of expenditure is unreasonable. The
state finance takes on too much financial burden, and still bears
the large expenditures which should be borne by enterprises,
society and individuals, he said.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in insufficiency of funds for major fiscal
spendings and it is even hard to meet payrolls in some areas,
explained the minister.
</P>
<P>
"To solve these problems, we must step up our efforts to
straighten out financial and economic order, thoroughly fight
corruption and continue to promote the reform of the financial and
taxation systems," he emphasized.

<P>
"Great changes took place in implementing the central and local
budgets in 1998," the minister explained, adding that "the Asian
financial crisis has had a more serious impact on China's economy
than expected."
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenge, the Chinese government tightened macro-
control and turned to an active fiscal policy. The Ministry of
Finance issued eight billion yuan's worth of additional bonds
overseas in June, 1998, and another 100 billion yuan's worth of
additional government bonds were issued to state-owned commercial
banks in August, said Xiang.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money raised through the 100 billion-yuan bond
issue, together with another 100 billion yuan in bank loans, went
to the construction of infrastructure facilities in agriculture,
forestry, water conservation, transportation, telecommunication
and environment protection, projects for upgrading urban and rural
power grids, grain warehouses and urban public utilities.
</P>
<P>
"The pro-active fiscal policy greatly promoted economic growth,
played a crucial role in basically attaining last year's projected
goals of economic growth and was conducive to the restructuring of
investment and the economy and future economic growth," said the
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Standardized tax system, tightened collection and management of
taxes, and reduction in loopholes were major factors behind the
rise in fiscal revenue last year, explained the minister.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the efficiency of the expenditure, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) increased investment in infrastructure facilities,
guaranteed timely and sufficient funding for basic living expenses
of laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises and for pensions
to retired employees, stepped up efforts to promote the reform of
the grain distribution system, allocated more funds to implement
the strategy of invigorating the country through science and
education, and appropriated more than 13 billion yuan for disaster
relief, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the MOF increased the fiscal spending last year on
infrastructure projects by 90.7 percent on a yearly basis,
allocated 16.8 billion yuan from the central finance as subsidies
and loans, raised expenditures for policy-related grain subsidies
by 10.2 billion yuan over the 1997 figure, and appropriated 37
percent and 27.9 percent more funds for education and science,
respectively.

BUENOS AIRES, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Boca Juniors have been banned
from playing at their famous "Chocolate Box" ground on Sunday
because of midweek crowd violence.
</P>
<P>
Buenos Aires city authorities ruled on Friday: "Boca Juniors'
Bombonera stadium is not in the necessary condition to host any
kind of sporting event this weekend."
</P>

An Argentine Football Association (AFA) spokesman said Boca
would play Sunday's first division fixture against Ferro Carril
Oeste at San Lorenzo's Buenos Aires stadium.

Tax rebate for 20 exporting items such as machinery, electrical

56 percent this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the army, armed police and procuratorial, judicial and
public security organs ordered to de-link with business operations,
the fiscal spending for national defense will expand further,
explained the minister.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure for national defense is planned to rise 12.7
percent to 104.65 billion yuan in 1999, and the funding for
customs, frontier defense and other government departments in
suppressing smuggling and for procuratorial, judicial and public
security organs in poverty-stricken areas will increase by another
three billion yuan, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal subsidies for implementing the grain and cotton
policies will increase by more than six billion yuan to over 50
billion yuan in 1999, with the state funding for education rising
2.6 billion yuan, or 20.4 percent, and technological input 820
million yuan, or 9.5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the central finance will increase tax rebates to local
authorities by 5.6 billion yuan, and allocate 2.15 billion yuan
more to ethnic regions and under-developed areas in poverty relief
fund and transfer payment.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the MOF also needs to guarantee sufficient funds to
ensure a minimum standard of living for laid-off workers from
state enterprises and help them get re-employed, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
After elaborating the details on the draft budget, the finance
minister said: "Implementing the budget for 1999 well and
fulfilling all financial tasks are of vital importance to
promoting economic restructuring, supporting the various reforms,
maintaining the sustainable and sound development of the national
economy and bringing about all-round social progress."
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal, the MOF should conscientiously implement the
pro-active financial policy and properly manage and use the
financial investment, take the initiative to promote the reform of
taxes and charges and improve and standardize the financial and
taxation systems, beef up tax collection and management to ensure
a steady increase in revenue, modify the functions of public
finance, optimize the structure of expenditures and establish the
basic framework for a system of public finance, rectify the

<HEADLINE> China's Budget Deficit to Exceed 150 Billion Yuan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's finance minister Xiang
Huaicheng said here today that China will continue to follow a pro-
active fiscal policy and the budget deficit is expected to rise to
150.3 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The central finance revenue is expected to grow 7.3 percent in
1999 to 588.6 billion yuan, and the total expenditures to rise 14.
7 percent to 738.9 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of 150.3
billion yuan, 54.3 billion yuan more than in 1997, said the
minister in his report this morning to the ongoing Second Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the nation's
highest lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
Xiang added that the MOF plans to issue 341.5 billion yuan in
government bonds in 1999, a decrease of 47.6 billion yuan from
last year. After offsetting the deficit, the rest will be used to
repay the principles and interests of maturing government debts.
</P>
<P>
Also, revenue target from the central government's funds is set
at 121.8 billion yuan, with the expenditure for funds totaling 122.
4 billion yuan, said Xiang.
</P>
<P>
In the local budgets, revenue will grow 6.1 percent to 879.9
billion yuan, and the expenditures will rise 6.7 percent to 879.9
billion yuan, according to the draft budgets.
</P>
<P>
Describing the year 1999 as "a year of special significance in
the course of China's development", the finance minister said it
is "a prudent decision" for the Chinese government to make to
increase domestic demand and implement a pro-active fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
The minister then listed a series of major areas for fiscal
spendings. Investment in infrastructure will expand by another 25
billion yuan, while the input into the agriculture, forestry,

<HEADLINE> hke030603 -Bomb Explosions Shatter Brief Calm in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A series of bomb blasts shattered
the calm in the riot-torn Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku
province, on Friday night, frightening people who then blockaded
main road.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Saturday, the bomb
explosions occurred near Silo Church, where hundreds of refugees
are being sheltered.
</P>
<P>
"There were three explosions near the church as we were about
to have dinner," Edwin Paliama, a staff member at the Silo Church
told the Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
One person was reportedly injured by a bullet fired by a
security officer.
</P>
<P>
No information was available yet about who was responsible for
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Edwin confirmed that dozens of marines were dispatched to the
scene.
</P>
<P>
The deployed marines are the advance group of 2,000
reinforcement troops sent to Ambon by Armed Forces Commander Gen.
Wiranto on Wednesday. Their arrival brought a semblance of calm to
Ambon on Thursday after weeks of horrendous clashes between
Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed more than 200 people
this year and forced thousands to flee the territory.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said more than 400 others were injured since
religious clashes erupted in the province in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
The violence was initially sparked by a dispute between a
Muslim migrant and a local Christian driver of a public minibus on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
It then quickly degenerated into full-scale rioting pitting
members of the two communities against one another.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

"Fresh progress was made in reform of the financial system,"
said the minister. "The People's Bank of China eliminated its
branches at the provincial level and established nine trans-
provincial or trans-regional branches."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the state issued special treasury bonds
totaling 270 billion yuan to replenish capital in wholly state-
funded commercial banks, thus increasing their ability to guard
against financial risks.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, last year China's pattern of imports
and exports continued to improve and there was improvement in the
utilization of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
"The total volume of China's imports and exports reached US$324
billion in 1998, a drop of 0.4% over the previous year," said Zeng,
adding that there was a rise of 0.5% for exports and a drop of 1.5%
for imports.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the scale of foreign investment in China
basically remained stable in 1998, with nearly 20,000 foreign-
funded projects approved and contracts involving US$52.1 billion
signed, an increase of 2.2% over the previous year. A total of US$
58.9 billion in foreign funds was used.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that more advances were made in science,
technology and education and all social undertakings made
comprehensive progress, adding that the Chinese people's living
standard continued to improve in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We achieved nine-year compulsory education in areas with 73%
of China's total population and illiteracy among young and middle-
aged people dropped to 5.5%," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he said, the per capita disposable income of city
dwellers was 5,425 yuan and the per capita net income of rural
residents was 2,160 yuan, representing increases of 5.8% and 4.3%
respectively in real terms over the previous year after allowing
for price drops.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Altar Unearthed in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Members of a Sino-Japanese
archeological team recently unearthed an ancient altar in central
China's Hunan Province,
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have verified the altar, the oldest relic of its
kind discovered in China to date, dates back some 5,700-6,000
years.
</P>
<P>
The altar in the shape of an irregular ellipse was unearthed in
Lixian County near Dongting Lake. The area also features a state-
protected site which was home to a primitive society which lived
between the Daxi and Shijiahe periods some 4,000-6,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The altar, which covers 200 sq.m., was covered by a thick layer
of loess soil. A thick layer of ash several dozen centimeters
thick covers a large area beside the altar. Archeologists also
excavated 40-odd one-meter-deep pits containing the bones of
individuals thought to have been offered as human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have not as yet determined whether the primitive
people used the altar to worship the Heavens or ancestors. Some,
however, believe the altar was a sacred site which the primitives
used to pray for good harvests. Their assumption is based on the
research carried out following the 1997 excavation of world's
oldest rice field located near the altar.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of the altar indicates that the primitive society
used the site for community activities rather than for individual
or family purposes," according to He Jiejun, director of the Hunan
Archeological Research Center.
</P>
<P>
He noted the altar was used over a 300-year period in which
primitive religion in China developed and prospered.
</P>
<P>
The provincial archeological center and Japanese International
Cultural Research Center have joined in eight cooperative
excavation projects.

The per capita floor space of people in urban areas exceeded
nine square meters, while the impoverished population in rural
areas dropped by 8 million. The registered unemployment rate in
cities and towns was 3.1%, and the natural population growth rate
was 0.953%, meeting the planned target, said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
The minister also listed conflicts and problems that still
exist in China's economic and social activities at present.
</P>
<P>
"The economic structure is irrational and the problem of
redundant development which has plagued us for many years has
resulted in a great deal of idle production capacity," he said. "
Meanwhile, quite a number of state-owned enterprises are still
experiencing difficulties in production and operation and
suffering declines in economic performance."
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he said, the total profit of industrial enterprises
decreased by 17% over 1997 and the losses of loss-making
enterprises increased by 22.1%. The number of workers laid off
from state-owned enterprises is on the increase, adding pressure
on employment efforts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, final consumption demand is feeble and it is
difficult to stimulate the market. The risks accumulated by
financial institutions over many years cannot be ignored. The
environment is deteriorating in some regions and pollution is
severe in some cities.
</P>
<P>
"We should take further measures and work hard to solve these
problems," he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of
the State Development Planning Commission, reported here today
China's main targets for economic and social development in 1999
to the ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
the country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Targets listed in Zeng's report include:
</P>
<P>
-- The economy should grow by about 7%.
</P>
<P>
-- National investment in fixed assets should increase by about
12%.
</P>
<P>
-- The rise in national retail prices should be held under 2%
and the rise in consumer prices should be kept under 4%.
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts should be made to increase the total volume of
imports and exports and achieve a fundamental balance between them.
</P>
<P>
-- The deficit should remain at a necessary level, with a
central budget deficit of 150.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
-- The total money supply should be about 150 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
-- The registered unemployment rate in cities and towns should
be confined to about 3.5%.
</P>
<P>
-- The natural population growth rate should be limited to 1.01%
.
</P>
<P>
To attain these targets, Zeng said, there are six major tasks
for national economic and social development that must be
fulfilled this year:
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening capital construction for agricultural
development and adjusting and optimizing the agricultural
structure;
</P>
<P>
-- Striving to create favorable external conditions for the
reform of state-owned enterprises and strengthening support for
small and medium-sized enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting economic restructuring and fostering new growth
areas in the economy;
</P>
<P>
-- Deepening the price reform to rectify order in the market;
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to follow the strategy of developing the country
by relying on science and education and basing economic growth on
advances in science and technology and on improvement in the
quality of the labor force;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting all social undertakings to further improve people'
s lives.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of
the State Development Planning Commission, said here today that
China this year will strengthen capital construction for
agricultural development and adjust and optimize the agricultural
structure.
</P>
<P>
Zeng made these remarks in a report on the implementation of
the 1998 plan for national economic and social development and on
a draft 1999 plan for national economic and social development
delivered at the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
"We need to continue intensifying capital construction for
agricultural development, focusing on water conservancy," said the
minister. "We should speed up the work of harnessing major rivers
and lakes and repairing facilities damaged by floods, focusing on
reinforcement of banks to ensure safety during the flood season
this year."
</P>
<P>
Silted rivers and lakes should be dredged, he said, while it is
also necessary to remove some embankments in a planned way to
discharge floodwater and return some farmland reclaimed from lakes
back to the original state so as to restore and improve the
capacity of rivers to handle floodwater and the capacity of lakes
to store floodwater. New towns should be built as needed for
displaced people, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should speed up projects to reinforce dilapidated and
dangerous reservoirs and intensify our efforts to build more
regulating facilities on major rivers to improve their regulating
and storage capacity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that practical measures need to be taken to
improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
"In the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and the Yellow
rivers, in the grasslands and in the windy and sandy areas in the
Northwest, the Northeast and North China, we should redouble our
efforts to bring about an all-round improvement in the environment,
plant trees and grow grass on a large scale and develop an
environmentally friendly agriculture," he elaborated.

<P>
According to the minister, in 1999 the Chinese government will
try to increase the per capita disposable income of urban
residents and the per capita net income of rural residents by 4%
in real terms.
</P>
<P>
The government will also intensify efforts to help the poor and
make sure that more than 10 million poverty-stricken people in
rural areas will have adequate food and clothing in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zeng, in a socialist market economy, the set
economic growth rate is an anticipatory index subject to
adjustment in response to changes in domestic and foreign economic
situations.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into full consideration a variety of factors, we have
set the target for economic growth at about 7%," he noted, adding
that maintaining a relatively fast pace of growth will help
resolve conflicts and problems in various sectors and boost
people's confidence.
</P>
<P>
While China has the capacity to reach this target, it is also
necessary to work very, very hard to attain it, said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
"We need to step up efforts to improve the economic structure
and the pattern of economic growth, continuing to combine a good
pace of growth with a good structure, quality and performance for
the economy. We should also concentrate on developing markets,
optimizing the structure and improving the quality and performance
of economic growth while maintaining an appropriately rapid
economic growth," he concluded.

The minister said that the area devoted to grain crops in 1999
should be maintained at 110 million hectares and that total grain
output should reach 495 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"We should also adjust the pattern of cultivation to comply
with market demand and improve the quality of farm produce," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Further efforts should be made to expand the application of
advanced practical agricultural technologies, especially more
efficient water-saving irrigation, such as drip irrigation and
spray irrigation, and dry farming techniques, and develop
precision agriculture, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of doing everything possible to
increase the income of farmers.
</P>
<P>
"We should improve the system of non-government services in
agricultural development, develop more industrialized agricultural
operations and increase the degree of processing and the
conversion rate of agricultural products," he said.
</P>
<P>
More of the rural work force should be organized to work on
infrastructure development and efforts should be made to increase
the income of these workers for their services, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should restructure rural enterprises, paying particularly
close attention to quality, economic performance and environmental
protection and focusing on the processing of agricultural and
subsidiary products and their storage, preservation,
transportation and marketing," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Practical measures to lighten the burden on farmers should be
taken, such as implementing the policy of collecting reasonable
and limited charges for specified items only, charges that will
remain unchanged for at least three years, and resolutely banning
indiscriminate charges, unauthorized fund-raising and arbitrary
fines and quotas, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the development of small cities and towns
should be accelerated, adding that a good job should be done of
experimenting with the reform of the management system for
household registration in these cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
"We should give play to the role of small cities and towns in
promoting economic development in rural areas to improve the
quality of life for farmers," he said.

<HEADLINE> China To Deepen Price Reform in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of
the State Development Planning Commission, said here today that
China this year will further deepen price reform and rectify
market order.
</P>
<P>
"We should seize this opportune time when the overall price
level has been falling to make further adjustments in the price
structure and reform the price formation mechanism while boosting
domestic demand and upgrading industries," said Zeng in a report
on the implementation of the 1998 plan and a draft 1999 plan for
China's national economic and social development delivered at the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
the country's legislature.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Chinese government will focus on
adjusting prices in basic industries and public utilities,
including postal services, telecommunications and housing, aiming
to break monopolies in these areas.
</P>
<P>
"We should reform the management of power rates in rural areas,
gradually integrating power grids and making power rates the same
for urban and rural areas. We should experiment with separation of
the management of power plants from that of power grids so that
power plants can offer competitive prices for power grids," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to continue to implement the policy of
offering protective prices for state grain purchases and rectify
order for purchases of grain in the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will lift controls on purchase prices for cotton and retail
prices for chemical fertilizers. We should promote charge-levying
reform and speed up moves to straighten out the relationships
among taxes, charges and prices," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, it is necessary to rectify order in the
market and standardize pricing.
</P>
<P>
"We should resolutely crack down on the production and
marketing of fake and shoddy goods, formulate supporting
regulations for the Price Law and investigate and prosecute in
accordance with law pricing irregularities such as dumping,
monopoly, fraud, price discrimination and price hikes for
exorbitant profits," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be taken to improve the management of prices for
medicines and charges for medical services and standardize the
discounting of prices for medicines, and to rectify the
construction market and standardize charges for construction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should also carry out inspection surveys of prices and
charges closely related to people's lives, particularly charges
for telecommunications services, purchase prices for grain, power
rates in rural areas and charges that affect rural people and
agricultural development," he said.

The rate of exchange, that closed Thursday at 2.08 reals for a
dollar, after opening at 2.13 reals for one dollar, dropped again
Friday, opening at 2.06, and by midday it had reached 1.99.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, which had been sold Thursday in the parallel market
at 2.1 reals, was negotiated Friday at 1.9 reals in the Rio de
Janeiro money exchange houses and at 1.89 in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
Operators in the futures market, where the dollar had reached a
surprising appreciation, started to close negotiations for next
April with a 1.98 reals for a dollar rate of exchange.
</P>
<P>
The rapid recovery of the real was attributed to the assumption
of new Central Bank President Arminio Fraga, and to the imminent
announcement of a new agreement of the government with the
International Monetary Fund by which Brazil will obtain 41.5
billion dollars in assistance.
</P>
<P>
Fraga announced several changes in the monetary policies of the
country, basically directed to reduce inflation and to mollify the
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The new Central Bank president said that all the efforts will
be aimed at preventing a further inflation increase, and that the
Central Bank will intervene in the exchange market to sell dollars
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a 39 percent to 45 percent annual increase in
the interest rate, to reduce even more the circulating money and
stop the inflation that resulted from the devaluation, since the
increase in the cost of living in February was higher than in all
of last year.

<P>
SANTIAGO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza said Friday his government has not decided to
attend the ninth Iberoamerican Summit scheduled for November in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He said Chile's decision would depend on the development of
events and the number of heads of state to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
He added that his government would consider the invitation to
the summit carefully as Chile must not be left out of the
Iberoamerican Community.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Chilean government announced suspension of
official meetings with Spain and Britain, and said its decision
concerning the summit would be based on the development of former
Chilean ruler Augusto Pinochet's case.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 82, was detained last October by British police
acting on an extradition warrant from Spain in connection with
allegations that he murdered Spanish citizens while in power from
1973 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Boost Domestic Demand in 1999 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of
the State Development Planning Commission, said here today that
the Chinese government will adopt four major measures to further
expand domestic demand and keep up the momentum of economic
development in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Measures listed by Zeng in his report on a 1999 draft plan for
China's national economic and social development delivered at the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
the Chinese legislature, include:
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing investment in fixed assets and ensuring the
quality of infrastructure projects;
</P>
<P>
-- Correctly guiding the orientation of consumer spending and
devoting a great deal of effort to developing consumer markets in
rural areas;
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent
monetary policy;
</P>
<P>
-- Expanding foreign trade and vigorously, rationally and
effectively utilizing foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the Asian financial crisis and changes in
international markets, it is right for us to continue boosting
domestic demand. This also constitutes the basic foundation for
China's economic development as well as part of our long-term
strategic principles," said the minister in his report.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's total investment in fixed assets should
increase by about 12% in 1999. While the state sector of the
economy continues to increase investment, the government should
encourage the non-state sector to do the same.
</P>
<P>
"Investment in fixed assets should mainly go to rebuilding in
flood-hit areas, the harnessing of rivers and lakes, water
conservancy projects, infrastructure projects currently under way
and projects to develop major equipment domestically and apply
high technology to production," said Zeng.

<P>
It is also necessary to encourage people to increase
consumption and improve government policies in order to increase
people's spending on housing, cars and other high value consumer
goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of the urban housing system should be speeded up by
rectifying the selling prices of land and compensation for
demolition," he noted. "We should also increase housing credits,
improve the secondary housing market and make housing a new
consumption growth area as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to encourage and expand the
practice of paying in installments and other forms of individual
credit consumption, he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that vigorous efforts should be made to
develop rural markets.
</P>
<P>
"We should improve the consumption environment in rural areas
by strengthening the development of infrastructure facilities such
as water supply, power supply, roads, communications, radio and TV
and by creating conditions for rural families to be able to use
household electrical appliances and telephones," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also needed to produce and develop high-quality and
reasonably-priced agricultural machinery for irrigation and field
work and for the artificial drying of grain and the processing and
transportation of agricultural and subsidiary products, he said,
adding that it is necessary to develop water treatment equipment
suitable for rural markets and introduce efficient and energy-
saving multiple-fuel cooking stoves.

<P>
He stressed that no more industrial development projects should
be examined and approved in 1999, except in cases where technology
will be improved and products will be upgraded and marketable.
Funds should be concentrated to ensure that a number of key
development projects be completed and put into operation.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring the quality of infrastructure projects is crucial to
the success of the policy of boosting domestic demand, said the
minister, adding that project development procedures should be
strictly followed and quality closely monitored at all points in
the process.
</P>
<P>
"The legal person responsibility system for projects should be
improved and the public bidding system standardized, the
supervision system and the contract management system for projects
strengthened and the system of making leaders responsible for
project quality implemented," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to use economic, legal and administrative means
plus supervision through public opinion to intensify the
supervision and control of project quality, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Zeng, developing urban and rural consumer markets
is an important aspect of China's efforts to boost domestic demand.
It is necessary to take effective measures to expand consumer
spending and stimulate urban and rural markets to allow investment
and consumption to play their role in fueling economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We should further improve the pattern and manner of the
distribution of social wealth and increase the purchasing power of
urban and rural people. Special attention should be paid to
increasing the cash income of people with low and medium incomes,"
he said.

"We should expand the fields of consumption and open up new
service consumption markets, encourage and guide a rapid
development of the tertiary industry, introduce industrial
management of culture, sports, non-compulsory education and non-
basic medical care, make tourism a new growth area in the economy,
and promote a rapid development of community services to make
things more convenient for people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, this year China will continue to
follow a proactive fiscal policy, and issue treasury bonds for
rebuilding in flood-hit areas and for water conservancy projects
and other infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
"We must see to it that the limited funds are put to good use
and that the investment of government funds guides the investment
of other funds in society. Meanwhile, we must increase revenue and
reduce expenditures and oppose waste and extravagance," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to continue to improve the financial order
and strengthen supervision over finances by making sure that
administrative charges and income from imposition of fines and
confiscation of funds are turned over to the government as
national revenue and are not used without authorization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China should pursue a prudent monetary
policy to promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that in 1999 the supply of M2 will increase by
14% to 15% and that of M1 will increase by about 14%," he said. "
In accordance with the guidance plan, state banks will grant 1
trillion yuan of loans in 1999, an increase of 14.6% over last
year."

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb President Sacked for alleged Power Abusing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A Western envoy sacked Bosnian
Serb President Nikola Poplasen on Friday, accusing him of power
abuse and defying the will of voters.
</P>
<P>
High Representative of Peace Implementation Council (of Bosnia),
Spanish diplomat Carlos Westendorp, said he made the decision
under the authorization of related articles in the Dayton Peace
Accord and resolutions of the Peace Implementation Council, the
Yugoslav Tanjug news agency quoted a statement of Westendorp's
office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also blamed the sacked president for constantly
endangering the stability of the Bosnian Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
In a move to show his defiance, Poplasen issued a statement on
the same day, calling Westendorp's decision "illegitimate and
undemocratic."
</P>
<P>
Poplasen said he would only step down in the "same democratic
way as he was elected" and that there should be a referendum to
decide on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Friction between Poplasen, elected as president in last
September, and those "moderates" headed by former president
Biljana Plavsic and supported by Western countries, has led to a
power struggle in Bosnia's Serb republic half during the past
months.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp has been empowered to implement the 1995 Dayton
peace agreement which ended Bosnia's 43-month ethnic war by
establishing a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation within
a single state.

<P>
The system for foreign trade management should also be further
reformed by accelerating a transition from an examination and
approval system to a registration and recording system for the
right to engage in export, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We should further optimize the pattern of imports, encourage
the import of high-tech products and equipment, and import raw and
semi-finished materials and resource products which are in short
supply in China," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China should strive to keep the scale of
foreign fund utilization stable and raise the quality and level of
the use of these funds.
</P>
<P>
"We should relax restrictions on foreign investment in selected
areas and open service trades to foreign firms on a step by step
basis, strive to open new financing channels by exploring the use
of internationally accepted methods of absorbing foreign
investment, and gradually ensure that foreign investors receive
the same treatment as their Chinese counterparts and strive to
attract investment from multinational corporations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to optimize the structure of foreign
investment and encourage foreign investment in the central and
western areas of China, giving priority to attracting foreign
funding for a number of projects with good conditions involving
agriculture, water conservancy, transport, energy, raw and semi-
finished materials and environmental protection, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In managing foreign investment, we should gradually shift our
focus from the system of examination and approval of projects to
policy-related guidance. Meanwhile, we should continue to improve
the environment for foreign investment by improving the system of
laws and regulations and making use of legal means to put a stop
to the arbitrary levying of charges on foreign-funded enterprises,
" he said.

<P>
He stressed that the exchange rate of the Renminbi should
remain stable, while the money supply should be regulated by using
such means as interest rates, re-lending, rediscount, open-market
operations and reserves against deposit.
</P>
<P>
More loans should be granted to infrastructure, agriculture,
consumption and small and medium-sized enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing opening to the outside world as a basic policy of
China, the minister said that while increasing domestic demand, it
is also needed to redouble efforts to develop foreign trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to pursue the strategies of market
diversification and achieving success by improving product quality
and use every possible means to increase exports, try to improve
the quality and grades of exports and do more to export accessory
items and entire product lines and increase the added value of
exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to help and encourage enterprises which
meet necessary conditions to engage in the processing of imported
materials outside of China to promote the export of labor,
equipment and raw and semi-finished materials, which is a major
way of increasing exports at the moment, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to optimize the pattern of exports and
adopt measures such as export quotas, credit policies and
adjustments in the level of export tax rebates to promote export,
especially the export of famous-brand high-quality products, form
production bases for the export of large quantities of
agricultural products, build more storage facilities and establish
a risk prevention mechanism," he noted.

Bordering India, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Myanmar, Tibet
boasts abundant natural resources, unique plateau landscapes and
rich Tibetan cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the regional government adopted an opening-up policy
that aimed to take advantage of the resources under preferential
policies granted by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Tibet plans to set up a light industrial zone in its capital,
Lhasa, and expand economic and technological cooperation with
interior areas and foreign countries, while increasing exports of
agricultural and livestock products, handicrafts and mineral
products.

<P>
The regional government has been allowed to examine and approve,
if requirements are met, all foreign-funded projects, except those
prohibited by the state government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade with neighboring countries is expected to be
boosted since Tibet has decided to accelerate border trade with
Nepal, India, Myanmar and Bhutan.

<HEADLINE> Tyson to Serve Extra 60 Days for Violating Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indiana won't sentence Mike
Tyson but decided to lock the former heavyweight champion in a
Maryland jail for an extra 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Tyson will serve the additional time in Maryland for violating
his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape conviction, according to
court documents filed Friday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
His 60-day sentence begins at the end of the one year he is
serving in Montgomery County, Maryland, for assaulting two men
after a minor road accident. The Maryland sentence could be
reduced for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
Indiana authorities could have forced Tyson to serve up to four
years in prison, but they wanted to resolve the issue at no
further cost to taxpayers while still holding Tyson accountable,
Marion County prosecutor Scott Newman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We were frankly not anxious -- and I don't think the people of
Indiana were anxious -- to have Mike Tyson back in our courts and
in our jails," Newman said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is "satisfied with this matter is behind him now and he's
looking forward to his future," said James Voyles, the boxer's
Indianapolis lawyer.
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why he doesn't resume training and fighting"
once he is released from jail, Voyles said. He added that he does
not expect the agreement to affect Tyson's Nevada boxing license.
</P>
<P>
Tyson will pay Indiana $80 per day, or a total of $4,800, for
the cost of his incarceration, and Indiana will reimburse Maryland
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Tyson admitted he violated his probation. He also waived his
right to appeal his no-contest plea to the charges. Tyson's
probation was scheduled to end March 24.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed Thursday by Newman, Tyson and Voyles
and was accepted Friday by Judge Patricia Gifford, who had
sentenced Tyson for his 1992 conviction.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released
from prision in March 1995 after serving three years of a six-year
sentence. He began serving his Maryland sentence on February 5.

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Overproduction of Cashmere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has stopped
approving new cashmere production as part of its efforts to curb
overproduction of goods, according to the State Textile Industry
Administration.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest cashmere producer and its exports
account for about 60 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high profit margins, there are over 2,000
cashmere producers in China, leading to overproduction and driving
down the price. It has been estimated that there is a stockpile of
3,000 tons of the material.
</P>
<P>
Banks have also stopped loans for cashmere production, and the
government has set a protective ceiling on cashmere prices and has
purchased 3,000 tons of cashmere.

<HEADLINE> China Attains Macro-Control Targets for 1998 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1998 industrial added value (for all state-owned industrial
enterprises and non-state industrial enterprises with annual
product sales incomes of more than 5 million yuan) amounted to 2.
0046 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.8% over the previous year,
said Zeng. The sales rate for manufactured goods also increased
gradually, with an average of 96.5% for the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the scale of investment in fixed
assets in China increased last year, and the pace of
infrastructure development was notably quickened. A total of 2.
8457 trillion yuan was invested in fixed assets in 1998, an
increase of 14.1% over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"More fixed assets investment was appropriately directed to the
central and western areas of the country. Investment in the
western area increased by 31.2% over 1997, 14.9 percentage points
more than the increase for the eastern area," said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
In terms of China's financial situation, Zeng said that revenue
for the country as a whole (excluding revenue generated from loans)
totaled 985.3 billion yuan in 1998, an increase of 13.9% over the
previous year. Expenditures (excluding repayment of loans) totaled
1.0771 trillion yuan, an increase of 16.7%.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures exceeded revenue by 91.8 billion yuan and the
deficit for the central budget alone was 96 billion yuan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the net amount of currency issued in 1998 amounted
to 102.7 billion yuan, which was smaller than the projected figure.
Meanwhile, China's foreign exchange reserves totaled US$145
billion at the end of 1998, US$5.1 billion more than those at the
end of the previous year, and the exchange rate for the Renminbi
remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Zeng went on to say that steady progress was made in all
reforms and headway was made in efforts to re-employ laid-off
workers.

<HEADLINE> China Attains Macro-Control Targets for 1998 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of
the State Development Planning Commission, said here today that
China has successfully implemented its plan for national economic
and social development in 1998 and has basically attained its
macro-control targets in spite of the negative impact of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the 1998 plan was implemented satisfactorily and
the macro-control targets were basically attained," said Zeng in a
report on the implementation of the 1998 plan for national
economic and social development and on a draft 1999 plan for
national economic and social development delivered at the ongoing
Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, who was entrusted by the State Council, China's cabinet,
to make the report, said the central authorities resolutely made
the decision to increase investment and boost domestic demand so
as to step up infrastructure development and promote economic
growth when the country was faced with the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, China's national economy sustained a
relatively rapid growth and there was a drop in the overall price
level in the market. With the implementation of policies and
measures to boost domestic demand, the rate of economic growth
gradually increased.
</P>
<P>
"The country's gross domestic product hit 7.9553 trillion yuan
in 1998, representing an increase of 7.8% over 1997 and basically
reaching the target set in early 1998," he said, adding that the
overall retail price level dropped by 2.6% over the previous year
and consumer prices fell by 0.8%.
</P>
<P>
There was a good harvest for China last year, and industrial
production also increased steadily, said Zeng. In 1998, China's
grain output exceeded 490 million tons; cotton output reached 4.4
million tons; and oil-bearing crops, 22.92 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Collects More Taxes From Overseas-Funded Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in east
China's Anhui Province turned in 790 million yuan in taxes last
year, a jump of 36 percent over 1997, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
This amount raised the proportion of taxes from overseas-funded
firms in the province's total industrial and commercial tax
revenue to six percent, one percentage point more than in 1997, an
official source said.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in taxes paid by overseas-funded enterprises
was due mainly to the number of large and medium-sized projects
that were created last year and became major sources of taxes
immediately, the official said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Anhui last year also stepped up efforts to
stop tax evasion, according to the official.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Tatiana Malinina of Uzbekistan and
world champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia dominated the women's and
men's short programs in on opening day of the ISU Grand Prix
finals in St. Petersburg on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo took the pairs short program,
while Russia's Anjelica Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov came out on
top in both the compulsory and original ice dances.
</P>
<P>
Malinina took the women's short program, upsetting favorite
Maria Butyrskaya despite a difficult program. Malinina nailed a
triple lutz-double toe, a triple flip and a strong high double
axel.
</P>
<P>
Yagudin executed a clean triple axel-triple toe and triple lutz,
as did 16-year-old runner-up Evgeny Plushenko. But Yagudin's
artistic program was stronger.
</P>
<P>
Shen and Zhao shined with a very high double twist and a throw
on the triple loop. Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze, Olympic silver medalists, had been expected to fare
more strongly, but Berezhnaya made three mistakes, including a
fall right in front of the judges.
</P>
<P>
Krylova and Ovsyannikov placed first in the compulsory and
original dances Friday, with difficult, fast programs that they
performed smoothly. French pair Marina Anissina and Gwendal
Peizerat came in second in both programs.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Realizes Grain Self-sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province,
a former grain importer, now has a three billion kg grain surplus
available for export.
</P>
<P>
The province has thus achieved grain self-sufficiency for the
first time in history.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, one of the poorest areas in China, was forced to import
500 million kg of grain annually over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Xie Guoye, deputy director of the Gansu Grain Bureau, said the
province 1998 grain output hit 8.7 billion kg, with the current
stockpile standing at five billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievement to central government efforts to
solve the grain shortage problem in Gansu. The government
allocated over one billion yuan in the early 1980s to build grain
production base in the Hexi Corridor located in western Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The Hexi area has developed into one of the country's major
grain production bases with an annual output of three billion kg
and currently accounts for about a third of the province's total
output.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of advanced farming techniques, has helped
increase grain output by offsetting the effects of prevailing dry
and cold weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Gansu's grain output climbed from six
billion kg in 1985 to over eight billion kg last year, with the
figure expected to hit nine billion kg in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, a province which features both arid and semi-arid areas
with mountains and deep valleys, has a total population of 24
million people.
</P>
<P>
The province is home to approximately three percent of the
nation's total cultivable land. Nonetheless, the former 3,000 kg
per hectare grain output for some areas represented a mere 20
percent of the output for developed areas.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Chief Calls for Zero Violence Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- It is time that all members
of the society take a stand to eradicate violence against women in
all its manifestations, Executive Director of the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) Nafis Sadik said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement for the International Women's Day which comes on
March 8, she encouraged all governments to work towards ending
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
"Women and girls are actually at greater risk of violence from
members of their households, than from strangers," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many forms of communally sanctioned violence against women,
such as female genital mutilation, are associated with the
community's or the family's demand for sexual chastity and
virginity, she said.
</P>
<P>
Women and girls' reproductive and sexual health should not
depend on the perceptions and feelings of those wielding authority
over them, but must be guaranteed as a basic human right, Sadik
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the fight for the eradication of violence against
women, Sadik will join U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Monday, March 8 in a global video-conference entitled "A World
Free of Violence against Women" at the U.N. General Assembly Hall.

<HEADLINE> Le Saux and Fowler Agree Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux and
Liverpool's Robbie Fowler has reached a peace pact when Le Saux on
Friday wrote a letter of apology to Fowler following their clash
at Stamford Bridge last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fowler responded by saying he would like to think this was the
end of the matter, and that his actions were "misinterpreted".
</P>
<P>
TV replays of Chelsea's 2-1 win showed Fowler falling to floor
after being elbowed by his England team-mate Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
Both players have been charged with misconduct by the Football
Association over the clash, which allegedly followed personal
taunts from Fowler aimed at Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement released through Chelsea, Le Saux said: "I
recognise that the use of elbows can be dangerous and I should not
have reacted in the way I did.
</P>
<P>
"People in all walks of life occasionally face provocation, and
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
"I realise I have to deal with it in a more mature manner. I
accept that I will face punishment from the FA, and I recognise
now that I was lucky not to have been sent off for the way I
reacted."
</P>
<P>
Le Saux and Fowler were involved in a running battle throughout
the 90 minutes as the game threatened to boil over, but the
elbowing incident was not spotted by the referee or his assistants.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Chelsea reiterated: "Graeme Le Saux today
apologised unequivocally for his attack on fellow England player,
Robbie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
"He has written a private and confidential letter of apology to
Fowler, expressing his regret at the incident during the Chelsea-
Liverpool match."
</P>
<P>
Fowler responded with a statement from his solicitor, Kevin
Dooley, which read: "The incident during last Saturday's match at
Chelsea in which I was elbowed on the back of the head by Graeme
Le Saux was highly regrettable.
</P>
<P>
"Graeme may have misinterpreted my actions, which were not
intended to cause any offence, and it is unfortunate that attempts
have been made since the game by others to make me the scapegoat
for what took place.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to think that this is the end of the matter and I
look forward to the opportunity of playing alongside Graeme in
future England matches."

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Fabrice Santoro advanced into
the semi-finals of the Copenhagen Open tennis tournament in
Denmark on Friday, winning the first set 6-3 and leading the
second 2-0 when his opponent Rainer Schuttler of German gave up
suffering from flu.
</P>
<P>
The fourth seeded Santoro, who has conceded only nine games in
three matches and not yet dropped a set, will play his unseeded
French compatriot Sebastien Grosjean on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe will face last year's
Copenhagen Open winner Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden, seeded third,
in the other semi.
</P>
<P>
Santoro, 41st in the world rankings, has spent 10 years on the
professional tour, beating world number one Pete Sampras of the
United States three times.
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson was hard pressed in his quarter-final, taking 125
minutes to beat Wayne Black of Zimbabwe 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. The younger
of the Black brothers hurt his right ankle early in the third set
but fought to the end despite a painful limp.
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, 32, has defeated his semi-final opponent, the older
Black brother Byron, in two previous encounters without dropping a
set.
</P>
<P>
Black, 29, needed 119 minutes to fight off an energetic
challenge by Max Mirnyi of Belarus, who hammered home 17 aces. He
won 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 over Mirnyi, the 1998 Wimbledon and U.S. Open
champion in mixed doubles with American Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
Hitting stinging baseline shots, Grosjean turned from the brink
of defeat to beat Canadian Daniel Nestor 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. Nestor led
the second set 4-3 but Grosjean, 82nd in the world, rallied to
engineer an all-French semi-final.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Discuss Bananas With UK Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to resolve the escalating
trade war with the United States over banana imports, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook will meet U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for talks Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cook told reporters Friday the hastily arranged meeting with
Albright, who will pass through London on her way back from a trip
to Asia, represents a chance to discuss how to get their relations
back on track.
</P>
<P>
"We are both committed to free trade and I would certainly wish
to argue that it is not helpful for America unilaterally to impose
trade sanctions on Britain," Cook was quoted by Reuters as saying
during a trip to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
"My message to Madeleine Albright... is that our two countries
have much more in common than we have in disagreement and we ought
to make sure that disagreements do not come between us when we
have so much to gain by working closely together."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Britain's Foreign Office summoned the U.S.
ambassador in London for the second time in 24 hours to reprimand
him about an escalating trade war over bananas. The meeting
yielded no progress in resolving the dispute, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Philip Lader sought to calm troubled diplomatic
waters and insisted the United States would work hard with Britain
to find a solution to the threat of a trade war, calling the
threat nothing more than an "irritant" in the friendship between
Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We're working towards finding an amicable solution, one that
is consistent with WTO rules," Lader told the press after the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Hristina Kalcheva Grabs High Jump World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 5 (Xinhua) - Hristina Kalcheva of Bulgaria grabbed
the world title in the women's high jump at the 7th World Indoor
Athletics Championships which opened Friday in Maebashi, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The little known girl from Plovdiv was a big surprise at the
championships, clearing 1.99 meters for the gold.
</P>
<P>
She continued the Bulgarian tradition in this event: six world
titles won at the seven indoor championships held so far.
</P>
<P>
At the 6th championships in Paris in 1997 Stefka Kostadinova
became world title-holder for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
In Maebashi, Kalcheva significantly improved her previous
season's best of 1.92 meters. Last year in Sofia she cleared 1.99,
jumping in the open.
</P>
<P>
"Fairly speaking, I did not expect to clear more than 1.96
meters and was surprised by the result myself. However, I think
that Rostislav Dimitrov's achievement in the triple jump inspired
me and I began to think of winning a second medal for Bulgaria
today," Kalcheva said.
</P>
<P>
"I still do not know how it happened. I expect to perform well
and secretly hoped for a medal, but the world title was a great
surprise even to me," Atanas Atanassov, Kalcheva's coach said.
</P>
<P>
Hristina Kalcheva was born in the town of Aleksin (near Moscow)
on May 29, 1977. Her mother is Russian and her father is Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
Until a year ago Kalcheva had dual nationality, Russian and
Bulgarian. In 1998 she gave up her Russian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Kalcheva took up athletics when she was 11 years old. She
started training under Atanas Atanassov, former champion and
Bulgarian record-holder in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
Her first achievement was the clearing of 1.78 meters in 1996,
when she became holder of the Bulgarian junior athletics title.
</P>
<P>
She won the Bulgarian women's title in the open twice, in 1997
and 1998; she is also holder of the 1997 and 1998 women's indoor
title.
</P>
<P>
She placed second at the European Cup tournament in Prague in
1998.
</P>
<P>
She failed the qualifiers for the European championships in
Budapest in 1998.

<HEADLINE> EU-China Energy Cooperation Meeting Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and China
closed their two-day energy cooperation conference Friday, which a
senior Chinese government official said was very successful.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the European partners need to learn
more about China.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session, Wang Shaoqi, director general of
international cooperation of China's Ministry of Science and
Technology, said that the European partners in the energy circle
have great desires to find cooperation and investment
opportunities in China, but they do not have enough knowledge of
China.
</P>
<P>
He said that many participants are very interested in a report
about China's energy structure and this has proved that many
European companies do not have sufficient information about China.
Therefore, the Chinese official suggested that European
businessmen have more contacts with their Chinese counterparts and
look for opportunities for a visit to China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the EU and China signed a joint declaration
on EU-China energy cooperation. Under the joint declaration signed
at the energy conference by EU Commissioner Christos Papoutsis and
Xu Guanhua, vice minister of science and technology of China, the
EU-China cooperation in the energy field will be strengthened
through maintaining a permanent and effective dialogue on energy
issues of mutual importance.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should create conditions for facilitating an
increased presence of EU energy companies in China, and vice
versa, including the policy, legal, regulatory and fiscal aspects,
while continuing jointly to support exchanges, training courses,
workshops, seminars and studies, according to the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also underlined the new opportunities offered by
the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation between
the EU and China signed in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 300 representatives from the 15 EU member
states and China, Papoutsis said the European Commission stands
ready to play an active role in promoting international energy
cooperation and contacts at appropriate level, between industry,
the financial sector and decision-makers, in order to make
substantial progress on matters of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing the level of the dialogue and reinforcing mutual
understanding; contributing jointly to the harmonious development
of energy policy worldwide; creating the conditions for an
expanded presence of European companies in China, in the interests
of both China and the European Union -- these are the fundamental
elements for a new dimension in our energy relations at the dawn
of the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The discussions at the energy conference cover electricity,
coal, gas, oil, renewables and energy efficiency. It will be
regarded as a major opportunity for consolidating existing
EU-China links, establishing new ones, and providing an update on
most recent development, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
Energy cooperation between the EU and China dates back to the
early 1980s, and energy is one of the cooperation fields
explicitly mentioned in the Trade and Economic Cooperation
Agreement signed between the then European Community and China in
1985.

and voiced his hope to see the early return of a U.N. peacekeeping
mission to the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said, "I
unreservedly strongly condemn the merciless murders, inhuman
mutilations and other appalling human rights violations
perpetrated by the rebels on the civilians in Freetown."
</P>
<P>
Annan also recommended that the mandate of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) be extended for a three-month
period until June 13, 1999. Its current mandate will expire on
March 13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The eight-person observer mission and special representative
Francis Okelo were forced to relocate to neighboring Guinea during
a recent rebel offensive in Freetown, which was later repulsed by
the Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers known as the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he intended to increase the number of military
observers from eight to 14, and he hoped that the mission could
return to the capital of the West African country shortly.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the light of some allegations that members
of pro-government forces may also have been guilty of violations,
he hoped that the Sierra Leonean government would fulfill its
assurances that such allegations will be investigated.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a U.N. human rights right on the Sierra Leone
atrocities against civilians, Annan said that peacekeepers with
the ECOMOG force had also been accused of summary executions.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the ECOMOG high command had promised an
investigation would "take corrective action as necessary."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan appealed to the international community to
continue to support the ECOMOG logistically.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the possible partial withdrawal" of Nigerian
forces from the ECOMOG following the elections in the country and
the consequent effects on the ECOMOG's military effectiveness in
Sierra Leone could "require a major reappraisal of the situation."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also praised as a bold and valuable President
Ahmed Kabbah's decision to allow the leader of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Foday Sankoh, to meet with rebel
leaders in order to develop a coherent set of political demands,
which would form the basis of subsequent negotiations with the
Sierra Leonean government.
</P>
<P>
In view of the improvement in the security situation in and
around Freetown achieved during the past few days, he expressed
his intention to re-established the UNOMSIL in the capital as soon
as possible.

<HEADLINE> UK's Veteran Judge Lord Denning Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Lord Denning, one of the greatest
judges of his time, died Friday, six weeks after his 100th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
His former clerk, Peter Post, said he died "peacefully" in his
sleep at the Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester in the early
hours of Friday.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the people's judge," Lord Denning was regarded as one
of the most popular law-makers when he retired in 1982 after 38
years on the bench.
</P>
<P>
Post said, "The name Denning was a byword for the law itself.
His judgments were models of simple English which ordinary people
understood."
</P>
<P>
"He had huge intellect and reforming imagination in equal
measures, and in court, he never failed to be an object lesson in
judicial courtesy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair paid tribute to him and described him
as "one of the great men of his age."
</P>
<P>
"He was always the soul of courtesy, helping out young
barristers or someone with a hopeless case -- and sometime I was
both," Blair said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Dow Shoots 268 Points At Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
shot 268 points at a new record high Friday as investors believed
that the Federal Reserve would have no reason to raise interest
rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip index finished up 268.68 at 9,736.08, surpassing
the record closing high of 9,643.32 points on January 8 and
bringing the new year's gain to 6 percent. The index gained 191.52
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The index rallied stronger after the Labor Department reported
that the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.4 percent in
February and the number of payroll jobs increased by a
better-than-expected 275,000 last month.
</P>
<P>
The report convinced investors that the U.S. economy will
continue to expand without any inflationary threats and therefore
the Federal would have no reason to raise interest rates in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq index was up 44.22 at 2,337.11 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 28.83 at 1,275.47.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 12.39 at 603.14 and the American
Stock Exchange index rose 8.89 at 707.41. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies was up 3.99 at 398.01.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,080 up, 933 down and 556
unchanged. NYSE volume totaled 828.07 million shares vs. 708.79
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Milk Producers Predict Historic Price Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. milk producers will
experience a sharp price drop over the next month, the largest
change in one month in history, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department said the basic milk price received by producers
will drop from 16.27 dollars per hundred pounds of milk to 10.27
dollars. The largest month-to-month decline ever recorded was a
2.52 dollars dip.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming price decline is earlier than normal. Prices paid
to producers usually drop in the summer when it's hotter and milk
production declines.
</P>
<P>
Economists said it is good news for consumers who would see a
decline in the prices of milk, cheese, butter and other dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
Despite the size of the drop, the price will not reach the
lowest level dairy farmers have seen, the economists said. In
February 1991, for instance, prices were at 10.04 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Producers also have a cushion waiting for them. Congress
included 200 million dollars for dairy producers in last year's
emergency farm aid package. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is
still deciding how to distribute the money.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Brazil Conclude Loan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) announced Friday that the negotiations for the first review
of the stand-by loan with Brazil, approved by the IMF Executive
Board three months ago, ended between a Brazilian team and the IMF
staff.
</P>
<P>
Shailendra Anjaria, director of external relations of the IMF,
said that the documentation will be reviewed this weekend in
Brasilia and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that the management of the IMF will be in a
position on Monday to recommend to the Executive Board the
completion of the review, and that the memorandum of economic
policies will be made public shortly thereafter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The completion of a review means that the IMF board approves a
payment from a loan. The memorandum of policy will outline what
Brazil promises to do to win the money, including targets for
growth, inflation and budgetary policies.
</P>
<P>
The IMF put together an international rescue package amounting
to 41.5 billion U.S. dollars for Brazil last November and handed
over an initial payment of 5.3 billion dollars. It had expected to
pay a further 4.5 billion dollars by the end of February, but the
devaluation of the Brazilian currency meant the two sides had to
renegotiate conditions behind the loan.

<HEADLINE> Blair Resorts to Friendship With Clinton for Banana Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday promised to use his special relationship with U.S.
President Bill Clinton to avert an impending transatlantic trade
war.
</P>
<P>
Blair said in a radio interview Friday morning that he would do
all in his power to try to persuade the U.S. to lift the threat of
import tariffs against a number of European luxury ranging from
Scottish cashmere sweaters to pecorino cheese.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister expressed the belief that his
relationship with the American president could play a vital role
in solving the so-called "banana dispute."
</P>
<P>
"I get on very well with him... and I think the British-U.S.
relationship is a very important one. When things like this come
up it's important to have that relationship," Blair was quoted as
telling a radio program.
</P>
<P>
Blair also promised that the U.K. government will compensate
Scottish cashmere exporters hit by the U.S. decision to raise
tariffs on their goods from 6 percent to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move came as the European Union called for an urgent
meeting of the World Trade Organization to tackle the dispute. In
its filing to the trade body, the EU accused Washington of
"irresponsible unilateral action" and a "blatant disregard" of WTO
dispute procedures.
</P>
<P>
The proposed U.S. trade sanctions would cost EU producers up to
520 million dollars a year. But experts warn the dispute could
escalate with disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
Blair promised to make "a lot of calls in the next few days,"
and described a telephone conversation with Clinton Thursday as
"very constructive."
</P>
<P>
"We are also going to sort it out within the European Union as
well as with the U.S," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopes Lewinsky to Be Permitted to Go on Her Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that "the American people are virtually screaming at
us" to get on with their business and put the former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky sex scandal to rest.
</P>
<P>
The unrelenting question of the Lewinsky affair that led to
Clinton's impeachment came up at a joint press conference with
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, and the president answered
with yet another call for an end to it.
</P>
<P>
He declined comment on Lewinsky's two-hour television
interview, saying he hadn't seen it.
</P>
<P>
"What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on with her
life," Clinton said. "And I hope it will be a good life."
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that the American people are virtually
screaming at us to get on with their lives and their business and
to do their business," Clinton said. "And I'm going to do my best
to do that as well as I possibly can."
</P>
<P>
On February 12, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial
against Clinton and declared acquittal of the president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 17, was
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Lauds Decision to Set up Brcko District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday voiced his strong support to a decision to set up
a neutral district in the Bosnian town of Brcko and put it under
the international supervision.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through a spokesman here, Annan said he
"strongly endorses the Brcko Arbitration Tribunal's decision to
create the Brcko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be held in
condominium by both entities."
</P>
<P>
"For Brcko, no less than for Bosnia itself, there is no
alternative to democratic, multi-ethnic government, and the
Secretary-General is therefore particularly pleased that this
vital principle has been upheld by the award," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The award provides unique opportunity for the three
communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to work together to promote
economic prosperity, establish the rule of law and demonstrate
their commitment to a tolerant and open society," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It referred to a decision on the future of the strategic been
river port that had been claimed both by Bosnia's Moslem-Croat
federation and by the Bosnian Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
The town, astride a narrow corridor linking the eastern and
western parts of the Serb-controlled territory in northern Bosnia,
was seized by Bosnian Serbs early in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General strongly urges the leadership in both
entities to serve the interests of all Brcko residents, regardless
of their ethnicity, by complying fully with the arbitration
award," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Hezergovina, and its
International Police Task Force, will continue to assist the
parties and the supervising authority in Brcko to ensure a smooth
transition to a unified, multi-ethnic police and judicial system
in the newly established Brcko District," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover How Mammals Figure Out Smells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from U.S. and Japan
said that they have discovered the secrets of how mammals
distinguish among smells, the Associated Press said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mammals can distinguish among many thousands of odors with
their 1000 smell sensors. This is a mystery that has long
perplexed experts.
</P>
<P>
A new study of mice, performed by Dr. Linda B. Buck of the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Harvard Medical School and her
colleagues from Japan, found that instead of dedicating a single
sensor to a single odor, mammals use their sensors in combination.
The same sensors are triggered again and again in different
combinations, and each combination spells out a unique odor.
</P>
<P>
The sensors also called olfactory receptors line the wall of
the nasal cavity.
</P>
<P>
Linda said that each receptor is used over and over again to
define an odor, just like letters are used over and over again
to define different words.

WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that he hopes former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky will be "permitted to go on with her life."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, asked about Lewinsky at a news conference with Italian
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, said he did not see the nationally
televised interview with Lewinsky. He declined to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
"What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on with her

efforts that I have made and I continue to make every day at home
and at work will bear fruit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that "the American people are virtually

</P>
<P>
"And I'm going to do my best to do that as well as I possibly
can, but, you know, it's been a pretty tough thing for everybody
involved and I wish her well, I hope it works out well for her,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was also asked how he felt about Lewinsky earning
money from the affair, added: "It's been a pretty tough thing for
everybody involved, and I wish her well. I hope it works out well
for her."
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky Wednesday stepped into the limelight that has mostly
swirled around her for the last year with the airing of a
long-awaited television interview and the publication of a bitter
biography that lashes out at Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,
her own lawyer and even the president she loved.
</P>

On February 12, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial

<HEADLINE> Hope Seen for EU to Find Budget Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The 15 European Union (EU) member
countries may start to have some hope to solve budget problem
since French Farm Minister Jean Glavany told reporters here on
Friday that EU president Germany has given up a demand for member
states to share part of the bloc's agriculture budget.
</P>
<P>
The French minister was briefing journalists after negotiations
no EU budget policy reform adjourned until next Tuesday. He said
he had received assurance from his German counterpart Karl-Heinz
Funke.
</P>
<P>
The German proposed option for EU budget co-financing has
caused concerns by France, which Lionel Jospin, the French prime
minister, dismissed it as "an ineffective, legally dubious and
non-community solution".
</P>
<P>
However, French President Jacques Chirac early this week
welcomed the fact that agriculture ministers have been sent a firm
signal to refocus negotiations when they meet again on Thursday
after their marathon talks were suspended on February 26. Chirac
insisted there is no Franco-German divide, rather a general
problem of adjustment of national positions.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe Germany, faced with economic stagnation,
has reined in its financial demands to progressive reversal of its
net contribution curb. This concession means the current EU
president will not seek to hit the jackpot but will simply
insist that in the longer term its net contribution should move
not up but downwards. Therefore, some hope is emerging for the EU
Berlin Summit meeting on March 24-25 to reach a final solution.
</P>
<P>
EU commissioner for trade affairs Leon Brittan said last
weekend in Warsaw that the bloc's future enlargement will be
difficult if there is no progress on the budget reform, known as
Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, European Commission President Jacques Santer in
Paris early this week also stressed the importance of finalizing
Agenda 2000 now, since failure to do so would send a poor signal
to the outside world and in particular those central and eastern
European countries lining up to join the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Central Bank Can Support Ruble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov said here Friday that the Central Bank has sufficient
resources to support the ruble and make foreign debt payments.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov, who had just returned to Moscow from the Black Sea
resort of Sochi after a meeting there with Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, said the Central Bank could prevent a sharp drop of the
national currency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank had
coordinated their stances on foreign debt payments, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
"It was decided that the Central Bank would continue making
foreign debt payments," Zadornov said.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of the year, Russia is due to make 4.6
billion U.S. dollars in foreign payments, 3.7 billion dollars of
which is Russia's debt to the IMF, on Eurobonds and MinFin bonds
which cannot be restructured.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government hopes to reach agreement with the IMF on
refinancing its debt to the Fund.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Primakov called IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus and the two had "a very lengthy, detailed and
constructive conversation," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia's current foreign reserves, at 11.5 billion dollars,
remain a far cry from the pre-crisis 20 billion dollars, although
the figure went up somewhat recently.
