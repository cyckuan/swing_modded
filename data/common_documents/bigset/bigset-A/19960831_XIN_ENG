<HEADLINE> Industrial Action to Increase Sharply in UK: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Industrial action in Britain will
increase sharply over the next six months as employees become more
willing to "take a stand" against growing pay inequality and
insecurity at work, a latest survey of unions forecasts today.
</P>
<P>
Trade Union Trends, a six-month survey of unions conducted by
the Labor Research Department of the Trade Union Congress, shows
that the proportion of unions taking action has doubled over the
past six months to 62 percent, with almost two thirds of the
unions surveyed expecting a further increase in action over the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 73 trade unions, representing 7 million
employees, reveals that four out of five ballots on industrial
action achieved a "yes" vote in the last six months, up from two
thirds for the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that most unions used ballots as a bargaining
lever, with two out of three reaching agreement without taking
action. And when action was taken, it usually lasted just one or
two days.
</P>
<P>
Pay is the main cause of industrial action, accounting for 33
percent of disputes, followed by enforced changes to working
practices or time, accounting for 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey comes against the background of a series of strikes
and strike threats in the Post Office, on the railways, on the
London Underground and by British Airways pilots this summer.

''The higher authority is delighted that whatever obstacles
appeared to impede against progress have been amicable resolved
to the satisfaction of both parties,'' the two governments said

Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The higher authority comprised top government and railways
officials from Zimbabwe and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt Adamant Against Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government today
remained adamant that it would not rescind its decision to dismiss
the bulk of its 161,000 civil servants who are striking for better
pay, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro said today that following lengthy discussion with
Unified Civil Service Negotiating Committee, one of the
conclusions was: ''it be made clear to the committee that the
government maintains its position regarding the dismissals.''
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said this in a statement although the government
promised to raise the salaries of the civil workers.
</P>
<P>
The minister would however, present to cabinet the committee's
request to have the dismissed workers reinstated as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which had given
the government a 72-hour ultimatum until Friday to resolve the
dispute with striking civil servants after which it would call for a
nationwide general strike, said it would hold a meeting on Saturday
to decide on the next move.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Maria Barroso Fund, named
after the former first lady of Portugal, will grant 230 tons of
stationery to Angola's children in September.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in Stockholm today by Barroso who is in the
Swedish capital to attend an international conference on
children, according to Angola's national news agency (ANNA).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ANNA, the former Portuguese first lady
said she would materialize the grant, which is aimed at enhancing
the educational facilities in the war-torn southern African
country, during her visit to Luanda next month.
</P>
<P>
Barroso, who had visited Angola early this year in company
with Portuguese President Mario Soares, said she knew well about
the miseries that the war had brought to the Angolan children.
</P>
<P>
Civil war broke out in 1975 after Portugal left its former
colony of Angola and it lasted until 1994 when the government and
the rebel UNITA movement signed a peace pact.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Japan on Issue of Diaoyu Islands (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China has warned Japan not to do
anything foolish over the Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea, an
editorial in today's People's Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The Diaoyu islands, like Taiwan, are an inalienable part of
China, as they have belonged to China since ancient times, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, Japan has carried out a series of
provocative actions over this part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, the right-wing Japanese Youth Foundation built a
lighthouse on the Diaoyu islands.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government announced an exclusive economic zone of
200 nautical miles on July 20, which took in the Chinese islands.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda then openly claimed
that the Diaoyu islands belonged to Japan and said that there was
no need to justify its claim.
</P>
<P>
On August 18, a right-wing group from Japan's southern Okinawa
prefecture put up a board on one of the islands with a drawing of
the Japanese flag on it. The Diaoyu islands are situated between
Taiwan and southern Japan.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has ordered the military to prepare for any contingency
and that the Japanese authorities concerned even went so far as to
threaten to resort to force if necessary, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that all the above acts show that
Japan considers the Diaoyu islands its own territory.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will not stand for such actions which
violate China's territorial integrity, the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu islands is
indisputable. Evidence dating back as early as the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644), when Chinese fishermen conducted activities in this
area, prove the islands are part of China.
</P>
<P>
Japan seized Taiwan and its surrounding islands, including the
Diaoyu islands, during the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895. In
April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to sign
the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and ceded the islands to Japan, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
After World War Two, a defeated Japan returned Taiwan to China,
but handed the Diaoyu islands over to the United States. In 1971,
the U.S. government illegally returned the Diaoyu islands to
Japan, an action the Chinese government strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
When Japan and China normalized relations in 1972 and signed
the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978, the two
countries, considering overall relations, agreed to leave the
issue of the Diaoyu islands to be settled in the future, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese side broke its promise and behaved in an
underhand way over the Diaoyu islands issue many times. Japan has
intensified its efforts to create instability and stir up trouble.
</P>
<P>
Japan tried to strengthen the symbolic significance of its
occupation of the Diaoyu islands by playing the shameless card of
"if I have occupied then it's mine."

<HEADLINE> China Warns Japan on Issue of Diaoyu Islands (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial said that it is well known that in relations
between countries, the issue of ownership of territory is the most
sensitive one.
</P>
<P>
Japan has raised this sensitive issue many times recently. We
cannot help asking what Japan's real intentions are, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
Japan evidently wants to take advantage of the changes in the
political situation in east Asia since the end of the Cold War to
show off its power to the outside world and to test China's
determination to safeguard its territory and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
China has always considered the situation as a whole and
cherishes the friendly relations between China and Japan, but it
will never waver on the issue of territory.
</P>
<P>
China's stand on the Diaoyu islands is to put aside the dispute
and jointly exploit the region on the precondition that China has
sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During a period of more than one hundred years, the Chinese
people have never kow-towed to foreign powers. They won back the
independence and sovereignty of the country with the blood and
lives of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
Today, if anybody thinks China's 1.2 billion people will
surrender even one inch of soil, they are indulging in fantasy; if
anybody holds the illusion that the Chinese people will yield to
foreign forces, they are day dreaming; if anybody wants to cause
trouble over the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, they are making a grave miscalculation, the editorial
warned.
</P>
<P>
We can say with certainty that on the issue of a country's
territory and sovereignty, the Chinese people are as one.
</P>
<P>
No Chinese will surrender the country's territory and
sovereignty to anyone. If anybody dares do so, he will be cursed
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Japan's provocation of China over the Diaoyu islands is not
accidental but is an inevitable result of emerging rightist
elements in Japan's internal political situation and Japan's
intention to flex its muscle.
</P>
<P>
Below are just a few of the numerous illustrations of this
tendency.
</P>
<P>
In recent years many Japanese have distorted the country's
history of aggression, glorified its war of aggression and imbued
its countrymen with a sense of militarism.
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese politicians are exaggerating the so-called "China
threat", tried their best to sow dissent between China and its
neighboring countries, inventing an excuse for the expansion of
its forces.
</P>
<P>
They have strengthened the Japan-U.S. security system, expanded
its scope of protecting the country and even talked about "paying
attention to the trends of the Chinese military."
</P>
<P>
Japan has continually increased its military expenditure,
engaged in arms proliferation and tried its best to send its
soldiers abroad, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries have long expressed their concerns that Japan
would embark on its old road of militarism. These fears are not
groundless.
</P>
<P>
The series of activities recently conducted by Japan seems to
turn these fears into reality.
</P>
<P>
The editorial concluded that it appears as if some political
figures in Japan have lost their heads.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries should try to calm them down and persuade them
not to do anything foolish. At the same time, Asia must maintain
its vigilance over Japan's actions.

<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Irish police seized 40 kg of
cannabis in a successful operation at Dublin airport this
afternoon and another 60 kg of cannabis was discovered in a field
in the southern part of the country on the same day, according to
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The two hauls of drugs had a total street value of about 1
million Irish pounds (1.62 million U.S. dollars), Irish police
sources told reporters.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the drugs were destined for sale in Ireland,
which is now facing a growing problem of drug abuse and drug
trafficking, rather than in transit for some other destination.
</P>
<P>
The drugs seized at Dublin airport had arrived on a flight from
Spain and were tracked in a joint police action with Spanish
police and Customs forces, they added.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, with miles of remote coastline, has become a hub for
the international drugs trade and it has also been used as a
trans-shipment point for the import of drugs into Europe.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sends Rescuers to Plane Crash Site in Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia today sent a group of 13
rescuers to the remote Arctic island of Spitzbergen, Norway, where
a Russian airliner crashed Thursday, killing all 141 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said the group, armed with special
equipment, will search for victims as soon as it arrives.
</P>
<P>
The airliner, which was taking Russian and Ukrainian coal
miners to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden in
Norway, smashed into a snow-capped mountain as it came in to land
at the island's airport.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian experts and officials of the
Commonwealth of Independent States Aviation Committee flew to
Spitzbergen to help Norwegian investigators discover why the plane
crashed.
</P>
<P>
The island, which has about 3,000 inhabitants, lies some 500
miles (800 kilometers) off the northern tip of Norway and suffers
one of the most extreme climates in the world.
</P>
<P>
It sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged
into round-the-clock darkness in winter months.
</P>
<P>
Norway has ruled the island under the terms of a 1920s
international treaty which gave many other nations the right to
establish settlements and exploit coal.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Allows Serbs to Get Back Ammunition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia has ordered the Bosnian Serb
military to move their illicitly-stored ammunition to authorized
sites, an IFOR spokesman said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
IFOR has discovered 17 unauthorized military facilities with a
total of 3,000 tons of ammunition within the territory of the
self-styled Republika Srpska, and blown up one of them at
Margetic, south of Bihac, containing 300 tons of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Captain Mark Vandyke, spokesman for IFOR, said the Serbs would
be allowed to reclaim the ammunition in the remaining 16 sites
because they had voluntarily informed IFOR of the sites after the
discovery of the Margetic depot.
</P>
<P>
Although Bosnian Serbs had reported those military facilities
late and by doing so violated the Dayton agreement, it "justifies
a different way of enforcing compliance," Vandyke said.
</P>
<P>
Besides blowing up the ammunition found in Margetic, IFOR has
in the past month also banned helicopter flights by Bosnian Muslim
forces for violating IFOR flying rules, and destroyed 1,200
weapons confiscated from all three ethnic factions.
</P>
<P>
These actions should "leave no doubt that we will not tolerate
violations of the military annex of the Dayton peace agreement,"
Vandyke said.

BERLIN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- German experts Thursday
successfully defused an old World War Two bomb dropped by the
Allies in Oranienburg near Berlin, the press reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 residents were evacuated to safe area before
the bomb, weighing 250 kilograms and buried 6.5 meters in the
ground, was defused by remote control.
</P>
<P>
Oranienburg, an important arsenal location in Nazi Germany, was
the main target of bombing by the Allies during the war.
</P>
<P>
A number of unexploded bombs have been found and defused in the
area. However, the exact number of unexploded bombs still buried
in the city is not known.
</P>
<P>
It usually costs between 150,000 and 250,000 German marks
(100,000 - 170,000 U.S. dollars) to find and defuse such a bomb.

<HEADLINE> France Condemns Serbs Over Storming IPTF Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned the Bosnian
Serbs for besieging a U.N. International Police Task Force (IPTF)
station in a Serb-controlled town on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn such incidents and appeal to the parties (involved)
to respect their obligations. The Peace Implementation Force
(IFOR) and the International Police (IPTF) have once again
appropriately fulfilled their mission," French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 Serbs stormed the IPTF station in Zvornik, some
40 kilometers southeast of Tuzla, taking six U.N. police officers
hostage for six hours and destroying several vehicles parked
outside.
</P>
<P>
Serb police looked on passively and allegedly roughed up some
U.N. officers.
</P>
<P>
The event was apparently in retaliation for NATO peacekeeping
forces' detention of 45 Serb policemen earlier in the day for
bringing weapons into the demilitarized zone. They were trying to
evict a group of Muslim returnees who were rebuilding their homes
in the village of Mahala near Zvornik on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the United Nations also condemned the Serbs over
the incident.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Up Moderately In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer spending edged
up 0.2 percent in July while incomes grew at their slowest pace
for seven months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said personal spending totaled 5.15 trillion
dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in July, up from 5.14
trillion in June.
</P>
<P>
The report also revised June's fall in spending down to 0.4
percent, steeper than the initial estimate of 0.2 percent. The
decline was the first since last January when blizzards kept many
shoppers at home.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity. The government reported Thursday that consumer spending
increased at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
helping to boost overall economic growth to a strong 4.8 percent
annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe U.S. consumers, many overburdened with debt,
are winding up a spending spree that lasted through much of the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. department also reported that personal incomes went up
0.1 percent in July to 6.47 trillion dollars at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, from 6.46 trillion a month earlier.

It was the smallest gain since January when incomes were
unchanged from the previous month. Personal incomes had jumped 0.9
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- also rose 0.1
percent after a 0.8 percent gain a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The combination of income and spending meant that Americans'
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income --

<P>
Private-sector wages and salaries, the most closely watched
component of income, fell 6.9 billion dollars at an annual rate to
3 trillion dollars after advancing 45 billion dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for
inflation. When adjusted, disposable income fell 0.1 percent and
the spending was unchanged.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Exports Expected to Decline in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports are forecast
to decline in the second half of the year for the first time this
decade, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
That's likely to aggravate the country's already worsening
trade deficit. The government estimates the trade deficit for the
year is likely to be 19 billion U.S. dollars, nearly double last
year's 10.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first six months of the year rose 11.8 percent
to 65.1 billion dollars over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But exports fell 3.6 percent in July and are projected to fall
by another 1 percent between August and December.
</P>
<P>
The worst fall exports on record was registered in the three
months ending January 1992, and during the first quarter of 1990
and the fourth quarter of 1994. But the fall has never continued
for a six-month period as is expected for the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
MITI attributes the continuing downward spiral to falling
prices for South Korea's major export goods including
semiconductors, while the import prices for raw materials
including crude oil, grain and consumer goods are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The relatively high valuation of Korean currency in comparison
with that of South Korea's major trading partners, the Japanese
yen for example, has also been blamed for slowing exports, since
it makes major South Korean exports less competitive on the world
market.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Announce Total Pullout from Chechen Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops had completely
pulled out of the Chechen capital Grozny and the breakaway
republic's mountainous areas by noon today, Russia's troop command
said today.
</P>
<P>
The troops are now deployed near Khankala, where the command is
based, waiting for orders.
</P>
<P>
The command also claimed that the Chechen separatists failed to
follow last week's cease-fire agreement since 1,200 to 1,500 rebel
soldiers still remained in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Under the military deal signed last week by Russian peacemaker
Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel chief-in-staff Aslan Maskhadov,
Russian troops and rebels were due to leave Grozny by September 1,
surrendering it to the care of joint patrol groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chechen separatists complained that federal
troops intentionally delayed their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
They said that the troops halted the pullout from two districts
of Grozny this afternoon, which hindered the rebels' plan to
complete the withdrawal of their soldiers today.
</P>
<P>
Further talks between Lebed and Maskhadov were held today to
clear the way for a long-term settlement of the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
The war in Chechnya between Russian forces and Chechen
separatists has been going on since December 1994, when Russian
President Boris Yeltsin sent in troops to crush the breakaway
republic's bid for independence.
</P>
<P>
Last week's cease-fire ended the worst fighting in the Chechen
capital Grozny since the war began.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Defense Agency Seeks Maximum Spending Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Defense Agency today
requested 4.99 trillion yen (49.9 billion U.S. dollars) for its
defense budget in fiscal 1997, a 2.88 percent increase on this
year's budget and the biggest rise for the last five years, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
The 2.88 percent rise was set in late July by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet as a ceiling on the fiscal 1997
defense budget.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling on the current fiscal 1996 defense budget was 2.9
percent. The budget actually rose 2.58 percent to 4.85 trillion
yen (48.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The agency is seeking a 15.1 percent increase in front-line
procurement spending to 961 billion yen (9.61 billion dollars),
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Defense authorities plan to sign 827 billion yen (8.27 billion
dollars) of fresh contracts to procure front-line equipment such
as tanks, fighters and warships, a 2.7 percent rise over contracts
in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
The planned purchases include 11 155-mm howitzers, nine
multiple launch rocket system units, 20 type 90 tanks for the
Ground Self-Defense Force, two destroyers costing some 133.2
billion yen (1.33 billion dollars), a submarine, a minesweeper for
the Maritime Self-Defense Force, nine F-2 fighters costing 114.8
billion yen (1.148 billion dollars) and 13 trainers for the Air
Self-Defense Force, according to the news service.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Head Team for Negotiations with PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government approved
today that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would head a team
responsible for negotiations with the Palestinians, which are to
resume next week.
</P>
<P>
At today's weekly session, the cabinet approved the decision
with a vote of 15 against 2. National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon and Science and Technology Minister Benny Begin voted
against the plan.
</P>
<P>
A statement released after the meeting said that Netanyahu,
together with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign
Minister David Levy, would lead the negotiations with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on various issues, including
Israeli troops' redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The long-projected but repeatedly-delayed Hebron pullback is
one of the major dispute between Israel and the PNA. Under the
Oslo accords, Israel should have pulled out troops from the
volatile town by last March, but the former Labor government
froze the process after a series of anti-Israeli bombings killed
58 people from late February to early March.
</P>
<P>
Israeli new hardline government has demanded revision of the
pullback plan, which is expected to be high on the agenda
of next week's first meeting of the Israeli-Palestinian steering
committee. This will end the six-month long freeze on the
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister will appoint a negotiating team that
will negotiate with the Palestinian (National) Authority on the
implementation of internal agreements. Among the issues discussed
is the issue of Hebron," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiating team will be directed by the prime minister,
together with the ministers of defense and foreign affairs. The
conclusion of the negotiating team will be bound to approval of
the government," it added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the criticism of his way of handling with
the Palestinians, Netanyahu argued that his government has
changed the direction of diplomatic negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The current government is leading a new path. It stands
by its demand for reciprocity and fulfilling commitments,"
Netanyahu said. He stressed he would reverse the "disarray"
prevailing in the former government, which did not insist on
PNA's fighting terrorism until the terrorist attacks in February
and March.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Hebron issue, there are other more thorny
disputes for the Israeli and Palestinian teams to deal with,
including the status of Jerusalem and expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel's policy of expanding the settlements and cracking down
PNA's activities in East Jerusalem have created a crisis
recently, as PNA President Yasser Arafat called on Palestinians
for a general strike Thursday and a massive prayer today.

<HEADLINE> Cows Enter Paris to Protest "Mad Cow" Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 cattle farmers and
their sympathizers led a herd of cows to Paris' Eiffel Tower this
morning to protest against the collapse in the French beef market
caused by the "mad cow" crisis.
</P>
<P>
Five of the cattle breeders, who made a marathon 350-kilometer
march to the capital, were granted a meeting with President
Jacques Chirac who promised to help save their livelihoods which
have been devastated by the British health scare over beef.
</P>
<P>
The cows and their breeders took three weeks to make the
350-kilometer journey from the cattle production center of
Charroux in central France.
</P>
<P>
The farmers were protesting that cheap beef imports from
outside the European Union, especially from eastern Europe, have
helped force prices down by a third in recent months after the
"mad cow" crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac expressed his solidarity with the cattle
breeders who say they have suffered enormous losses.
</P>
<P>
"France will not be great and strong unless it has a powerful
and good agriculture on all its territory," Chirac wrote in a
message to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will be done to give confidence to our farmers, to
our cattle breeders and especially to the young people who need to
 establish themselves." the president said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chirac gave no specific pledges to the farmers to help
them overcome the effects of the "mad cow" scare which erupted
after the British government admitted in March there could be a
link between a fatal brain disease affecting cattle and a similar
disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
A police motor escort travelled ahead of the demonstrators to
make way for them as they made their way through the Paris morning
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators held posters like "The march against death"
and others carried a wooden coffin symbolizing the "death of the
cattle industry."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of farmers blockaded roads across the
country on Thursday to carry out spot checks on trucks carrying
imported cows and beef. In Moulins, central France, cattle farmers
stopped 200 cargo trucks.
</P>
<P>
The national trade unions of cattle farmers are calling for a
suspension of imports of cows and beef from non-EU
countries. Agricultural Minister Philippe Vasseur has asked the EU
to take steps to protect the EU market which has already been
savaged by the "mad cow" crisis.

PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- France's trade surplus edged up to
53.283 billion francs (10.66 billion U.S. dollars) in the second
quarter of 1996 from 52.904 billion francs (10.6 billion
U.S. dollars) in the same period last year.

However, the June surplus fell to 9.749 billion francs (1.95

U.S. dollars) in May, French Customs said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both imports and exports dropped slightly in June
over the previous month, although 11 Airbus aircraft, one of
France's pillar exports, were sold in June against four sold in
May.

<HEADLINE> French Unemployment Drops Slightly in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed in France
fell by 20,000 in July after a two-month consecutive rise in May
and June, the Ministry of Labor said today.
</P>
<P>
But the unemployment rate remained at 12.5 percent in line with
the stricter calculations of the International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
The French government said the 0.7 percent drop in the number
of jobless to 3,045,000 was due to the entry by many people into
professional training programs and summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
But under an old unemployment calculation method, which
considers workers working for less than 78 hours a month as
jobless, France's unemployment rate rose by 0.5 percent in July,
adding 15,700 people to the ranks of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The new unemployment calculation method showed the drop was
largely a result of a 1.2 percent rise in the employment rate
among people under the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
The number of people in this group entering professional
training programs in July grew by 20.4 percent, as compared with
the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Radio Damascus Lashes Out Israeli Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Radio Damascus today lashed out
the hardline Israeli policies, especially regarding the expansion
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The policies, which harm Arab interests, tear down the last
masks the Israeli government used to put on, the radio pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The incumbent Israeli government persists in undermining the
Middle East peace process, thus preparing for war," the radio said
in its political commentary.
</P>
<P>
Israeli would not, in the final analysis, be able to confront
a unified Arab position or usurp the Arab rights, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the necessity of strengthening the unified Arab
position in line with the results of the pan-Arab summit
held in Cairo in June.
</P>
<P>
The radio highlighted the importance of maintaining continuous
contacts with world leaders to expose the Israeli schemes in order
to politically besiege Israel.
</P>
<P>
The international community is aware of the dangers of the
Israeli policies, the radio said, citing the increasing worldwide
criticisms of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The radio called for more pressures on Israel to prevent it
from undermining the international efforts aimed at ensuring the
success of the peace process and establishing a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Falls To 18 Percent in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in the
country based on national consumer price index
fell from 22.7 percent to 18.2 percent in July
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Monthly Economic Review by
the Bank of Tanzania (BOT), which was made available today,
the inflation rate has not only fallen in comparison to last
June's figures, but also in comparison to inflation rate in June
last year which was 27.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report issued on Thursday by the BOT, said that the drop
in inflation rate was attributed to a decline of 4.5 percent
of the food index in the period of June to July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The BOT economic review said that the month to month changes
registered a decline of 2.2 percent between June and July 1996 as
compared to a change of 1.3 percent registered between May and
June this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the rate of inflation had been falling
over the last five months partly because of seasonal factors
associated with crop harvesting and also because of the impact of
tight monetary policy and fiscal measures taken to stabilize
prices.

<P>
BONN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel has reiterated that the German government has always
followed a "one China" policy and will stick to it, the business
daily Handelsblatt quoted him as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The federal government does not recognize the self-claimed
"Tibetan government-in-exile" or have any contact with it, Kinkel
said in an interview with Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government had always supported
the unification of the German nation.
</P>
<P>
Stating that Germany wants to develop good relations in all
fields with China, the minister highlighted the importance of
economic relations which, he said, had bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Germany has become China's biggest European
business partner. The volume of bilateral trade has risen to 26.5
billion German marks (18 billion U.S. dollars) from 2.5 billion
German marks (1.7 billion dollars) in 1980, and accounts for more
than one third of trade volume between Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which has already invested 1.8 billion German marks
(1.2 billion dollars) in China and has contracted investment
totaling 4.4 billion German marks (3 billion dollars), will
increase its investment in the future, said Kinkel.

GENEVA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Between 220,000 and 245,000
refugees and displaced persons have so far returned home in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) estimated today.

But most of those returning home went to "majority areas" --
places where returnees are part of the ethnic majority. Few have
returned to "minority areas," UNHCR spokesperson Ron Redmond said.

The figures are based on "best guesstimates" of return
movements to Bihac, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Banja Luka, Sarajevo
and Gorazde, the areas under the agency's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The arrivals have either remained or moved on to other places,

<HEADLINE> Ex-President Chun to Appeal Against Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan, who was condemned to death earlier this week for his
part in a 1979 military coup, finally decided today to appeal
against his sentence.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yang-woo, Chun's defense attorney, said that his client has
decided to appeal on the advice of his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"It is more advantageous for Chun to appeal than not to," Lee
told reporters after he met Chun at Anyang Prison just south of
Seoul early today.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, the Seoul District Court sentenced Chun to death
and another former president, Roh Tae-woo, to 22 and a half years
in prison on charges of mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
It also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million
dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly accumulated while
in office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sentences ranging from four to 10 years were given
to 13 former South Korean officers who helped the two
ex-presidents in their quest for power.
</P>
<P>
Chun is expected to present his appeal to the Appellate Court
this weekend or early next month.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, Roh is also planning to file an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Other defendants who received prison sentences from the Seoul
District Court relating to the same charges of treason, mutiny or
corruption, have already decided to appeal to the Appellate Court.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from the roles played by
the two former presidents and their cronies in the military coup
on December 12, 1979 and the killing of civilians in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was succeeded by his friend, Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993 after a presidential election which saw his
fellow-party member Kim Young-sam come to power.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Promote Angolan Peace Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC), citing the slow progress of the
Angolan peace process, said today that it wants to assume more
control over the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The community's executive secretary, Kaire Mbuende, who is in
Windhoek for a visit, said the two-month-old SADC Organ on
Politics, Defense and Security will meet soon in Angolan capital
of Luanda, the Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
SADC's new chairman, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa,
will soon consult President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC organ may be more effective than the United
Nations initiative to end the Angolan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and the main opposition UNITA movement
signed a peace accord in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years after the accord, a government of national
unity is far from being formed.
</P>
<P>
A UNITA congress this week rejected the position of vice
president in a government of national unity offered to its leader
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The two Angolan leaders are scheduled to hold their fourth
meeting since the signing of the peace accord during the first
two weeks of next month.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Japan on Issue of Diaoyu Islands (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial said that it is well known that in relations
between countries, the issue of ownership of territory is the most
sensitive one.
</P>
<P>
Japan has raised this sensitive issue many times recently. We
cannot help asking what Japan's real intentions are, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
Japan evidently wants to take advantage of the changes in the
political situation in east Asia since the end of the Cold War to
show off its power to the outside world and to test China's
determination to safeguard its territory and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
China has always considered the situation as a whole and
cherishes the friendly relations between China and Japan, but it
will never waver on the issue of territory.
</P>
<P>
China's stand on the Diaoyu islands is to put aside the dispute
and jointly exploit the region on the precondition that China has
sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During a period of more than one hundred years, the Chinese
people have never kow-towed to foreign powers. They won back the
independence and sovereignty of the country with the blood and
lives of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
Today, if anybody thinks China's 1.2 billion people will
surrender even one inch of soil, they are indulging in fantasy; if
anybody holds the illusion that the Chinese people will yield to
foreign forces, they are day dreaming; if anybody wants to cause
trouble over the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, they are making a grave miscalculation, the editorial
warned.
</P>
<P>
We can say with certainty that on the issue of a country's
territory and sovereignty, the Chinese people are as one.
</P>
<P>
No Chinese will surrender the country's territory and
sovereignty to anyone. If anybody dares do so, he will be cursed
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Japan's provocation of China over the Diaoyu islands is not
accidental but is an inevitable result of emerging rightist
elements in Japan's internal political situation and Japan's
intention to flex its muscle.
</P>
<P>
Below are just a few of the numerous illustrations of this
tendency.
</P>
<P>
In recent years many Japanese have distorted the country's
history of aggression, glorified its war of aggression and imbued
its countrymen with a sense of militarism.
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese politicians are exaggerating the so-called "China
threat", tried their best to sow dissent between China and its
neighboring countries, inventing an excuse for the expansion of
its forces.
</P>
<P>
They have strengthened the Japan-U.S. security system, expanded
its scope of protecting the country and even talked about "paying
attention to the trends of the Chinese military."
</P>
<P>
Japan has continually increased its military expenditure,
engaged in arms proliferation and tried its best to send its
soldiers abroad, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries have long expressed their concerns that Japan
would embark on its old road of militarism. These fears are not
groundless.
</P>
<P>
The series of activities recently conducted by Japan seems to
turn these fears into reality.
</P>
<P>
The editorial concluded that it appears as if some political
figures in Japan have lost their heads.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries should try to calm them down and persuade them
not to do anything foolish. At the same time, Asia must maintain
its vigilance over Japan's actions.

</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba met here today with foremer Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
No detail about the meeting has been revealed, but observers
here said it was possible that the two sides discussed the
amended constitution.
</P>
<P>
Vice- President Godfrey Miyanda and Kaunda's senior aides
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also met here today with a delegation of the
opposition Zambia Democratic Congress.
</P>
<P>
More meetings have been planned between Chiluba and other
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba announced last Sunday that he will meet Kaunda and
other opposition leaders to seek ways of breaking the impasse
arising from the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution Amendment Bill, which was signed into
law by Chiluba last May, Kaunda cannot contest the presidency in
the elections to be held late this year because his parents are
foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP) led by Kaunda and other opposition parties are strongly
opposed to the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda ruled the country after its independence in 1964 until
he was defeated by Chiluba in the first multi-party elections in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Friday Prayer Passes Quietly in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Friday Moslem Prayer
passed quietly today in east Jerusalem, as thousands of Israeli
police and troops kept a day of vigilant watch.
</P>
<P>
Only about 15,000 to 20,000 Moslem worshipers attended the
prayer at the Al Aqsa Mosque in the Old City, much lower than the
usual number of 20,000 to 30,000, Jerusalem Police said.
</P>
<P>
This is partly because the Israeli security forces have turned
away many worshipers from the Palestinian self-rule areas of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are still under tight Israeli
closure.
</P>
<P>
After Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat called Wednesday for a massive prayer to protest Israel's
settlement and Jerusalem policies, Israeli border police have
tightened the blockade.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's prayer call served as a strong warning in protest
against Israel's hardline policies adopted by the new government
taking office in June. Israel has resumed the construction of
Jewish settlements in Palestinian self-rule areas, insisted on a
united Jerusalem as its capital, and refused to open talks on the
Palestinian demand for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police today closed roads entering Jerusalem's Old City
and soldiers set up dozens of new roadblocks on the city's
outskirts to keep Palestinians from entering.
</P>
<P>
Reports said many Palestinians holding legal permits were even
denied entry to Jerusalem in order to prevent possible unrest.
</P>
<P>
Keeping high vigilance, more than 2,000 armed police and troops
were stationed in the Old City area. Dozens of policemen on
horseback were also deployed at noon outside the Damascus Gate,
the hotbed for Arab violence, to reinforce an already heavy
security force presence there.
</P>
<P>
The day passed quietly. The Old City remained open to tourists,
with most shops and stalls opened as usual to business, selling
fruits, drinks, clothes to a few brave tourists and a large number
of journalists.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the noon, huge crowd of Arab worshipers, franked
by armed Israeli policemen and soldiers, streamed out through the
gate in an orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
However, a sense of despair and dissent toward Israel's
hard-fisted policies was obvious among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Jews are no good. They prevent us from praying for God," a
young Palestinian among a group told Xinhua, pointing at the
Israeli soldiers standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials defended Arafat's call as sending out a
message to the world. "It's a message from us to the Israelis and
all over the world to say that ... we cannot speak abut peace and
security without Jerusalem," said PNA Minister Imat Faluji.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, PNA representative in east Jerusalem, blasted
Israel for refusing entry of many other Palestinian
worshipers. "It seems to me that Israel intends to open the
subject of Jerusalem through ... police forces, instead of opening
it on the tables of negotiating," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Police chief Arye Amit denied reports that some
prayers holding legal permits were refused entry at the border
crossings. He attributed the lower turnout of Arab prayers to the
reasoning on the part of the PNA, which he said has taken measures
to avoid violent clashes with Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
The police head also warned that Israeli security forces would
crash any violence. "We are ready for everything, for any event
and any clash. And hopefully, this has not happened," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tense Situation in Serb Mahala Village Calms Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The tense situation in the Serb
village of Mahala in eastern Bosnia began to calm down today after
an incident Thursday that sparked the worst violence since the
Dayton agreement was signed last December.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted Bosnian Serb Interior Minister Dragan
Kijac as saying that an incident had been avoided, the Serb police
were released and international policemen were unblockaded.
</P>
<P>
Kijac added an agreement has been reached between Serb
authorities and peace Implementation Force (IFOR) ground troop
commander General Michael Walker.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the IFOR should return to its initial
positions in the region of Mahala and the forces of the Serb
Interior Ministry should control their territory, paramilitary
units in Mahala be disarmed and forces that illegally entered
Mahala be identified.
</P>
<P>
Kijac expressed the hope that Walker would abide by the
agreement just as the Serb Interior Ministry did. He added he
would discuss the matter with Walker Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A clash erupted between Serbs and Muslim civilians Thursday
morning after Serb police tried to check the identity cards of the
Muslims who went to the Serb territory to rebuild their
war-damaged homes in Mahala. IFOR troops intervened and detained
65 Serb policemen.
</P>
<P>
About 600 Serbs and some Serb policemen, angered by NATO's
action in Mahala, later blockaded six U.N. officials in their
office in the nearby town of Zvornik.
</P>
<P>
The stand-off was later defused after Walker flew to the
incident spot with Bosnian Interior Ministry officials who ordered
their men to cooperate with the IFOR.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Walker held talks with Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic to discuss the tense confrontation between IFOR
troops and Serbs. Walker met with Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic
today on the same topic.
</P>
<P>
The violence was another example that tension across Bosnia was
rising steadily in the run-up to the first post-war national
elections scheduled for September 14.

<HEADLINE> UN Stresses Demining in Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today stressed operational demining should be an
important element and an integral part of peacekeeping mandates.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on demining in the context of U.N. peacekeeping,
German Ambassador Tono Eitel, council president for August, said
that the Security Council encouraged the special committee on
peacekeeping operations to examine options for achieving early
deployment of mine-clearance units and encouraged member states to
examine whether and in what form they might be able to help in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies reported that there are over 110 million land
mines buried worldwide. In 1994, roughly 100,000 land mines were
cleared while more than 2 million were laid.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement said that the primary responsibility
for demining rested with parties responsible for the laying of
mines. Parties to a conflict must desist from further mine laying
once a peacekeeping operation was established.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the international community to intensify
its efforts in assisting those parties to a conflict which have
shown their readiness to cooperate with mine clearance, mine
awareness and training programs in the the context of U.N.
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The council appealed to all states to contribute to the United
Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Demining and other funds
established by the secretary-general for peacekeeping operations
with demining elements.
</P>
<P>
Demining activities should make use of the appropriate modern
mine-clearance technologies and specialized equipment and focus on
the creation and strengthening of local demining capabilities,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Mandate of Observer Mission in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today renewed the mandate of a small observer mission in Liberia
until November 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In adopting the resolution unanimously, the council stressed
that the continued presence of the U.N. Observer Mission in
Liberia (UNOMIL), which now has only 10 observers, is predicted on
the presence of a much larger peacekeeping force by the Economic
Community of West Africa (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The council expressed welcome to an agreement of the ECOWAS in
Abuja on 17 August 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the agreement extended the 1995 Abuja
agreement until 15 June 1997, established a timetable for
implementation of the agreement, adopted a mechanism to verify
compliance by the faction leaders with the agreement, and proposed
possible measures against the factions in the event of
noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the Liberian factions to implement
fully and expeditiously all the agreements and commitments they
have entered into.
</P>
<P>
The council also requested the U.N. secretary-general to report
to it by 15 October 1996 with proposals for assistance which the
UNOMIL or other United Nations agencies could provide in support
of the Liberian peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Security Council on the matter of Liberia,
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun
stressed that the final settlement of the Liberia conflict can
only depend on the Liberian people themselves.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the parties concerned to find a political
solution to the conflict through patient and sincere negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"At this critical juncture of the Liberia peace process, we
sincerely hope that the parties in Liberia will seize the
favorable opportunity of the extension of the UNOMIL's mandate to
complete the disarmament of their forces in real earnest and make
good preparations for the general elections so as to ultimately
achieve national reconciliation and restore peace in the country
through fair elections," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dismissed S.African Deputy Minister Expelled From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's recently
dismissed Deputy Minsiter of Environmental Affairs and Tourism
Bantu Holomisa was today expelled with immediate effect from the
African National Congress (ANC) after he was found guilty of
misconduct which brought the party into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
in a statement issued in Johannesburg after a disciplinary
committee hearing, the ANC said Holomisa had behaved throughout
his disciplinary process as though ''he is above the
organisation''.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing earlier in the day, the disciplinary
committee, chaired by Public Service and Administration Minister
Zola Skweyiya, dismissed certain procedural objections Holomisa
raised for a postponement.
</P>
<P>
However, the hearing went ahead and made unanimous judgement
to expel Holomisa in his absence after he walked out of the
hearing because his objections had been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Holomisa said he will appeal to the ANC's
highest policy-making body, the National Executive Committee
(NEC), and will even petition the Supreme Court for a review if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa said he will remain an ANC parliamentary member until
the NEC ruled on his appeal.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa was sacked by President Nelson Mandela from his
deputy ministerial post last month for allegedly bringing the
party into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa joined the ANC shortly before the 1994 general
elections and polled the most votes in the ANC's first nec
elections.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Urges Freedom of Movement, Media in Serb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy to the former
Yugoslavia John Kornblum today called on Bosnian Serb leaders to
guarantee freedom of movement and freedom of the media in the Serb
part of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Serb acting President Biljana Plavsic and
Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha, Kornblum, who is assistant secretary
of state, told reporters in the Serb city of Banja Luka that he
had asked about Serb policy as regards freedom of movement and
freedom of the media and urged the freedom in that regard.
</P>
<P>
He also told Serb leaders that incidents like the one that had
occurred near Zvornik Thursday must not happen again, Tanjug
news agency reported from Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
A clash between Serbs and Muslims in the village of Mahala near
Zvornik in eastern Bosnia sparked off Thursday when Serb police
asked for identity cards from a group of Muslims who crossed the
inter-ethnic border to the Serb territory to rebuild their war
damaged homes. The tension calmed down after peace implementation
Force (IFOR) troops intervened.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, who is on a Balkan tour currently, described freedom
of the media as very important and expressed concern about Serb
authorities' failure to issue a permit for the opening of an
independent TV channel in Banja Luka, the biggest city in the Serb
state.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic, who will run for the presidency of the Serb state
Republika Srpska in September elections, said the TV channel would
soon start broadcasting and there were no major obstacles to it.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the incident in Mahala, Plavsic explained that a
group of Muslims had tried to cross into the Serb territory by
force and that quite a number of them had been armed. She added
that she hoped the IFOR troops would submit a correct report on
it.
</P>
<P>
The commander of NATO-led IFOR ground forces in Bosnia, Michael
Walker, said today both Muslims and Serbs were armed in the
incident in Mahala in violation of of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Kornblum held talks with representatives of
opposition parties in Republika Srpska in Banja Luka on the
upcoming elections and the situation in Bosnia, Tanjug said.

JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- One of major abbattoirs in
botswana will be closed down after the outbreak of the cattle
lung disease,the Southern Afrian Broadcasting Association (SABA)
reported today from Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
The management at the Maun Abattoir in north-western Botswana,
has started serving employees with letters to terminate their
jobs in a " voluntary exit scheme" aimed at facilitating the
closure of the abbattoir.
</P>
<P>
The Radio Botswana said the on-going exercise to eradicate the
disease has left no cattle in the area.
</P>
<P>
Facilities at the abbattoir such as chillers and houses are to
be rented out.
</P>
<P>
Employees at two other abattoirs in the country are being
encouraged to take the exit package as operations there are being
reduced.
</P>
<P>
More than two thousand heads of cattle have been destroyed by
the veterinary department in Botswana in a bid to contain the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The government has paid out more than 32 million u.s. dollars
to compensate the ranchers.
</P>
<P>
Beef is one of Botswana's leading exports. It was not
immediately clear how many jobs are at stake because of the
cutbacks at the three abattoirs.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Issues Harshest Warning Yet to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat today issued the harshest yet warning to
Israel's hardline government that the Palestinians revolted once
again and might to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the warning while addressing 200 people at Balata
Refugee Camp in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a magic wand, but I have the children of the
uprising," he told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's warning came after a two-day confrontation between the
Palestinians and the Israeli government headed by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We are the ones who waged the longest uprising in the 20th
century and murder, imprisonment and expulsions did not terrorize
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's refusal to compromise or implement the peace
agreement requires the Palestinians to be ready and prepared,
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the Israeli policy of expanding Jewish settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and its non-commitment to the
signed agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, Arafat
ordered a four-hour general strike in the West Bank, Gaza Strip
and East Jerusalem Thursday and called for a massive prayer at
Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque in protest today.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 15,000 Palestinians turned out at the prayer,
fewer than usual for a Friday prayer and much fewer than the
planned turnout of 100,000 due to Israeli troops' stringent
roadblocks at the entrances to the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians felt indignant this week over the reports that
the Netanyahu cabinet approved new construction of Jewish
settlements and the demolition of a Palestinian youth center in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, under mounting pressure from the furious
Palestinians, announced that he and a small group of ministers
would oversee the negotiations with the Palestinians, that are
expected to resume next week.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat's harsh remarks this evening indicated that the
tension between the two sides had not been defused.
</P>
<P>
Balata was a hotbed of confrontation with Israel during the
1987-1993 Intifada (Palestinian uprising). Arafat hinted that the
Palestinians were ready to face Israeli soldiers again.
</P>
<P>
"Every one of you should have 12 children, two for you and 10
for me," Arafat told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's call to prayer Friday was viewed as a move to
underscore the Palestinians' claims to east Jerusalem as a future
capital and to test Israel's claim that it ensures freedom of
worship in the holy city, which is sacred to Jews, Moslems and
Christians alike.
</P>
<P>
Strikes, a common protest tool during the 1987-1993 uprising
against Israeli occupation, are mainly meant to demonstrate
unity.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Launches Presidential School Project in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The biggest challenge
facing South Africa is to provide adequate learning
infrastructures and to encourage a culture of learning, South
African President Nelson Mandela noted today.
</P>
<P>
Launching the first presidential school project in Warrenton
in Northern Cape Province, Mandela said if these challenges are
not met, the youth of the country will not be equiped to meet the
challenges of a changing society.
</P>
<P>
''Problems are there and need to be addressed urgently and
gently by the parents, teachers, the business community and
government for the success of our democracy,'' said the
president, adding the government can not solve the problems on
its own.
</P>
<P>
The Warrenton presidential school project involved a 3.5
million Rand (about 780,000 U.S.Dollars) school building program
developed in the partnership between government and Shell South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shell's involvement was a response to Mandela's call two years
ago to the private sector to help redress the imbalances in
education caused by apartheid.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela highlighted the multi-faceted problems
facing the provincial education department, including
overcrowding in schools, poor facilities and the high illiteracy
rate among children of school-going age.
</P>
<P>
In a special message to the youth, the president said: ''The
only and best way to show gratitude to all stakeholders is for
you to study very hard.''

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Concerned Over Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Council of Ministers
said, in a press release here today, that it is concerned over
the fact that the UNITA movement did not complete the assembling
of its soldiers on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA's slowness in selecting and reorganizing its
soldiers into the army of national unity is also worrying, said
the press release which was issued at the end of a Council of
Ministers' meeting chaired by Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the UNITA should have 26,300 of
its soldiers selected into the unity army, but until now only
about 3,500 UNITA soldiers have been selected to join it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the implementation of the peace process
and the present economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government expressed its concern over the
difficulties in free flow of people and cargo throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two sides will hold halks on the
issues in the near future to pave the way for the summit meeting
in September between President dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Move Ahead in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories went
up by 1.8 percent in July after a decline in June, U.S. Commerce
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth advance in five months for a part of the
economy that had faltered during much of last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said that orders for both durable
and nondurable goods rose to a seasonally adjusted 317.6 billion
dollars in July after falling 0.7 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are considered a key gauge of the U.S.
manufacturing strength and increases could mean greater production
and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods jumped 1.7 percent following a 0.2
percent decline in June. Among durable goods, transportation
orders slipped 0.4 percent on top of a 1.3 percent drop a month
earlier. A large decline in shipbuilding and tanks more than
offset an increase in motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nondurable goods advanced 1.8 percent after a 1.2
percent drop a month earlier. Orders for foods and chemicals led
the increase, offsetting a decline in textiles.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft gained
4.2 percent after increasing 2.6 percent the previous month. These
orders often are a barometer of business plans to expand and
modernize and have been a major source of economic strength during
the current expansion.
</P>
<P>
But orders for military goods plunged 36.7 percent after
surging 26.4 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders increased 1 percent, the 10th
advance in 11 months. A growing backlog suggests businesses may
have to increase production facilities and manpower to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, rose 1.2 percent,
wiping out an 0.8 percent loss in June. Inventories edged up 0.2
percent after falling 0.1 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The report and other data released earlier this week showed
that U.S. economy is still expanding strongly although many
analysts and the U.S. Federal Reserve had anticipated that the
economy would slow down in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal also reported today that a number of
prominent U.S. economists are revising upward their forecasts for
economic growth, predicting a strong economy right through the end
of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mali Asks France, Angola to Respect Dignity of Malians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malian President Alpha Oumar
Konare today called on France and Angola to respect the dignity of
Malians living in their countries and not to use the way of
expulsion on chartered planes to make them go home.
</P>
<P>
"We don't approve the way of using chartered planes. We have a
lot of reserve over this way of expulsion because we consider the
conditions in which our compatriots were repatriated violated
their dignity,"Agence France Presse quoted Konare as saying.
</P>
<P>
France expelled 57 Malians on Sunday and Wednesday on two
chartered planes, while Angola has expelled 1,000 Malians on
chartered planes in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We think that there are other ways to make our citizens who
are not in regular situation leave. One cannot be the friend of
Mali without having consideration for those (Malians) abroad,"
said the Malian president.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of the expelled Malians returned home
penniless and were even robbed before they were kicked out.
</P>
<P>
Konare said that Mali will discuss with its "European and
African partners" programs to regard immigration as part of
development problems in Mali.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Malian government has always asked its
citizens to respect the laws of their countries of residence and
is working on new measures to prevent illegal immigration.

<HEADLINE> World Congress Against Child Sexual Exploitation Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The first World Congress
Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children ended here
today with calls for tougher action to eliminate the sexual abuse
of children.
</P>
<P>
The conference adopted a declaration and action plan to stamp
out the child sex trade across the globe.
</P>
<P>
Millions of children around the world are being sexually abused
as the plagues of child prostitution, pornography and trafficking
in children has increased dramatically over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Though non-binding, the declaration is seen as a moral
commitment by governments to protect children from sexual
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
It calls for stronger legislation and tougher penalties for
paedophiles and child traffickers, and urges each nation and
region to raise public awareness by educating children about their
rights.
</P>
<P>
The declaration presses for the full implementation of the
U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and proposes concerted
action at local, national and regional levels to bring an end to
child sexual exploitation and abuse.
</P>
<P>
It appeals to all governments to formulate and implement laws,
policies and programs, and establish special mechanisms for
protecting children's rights by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chinese delegate Cui Ziqiu, who attributed the growing child
sex trade to poverty in developing countries and customers from
developed nations, told the conference that developed countries
bear a heavy responsibility in finding a solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The congress, which started on August 27, was jointly organized
by the Swedish government, End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism
and the United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
It brought together more than 1,200 delegates from 126
countries and over 50 inter-governmental and non-governmental
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Justifies Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said here today that Iraq has the full right to give
military support and aid to one of the two warring Kurdish
factions in northern Iraq to defend its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Iraqi News Agency, Aziz said that Iraq has
the full right to take actions in the country in defense of its
sovereignty, but he asserted that the military intervention will
be "limited" within the frame of providing aid and support and
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that head of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP)
Massoud Barzani sent a letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
August 22, in which he demanded Iraqi armed forces intervention to
protect them and fend off foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the persistence of Jalal Talabani, head of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), "in treason and allying
himself with enemies of Iraq and the Kurds," has led to the
serious deterioration of the situation in the self-rule region,
turning it into an arena for all forms of foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iraq can in no way allow Iran, which it
accused of being involved in the fightings between the two Kurdish
factions, to control the region directly or via Talabani's faction
since this forms "a grave threat to Iraq's sovereignty, security
and national unity."
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States of imposing illegitimate military
presence in the Kurdish area "which has brought about killings,
chaos and the flagrant Iranian intervention."
</P>
<P>
Aziz emphasized that Iraq has always been committed to
peaceful dialogue to solve the Kurdish problem and this stance
will remain unchanged despite Iraqi government's military support
for the KDP.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops, backed by 450 tanks, attacked this morning PUK
positions around Irbil, one of Kurdistan's main cities, forcing a
large number of people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
Tension is running high in the Kurdish area after
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the U.S. armed forces to be
alert and prepare for any contingency in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in Hainan Gaining Strong Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The influx of overseas investment
in the Chinese island province of Hainan is maintaining a strong
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, the southern province has approved
as much as 7,819 foreign-invested firms, and actually utilized
more than six billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province, China's largest special economic zone, has
guaranteed overseas investors' rights with a legal framework
during this period.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in the province has surged since 1995,
when contracts worth 2.78 billion US dollars were concluded, 2.27
times that of 1994's figure.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, the province approved
144 foreign-invested enterprises, using nearly 500 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said overseas investment has increased in
agricultural, mining, manufacturing and construction sectors,
while that in real estate decreased.
</P>
<P>
The scale of overseas investment is constantly expanding.
Investment in a single project climbed to 8.2 million
US dollars on average, nearly four times that of the preceding
year. Among the newly-approved foreign-backed projects, 14 have an
investment of more than 30 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province has also boldly opened new investment fields,
according to local officials. It used foreign investments to set
up auditing offices, accounting offices, commercial firms,
foreign-backed banks, financial companies, investment companies,
aviation companies, and to develop highway transportation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province is diversifying its methods of
attracting overseas investment. In addition to the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) practice, Hainan is also actively using
foreign government loans, foreign commercial bank loans, World
Bank loans, issuing bonds overseas, and receiving international
assistance.
</P>
<P>
In the past five year, the province used 77 foreign government
loans, totalling one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Hainan also completed two projects with
393,000 US dollars of international assistance.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-backed companies are becoming the province's major
exporters. In the first five months of this year, the companies
earned 41.35 million US dollars from exports, up 20 percent over
the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders U.S. Military to Prepare For Action in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday ordered the U.S. military to get ready for possible
deployment in the Persian Gulf in case Iraqi troops cross into the
Kurdish "no fly" zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton, who is
campaigning in the small Illinois town of Cairo, "has ordered that
steps be taken to ensure the United States is prepared for any
contingency."
</P>
<P>
"The United States is monitoring very closely indications that
Iraqi military units near Irbil, in northern Iraq, have been
brought into position and levels of readiness that would enable
them to take offensive action," McCurry said in a written
statement. "We have made clear to Iraq the seriousness with
which we view this situation."
</P>
<P>
Administration officials described the latest massing of
Iraqi troops as "provocative" and "saber-rattling" and a senior
U.S. official said the United States had been communicating its
concern over the situation over the past several weeks, mainly
through diplomats at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
An official said U.S concerns were focused on the area around
Irbil, near the northern Iraqi border with Iran and Turkey.
"U.S. forces have been told to be prepared to deploy to the region
if the president so directs," he said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-led air force contingent has protected the region
against possible attack by Baghdad since shortly after the end of
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iraq accused Iran of military aggression and said
it reserved the right to retaliate for Tehran's alleged deployment
of troops into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and its rival, the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), began fighting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The KDP has claimed Iran sent troops and military equipment
into northern Iraq in support of the PUK guerrillas.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) today said workers in the country's private sector
may soon join thousands of the civil servants striking for more
pay, if the government fails to meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU said employees in the private sector were now awaiting
the outcome of negotiations between the government and the bulk of
Zimbabwe's 161,000 civil servants striking for up to 60 percent
salary increase.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday the ZCTU gave the government up to Friday to start
negotiations which would resolve the impasse with its workers, or the
labor movement would call for a nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
''We have achieved part of that resolution in that we managed to
get the government to talk to the civil servants. We now await the
outcome of further negotiations between the strikers and the
government before we can decide whether to call for the general
strike or not,'' said ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''employees in the private sector are in full support of
the demands of civil servants, and they themselves are prepared to
join the strike.''
</P>
<P>
All striking civil servants whose work stoppage is now almost two
weeks old, were fired by the government during the first week. ZCTU
is now demanding that they all be reinstated unconditionally.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China's former Asian champion
swimmer Wang Dali has accepted an offer to work in the Hong Kong
Sports Institute as a swimming coach.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who comes from North China's Hebei Province, won the 400
and 1500 meters freestyle events at the 1986 and 1990 Asian
Games. After retiring in 1992, he went to Japan to study in a
Tokyo university.
</P>
<P>
Wang has long been wooed by the HK institute, for his

western methods in training. He was invited here in March this
year to train a Hong Kong team in its preparation for this year's
Asian championships. The championships were held in Bangkok in
May.
</P>

Since he will graduate from the Japanese university next March,
he decided to accept the offer of the Hong Kong institute and work
as a coach for Hong Kong's 37-member junior team.
</P>
<P>
"While working in the institute, I can see whether I should
seek a long-term job in Hong Kong," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"But I will do all I can to help the youngsters," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Developments in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is very much concerned
about the worsening situation in northern Iraq and is in close
contacts with the countries concerned, a Turkish high-ranking
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia News Agency quoted the official as saying that "all
kinds of clashes in northern Iraq are destroying the efforts to
secure the stability in the region and are threatening the
security of people's life and property."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the clashes in the region
should end as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops launched attacks today on Kurdish guerrillas in
northern Iraq with heavy gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said today in a
statement that the Iraqi forces staged the "limited operation"
at the request by the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The KDP is battling another Kurdish faction named the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) for supremacy in the
mountainous region where the U.S.-led coalition forces established
an enclave after the 1991 Gulf War for the Kurdish people seeking
independence from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that President Saddam Hussein ordered his troops
into Kurdistan after the KDP leader Massoud Barzani asked him
to intervene on August 22.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Iran of supporting the PUK, but Tehran made
no on official comment on the charges.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Urged to Promote Information Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Beijing municipal government has
been urged to speed up the city's information infrastructure
construction and list the projects in its cross-century
development plan.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The proposal said many developed countries have taken the
building of "information highway" as their economic and social
development strategy, adding it is also an indispensable condition
for Beijing's participation in world market competition and its
modernization.
</P>
<P>
The conference suggested the building of information
application systems for education, science and technology,
administration, finance, economy, trade, tourism and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government was told it would need 10 to 15 years
to build a world level "information highway" which would link up
with the global "information highway."
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that some 70 percent to 80 percent of China's
information sources come from the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Beijing had 3.8 million telephone lines,
over 4,500 kilometers of optical cables, and 160,000 mobile
phones, with the number of telephones for each 100 people standing
at 35.5 in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC held
that the building of the information infrastructure projects will
bring about the development of high-tech industries, such as
micro-electronics, photoelectronics, computers and
communications.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Alarmed by Unusual Muslim Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 75 Muslim men
marched Saturday morning towards the village of Mahala where the
clash between armed Bosnian Serb police and Muslim refugees took
place on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The march to the village, on the Serb side of a demilitarized
zone, was described as "an unusual activity, which could be
considered provocative," by a spokesman for the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel Max Mariner said that IFOR has set up
checkpoints on the road to Mahala, some 40 kilometers southeast of
Tuzla, to find out the identities and intentions of these Muslims.
</P>
<P>
IFOR has also informed all parties concerned and told the Serb
police in the nearby town of Zvornik to stay out of the area.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the U.N. International Police
Task Force (IPTF), which has monitoring police stations throughout
Bosnia, said that 30 Muslims arrived in Mahala Friday morning and
stayed there that night.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, armed Serb police attacked Muslim returnees to
Mahala, beating them and firing shots into air.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR peacekeeping force detained 45 Serb police for
bringing weapons into the demilitarized zone, but released them in
the evening after confiscating their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The arrests triggered a six-hour siege of an IPTF station in
Zvornik by some 600 angry Serbs, who roughed up U.N. police
monitors and destroyed their vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Rejects UN Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Burundi said today it will not
negotiate with rebels of the Hutu majority if they do not give up
violence and the "ideology of genocide," a report from Bujumbura
said today.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Luc Ndizeye, spokesman for Burundi's Tutsi military ruler
Pierre Buyoya today dismissed a U.N. security council threat of
an arms embargo, saying Burundi would solve its own problems.
</P>
<P>
``We are not concerned at this U.N. resolution. If i have one
message for the United Nations, it is: let Burundi solve its own
problems. That is what we are going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``Buyoya is sitting at the negotiating table, waiting for the
other parties to show up. There are only two conditions: that
they (Hutu rebels) give up killing innocent civilians and
renounce the ideology of extermination and genocide,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Hutu rebel groups also accuse the Tutsi-dominated
army of planning ethnic genocide, a charge denied by the
military.
</P>
<P>
``People must have the right to chose who is their leader but
you can't forget that the right to life is more important than
freedom of expression,'' said Ndizeye.
</P>
<P>
The army seized power on July 25 from civilian president
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, an act condemned by east and central
African states which slapped economic sanctions against it in
early August.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include cutting off of air and road links with
Burundi and they are aimed at pressuring Buyoya to return Burundi
to constitutional rule and agree to talks with rebels.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted by a 15-0 vote on Friday, the U.N.
security council for the first time condemned the coup and backed
measures including sanctions taken by regional African states.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said if such talks had not begun by October 31,
the council would consider imposing an arms embargo or applying
selective measures against leaders of the military regime and all
factions encouraging violence and obstructing settlement.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people have been killed in the last three
years in Burundi in massacres and a civil war between the army
and rebels that have raised fears of bloodletting on a scale
similar to Rwanda's genocide in 1994 when nearly one million
died.
</P>
<P>
Rebel forces this week tightened isolation of Bujumbura, a
Tutsi stronghold, by twice cutting power lines to the city,
forcing residents to use dwindling fuel stocks for generators.
</P>
<P>
They have also cut the main road north from Bujumbura to the
Rwandan border with a series of ambushes and by digging it up to
make it impassable for all vehicles, witnesses were quoted as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
Rebels mounted three ambushes on national route one earlier in
the week, including an attack on a beer truck.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting broke out on Wednesday and Thursday when rebels
attacked a school near the northern town of Kayanza and the army
launched a counter-attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
SENDAI, Japan, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Olympic runners-up China
edged Japan 3-2 for its second straight win at the World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix preliminaries here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China, who scored an easy 3-0 victory over Japan in a group
match at the Atlanta Olympic Games, battled for nearly two hours
before winning 10-15, 15-12, 15-10, 9-15 and 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The host team, inspired by veteran Motoko Obayashi and new
talent Maki Fujiyoshi, sprinted to an early 8-2 lead in the first
set but was forced into a 9-9 tie later.
</P>
<P>
Obayashi's powerful smashes combined with mistakes made by the
Chinese spikers gave Japan the opening set, sending the 3,000-odd
home crowd into ecstasy at Sendai City Gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
Ace hitter Sun Yue scored three consecutive points on service
to have a five-point run in the second set while substitute Wang
Ziling spiked four of her seven points in the third as China stage

deciding fifth set, where Sun had five points on attacking and two
points on blocking.
</P>
<P>
Obayashi scored 15 points in the match to lead the Japanese,

</P>
<P>
Sun was China's top scorer with 14 points. Li Yan and Wu
Yongmei both had six and captain Lai Yawen collected seven.
</P>
<P>
"Today's match was very good. Japan has a new line-up after the
Olympics and this was the first time we fought the new team," said
Chinese coach Lang Ping.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have effective blocking to fend off the attacks,"
she added. "We had not good physical strength in the fourth set to
cope with their blocks. Japan played a great game."
</P>
<P>
Japanese coach Kuzuwa Nobuchika said, "China didn't play well
today. The setter might be too exhausted. It doesn't look like the
Chinese team before, because they played too slow."
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's other game, Olympic champion Cuba rallied from
one set down to beat Russia 5-15, 15-11, 15-10 and 15-12.
</P>
<P>

mistakes. We don't have a good setter to set up the ball for
effective smashes."

On Sunday, the final day of the Sendai leg, China meets Russia
and Cuba faces Japan.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction for Experimental "Libero" Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SENDAI, Northeastern Japan, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The new rule
of "liberal" defender free to replace the back player without
going through the timer, which was trialed at the World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix here, got mixed reaction from the coaches of
the participating teams.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol sang high praise of the new rule,
while his countparts from Japan, Cuba and China said they had
virtually no experience on it.
</P>
<P>
"Libero (liberal defensive player) rule is very good," said
Karpol. "I almost post one throughout the game."
</P>
<P>
But he maintained the rule still needed improvement, saying the
libero should be allowed to attack.
</P>
<P>
According to the experimental rule, the libero, who dons a
black vest with the letter "L", cannot attack and serve. Only one
libero could play on backcourt at any time.
</P>
<P>
Japanese coach Kuzuwa Nobuchika agreed with Karpol. "It is a
waste of the resources as the libero player could not attack from
the backcourt."
</P>
<P>
He added, "Since I have not much experience with the rule, I am
going to gather some here."
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Lang Ping said she had let some players to
practice as libero before coming here.
</P>
<P>
"Libero system is a new thing. I am familiarizing myself with
the rules and learn how to make it work better for my team," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The International Volleyball Federation sent questionnaires to
coaches and referee to find out whether the rule really helps to
improve the defence.
</P>
<P>
The federation is also collecting videos and statistics of the
games for evaluation.

<HEADLINE> OECD Experts Joins in Seminar on China's State Sector Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 Chinese and
overseas scholars and Chinese officials attended a seminar here
today to discuss ways of rejuvenating China's state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Present at the two-day conference were scholars from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the
Institut d'Economic Industrielle Universite des Sciences Sociales,
Harvard University, the London School of Economics, the Universite
Libre de Bruxelles, and other universities.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the "International Conference on Theory of the
Modern Firm and China's Economic Reform" is to discuss the latest
developments in western theories on company management and reform.
</P>
<P>
With China's increasing economic reforms, applying the modern
enterprise system to China's state-owned enterprises has become a
crucial matter for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that one-third of the staff in state-owned firms
are redundant and that they can't be sacked because of the lack of
a social insurance system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these firms usually have a high level of debt and are
burdened by having to attend to many of society's functions, such
as schooling, kindergartens, clinics, and security measures inside
the business perimeter.
</P>
<P>
China is experimenting with modern enterprise system reforms in
100 carefully selected state-owned enterprises, 56 group
companies, and three holdings companies.

SHANGHAI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A local vocational school for
deaf-mutes in China's largest city has made a great effort to
increase the amount of education available for children with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
The school is the country's first secondary technical school
for deaf-mutes, said Dai Mu, school head.
</P>
<P>
"The school has trained a number of outstanding students in the

</P>
<P>
It provides four-year specialities for its special students in
design work, metal processing, carpentry, and tailoring.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these special majors, the school has begun
providing the same courses as regular middle schools, so that
students can get two certificates, one for a middle school
education, the other for vocational skills.
</P>
<P>
The school even encourages its deaf-mute students to go for

<HEADLINE> France Supports All Peace Efforts in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- France said today it supports all
efforts to bring peace to Burundi, including plans by
representatives from the Italian Roman Catholic community,
Tanzania and the United states to arrange tripartite peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sant'Egidio of the Italian Roman Catholic community, former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and U.S. envoy to Burundi and
Rwanda Howard Wolpe may take part in the talks, a French
government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"Anything which contributes to the search for a political
solution and national reconciliation (in Burundi) is welcome,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burundi's military-backed government said President
Pierre Buyoya "is waiting at the table of negotiations," according
to reports from Burundi's capital Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
A Burundian government spokesman said that Buyoya, who seized
power in a bloodless coup on July 25, is "ready to negotiate with
the armed factions, on condition that they put down their arms and
abandon genocide.
</P>
<P>
"The door is open. The ball is in the camp of the Hutu
rebels. To negotiate, one needs two sides," Jean-Luc Ndizeye said.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu rebels have rejected calls for talks by the
Tutsi-dominated military government.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic fighting between the majority Hutus and the minority
Tutsis broke out in 1993 after the country's first democratically
elected Hutu president was assassinated. More than 100,000 people
are estimated to have died in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, who ruled the country from 1987 to 1993, said he
launched the coup in July to bring peace to the country. He has
formed a transition government to try to unite the country and
promised to draw up a new constitution.

<P>
BAGHDAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi troops launched attacks
today on Kurdish guerrillas in northern part of the country with
heavy gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in a statement
carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) that the Iraqi forces
staged the "limited operation" at the request by the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The KDP is battling another Kurdish faction named the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) for supremacy in the mountainous region
where the U.S.-led coalition forces established an enclave after
the 1991 Gulf war for the Kurdish people seeking independence from
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that President Saddam Hussein ordered his troops into
Kurdistan after the KDP leader Massoud Barzani asked him to
intervene on August 22.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to launch a limited military operation in defense
of our sovereignty and our people and their properties," INA
quoted the deputy Prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraqi troops, backed by 450 tanks, began
shelling the PUK positions around Irbil, one of Kurdistan's main
cities, at 0500 a.m.(0100 GMT).

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda First Discovered in Baoxing County, Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A 200-kilometer westward journey
from Chengdu, the capital city of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, brings travelers to a small, but mysterious county.
</P>
<P>
The county, Baoxing, has a population of less than 60,000, but
it is closely related to the history of the most loved animal in
the world -- the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda was first discovered by a French missionary in
1869. It caused a sensation throughout the world at the time, and
the county became known as the "home of the giant panda."
</P>
<P>
The French missionary was sent to China to work when he was
36. He took a great interest in life of wild animals in China and
collected many valuable specimens of animals and plants, including
the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
On May 4, 1869, the missionary wrote that his hunters waited
for about two weeks in the east part of Baoxing County, and they
brought him a lovely "black-white bear." It might be a new
species, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
He intended to send the animal to Paris for scientific
research, but sadly the animal died without leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
The missionary had to send its fur to the Paris national museum
for display. There, scientists believed that it was neither a bear
nor cat, and named it "giant panda."
</P>
<P>
The missionary's discovery attracted world attention to the new
species of animal. Many foreign scientists and explorers came to
China to hunt for the animal.
</P>
<P>
Then in 1936, a female garment designer from the United States
visited Baoxing and caught a giant panda with the help of local
hunters. Later, she took the young panda with her to San
Francisco, according to local records.
</P>
<P>
This was believed to have been the first time that a giant
panda had left for an alien land.
</P>
<P>
According to the local records, a dozen more giant pandas were
killed by foreign hunters and a great number of panda furs that
were collected from the local people were taken to museums in
Britain, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Now the panda, an endangered species, is loved around the world
- it has even become the official logo of the World Wildlife
Fund.

</P>
<P>
Lebanese Information Minister Farid Makari said in an interview
with the Cairo-based Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs) Radio that the
Lebanese and Syrians are acting in unison in the Middle East peace

Syrian President Hafez al-Assad said that the Israeli proposal
should be "Lebanon and Syria, first and simultaneously."
</P>
<P>
Makari said in the interview today that his country does not
object to the resumption of negotiations with Israel if
Arab-Israeli peace talks are resumed from the point they had
reached and within the same framework maintained since the

MOGADISHU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of families started
fleeing in Goldogob district of Somalia's central Galgudud region
today and yesterday when Ethiopian troops reportedly came near
the border line only 5 Km away.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Goldogob, 75 km west of Galkaio, said eyewitness
accounts said those who fled are mainly young men from the age of
14 to 45. Galkaio is 500 Km North of capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Al-Islam Sheikh Mukhtar Sheikh Hamud has accused
the Ethiopian government of terrorizing the civilians with its
new air surveillance on the town accompanied by troops deployment
nearby.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamud told reporters today that this new incursion
started when troops of Ethiopia had invaded the Western district
of Gibiley, 80 Km West of Hargeisa, capital of the break away
republic of Somali Land three days ago.
</P>
<P>
He said local elders at Gibiley district told the intruding
Ethiopians they accommodated no Al-Itihad base and needed no
problem in their region, and persuaded the invaders to retreat to
their original bases.
</P>
<P>
During the "peaceful invasion" into Gibiey, Sheikh Hamud
said, no one was killed or wounded. "the action has however
caused many people to flee the town."
</P>

forces, supported by tanks, armored vehicles and helicopter
gunships, attacked the border towns of Dolow, Luq, Bulohawo and
Bohol Garas, and seized them temporarily.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians came reportedly to fight the Islamic
fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad Al-Islam which had long been
engaged in a hit and run battle against Ethiopian forces in the
fifth zone mainly inhabited by the Somali clan.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys from Al-Islam Executive Committee
claimed that at least 150 people were killed, five mosques
destroyed, two libraries and all the state owned buildings wiped
out while 30 percent of the residential houses were burned to
ashes at Luq alone during the Ethiopian invasion early this
month.

<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua)-- Most of China's more than one
million middle and primary schools have library facilities,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 65 percent of the Chinese primary and middle schools
had libraries, while it was 80-100 percent for schools in big
cities or in coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
The schools have an average of 3,000 books each, while
libraries in major schools usually take up at least 100 sq m, and
contain more than 10,000 books.
</P>
<P>
School libraries provide students with reference services and
advice, and some are equipped with computers and audio equipment.
</P>
<P>
Since the Regulation on Middle and Primary School Libraries was
promulgated and the Methods on Classification of Library Books
were published in 1991, the country's school libraries have had
more rapid development. Now, 70 percent of the libraries are up to
national standards in equipment, book collection, funding, and
staff.

</P>
<P>
He said that banks in Hong Kong are particularly interested in
adding Visa Cash as a feature on their existing bank ATM/debit or

<HEADLINE> HK Deposits, Loans on Rise in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Total deposits increased by
0.8 percent in July after a rise of 1.3 percent in June, according
to statistics published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA).
</P>
<P>
Of the deposits, Hong Kong dollar deposits rose by 1.1 percent
in the month and foreign currency deposits grew by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesman said that the rise in HK dollar deposits in
July was attributable to increases in both HK dollar demand
deposits and time deposits, which more than offset the fall in HK
dollar savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
During the month, HK dollar demand deposits continued to grow
rapidly by 3.2 percent while HK dollar time deposits rose by 1.5
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign currency deposits, he said, both the US dollar
and non-US dollar components increased. Having fallen by three
percent during April to June, US dollar deposits reverted to an
increase of 0.3 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Non-US dollar foreign currency deposits were up by 0.7 percent,
after remaining virtually unchanged in June.
</P>
<P>
Total loans and advances grew by 2.2 percent in July, following
a 0.5 percent increase in June, which reflects a further expansion
in domestic credit by 1.5 percent and a rebound in offshore
lending by 2.7 percent in July.

LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The new Lagos state military

their possession to their respective directors-general.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Mohanned Marwa, who was sworn in 10 days ago as state

million Naira (630,000 U.S. Dollars) had been withdrawn from an
account in a bank ''in gross violation'' of the directive.
</P>
<P>
He said he has started investigations to identify the
culprits, promising that they would face the appropriate
tribunal.

Marwa temporarily froze the state government's accounts at the
failure of his predecessor to state the position of the state's
finances during the hand-over on August 22.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Cooperation with Israel in Water Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has denied reports that it
is transferring water of the Nile River to Israel via Al-Salam
Canal, currently under construction in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
There is no cooperation between Egypt and Israel in the field
of water, Egyptian Minister of Irrigation, Public Works and Water
Resources Abdel-Hadi Radi said in an interview carried by the
Egyptian state-run newspaper Al Gomhuria today.
</P>
<P>
Radi warned that Israel wants to have full control over water
resources in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in
1979. But relations between the two countries remain cool.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Radi also accused Ethiopia of wrongly
believing that it has full sovereignty over water sources of the
Nile.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt is trying to maintain close ties with Ethiopia and
other Nile basin countries, said Radi.

<HEADLINE> Official: Nile Flood Not to Cause Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A massive flood of the Nile River
will not cause an earthquake, according to Director of Egypt's
Earthquake Center Rashad Qabisi.
</P>
<P>
Qabisi was apparently trying to dispel fears that the Nile
flood beginning next month, expected to be the greatest ever in
history, may lead to the occurrence of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have not affirmed any relation between man-made
lakes, such as Lake Nasser, and earthquakes, he was quoted today
as saying by Egypt's Arabic-language weekly Akhbar al Yom.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile in 1971,
excess water of the river is held back behind the dam in Lake
Nasser to avert flooding.
</P>
<P>
Lake Nasser, some 700 kilometers south of Cairo, is the world's
largest man-made lake with 500 kilometers long and 10 kilometers
wide.
</P>
<P>
The Nile water level in Lake Nasser recorded a new rise of 10
centimeters and reached 175.18 meters Friday, a sign that the Nile
flood is imminent in Egypt, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the lake will reach 179.2 meters in the
second half of October, Egyptian Minister of Water Resources
Abdel-Hadi Radi said earlier this week. The lake is considered
full at 175 meters, and the extra water will be channeled to the
Toshka Canal, which has never been used since it was dug 30 years
ago as a precaution against massive Nile floods.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak would be closely following the flood
situation of the Nile, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Joint Statement Signed to End War in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the Republic of
Chechnya today signed a joint statement in Khasavyurt, a town
outside Chechnya, reaffirming the end of the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
The communique, which would constitute the basis for further
peace talks, was signed by Russian federal envoy Alexander Lebed
and separatist military chief Aslan Maskhadov after more than
seven hours of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the two sides would defer any
decision on the status of Chechnya for five years until December
31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
A joint commission will be set up by October 1 this year to
monitor the complete withdrawal of Russian troops and take charge
of resuming the financial and currency relations between federal
government and Chechen Republic.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov praised the communique and said to the reporters
afterwards that no soldier would be killed in the Chechnya from
then on.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave Lebed sweeping but
unspecified powers to stop the conflict, which began in December
1994.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lebed signed a truce to end some of the worst
fighting in the Chechen capital, Grozny, after the rebels attacked
the city on August 6 to humiliate Yeltsin three days before his
inauguration for a second term.

CHENGDU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An investment zone jointly built
by business people from both sides of the Taiwan Straits
manufactured 200 million yuan worth of goods in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The zone's annual production value is expected to top one
billion yuan in 1998, an official of the zone said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the zone, located in this capital of Sichuan
Province, southwest China, started in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said that the zone enjoys the same preferential policies as
coastal cities open to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, some 3,000 people from all parts of
the world have come to survey the the biggest investment zone for
Taiwan Companies in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Among them are representatives of the Pacific Electric Wire &AMP;

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Beirut Residents to Choose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanese prime
minister, is one of the 92 candidates who will compete for the 19
seats in Beirut Sunday in the third of the five-stage general
elections which will produce a new 128-seat house.
</P>
<P>
Four alliances comprising 43 candidates respectively headed by
Hariri, ex-Premier Salim al-Hoss and incumbent deputies Adnan
Traboulsi and Najah Wakim, and 49 independents, are the staples
waiting to be chosen by some 380,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a fierce contest between Hariri, Hoss and Salam,
all Sunni Moslems, local political observers described the Sunday
election as a "combat for leadership of the residents in Beirut."
</P>
<P>
There are 17 candidates in "the Beirut's Decision" alliance
headed by Hariri, while two slots are left vacant, one for Sunni
and another Maronite.
</P>
<P>
The alliance of "Salvation and Change" led by Hoss includes 13
candidates, "the People's List" alliance of Wakim includes eight
and "the National Unity" alliance of Traboulsi includes five.
</P>
<P>
The most remarkable among the independents is Tammam Salam,
son of Saeb Salam, former prime minister and one of the republic's
founders.
</P>
<P>
At stake in Sunday's election are six seats reserved for Sunni
Moslems, two for Shiite Moslems, one for the Druze, one for
Maronites, two for Greek Orthodox Christians, one for Greek
Catholic Christians, three for Armenian Orthodoxes, one for
Armenian Catholics, one for Evangelicals and one for Christian
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Amil Khoury, owner and editor of the Beirut's conservative
daily An-Nahar, noted that unlike other heads of the alliances,
Hariri can draw votes for every member of his alliance instead
of their dependence on individual efforts.
</P>
<P>
Khoury said that the billionaire prime minister wants to have a
"representative, homogeneous, harmonic and united parliamentary
bloc" which, along with other major blocs, will ensure a political
stability of the government.
</P>
<P>
Local observers commonly agree that the mainstream in the next
half-Christian, half-Moslem house will be the major blocs, ending
an era of lacking disciplined and homogeneous blocs in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Those would-be major blocs is respectively headed by Hariri,
incumbent House Speaker Nabih Berri and Druze leader Walid
Jumblatt, in addition to another possible group led by President
Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
After four years of experiences in the government, Hariri has
attached a tremendous importance to the foundation of this kind
of blocs which can play an effective role in the house and
constitute a majority in voting for projects and decisions.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government candidates scored a crushing victory in the
first round of election in the predominantly Christian
governorate of Mount Lebanon on August 18 by winning 32 out of 35
seats and among the winners are 12 members of an alliance led by
Jumblatt, a minister in Hariri's government.
</P>
<P>
In the second round in North Lebanon, most traditional leaders
lost in the competition for the 28 seats in the parliament, and
almost all the winners, including 12 new faces, are friends of
Syria, the most influential foreign power broker in this country.
</P>
<P>
Hot contests are expected between two rival Shiite groups, Amal
of Nabih Berri and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
the last two rounds of elections in the constituencies of South
Lebanon on September 8 and in Beqqa on September 15.

SANAA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Yemen and Saudi Arabia reaffirmed
their commitment to Arab solidarity and the Middle East peace
process, two major issues discussed at the Cairo Arab summit held
in June.
</P>
<P>
They stressed keenness on the security of the Arabian
peninsula, the Gulf and the African Horn regions as well as the
safety of navigation in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of a visit to Yemen by
Saudi Minister of Defense and Aviation Sultan Ben-Abdul-Aziz, the

which they signed in 1934.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed commitment to the Memo of Understanding
which was inked in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two documents spell out terms on border disputes between

<HEADLINE> Unified Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market Urged by Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial experts want
the establishment of a unified inter-bank foreign exchange market
to be placed high on the agenda, according to a recent seminar in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"A unified foreign exchange market is conducive to a more
efficient foreign exchange management of the banks," participants
in the seminar agreed, adding that establishing such a market is
in line with the market-oriented transformation of the current
foreign exchange management system.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the market could improve the fund-raising
aility of banks, as well strengthen control over money supply.
</P>
<P>
The number of financial institutions involved in foreign
exchange business has been rapidly rising since China's reform in
foreign exchange management system, with the number topping 2,000
to date.
</P>
<P>
More efficient inter-bank foreign exchange lending and
borrowing is necessary for a proper distribution of the current
foreign exchange reserves, they said.
</P>
<P>
The current inter-bank business in foreign exchanges is
frequently hit by rampant irregularities because of a lack of
unified management and adequate supervision, making the need for a
standard and unified foreign exchange market all the more urgent.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Liberals Call for Referendum on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran's liberal camp called for a
nationwide referendum on amending the constitution in a bid to
seek a third term of presidency for Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a
press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily "Iran News" reported that the call was made
by Abdullah Nouri, a leading figure in the liberal camp and former
Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
The law in Iran does not allow the president to stay in office
for a third consecutive term. Rafsanjani is now serving his
second term, which will expire by July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Abdullah Nouri, a Parliament member from Tehran, proposed
to amend the constitution to make a third term possible for
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the rightists' opposition to Mr. Rafsanjani's
candidacy for a third term ... he (Rafsanjani) should be given
another chance because of his personal charisma and rich
political and executive experiences," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the present uncertainty concerning the future head
of the executive branch must be ended.
</P>
<P>
He noted "it is in the interest of the country and we should
not deprive our country of such a courageous statesman."
</P>
<P>
Nouri's name was mentioned in political circles in Tehran in
connection with the leftists' and moderates' plan to find a
candidate for the next president.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Marashi, another Parliament member from Kerman
province, supported the re-election of President Rafsanjani for a
third term, saying in today's Persian daily "Jumhuri Islami" that
there were no legal hurdle obstructing the re-election of
Rafsanjani for a third term except his own personal
disinclination.
</P>
<P>
From the legal point of view, he added, the way for
Rafsanjani's re-election was wide open and "it is my personal
view that it must be done."
</P>
<P>
He explained that there was explicit reference in the
constitution that under unusual condition, when the interests of
the system require, the Expediency Council can decide differently
from the ruling of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this ruling spelled out by the constitution, there
is need for any constitutional amendment," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, there are strong opposition from the hardliners headed
by Parliament Speaker Ali Akabr Nateq-Nouri to the proposed
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
The hardliners planned to nominate Nateq-Nouri for the
presidential candidacy to run the next election race scheduled
for August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Morteza Nabavi, a conservative deputy, has criticized those who
were seeking a new mandate for Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
"Isn't there anyone else in this country who deserves the
post? We should not change the law under any little pretext," he
argued.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Beef Industry Expected to Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia's beef industry was
set for a healthy recovery as seasonal conditions started to
improve and Asia's demand increased, the Cattle Council of
Australia said today.
</P>
<P>
"The beef industry will soon emerge as a stronger and fitter
competitor on the world stage after its toughest test in over 20
years," president of the council John Wyld said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"A combination of poor seasons, very low prices and unwarranted
concern over meat safety have combined to make the last three
years amongst the toughest period ever faced by cattle producers
in Australia, the United States and other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is a spark on the horizon," he said, noting
that a growing number of consumers in Asia were boosting the beef
industry's prospects, along with reduced competition from pork, a
slowdown in poultry expansion and increasing demand from fast-food
services for beef in the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the South Korean government would lift its quota
on purchases of Australian beef, and that the competing New
Zealand industry would downsize by over 10 percent by June 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, the gross value of livestock slaughtering in the

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French police detained Thursday and Friday nine Corsicans
suspected of belonging to the outlawed separatist group, "Historic
FLNC-Canal," blamed for several bomb attacks on public
constructions in the past 15 days. Prime Minister Alain Juppe
hailed this police operation which came one week after the
separatists announced an end to a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
-- Many Americans are suffering from a syndrome of
schizophrenia when deciding whether to re-elect Bill Clinton.

also think that the president lacks honesty and integrity.
</P>

Republican political scientist Frank Luntz said: "The voters

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In order to disqualify his 72-year-old rival Bob Dole, Bill
Clinton is emphasizing education for young people to build "a

really want to again make the mistake you made in the past?" asked
Clinton.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China's Shanghai branch recently granted 361 million yuan
in special loans during a drive to foster brand-name light
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The money will go to 20 manufacturers of these products,
including the Shanglin Refrigerator, the Forever Bicycle, the
Narcissus Washing Machine, and the Phoenix Bicycle, to help them
gain an annual sales volume of over ten billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has supported 58 brand-name light industrial products
in recent years, about one-third of the brand-name industrial
goods in the city.
</P>
<P>
These 58 items brought the city an annual output value of 21
billion yuan last year, 65 percent of the total amount for light
industry.
</P>
<P>
A sales volume of 34 billion yuan was reached for the 58
brand-name products, accounting for 63 percent of the gross sales
volume for light industrial products. Their combined profit held

<HEADLINE> Former South Korean Presidents Appeal to Higher Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean Presidents
Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who were sentenced by the Seoul
District Court early this week, formally appealed their cases to
the Seoul Appellate Court today.
</P>
<P>
Also filing petitions of appeal today were eight followers of
the two former presidents including former First Army Corps
Commander Hwang Young-si.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, the Seoul District Court sentenced Chun to death
and Roh to 22 years and six months in prison respectively on
charges of mutiny, treason and bribery. It also fined Chun 282
million U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million U.S. dollars,
representing the bribes they received from businessmen while in
office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sentences ranging from four to 10 years in prison
were given to 13 former South Korean officers who helped the two
ex-presidents in their quest for power.
</P>
<P>
Sentences ranging from 10 months to seven years in prison were
also given to 18 business leaders and former officials in
connection with the two ex-presidents' slush fund cases, some of
them with a stay of execution for two to four years.
</P>
<P>
Chun and others said in the petitions they submitted through
defense lawyers today that they were appealing because of their
dissatisfaction with the lower court decisions.
</P>
<P>
Chun originally refused to appeal, asking "what good is an
appeal?" But later he decided to appeal to the higher court.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from the roles played by
the two former presidents and their cronies in the military coup
on December 12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
With the newly-filed appeals included, 25 defendants have now
formally requested a retrial -- 15 of them in connection with the
December 12 and May 18 cases, seven with the Roh Tae-woo slush
fund and three with the Chun Doo-hwan slush fund cases.
</P>
<P>
This means that everyone indicted in connection with the
December 12 and May 18 incidents, except former Commander of the
Army 20th Division Park Jun-byung who was acquitted, and all of
the defendants who received prison terms for bribery, have
formally filed appeals.
</P>
<P>
Eight people who received suspended prison terms for bribery
including Samsung Business Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee are unlikely
to appeal, according to sources here.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Stefan Edberg advanced
into the third round of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament with a win
over ailing Bernd Karbacher on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Swede, who numbers two U.S. Open titles among
his six Grand Slam triumphs, benefitted from Karbacher's
retirement with a pulled left hamstring after one game of the
fourth set. Edberg led 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 1-0 at the time.
</P>
<P>
Edberg has had four notable night losses at the U.S. Open, in
1984 to John McEnroe in the second round, to Aaron Krickstein in
the fourth round in 1988, to Jimmy Connors in the fourth round in
1989 and to compatriot Jonas Bjorkman in the third round in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Edberg didn't have a break point against Karbacher until the
opening game of the second, and promptly converted it.
</P>
<P>
He dropped his serve in the next game, but he was beginning to
look more confident at the net.
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who had announced to later this year, hasn't won a
tournament this season, although he finished runner-up to Boris
Becker at the Queens Club grass court tournament in June.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Party to Release Plan for Afrikaner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Freedom Front (FF) of
South Africa is expected today to release its first formal
proposals for a separate Afrikaner state within the country,
''the Citizen'' daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria on Friday, FF Chairman
Pieter Mulder said the plan, accepted by the party's federal
council last week, had largely succeeded in reconciling the new
South Africa and the proposed constitution with the idea of
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
''The constitution contains clauses enabling, but not
guaranteeing, self-determination,'' said Mulder, adding the FF
is looking at how these clauses could be best exploited when
formulating its proposals on an Afrikaner state.
</P>
<P>
The expected plan also includes recommendations for Afrikaner
self-determination outside the borders of a ''Volkstaat'' (white
Boers' homeland), and a strategy to achieve these goals.
</P>
<P>
Mulder said the plan was the result of two years'
investigations by the FF, the Volkstaat council and independent
experts, and it had, over the past three months, been discussed,
refined and approved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an attempt to acquire support for its plan, the
FF would enter discussion with the African National Congress
(ANC), National Party (NP)and the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela said last year he might consider a
separate Afrikaner state if the majority of Afrikaners (Boers --
farmers of Dutch origin) supported the idea, but insisting a
referendum should be held beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Although all Afrikaners agreed Volkstaat was a fundamental
right, they could not decide on its boundaries, its constitution
or how it should be introduced.

JERUSALEM -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has warned Israel
that its failure to implement the signed agreements could renew
the Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a visit to the West Bank town of Nablus on
Friday evening, Arafat said that the Palestinian people had
revolted once against Israel and could do so again in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I tell them (Israelis) ... that we are the ones who waged the
longest uprising in the twentieth century, and murder,
imprisonment and expulsions did not terrorize us," Arafat spoke to
hundreds of people in the Balata refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the 1987-1993 Intifada, or Arab uprising,
during which about 2,000 Palestinians, including many
stone-throwing teenagers, were killed in violent clashes with
Israeli soldiers. Israeli soldiers also suffered heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW -- Russia's peace envoy Alexander Lebed declared the
Chechen war over today after he and separatist leaders reached
agreements, according to an ITAR-Tass news agency report from
Khasavyurt.
</P>
<P>
Lebed signed a peace deal with Aslan Maskhadov, military chief
of the separatists, deferring for five years any decision on the
status of Chechnya until December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
A joint commission will be set up by October 1 this year to
monitor the complete withdrawal of Russian troops and coordinate
steps in fighting crimes and terrorism in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave Lebed sweeping but
unspecified powers to stop the conflict, which began after Russian
troops moved into the breakaway republic in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lebed signed a truce to end some of the worst
fighting in the Chechen capital, Grozny, after the rebels attacked
the city on August 6 to humiliate Yeltsin three days before his
inauguration for a second term.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The United States, suspicious of the motivation
of the Iraqi troops moving northward, is considering to increase
its air power near Iraq by stepping up flight activities in the
Persian Gulf area, Pentagon officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There are movements of (Iraqi) forces that concern us," said a
Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has moved some of his
forces toward northern Iraq, a "no fly" zone created by
U.S.-allies to protect the Kurds from Iraqi troops after the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Recently there have been reports on fighting between two main
rival Kurdish factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, for the control over the region.

ULAN BATOR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia and Demark will
further develop economic and trade cooperation, Danish Foreign
Minister Niels Petersen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Petersen left here today for China after a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will cooperate in the fields of energy,
communications, environment protection, agriculture and livestock

Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Demark, which established diplomatic relations with Mongolia in
August 1968, began to play an active role in helping this Asian
country in 1991. It has decided to provide a grant of 27 million
U.S. dollars to Mongolia between 1991-1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Demark has also offered some 2.8 million dollars
of aid to Mongolia through the United Nations Education, Science
and Cultural Organization for the implementation of the Education
Program for Women in Gobi Desert.

JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has warned Israel that its failure to implement the
signed agreements could renew the Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a visit to the West Bank town of Nablus on
Friday evening, Arafat said that the Palestinian people had
revolted once against Israel and could do so again in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I tell them (Israelis) ... that we are the ones who waged the

</P>
<P>
He was referring to the 1987-1993 Intifada, or Arab uprising,
during which about 2,000 Palestinians, including many
stone-throwing teenagers, were killed in violent clashes with
Israeli soldiers. Israeli soldiers also suffered heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on every Palestinian to be "ready and prepared"
for the "intransigence" of the Israeli new hardline government
and its failure to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat issued the warning after a two-day renewed tension
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the stagnation of peace process and the lack of
change in the Israeli government's policy, Arafat called for a
general strike in the Palestinian territories and East Jerusalem
Thursday, and Friday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East
Jerusalem to pretest Israeli settlements expansion in the West
Bank and houses demolition in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No incident of violence has happened, but the atmosphere was
explosive as thousands of Israeli security forces were put on the
high alert Friday.
</P>
<P>
To calm down the situation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu sent several envoys to conduct dialogues with the
Palestinian National Authority, promising that the formal peace
talks would resume next week after a six-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior Israeli officials revealed that Netanyahu
would meet with Arafat soon to defuse the crisis. Netanyahu's
arrogant attitude and his reluctance to meet with Arafat, whom he
had accused of "harboring terrorism", has fueled the anger of the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu has reversed his opposition to this
meeting, apparently as a result of mounting pressure both from the
outside and inside the country. Israeli opposition parties have
warned any delay of such a meeting could only deteriorate the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

<HEADLINE> Strategic Afghan Highway Reopens after Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The strategic Afghan Salang
highway, linking Kabul with northern Afghanistan, has been
reopened to all kinds of traffic after a hiatus of about three
years, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to reopen the Salang highway was taken at talks
held recently in Mazar-e-Sharif between representatives of Prime
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and General Rashid Dostum, whose
forces control seven provinces in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the highway had been scheduled for August 27,
but was delayed until Thursday due to "technical and security
reasons".
</P>
<P>
The Salang highway, described as an engineering feat as it was
built by cutting across mighty mountain ranges, was closed to
traffic three years ago when Dostum joined hands with Hekmatyar in
an abortive attempt to oust the Rabbani government.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the two sides blocked traffic on the highway,
causing prices of daily goods in the capital city of Kabul to
rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A liquefied petroleum gas
storage center and a gas-fired power plant are expected to be set
up in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
As a major energy-consuming province, Guangdong burned a total
of 70 million tons coal in 1995, with 40 million tons of the coal
had to be shipped in from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
This caused serious environmental problems and pressure on the
area's transport system.
</P>
<P>
To improve the energy structure and use more clean energy, the
provincial government has banned the building of coal-fired power
plants in the delta area.
</P>
<P>
After studying predictions by experts of electricity demands in
the next decade, the government plans to build a gas-fired power
plant with an installed capacity of 8.28 million kilowatts in the
Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The present coastal gas supply will hardly meet the demand for
four billion cubic meters of gas in 2000, and six billion cubic
meters in 2010. The provincial government is considering importing
liquefied petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
Based on geological conditions, the provincial government
has recommended to experts four sites suitable for a gas
storage center and power plant, two on the west bank of Renping
Peninsula, two on the west bank of Dapeng Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Importing liquefied gas is new to China. The cost of
establishing a gas storage center, and projects involving
gas-exploitation and transportation, will be high. Officials
realize that it will be a hard, but necessary, task for the
province.

<HEADLINE> Financial Support For Jilin's Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- More than two million state
enterprise workers in northeast China's Jilin Province do not have
to worry about the future after retirement because they now have a
mutual assistance fund for their pensions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 80 percent of the state enterprise
workers in the province participate in the fund, and some 500,000
retired workers are enjoying financial support from the fund,
which is run by a non-profit social insurance company.
</P>
<P>
Workers' pensions from China's state enterprises used to be the
enterprises' responsibility, but it became an increasingly heavier
burden as the number of retired workers continued to rise.
Whether pensions would arrive on time or not, therefore, depended
on the profitability of the particular enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit social insurance company was founded in Jilin in
1992, in a move to ensure that retired workers would have a stable
income in retirement.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises involved in the mutual assistance fund are required
to pay 21.6 percent of the worker's salary into the fund and each
individual is required to put two percent of his or her salary
into it.
</P>
<P>
The amount of pension for each individual is approximately the
same as before, but the difference lies in the fact that fund,
instead of enterprises, provides the pension.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO), rubber and tin all ended the week higher.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals closed the week higher on news that cargo
surveyor Caleb Brett will release a higher August export figure
next week.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied early in the week on news of tenders from
India and Pakistan. However, Pakistan passed on to October
shipment its tenders for 6,000 tons of "refined, bleached and
deodorized" (RBD) palm oil and 3,000 tons of RBD palm olein, while
India did so for its tender for 6,000 tons of palm olein.
</P>
<P>
August-South rose by 20 ringgit (about eight U.S. dollars) to
close the week at 1,235 ringgit (about 494 U.S. dollars) a ton.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market ended the week higher on strong
buying interest both from local and overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
September RSS One rose by 8.00 sen (about 3.2 U.S. cents) to
330.00 sen (about 132 U.S. cents) per kilogram, while SMR 20

U.S. cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The market saw purchase from Turkey, China and European and
South African countries throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
The strong performance of the local market was in tandem with
the uptrend of the regional markets and Tokyo rubber futures.
</P>
<P>
Buyers were keen to cover their positions because the market is
expecting a shortage of supply due to the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) also closed the week higher
due to the strong performance on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
</P>
<P>
Tin price on the KLTM rose by eight sen (about 3.2 U.S. cents)
to close at 15.08 sen (about 6.03 U.S. cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week rose to 665 tons from last
week's 650 tons, with European, Japanese and local players
dominating the week's transactions.

<HEADLINE> Border Trade Makes Village in Tibet Prosperous (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Hui businessman, Ma Chengfu,
traveled thousands of miles from Lanzhou in China's northwest Gansu
Province, to Asam, a village of just 18 families in Yadong County,
southern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Ma arrived with silk and satin, produced in coastal Zhejiang
Province, for barter trade in Asam. He journeyed to the tiny
village instead of going to big cities such as Lhasa and Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
"Friends told me that I can do business with Bhutanese business
people. So here I am," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
He has lived for a month in a rented room. Because of the
difference in living habits between Hui people and Tibetans, he
does his own cooking, and lives a simple life. Meanwhile, he has
done a lot of business.
</P>
<P>
Yadong County shares a border of 290 kilometers with Bhutan and
Sikkim. It has 43 passageways along the the border. It used to be
an important port of entry through which Tibet traded with South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Before the closure of Yadong port of entry in 1962, the volume
of trade through official channels topped 330 million yuan (about
$39.76 million).
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the easing of the situation in the border
area, the re-opening of this port has been placed on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Local residents resumed bartering some time ago.
</P>
<P>
Asam, the village with the shortest distance to the border,
soon became a well-known trade-oriented village.

<HEADLINE> Thugs Shoot Dead Student In Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan student in Britain
who returned for holidays was shot dead by thugs in Nairobi on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ajul Shah (20), a pharmacy student of Cardiff University was
back here for holidays was attacked with his friends at First
Parklands Avenue, by six gangsters who also robbed of his car.
</P>
<P>
Niraj Haria, also a student at the same British university who
stayed in the car with Ajul, said the gangsters attacked them at
a road junction shortly after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
He told Kenyan local papers that "We had slowed down at the
road junction when the gangsters came out of hiding brandishing a
gun, demanding we surrender the car."
</P>
<P>
But no sooner had the thugs ordered the three occupants of the
Nissan Sunny car to leave than they shot the late Ajul in the
chest, Haria added.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi police boss J. Maragua said his men were still
pursuing the gangsters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to another report from "Daily Nation", a
gang of 20 on Friday attacked a Kiambu village, leaving two
people dead and four others critically injured.

Foreigners going to Asam for business are mostly Bhutaneses,
normally in a group of five to six, and with some twenty horses. It
takes only two to three days through using shortcut from Bhutan to
China.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese bring commodities and Bhutan specialties to Asam,
and take back consumer goods made in China.
</P>
<P>
While handling barter trade, dealers evaluate their goods in
Chinese currency of yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Although the method is a little primitive and dealers
cannot get cash at once, we still can do business," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
His landlady, Cering Lhamo, said that every family in her
village barters with Bhutan business people.
</P>
<P>
"This way all of us can make money, in addition to meeting our
own needs," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The Bhutan business people live in our village after their
arrival. As they know what the market needs before their arrival,
the goods they bring with them are usually exchanged in two or
three days," added Cering.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges of goods via non-governmental channels exceed 3.6
million yuan a year in Yadong, according to a local government
official.
</P>
<P>
"We warmly welcome business people from Bhutan and other
neighbouring countries to do business in Yadong, so long as they
abide by Chinese laws and regulations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Japan Has Long Been Coveting Diaoyu Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- In the summer of this year, a
group of Japanese right-wingers, with the instigation and backing
of the Japanese government, staged reckless provocations at
China's inalienable territory of Diaoyu Islands, arousing
righteous indignation from the Chinese People. However, Japan's
coveting of Diaoyu Islands has not started today only, and can be
traced back to decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the 1894-1895 Sino-Japanese War, Japan had never
questioned China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands consisting
of the Diaoyu, Huangwei, Chiwei, Nanxiao, Beixiao, Danan, Dabei
and Feilai islands which scatter to cover an area of seven square
kilometers to the northeast of China's Taiwan Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1884, an Okinawan resident from Naha became the first
Japanese to land on the Diaoyu Island to collect bird feathers and
conduct fishing.
</P>
<P>
When he appealed to the Okinawan governor to be allowed to
exploit the island, the Japanese official turned back his request.
</P>
<P>
Though the Okinawan governor wrote to the Japanese government
time and again in the following year to request control over the
Diaoyu, Huangwei and Chiwei islands, the central authorities at
that time declined to reply showing regard for China's sovereignty
over them held by the Qing Dynasty of the time.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Japanese
government coerced the Chinese Qing government into signing the
Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which China ceded the Diaoyu Islands
as well as the whole of Taiwan to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan returned Taiwan to China after its defeat in
World War II, it put the Diaoyu Islands to the trusteeship of the
American occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
When a U.N. commission announced in the late 1960s that there
might be a rich reserve of petroleum and natural gas around the
Diaoyu Islands, Japan soon went it alone to conduct geological
exploration around the islands.
</P>
<P>
Before long, the Japanese sent their patrol boats to Diaoyu and
destroyed the ancient marks there which confirmed china's
sovereignty over these islands.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese went even further by erecting a marker stone
defining the islands as pertaining to the Japanese Okinawan
prefecture and re-naming the eight Chinese islands in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States covertly included the Diaoyu
Islands into the return zone when the Americans agreed to return
Okinawa to the Japanese in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government lodged a strong protest against their
illegal action.
</P>
<P>
During negotiations on resuming diplomatic relations between
Japan and China in 1972, the two countries agreed to bypass the
issue of the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands and to solve the
issue only when conditions are mature.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made because the two sides attached great
importance to the Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
But after the negotiation and signing of the Treaty of Peace
and Friendship Between the People's Republic of China and Japan in
1978, some right-wing Japanese lawmakers, who took a hostile
approach toward China, demanded that China recognize Japan's
sovereignty over Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, however, complied with the right-wing
demand and sent patrol boats and aircraft to monitor Chinese
fishermen operating on waters close to these Islands.
</P>
<P>
In May 1979, the Japanese government manned the islands, built
helicopter fields there and dispatched exploration teams and
surveying vessels.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of the 1990s, Japan stretched its hands
again to the Diaoyu Islands as the global situation and the
balance of power between different countries changed.
</P>
<P>
In October 1990, some Japanese right-wingers erected a
lighthouse on one of the islands after getting permission from the
Japanese government. In addition, Japan sent out 12 vessels and
two helicopters to try to prevent fishing boats from Taiwan from
approaching the Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
On July 14 this year, Japanese right-wingers again built a
beacon on the Beixiao Island in an attempt to include it in the
sea charts and to pave the way for international recognition of
Japan's territorial claim.
</P>
<P>
On August 18, the right-wingers erected posts bearing the
Japanese flag and words of "remembering the dead" on the Diaoyu
Island.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that all these provocative activities of the
Japanese right-wingers were encouraged and backed by the Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, some prominent government officials acted in
unison with the right-wingers, by claiming that the Diaoyu Islands
were Japanese territories and suggesting that the Japanese
Maritime Security Department be ready at all time to counter
"interference" with force.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ambition to occupy China's Diaoyu Islands and its
provocative activities of wantonly trampling on China's
sovereignty for years have been sternly condemned by the Chinese
government and the Chinese media.
</P>
<P>
Japan will face no good outcome if it goes on to act
willfully.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Economic co-operation between
China and Australia are facing bright prospects, today's China
Daily quoted a visiting Australian trade official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Robert Minter, a senior representative of the Australia-China
Business Council, who arrived in Beijing on Thursday, said the
council would continue to promote trade ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he had discovered great opportunities to expand
joint-venture manufacturing of dairy products, biscuits and beer
in China.
</P>
<P>
Minter said Australian firms can offer essential technology
to their Chinese partners in food-processing, drinks, building
materials and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The future also looks promising for Australian sales and
investments in aviation navigation systems, telecommunications,
medical equipment and environmental treatment in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer,
Australian investment in China has expanded almost six-fold during
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation said that Australian investors have signed contracts
to inject a total of more than 3.5 billion US dollars, making
Australia one of the major investors in China.
</P>
<P>
Minter said the rapid economic growth of China is making the
country a big and expanding market, which has attracted an
increasing number of Australian enterprises. The frequent visits
between the two countries have also helped deepen mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said the council will go on providing services to help
Australian enterprises do business in China and vice versa.

WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- American Lonnie Bradley
defeated former champion Simon Brown Friday night in the
middleweight division after a lopsided unanimous decision in
Reading, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bradley, undefeated in 25 fights with 19 knockouts, had little

1993.
</P>
<P>
He dropped the WBC super welterweight belt in a 12-round
decision to Terry Norris on May 7, 1994 and has fought just once
in the last two years, posting a 10-round unanimous decision over
Glenwood Brown June 18.
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, former super middleweight champ Steve Little
scored a 12-round unanimous decision over last-second replacement
Joaquin Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in his hometown, Little improves his record to 24-14-2
with five knockouts. There were no knockdowns in the bout but
Velazquez had a point deducted in the fifth round.

<HEADLINE> India's Trade Deficit Down in April-July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit in
April-July this year stood at 1.08 billion U.S. dollars, lower
than the 1.5 billion dollars gap in the corresponding period last
year, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Trade in April-July was marked by a sharp deceleration in
imports and a slow down in export growth compared with June as
well as the first four months of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
India's exports in April-July were about 10.8 billion dollars,
up by 11.45 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
While imports in this period stood at 11.92 billion dollars,
5.95 percent higher than the same period last year. This is
mainly on account of a far sharper rise in oil imports valued at 3
billion dollars, an increase of almost 42 percent over the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit for the year 1995-96 stood at 4.53 billion
dollars, with exports growing at the rate of 21.28 percent and
imports at 28.74 percent.

DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Eden Girls University College,
the largest female college of Bangladesh in Dhaka with about
14,000 students, was closed on Friday for seven days following a
series of clashes between rival groups of students on the campus.
</P>
<P>
Campus sources said that police were deployed around the campus

The rival students fought a series of clashes since Thursday
night and both sides accused each other of bringing male outsiders
on the college campus to reinforce their strength.

<P>
Witnesses said both groups of students used stones and
brickbats during the chase and counter chase before the police
brought the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
The clash on the Eden college is the latest one of a series of
campus violence happening in this country. For the past two

NEW DELHI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- India's refrigerator industry
is reeling under one of the worst slumps of the decade with demand
being reduced to less than a half, an official from Commerce
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts maintained that the demand has gone down
by almost 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Leading refrigerator companies in the country like Videocon,
BPL, Whirlpool, have had their stocks piling up while dealers have
stopped stocking more refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
In order to create a demand for their models, manufacturers are
resorting to exchange offers but have seen no pick-up of the
demand.
</P>
<P>
The industry has been going through a bad patch since last
year. In a sharp contrast to the 1994-95 growth of over 20
percent, the sector grew by only 5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they expected that the demand would only pick up
slightly towards the end of September when manufacturers start
their off-season discounts.

main factors in affecting the stabilization of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan highly appreciated the activities of Ukrainian

<P>
BANGKOK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
announced immediate measures to improve the competitiveness of
Thai traders on the international market following depressing
export growth figures in the first half of this year, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The measures, aimed at spurring the country's export growth,
include provision of tax credits for Thai investments overseas,
the immediate return of value-added taxes to exporters, and
improvement of efficiency at Klong Toey port in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Export-related agencies have been asked to focus on improving
air and maritime transport services, finding cheap sources of
labor and raw materials, and locating new markets for Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
The measures were approved Friday at a special meeting of the
government's House Export Promotion Committee, chaired by Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held a day after the Bank of Thailand revealed
disappointing export growth for the first seven months of this
year at only 3.8 percent, against a 10.2-percent growth target.
</P>
<P>
The low export growth has led to fears that Thailand might be
forced to review its economic growth forecast of 8.3 percent for
this year.
</P>
<P>
Export revenues account for more than 70 percent of Thailand's
gross domestic product (GDP).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Propose APEC Entrepreneurship Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will propose the
formation of an APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation)
entrepreneurship center based in Indonesia at the third APEC
ministerial meeting to be held in the Philippines on September
5-6, an official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto Prawirokusumo, head of the Research and Development
Bureau of the Cooperative Affairs Ministry, said Indonesia hoped
that the creation of the center would get funding from the APEC
secretariat and Japan's Murayama Fund.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed center's activities would include
education and training in entrepreneurship for small-scale
businessmen in APEC members. It would also serve as a continuing
source of information on business opportunities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming meeting in Cebu, the Philippines, is to be
preceded by a meeting of senior APEC officials, at which Indonesia
will table a proposal to organize an international conference on
youth entrepreneurship, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Cebu ministerial meeting, Indonesia is expected to raise
a number of ideas on the use of various statistical indicators in
measuring the success of small-scale business development within
the framework of APEC's program.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Not to Copy Everything from Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia aspires to become
a nation with high civilization, but will not copy all that were
found in developed countries, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
in his National Day speech today.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia wants to become a progressive nation on its
own strength and does not want to be a country that imitates and
copies all that were found in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"However, we do not want to be different from the other
developed nations merely because we want to be different from
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will not reject anything positive from the developed
nations. What it rejects is anything negative, whether from the
developed nations or from undeveloped nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Malaysians to renew their resolve to restore the
dignity of the race and build a nation which stands tall together
with other countries with high civilization in the present world
and in the history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Based on the encouraging performance in the economic, political
and social fields, the people should be convinced that Malaysia
will achieve the status of a developed nation by 2020, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the theme -- "Culture Shapes Progress" -- for this
year's National Day celebrations, Mahathir said that a race
progresses because the culture of the race is in keeping with
progress.
</P>
<P>
"Our culture must be suited to the level of progress we wish to
achieve and this means that we have to study and develop a culture
to call our own," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's GDP Down in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Italy's gross domestic product
(GDP) for the second quarter this year dropped by 0.5 percent
compared with the first quarter, the latest figures from the
Italian Central Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) showed.
</P>
<P>
This is the first GDP drop this year but the third since the
first quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
An ISTAT official told reporters that the declining tendency
was obvious despite the 0.5-percent increase for the second
quarter in terms of the annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The increase in GDP was 3.8 percent, 2.7 percent, 3.2 percent
and 2.3 percent respectively for the four quarters last year but
only 1.5 percent and 0.5 percent for the first two quarters this
year.
</P>
<P>
While in terms of the annual rate, the increase rate was 3
percent for last year, it was 1 percent for the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The ISTAT official attributed the GDP fall to reduced working
days and decrease in production, especially the production of some
traditional products.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia's peace envoy Alexander
Lebed declared the Chechen war over today after he and separatist
leaders reached agreements, according to an ITAR-Tass news agency
report from Khasavyurt.
</P>
<P>
Lebed signed a peace deal with Aslan Maskhadov, military chief
of the separatists, deferring for five years any decision on the
status of Chechnya until December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
A joint commission will be set up by October 1 this year to
monitor the complete withdrawal of Russian troops and coordinate
steps in fighting crimes and terrorism in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave Lebed sweeping but
unspecified powers to stop the conflict, which began after Russian
troops moved into the breakaway republic in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lebed signed a truce to end some of the worst
fighting in the Chechen capital, Grozny, after the rebels attacked
the city on August 6 to humiliate Yeltsin three days before his

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considering Increasing Air Power Near Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States, suspicious
of the motivation of the Iraqi troops moving northward, is
considering to increase its air power near Iraq by stepping up
flight activities in the Persian Gulf area, Pentagon officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
"There are movements of (Iraqi) forces that concern us," said a
Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has moved some of his
forces toward northern Iraq, a "no fly" zone created by
U.S.-allies to protect the Kurds from Iraqi troops after the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Recently there have been reports on fighting between two main
rival Kurdish factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, for the control over the region.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon officials said the United States is considering a
number of precautionary steps in case the Iraqi troops involve in
the Kurdish conflicts, although his intentions were still unclear.
</P>
<P>
These steps include moving an Air Force expeditionary group of
fighter aircraft into Jordan or somewhere else nearby.
</P>
<P>
The USS aircraft carrier Enterprise in the eastern
Mediterranean and the USS Carl Vinson in the Persian Gulf have
been told to be prepared to move on short notice, the Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft on the Carl Vinson already stepped up flights in the
area as an initial display of U.S. concern, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon maintained that if the Iraqi troops were to cross
into the northern Iraqi area, it would use all its might to thwart
such movement.
</P>
<P>
Spy satellites have been monitoring the region for several days
to determine the motivation of the Iraqi troops' maneuver.
</P>
<P>
There are some 20,000 American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia
to monitor any activities Iraqi troops might take in northern
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers of Dutch Couple Set Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The kidnappers of a Dutch
couple in Costa Rica have threatened to make captivity unbearable
for the hostages if the required money was not paid in eight days,
investigators said today.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was contained in a letter found Thursday in one of
the entrances to the Altamira Hacienda rural estate in the
northern border area of the country, the Judicial Investigative
Organization (OIJ) said.
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated August 27, was written by Hueite Sierd
Sijstra and Jetty Cuors, both 50 years old, who were kidnapped in
the early hours of August 25 in the Altamira Hacienda.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers demanded 1.5 million U.S. dollars plus 2 million
colons (about 9,500 dollars) for the release of the couple.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch couple were working as administrators in the Altamira
Hacie in a reforestation project financed by the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Altamira Hacienda is in the same area where a German tourist
and her Swiss tourist guide were kidnapped in January this year,
who were later freed for a ransom of 200,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The German and the Swiss were held for 71 days by their
abductors, a group of five who had participated in the guerrilla
wars against the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had some clues about the identity of the Dutch
couple kidnappers, who were possibly the former Nicaraguan workers
at Altamira Hacienda.
</P>
<P>
But the police did not rule out the possibility that the
kidnappers might be linked to the group that took hostage the
German tourist and the Swiss guide in January. Two members of
that group have been detained, one in Costa Rica and the other in
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers of the Dutch couple demanded that negotiations
be held with the owner of Altamira Hacienda, also a Dutch citizen,
without interference from the police or authorities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Troops Rescue 3 hostages in Irian Jaya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian troops Friday rescued
three of the 12 hostages held by a gang since August 14 in
Indonesia's easternmost province of Irian Jaya, the Antara news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three freed hostages were in bad conditions, suffering
stomachache and foot injuries, said Col. Frans Willem de Wanna,
commander of the Rajawali task force of the Trikora military
command who led the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
He said the task force met no armed resistance in the
operation, in which a hunting company and two sleuthhounds were
deployed.
</P>
<P>
The gang, called the Security Disturbance Group (GPK), was
reportedly trying to make its way to an area located between
Paniai and Fakfak districts, which borders on Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, the GPK kidnappers abducted 16 workers of Pt.
Kamundan Raya logging company who were resting at their base camp.
</P>
<P>
Later two hostages escaped and two others were released to
carry a letter from the GPK to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers have demanded an end to logging operations in
the area, negotiations involving human rights organizations and
the mediation of Amungme tribal chief Tom Beanal as prerequisites
for the release of their captives.
</P>
<P>
The military said that it ruled out any negotiation with the
kidnappers and was determined to rescue the hostages through
military operations if the abductors refused to surrender.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Young cigarette smokers
could shorten their life expectancy, a Mexican health official
warned today.
</P>
<P>
Epidemiology General Director Roberto Tapia Conyer of the Health
Ministry said that if the smoking trend continues, 10 million
people in the world may be killed by it in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's life expectancy is now 70 years, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
In his study "The Importance of Epidemiological Surveillance in
Preventive Medicine Services," Conyer said behind education
campaigns to face this health problem, there are strong economic
interests thwarting the efforts to attack the increasing
consumption of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
He said programs to combat the tobacco addiction are different
from those against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
To confront the so-called "malady of the century", there are
campaigns and resources to modify the practices and attitudes of
the individuals, but in the case of tobacco smoking, cigarette
consumption is not discouraged.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The city government of Chengdu,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, has issued a
circular encouraging the development of local private business.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Beijing-based "China Business Times" said the
circular reveals the local government has tackled several problems
hampering the growth of the local private sector.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the city government showed its strong support
to the private economy as a competitor with other economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, local banks are asked to provide
private firms with loans, if these firms have records of suitable
management, performance and reputation. Taxation and other
official departments are told in the document not to collect any
kind of illegal fees from private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Private businessmen have the right to refuse illegal levies by
any department, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
The document encourages local private firms to buy shares from
state-owned companies, and also to become export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
All kinds of unreasonable restrictions on the private sector
should be removed, according to the circular.

<HEADLINE> Green Cross to Close Two Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOKYO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Green Cross Corp., under
prosecutors' investigation for selling HIV-tainted blood products,
plans to close and sell off two of its four domestic factories as
part of a restructuring, Kyodo quoted a business daily as
reporting today.
</P>
<P>
The company will likely shut down two main factories in Osaka,
one of which made the unheated blood-clotting agents that spread HIV
to users, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
The factories will be closed by 2000, and the land sold off for
purposes such as housing, the paper said. The company's other two
factories will be separated and turned into subsidiaries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Green Cross will also ask for financial aid from Sakura Bank,
probably on the scale of several billion yen, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The funds are needed to redeem the company's convertible bonds
and for a new factory to be set up in the city of Chitose, Hokkaido,
at the end of 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to post more than 5 billion yen (about
3.75 million u.s. dollars) in unconsolidated pretax losses in
fiscal 1996 ending March next year, due to a drop in sales after
medical institutions began halting purchases of its products due
to the HIV scandal, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Peace Accord Draws Mixed Reactions in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A peace accord initialed Friday
in Jakarta by the Philippine government and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) to end a 24-year old war in Mindanao has
drawn mixed reactions across the country.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the accord was initialed, President Fidel Ramos
predicted that with the formal signing of the accord here on
Monday, a genuine and lasting peace will finally prevail on the
main southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"Very soon, Mindanao will be blessed by enduring peace and
prosperity and show the rest of the country the best of what we
can do for another as Filipinos," Ramos said at an awarding
ceremony for this year's 10 outstanding students of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia also
hailed the initialing of the agreement, saying this would set an
example for the solution of ethnic and religious conflicts in
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In the Mindanao region, tens of thousands of Muslims held
special prayers and rallies Friday in support of the conclusion of
the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
Mosques all over Lanao del Sur province and the nearby Lanao
del Norte held special prayers, while some 45,000 people attended
a five-hour rally in Marawi city in a show of support for the
accord. Those present included some senators and congressmen as
well as MNLF members in colorful traditional clothes.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the U.S. embassy in Manila
said that Washington commended both the government and the MNLF
for their determination to find a mutual acceptable solution to
the Muslim armed revolt in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the hope that the negotiated resolution of the
long-running conflict will inspire similar efforts elsewhere to
resolve disputes in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
However, in Christian-dominated Mindanao cities, residents
opposed the agreement in quiet anger and were reportedly plotting
protests to embarrass MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari and visiting
foreign dignitaries on Monday when the agreement is to be formally
signed at the presidential palace in Manila.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Christians will stage a series of
protest actions on Monday, including flying flags at half-mast in
government and private offices in the parts of Mindanao to be
affected by the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the senate, Senate President Neptali Gonzales said he would
convene a hearing after Monday's signing of the agreement to find
out why some of the chamber's recommendations were not included in
the accord.
</P>
<P>
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a breakaway group of
the MNLF, said in a statement that the peace accord would not
bring about a lasting peace in Mindanao because opposition to the
agreement is very strong.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-strong MILF has vowed to continue its fighting for
the independence of Mindanao.

1-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Novak, who is ranked 47th in the

</P>

Sampras seemed on his way to an easy victory after breezing
through the first set in just 26 minutes, but his game began to
fall apart in the second set. Sampras managed to pull out the
third set but mistakes plagued him again in the fourth when he was
broken serving at 4-5 to send the match to a decisive fifth set.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth set, Sampras broke in the fifth game for a 3-2
lead and served for the match at 5-4. Sampras salvaged one break
point and set the stage for the victory with an ace, his 18th of
the match.
</P>
<P>
Sampras's next opponent will be Alexander Volkov of Russia, who
also needed five sets to beat Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, who has never won a

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Black Markets Targeted in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Stepped-up supervision has dealt
a serious blow to underground foreign exchange trading in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"Supervisory measures we have taken since the start of this
year have floundered the once red-hot black markets for foreign
exchange dealings," a regional official said.
</P>
<P>
The largest market, at the frontier of the Horgos Port in Ili
Prefecture, has vanished into thin air, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the effort to stem illegal foreign exchange trading,
Xinjiang withdrew a net 240 million yuan (about 30 million US
dollars) from circulation between January and May, compared with a
net supply of 1.1 billion yuan during the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The demand for foreign exchange has expanded quickly as a
result of brisk border trade, the official said, adding that to
date Xinjiang has opened 15 frontier ports to foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Some large foreign exchange dealers have taken advantage of
price differences through speculative buying and selling, causing
disorder in the foreign exchange market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, the regional foreign exchange
administration bureau unveiled a set of provisional rules on the
management of foreign exchange in the frontier areas.
</P>
<P>
The rules have been effective in curbing foreign exchange black
markets, the official said, citing as an example a 50 percent
increase in imports through border trade in the first five months
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises and individuals involved in illegal foreign
exchange trading have been penalized, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the foreign exchange administration bureau,
in cooperation with the police and administration bureau for
industry and commerce, has set up a special task force to deal
with foreign exchange black markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Air Transportation Office of
the Philippines (ATO) has indefinitely suspended all operations of
Air Philippines following a series of troubles with the airline's
Boeing 737 airplanes, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In ordering the suspension on Thursday, the ATO safety division
said that in the latest of the incidents, a B-737 suffered a
defect in its landing gear in Davao city. Another aircraft of the
same type met exactly the same problem three days before.
</P>
<P>
The safety division said it would review the air-worthiness of
the company's fleet of planes including three Boeing 737s and four
Japan-made YS-11 turboprops.
</P>
<P>
The division also said local pilots protested that the American
pilots of Air Philippines were unfamiliar with instrument landing
procedures during bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Based at Subic, Air Philippines began operations last February
with a temporary license following the deregulation of the
aviation industry two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Air Philippines said it voluntarily suspended
operations until an investigation is completed and corrective
measures are put in place.

<HEADLINE> Canon Sales to Provide After-sales Service for IBM Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- IBM Japan Ltd. plans to team up
with Canon Sales Co. in after-sales services for personal
computers (PCs) in the local market, a national daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
IBM Japan, a Japan unit of International Business Machines
Corp. of the United States, has no after-sales service bases in
Japan although it is a major PC maker, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
Because of lacking service support, the company has lagged
behind NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. in PC sales, particularly in
local areas.
</P>
<P>
NEC has 140 after-sales support bases, while Fujitsu operates
99 such bases throughout the country, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The planned linkup with Canon Sales, the marketing subsidiary
of Canon Inc., is expected to boost IBM Japan's sales.
</P>
<P>
IBM Japan will begin opening IBM PC Dock service counters in
Canon Sales' Zero One PC and peripheral equipment sales shops in
October, the paper said. It will open service counters at 12 to 13
Zero One outlets and expand to all 75 shops nationwide within a few
years.

<HEADLINE> Exports Boost Swedish Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has exported more goods
than expected so far this year, giving the country's economy an
unanticipated boost, according to the latest forecast released by
a Swedish commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The Norbanken projected in May that the gross national product
this year was expected to grow by 0.3 percent but later revised to
1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the revision is that the strong Swedish krona
has affected exports less than expected.
</P>
<P>
Exports are expected to increase by 5 percent this year and 4.2
percent next.
</P>
<P>
"Exports continue to be a positive surprise despite the
strengthening of krona and a weak demand in Western Europe," said
Norbanken analysts.
</P>
<P>
"This is partly due to export successes in Asia and South
America and partly to a delay in the negative effects of the
stronger krona."
</P>
<P>
Private consumption continent-wide is only likely to rise
moderately, by 1 percent this year, 1.4 percent in 1997 and 2
percent from 1998 to 2000, Norbanken analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Imelda Marcos, the former first
lady of the Philippines, has sought the recovery of 27 firms
allegedly owned by the late president Ferdinand Marcos and seized
by the Presidential Commission on Good Government 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Imelda said in a 10-page statement that the commission failed
to file a complaint against the 27 firms it sequestered from Jose
Campos, a Marcos crony, in 1986, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"No case to date has been filed by the commission directly
involving the ownership of defendant corporations, much less has
it established conclusively before any court that they form part
of the alleged ill-gotten wealth of the late president," she said.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the commission was criticized for being
"extremely remiss" in its duty as custodian of the alleged
ill-gotten wealth it seized after the 1986 revolt against Marcos.
</P>
<P>
So far, the commission has not submitted a complete inventory
of the seized assets.
</P>
<P>
Imelda also asked to nullify the commission's sale of some of
the assets of the sequestered firms which included six lands,
saying the commission has no right to sell them.

<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous Region is to
build two optic cables between Lhasa and Ningchi, and Xigaze and
Yadong, according to Science and Technology Daily.
</P>
<P>
The cable projects will use the optic telecom facilities of
NEC, a leading Japanese telecom company. A cooperation contract
has been signed by the company and Tibet Posts and
Telecommunications Bureau in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The two cables will open to public service by the end of next
year, according to Zeng Zhongyi, director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The NEC optic equipment has been used in the autonomous
region's first two cables, which were launched in 1995 to connect
Lhasa's telecom systems to that of Xigaze and Shannan.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that the cooperation with NEC will be further
enhanced as the region increases input in telecommunications
in its eastern part, an economically underdeveloped area
without any optic telecom infrastructure.

<P>
Shenyang Aircraft Industry (Group) Company has made notable
achievements in the manufacture of non-military products,
including cross-country vehicles and buses.
</P>
<P>
The company, which manufactured the country's first
jet-fighter, first land-to-air missile and first high-speed and
high-altitude attacker, now earns half of its income from the
civil section, which is composed of a number of non-military
factories.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft production company began to manufacture civil
products in the latter half of 1984, when it set up seven
production lines to make non-military goods.
</P>
<P>
From 1985-1995, the company's output value from civil goods
increased from 50 million yuan to 500 million yuan. The
non-military section now makes up half of the firm's production
value.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctor Treats Severed Finger With Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A 26-year old Chinese man has
had a severed finger successfully restored using just traditional
Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
The Number One People's Hospital in Kunming city, southwest
China's Yunnan province, is the first in the world to treat
severed body parts without surgery.
</P>
<P>
Doctors carried out the treatment on the unnamed patient
using a procedure known as "biological regenerant".
</P>
<P>
The patient, whose thumb was seriously broken and severed,
happily left the hospital after a treatment lasting a month with
compound Chinese herbal medicine. His finger completely healed
with the treatment.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Yang Jianyao said "Biological regenerant" is a compound
medicine, extracted from Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
During early studies, Chinese experts tested the medicine on
344 animals. Research results show that regeneration rates of
nerves and skin reach almost 87 percent, and success with muscle
tendons is 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Treatment on 10 patients with severed fingers, and five with
severed muscle tendons showed that survival rates of replanted
severed fingers and muscle tendons was 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Yang began to use the medicine in clinical treatment in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Yang's method to treat severed fingers needs just five
steps: disinfection, para-position, suture of skin, application of
medicine and fixation. Regeneration of nerves, muscle tendon and
blood vessels is completed with the help of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Cost for such treatment is only 200 to 300 yuan.

<P>
SAN JOSE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Poverty persists and social
differences increase in Latin America, according to a U.N.
magazine released here today.
</P>

generate contaminating waste substances," said "Tierramerica", a
magazine of the U.N. Program for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, published in Mexico, was released here for the
first time and will be published bi-monthly as a supplement of the
daily "La Nacion".
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the magazine, a special edition for Costa
Rica, is dedicated to the relations between economy and ecology,
and proposes to integrate environmental cost and benefit
calculations to economic policies as a way to evaluate their
impact on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The director of the U.N. Program for Environment for Latin
America, Arsenio Rodriguez, visited Costa Rica to present the
magazine's new edition.
</P>

MEXICO CITY, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Colombian coffee growers lost 2.68 billion
dollars from 1991 to 1996 because of a drop in exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Coffee Growers Committee told President
Ernesto Samper in a letter that the profit lost added up to 1.9
million dollars, a figure higher than the value of a year's
harvest of the product. Coffee growers consider they will lose
780 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine grain exports diminished during the
first half of this year, but export-generated revenue increased
thanks to a rise in the international prices of the product,
according to the Agriculture, Weights and Measures and Food
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Exports dropped 26 percent during the period, going from 12.5
million tons in 1995 to 9.25 million tons this year. Revenue
increased 4.3 percent as it went from 1.94 billion dollars to
2.024 billion dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The Inter-American Development Bank announced a
6.4-million-dollar loan to strengthen the executive and
legislative branches of the Venezuelan government.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to establish a macroeconomic analysis
unit under the Congress, and for the creation of a macroeconomic
programming and analysis bureau as a branch of the finance
ministry. The resources will also be used for technical support
for the congress to draft budget and public credit laws.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Panamanian merchant fleet transported an
unprecedented total of 100.7 billion gross tons of products up to
August 10 of this year, as announced by Finance Minister Olmedo

<HEADLINE> Fredericks Beats Johnson in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medallist Frankie
Fredericks of Namibia upset double Olympic champion Michael
Johnson of the United States to take the 200 meters victory on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks won an intense battle down the home straight to win
in 19.97 seconds at the Berlin grand prix.
</P>
<P>
The victory ensured Fredericks, the gold medallist at the 1993
world championships in Stuttgart, a fifth of the most lucrative
jackpot in the sport -- 20 one-kilo gold bars worth 250,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian shared the prize with Denmark's Wilson Kipketer
(men's 800 meters), Britain's Jonathan Edwards (triple jump),
German Lars Riedel (men's discus) and Bulgarian female high
jumper Stefka Kostadinova. Each won 50,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The prize is shared between athletes who win specific events
at the Golden Four series in Oslo, Zurich, Brussels and
Berlin. All five athletes won the series for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks threatened to win a gold medal in Atlanta in the
sprints after some brilliant early- season form but had to play
second fiddle to Johnson and Olympic 100 meters champion Donovan
Bailey.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks finished second behind Johnson when the American ran
a world record of 19.32 seconds at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Johnson came off the bend just behind Fredericks and seemed
ready to step into top gear. But the Namibian kept his form and
was so confident of victory.
</P>
<P>
Johnson took second in 20.02 with Trinidad's Ato Boldon, the
Olympic bronze medallist, finishing third in 20.37.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks beat Johnson in the opening meeting of the series
in Oslo before the Olympics but he seemed to get a flying start
that day.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo result marked Johnson's first defeat in any race for
two years and Friday's victory was a major surprise after the
American's superb form in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Johnson did not run in Zurich earlier this month because of
injury and chose to compete in the 400 at last week's meeting in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Six athletes came into the meeting with a chance of winning
the gold. Only American 400 meters hurdler Derrick Adkins failed
when he could only finish third behind compatriot Torrance
Zellner and Zambia's Samuel Matete.
</P>
<P>
Riedel clinched his part of the cash for the first time with a
huge winning second throw of 70.60 meters early on in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The former Kenyan Wilson Kipketer, who did not compete in
Atlanta because he had not got the go-ahead to run for his adopted
Denmark, clinched his share by winning the two-lap race easily in
one minute, 43.34 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Edwards jumped 17.69 meters in fifth-round to defeat Olympic
champion Kenny Harrison (17.16) while Kostadinova won the high
jump with 2.03 meters.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Ends Visit to Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Prime Minister
Branko Crvenkovski and visiting Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister
Hasan Muratovic said Friday there were no questions outstanding
between the two states and bilateral contacts would increase in
the coming period.
</P>
<P>
Crvenkovski told a news conference in Macedonian capital Skopje
there were identical or similar stands in the political sphere,
especially regarding the attitude towards European integrations
and admittance into collective security systems, according to
Tanjug news agency reports from Skopje.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic, before winding up his two-day visit to Macedonia,
said the Sarajevo government believed that NATO should remain in
Bosnia-Herzegovina until full conditions for the maintenance of
peace had been created.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that these conditions will not be made by the
expiry of the mandate of NATO-led IFOR troops and that the
international force would have to remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina
after the expiry of its current mandate" on December 20, 1996,
Muratovic said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the general elections on September 14, Muratovic
said his cabinet wanted the elections to be held on time in order
to make it possible to legally constitute central power.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia and Bosnian Muslim government recognized each other
in late April 1992, but have not yet established diplomatic
relations at the ambassadorial level.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Guerrilla Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States believes
that guerrilla attacks in Mexico constitute no threat to Mexican
political or economic stability, a State Department spokesman said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army,
which has attacked police and military posts in several towns in
central and southern Mexico over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no justification for violence in pursuit of
political ends in Mexico. However, it's important to underscore
that the United States does not consider these actions threatening
to Mexican political or economic stability," said State Department
spokesman Glyn Davies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House condemned the scores of the
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the violent actions of what appears to be a very
ruthless, small, armed organization of obscure groups dedicated to
the overthrow of the Mexican government," said White House
spokesman Mike McMurry.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Develop Mobile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been urged
to make joint efforts to build a land earth station in the
continent for the development of mobile satellite
telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued at the end of a three-day
workshop closed here on Thursday, participants resolved that
African countries should seriously consider building the station
through joint venture so as to maximize the benefits of the
satellite in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Without such a station, messages sent through the satellite
have to go through a country outside the continent before going
through to another country, however close the country might be.
The building of a station will greatly reduce communication costs
and make the system more affordable to the African people.
</P>
<P>
The communique also called on African countries to recognize
the benefits of the global mobile personal communications by
satellite, with the objective of solving telecommunication
problems in the continent, but noted that sovereign rights to
each country to regulate its telecommunications sector should not
be compromised.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized by the International Mobile
Satellite Organization, in collaboration with the Nigerian
Ministry of Communications. About 150 delegates from 20 African
countries attended the event.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Continue to Fall on Wall Street Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
extended Thursday's losses today and closed sharply lower on weak
performance of Wall Street and worries about the threat of a US
interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
New figures from the US Commerce Department showed today that
US economy was strengthening as new orders received by US
factories in July climbed strongly. This made the European stock
market operators quite nervous as the new economic data added to
fears of higher US interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The London stock market fell the most among major European
bourses, plunging 17.4 points on the FTSE 100 share index to close
at 3867.6.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt stocks followed Wall Street's suit and fell 0.63
percent on the DAX-30 index.
</P>
<P>
Today's good news of a continuing trade surplus in France in
June and that unemployment in France fell by 20,000 last month
failed to boost the Paris bourse, which continued to trade in
negative ground and finished down 0.35 percent, still depressed by
the prospect of possible industrial unrest in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100
leading British shares closed down 17.4 points at 3,867.6. The
Frankfurt DAX-30 index ended 16.23 points lower at 2,543.83. The
Paris CAC-40 share index finished down 6.95 at 1,970.61.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Ceasing Hostilities in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today demanded that all sides in Burundi declare
cessation of hostilities, call an immediate halt to violence and
assume their responsibilities to bring peace, security and
tranquillity to the people of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the council
condemned the overthrow of the legitimate government and
constitutional order in Burundi and all those parties and factions
which resort to force and violence to advance their political
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Burundian people, both Hutu and Tutsi, have been plagued by
armed conflicts and sometimes genocide for decades, especially
since coup in October 1993. On July 25 this year, a coup d'etat in
Burundi returned Major Pierre Buyoya of Tutsi to power, replacing
President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. The Security Council condemned
the coup immediately and its neighbors imposed economic sanctions
on Burundi on the July 31 summit meeting of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its strong support for the
efforts of regional leaders including at their meeting in Arusha
on July 31 of OAU and of former President Nyerere of Tanzania to
assist Burundi to overcome peacefully the current grave crisis.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the regime to ensure a return to
constitutional order and legality, to restore the National
Assembly and to lift the ban on all political parties.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that the leaders of all parties in Burundi ensure
basic conditions of security for all, all of Burundi's political
parties and factions initiate unconditional negotiations
immediately with a view to reaching a comprehensive political
settlement.

<P>
The Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, after several days of clashes in northern Iraq over

in charge of the U.S. relationship with northern Iraqi region
where Kurds live, presided over the talks.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks closed lower
for the second day in a row Friday as new economic data showed the

may not happen.
</P>
<P>

during the month, well beyond predictions of about 1 percent.
